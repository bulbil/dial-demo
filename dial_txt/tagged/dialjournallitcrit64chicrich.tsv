		A decisive victory of the Allies which will make any aggres - sive return of Pan-Germanism impossible is the only way by which this end can be attained .

		Toward gaining this vic - tory by rejecting from the beginning the crafty manoeuvres of the
Berlin Govern	LOCATION	- ment , unceasingly renewed to divide and deceive the Allies , the deliberate and profound conviction of every citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	can accomplish much .

		I ^ have , therefore , brought together in this little book , written for you espe - cially , a series of specific facts , easily verified , which should establish among you this certain conclusion :
Germany	LOCATION	no longer exists .

		Public Ij !

		THE DIAL fortniff & tty Journal of Criticism ann 2Dtecu00ton of Eiteratute ana American Literature From time to time I am asked like many other writers to discuss some tendency in our national literature .

		-LRB- It is assumed that we have a national literature , as of course every self-respecting people must have a literature . -RRB-

		I am expected to tell what is happening to it and to prophesy its splendid evolution .

		Often this takes the form of an inquiry about American fiction , as fiction is the bulkiest and the most popular of the literary modes .

		Again it is that irrepressible mauvais sujet of the literary family the drama , which is always being reformed but never achiev - ing the solid reputation desired by its friends .

		All such preoccupations seem to me futile : they resemble the preoccupa - tions of the adolescent as to when he will become a man .

		When he is one he will know it without an extended investigation .

		Such self-conscious concern for the future of the American novel , for the develop - ment of an American literature , would indicate that as a people we are not yet sufficiently serious minded to create an enduring literature .

		The way in which the world war has got into American writing , or rather the way in which it has failed to get into it , in any deep sense , confirms me in this belief .

		The publishers ' lists , to be sure , are not wanting in titles of war books , nor do our reviews and magazines lack articles on every conceivable aspect of the great strug - gle .

		But such books and articles hardly pretend to be more than journalism , ephem - eral record , momentary reactions to the stupendous drama .

		The war has not yet got under the skin of our writers so that it has become of their blood and bone .

		It is still `` news '' to them , with the sensation value of daily news .

		At first , in those first breathless , dazed months it was to be expected that the habits and preoccupa - tions of our writers like those of our busi - ness men would rest in their fixed grooves .

		There was for a long time the inevitable inclination to regard the war as something remote from the personal interests of the
New World	LOCATION	, as from its political interests something to be looked upon from a safe distance with curiosity mingled with aversion .

		Indeed , in certain quarters it was ignored as far as possible so that an unperturbed spirit might follow its accus - tomed path .

		Thus in the second year of the great war a substantial magazine of the `` literary '' class could announce with an ostrichlike complacency an editorial pol - icy of wholly avoiding the war and keeping its pages free from the emotions and alarums that were distracting the civilized world .

		For two or three years after the fa -
tal summer of 1914	DATE	there continued to flow from American presses an undimin - ished stream of purely American books , novels of Alaskan wilds , of cowboys and ranches , of new millionaires and old `` soci - ety , '' of extinct
New England	LOCATION	towns and musty religious problems , etc. , etc. .

		This mixed stream of national literary interest has not yet dried up , scarcely diminished in volume , although by now American authors must have exhausted pretty well their before-the-war crops of manuscript and , incidentally , must have discovered the war as a human phenomenon , if not as imag - inative material for their craft .

		But now that at last , this nation has been absorbed into the conflict , the reflection of it in our letters should appear presently .

		No doubt instead of western stories or drummer tales or sociological anxieties we shall have a shower of war diaries , trench yarns , and spy stories , as well as more technical and philosophical discussions of this one most insistent human interest .

		This shift of subject , of course , will not make literature , in the real sense , any more than the daily reports from the battle fronts make literature .

		To fuse this war THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	experience into literature , to make out of it a distinctively American contribution to the human record of the war , there must pass something from the tragic experience into the minds and the souls , not only of Amer - ican writers but also of American readers for to the making of any literature must go first an understanding public .

		In the welter of American war books already put forth there has been slight evidence of this spiritual transmutation of the raw material .

		Little enough , it might be added , in French and English war books .

		To put the matter more bluntly , if the war were to end to-day and the literary account of it were to be made up now there would be a wealth of matter for the histo - rian , but little , very little , to enter on the imaginative record of mankind .

		And we Americans would swiftly revert to our cowboys and girl heroines , to our old games and problems .

		The war , however , will not end to-day nor to-morrow , and our participation in its dangers and sacrifices , in its spiritual drama above all , must inevitably grow with amazing rapidity .

		Soon there will not be a nook in all our great country that can safely ignore the war , nor a man or woman who can successfully put aside its persist - ent questioning and searching of the human mind .

		We can not think as we once thought , we can not feel as we once felt , we can not plan as we once planned .

		We shall know that we have passed into a new world of self-consciousness , and for good or ill the doors of the old world are closed upon us forever .

		The war will no longer pass before our eyes in the head - lines of the newspaper as some inexplica - ble and remote phenomenon , that can not touch our being .

		It will pass into our hearts and souls .

		And then the war , hav - ing got under our skins , having become part of the national consciousness , must inevitably pass into our literature as the larger , the more absorbing part of our - selves .

		Specifically I take it the war will give us American ideas , a larger knowledge of the world in which we live and of the tangled interests of the peoples of the world .

		We shall shed some of our complacent provinciality and ignorance .

		Again it will give us larger and more com - plex perceptions of human relations .

		And finally it will enrich us with emotions , not purely personal .

		The generation of Amer - icans that will emerge from these years of world trial will have less in common with the past generations of Americans and more in common with other peoples .

		As a people we shall have grown in under - standing not only of ourselves but of the world outside .

		And it is from understand - ing also one might say from suffering and trial that is created that fine , sensi - tive , complex consciousness of life neces - sary for the making of a serious literature .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL The Structure of Lasting Peace VI .

		SOME PROBLEMS OF READJUSTMENT : POLITICAL BOUNDARIES AND NATIONAL RIGHTS `` No annexations , no contributions , no punitive indemnities '' has become a famil - iar formula for the settlement of the war 's issues , dear to the hearts of doctrinaire political radicals and to the minds of sen - timentalizing pacifists .

		Its generality and vagueness are the best of its endearing vir -
tues.	DATE	.

		It is as unreflective , as unregarding of the concrete and specific constituents of an organization of democratic peace as the formulae of the pan-Germanists among the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	or the panic-Americans and bitter-enders , like Col.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	and
Bolo Pasha	PERSON	, among the democracies of the Entente .

		The notion on which the latter advocate their read - justment is the notion of vac victis , and for the junkers of
Germany	LOCATION	nothing could be more apropos to keep the people of Ger - many at war in their interest .

		The notion which guides the anti-annexationists is in effect that of the status quo ante , and that is only just less desirable to the irrespon - sible German governing class than German victory .

		The formula against annexa - tions , contributions , and indemnities really looks backward .

		It denies to the war the salutary consequences in the reorganiza - tion of mankind which alone can a little mitigate its horror .

		If acted upon , it would in a generation bring on a new war with the same motives in play as in this one .

		Considered squarely , it is a piece of what
William James	PERSON	used to call vicious abstractionism , generated without consid - eration of the specific issues and living problems it is intended to relieve and to settle ; situations and problems which , moreover , have themselves so changed in character and implication since the be - ginning of the war , that the bearing of any formula upon them , including the formu - lae of democracy and nationality that dominate these studies , require a con - stant and watchful readjustment which renders a priori assumptions of any sort venturesomely speculative .

		Assumptions , however , must be made , and their danger is lessened in the degree in which they utter the enduring motives in human nature and social action .

		In the light of these , as well as in view of the originating conditions and purposes of the present war , a lasting peace can not be a negotiated peace .

		A lasting peace must needs be a dictated peace , and the dicta - tor 's victory must needs be at least so thoroughgoing as to compel , should it be found desirable , those members of the Cen - tral-European establishment whose policy is responsible for the atrocities on the high seas , in
Belgium	LOCATION	, in
France	LOCATION	, in
Poland	LOCATION	, and in
Armenia	LOCATION	, to stand public trial for murder .

		Peace without this degree of victory is too likely to be only an armistice : students of ancient history may recall the `` negotiated '' peace of Nikias between
Athens	LOCATION	and
Sparta	LOCATION	during the
Peloppen	PERSON	- esian war , a peace that served only to pro- long the intolerable agony of the noblest family of mankind that antiquity knew .

		Even a German peace would be better , be - cause more enduring , than a negotiated one and a German peace would mean sub - mission to the German hegemony over civ - ilization .

		It would mean this even if the government of
Germany	LOCATION	were well-inten - tioned toward mankind .

		It would mean this because outside of the regions of sen - timentality and dialectic might is right , be - cause history is the record of claims and privileges of the few over the many yielded by the many to force , deferred to through custom , and finally revered and idolized through old age .

		The claims and priv - ileges of dynasties and churches are the most notorious instances , and the less con - spicuous ones are infinite .

		International democracy will have to be established by force and sustained by force , before it be - comes naturalized in the economy of civ - ilization by education , self-sustaining through habit , and finally sacred through immemorial old-age .

		Even national de - mocracy , it must be remembered , is a very young and tender plant in this Christian civilization of ours , a plant not yet quite secure even in countries where it sprang 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	fully panoplied from the heads of the
Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Force alone can replace anarchy in international relations by law , even as it has done so in personal relations .

		Whether that force be military , or of an - other specification , is indifferent .

		The illu - sion that in personal relations `` right is might '' derives from the fact that the might which sustains the right that is might is not so visible in those relations as in the relations between states .

		Right is might only by the force of the collective pressure of society toward this `` right . ''

		The rule of law is the rule of the largely unseen , but the ready and watchful power of the state whose visible symbol is the policeman on his beat .

		Hence , lasting peace is to be grounded upon two postulated events .

		First , a dem - ocratic victory with the permanent main - tenance of sufficient organized force , whether military , or economic , or both , to keep secure the fruits of this victory .

		Sec - ondly , such definition of the settlement and such use of the insuring force as to invig - orate and expand the creative instrumen - talities that are inevitably making for the internationalization of mankind .

		These instrumentalities have gone , in our survey , by the names democracy and nationality .

		And the significant thing about them is that they are ideals even more than they are instrumentalities .

		There exist , however , within the coun - cils of the Entente itself strongly en - trenched interests unwilling to consider a settlement in terms other than those of the traditional diplomatic piracy .

		Between the luckily abolished Russian bureaucracy and
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, between
Italy	LOCATION	and these powers and
Rumania	LOCATION	and these powers , agreements exist which if carried out would have led to a new war within less than a generation , agreements altogether counter to the announced fundamentals for which
England	ORGANIZATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	entered the war .

		Happily , events have taken the issue from the hands of intrigu - ing diplomacy in
Russia	LOCATION	, and President
Wilson	PERSON	, speaking for the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, is determined to keep un - sullied the record of our country in this crisis in the affairs of mankind .

		But a traditionally ordained residuum remains , like the commercial `` war after the war , '' and the land-grabbing claims of the vari - ous lesser allies of the Entente , and the claims of its numerous proteges the `` small nations '' of
Europe	LOCATION	, Poles and
Letts	PERSON	and Lithuanians and Jugo-Slavs and
Ukrain	LOCATION	- ians and Finns .

		These clamor for their establishment as sovereign states with all that this implies .

		Each of them has at its mercy minorities of other nationalities whom it bitterly opposes , the attitude of the Polish nationalists toward the Jews leav - ing nothing to be desired even by a
Prus	PERSON	- sian in ferocious cruelty .

		The problem of readjustment is at bottom the problem of reconciling these counter-claims , of re - defining the post-bellum economic pro- gramme and the actual territorial lusts of the major powers in harmony with the principles of democracy and nationality .

		It has already been indicated how com - pletely these principles controvert the traditional assumptions of exclusive state - sovereignties from which international `` law '' and diplomatic deviation derive ; how they utter the more deep-lying condi - tions and forms of the organization of
Europe	LOCATION	those that are so obvious that they go unnoticed save when an assault upon them is made .

		What they point to , in the post-bellum reorganization of man - kind , is far less a shifting of ante-bellum boundaries than a redefinition of the rights and duties pertaining to peoples living out - side as well as within those boundaries , in their relations to one another .

		At no point on the map of
Europe	LOCATION	are ethnic coinci - dent with political boundaries .

		The polit - ical nationalism which seeks to create these coincidences , thus multiplying the number of irresponsible sovereignties , is as vicious as it is blind .

		It seeks merely to multiply the type of situation in which this civil war began .

		The festering areas of this situation were , of course , the
Balkans	LOCATION	, where the conflicts were in play of the Balkan peoples with Turkish dominion , of Serbian eco - nomic necessity with Bulgarian national confraternity , of Serbian national sympa - thy with Austro-Hungarian economic greed , and the group and personal aspira - tions of all these peoples with German economic greed and cultural paranoia .

		War only universalized and dynamified
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 these conflicts .

		Under the political system of independent state-sovereignties , it was unavoidable .

		Where , however , the principles of de - mocracy and nationality operate , the state is not , it will be remembered , the para - mount and all-compelling social organiza - tion .

		It is one , among many others , coordinate with them , and serving a very definite and highly specialized function with regard to them the function of um - pire , of regulation and equalization , in the issues that arise between them .

		In terms of its function the state is an administra - tive area , not a cultural nor a racial one , and the problems and technique of admin - istration are constituted of quite other con - siderations than those of race and culture .

		These others , and these alone , have any claim to enter into the definition of polit - ical boundaries , and they are reduceable to just one the scientifically ascertainable limits of administrative efficiency in view of the economic and cultural interdependence of mankind .

		The geography of an area , the relation of its contiguous nationalities to waterways and harbors and railways are much more significant for the happi - ness of these nationalities in their political correlations than any form of racial he - gemony .

		Thus , the unity of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	is functionally of a very different kind from the unity of the
United States of America	LOCATION	or the Austro-Hungarian Em - pire .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	's colonies and prov - inces , peopled by her own nationalities , have a tremendously completer indepen - dence than
America	LOCATION	's constituent `` sov - ereign '' states ;
Austria	LOCATION	's
Hungary	LOCATION	has the sovereignty , and more , of
Britain	LOCATION	's Can - ada ;
Austria	LOCATION	's
Bohemia	LOCATION	, that of an Amer - ican state ; her
Bosnia	LOCATION	none at all .

		The constituent nationalities of
Russia	LOCATION	, prior to the revolution without any sovereignty whatsoever , are now aiming at complete political independence regardless of all other considerations , regardless , that is , of the very conditions on which their national lives must be built .

		Now political experience makes , on the whole , against the small nation-state .

		It is always quarreling with its equals and an object of desire to its superiors .

		Its sov - ereignty rests on sufferance , even with `` in - ternational guarantees '' -LRB- occasion turns these into `` scraps of paper '' -RRB- , and its pros - perity is a provocation .

		Experience would create quite other satisfactions , for the claims of the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	's proteges , than political sovereignty .

		The case of the Jugo-Slavs is here the crucial , the test case .

		These eight or more varieties of the
Sla	ORGANIZATION	- vonic species have all the traits of nation - ality .

		Among them the Serbo-Croats are politically the most significant and cultur - ally the most self-conscious .

		They con - stitute , indeed , ethnically , as well as other - wise , a single nationality .

		Their political entanglements have precipitated the war .

		They are citizens in the two sovereign states
Serbia	LOCATION	and
Montenegro	LOCATION	, and sub - jects in the Magyar dependencies of
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	.

		The pro- gramme of political nationalism would combine these areas into a greater
Serbia	LOCATION	under the present Serbian ruling house .

		The Montenegrin king is naturally reluc - tant to surrender his dynastic prerogative , and is said , in spite of his acquiescence , to be flirting with Austrian nuntios .

		The Berlin-Buda-Pesth financiers , again , and the promoters of Mittel-Europa , can not imaginably relax their grip on
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	.

		In the conduct of the Hungarian rulers toward their Slavonic subjects Prussianism had a perfect incarna - tion .

		This conduct is to be sharply dis - tinguished from that of the Austrians toward their Slavonic fellow-citizens .

		The former is far more a model of frightful - ness than
Prussia	LOCATION	in
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	LOCATION	; the latter manifested the wise statesman - ship that distinguished
England	LOCATION	's relations , since the Boer war , to her dependencies .


Francis Ferdinand	PERSON	, the murdered arch - duke , planned to extend the Austrian pol - icy to the whole of the
Dual Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		Rumor will not down that his murder was arranged in
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Buda	LOCATION	in order to prevent the federal coordination of all the nationalities in the empire , a coordination which would have made the way toward Mittel-Europa a difficult one indeed , and would have deprived the politico-national - ist Serbo-Croats of their most dynamic motive .

		The present emperor , it happens , is even more set upon this coordination than the late Archduke .

		His plans and 12 THE DIAL hopes , neither , suit junker
Germany	LOCATION	nor nationalist Slav .

		His plans and hopes , however , whether through self-interest or intelligence , are in harmony with the geo - graphical and economic determinants of the fate of all the nationalities herein in - volved , the independent states of
Serbia	LOCATION	and
Montenegro	LOCATION	included .

		These states have undergone wars for the sake of rail - ways and access to the sea .

		Those desir - ables , and many more , may come to their people by a political union with
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Such a union would be a vio - lation of the formula `` no annexation '' ; but if it is a union on a democratic basis , un - der effective guarantees , it becomes as true that
Austria	LOCATION	is annexed to them , as they to it .

		Such guarantees , however , require a radical change in the constitution of the
Dual Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	, a great easement upon its sovereignty .

		They would need profoundly to alter the incidence of taxation , the scope of suffrage , and the conditions of cultural and religious organization .

		Even with the very desirable creation of the wished-for
Greater Serbia	LOCATION	as a part of the new Aus - trian Commonwealth of politically equal nationalities , the guarantees could not be merely written into the law of the land alone .

		To be effective , they would have to be trans-national , enforcible by interna - tional intervention .

		Prescription is futile without enforcement , as the notorious ex - ample of the much-chastened and newly enlightened
Rumania	LOCATION	shows .

		Under the provisions of the treaty of
Berlin	LOCATION	which established this dynastic and landlord-rid - den state -LRB- now striving nobly and with heroic effort toward democracy , economic as well as political -RRB- , Jews , on whom the Rumanian political medievalism bore even harder than on the Rumanian peasant , were to be established in citizenship equally with their fellow-countrymen .

		Rumanian legislation rendered these provisions com - pletely nugatory .

		The taboo on `` interfer - ence in a state 's internal affairs '' kept the Jews from appeal and redress .

		The Jew - ish minority was and is completely at the mercy of the non-Jewish majority .

		The war has led the Rumanian government of its own motion to plan to remove this tragic injustice , but had there existed an international court with power to enforce its verdicts , to which the minority or the powerless could have appealed , the history not only of the Jews but of the downtrod - den peasants of
Rumania	LOCATION	might have been otherwise written .

		In a readjustment such as the basic needs of their peoples show as wisest for Aus - tria-Hungary and her Slavic subjects and Slavic rivals , the lesson is obvious .

		The geographically and economically defined administrative area which may be the state of Austria-Hungary-Serbia , would be much larger than the original .

		The state would be a democratic cooperative com - monwealth of nationalities with their so - cial and cultural differences strengthened and enhanced by their economic and polit - ical unity .

		To secure this , however , to turn what is written as a law into what is practiced as a life would require a superior authority to which endangered minorities could appeal and from which they might actually get justice .

		As with
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, so with Rus - sia and her constituent nationalities , with
France	LOCATION	and
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, with the other Balkan states .

		The chief problem in a readjustment that shall be advantage - ous to the masses of men rather than to governments and other vested interests is the problem of creating a machinery that shall effectively safeguard the rights of minority nationalities to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

		Without such a machinery exclusive sovereignties , and wars , are inevitable .

		With it the nullification of international obligations becomes impossible , the whole political programme based on the present state-sys - tem irrelevant .

		The quarrels will fall to the ground that have arisen among Poles over dragooning the unwilling Bohemians , who have in recent years been perfectly well off with
Austria	LOCATION	, into union with their chauvinist fellow nationals of
Russia	LOCATION	, who have learned nothing from history and re - main as intolerant and piratical as the Shlakta whose selfishness and sensualism destroyed the Polish state .

		And so the quarrels of the Ukrainians , the
Rutheni	PERSON	- ans , the Finns , and others with the Rus - sians .

		So , quarrels anywhere between
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 nationalities .

		Once democracy , in accord , of course , with the living law and the en - during moods of a people , is prescribed for an economico-political area , and minor - ities in such an area are safeguarded by the proper machinery of law , the creative and cooperative tendencies in human na - ture and the compulsion of the industrial machine will , other things being equal , automatically and without restriction ef - fect the indefinite duration of peace .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		Corrupted Dramatic Critics One of these days when the financial depression in the playhouse at last exceeds the mental depression , some
Gordon Craig	PERSON	is going to rise up and propose to cure the theatre by killing the critics .

		There will be sympathizers .

		The critics themselves , first of all .

		For little does the public appreciate the joy of buying a ticket at the box office of the speculator in the Hotel Astorbilt or of seeing a play with no more serious problem in mind than whether
Robert Mantell	PERSON	wears a toupee or how much the feminine figure has deteriorated since the rigorous tighted days of
Weber & Fields	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the critic is never likely to win such sympathetic un - derstanding while he retains his position as a professional person , and profits by the public 's inability to penetrate learned ho - kus-pokus .

		Barring an occasional
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, the world has failed to pene - trate the pretences of the professions even when they were most vulnerable .

		Perhaps if dramatic critics were to be officially classed as day laborers unskilled under some wartime census , instead of special practitioners with office hours from
8:15	TIME	to 12 p. m. there might be hope .

		Perhaps they might then get over a few of their worst habits .

		They might stop behaving like mid-Victorian `` literary men '' accept - ing each play as a figment without eco - nomic , social , or ethical base .

		They might stop treating the American theatre as a series of separate plays , not as an organ - ization .

		They might stop describing the effect of the play on themselves , instead of their and your and my effect on the play , and its presumable interaction with society .

		They might stop weighing that reaction of their mental epidermis in the fuddling old scales of absolute judgments .

		They might begin to understand society both behind the curtain and in front .

		They might begin to understand the economics of American industrialism .

		They might even begin to understand the economics of the American theatre .

		Until they do , they will remain petti - fogging `` literary men , '' frank panderers to theatre owners and theatregoers , or , at best , men who abuse the `` commercial manager '' without understanding what makes him the worst business man , as well as the worst artist , in the world .

		In such times as these , with the profes - sional theatre going rapidly though doubtless temporarily , as heretofore to the wall , the callousness of the critic be - comes peculiarly maddening .

		Perhaps as maddening as the theatrical system on which this callousness has been polished .

		It drives one to the desperate paradox of affirming that the critic is not familiar enough with the commercial methods of the playhouse because he is altogether too familiar with them in a wholly subjective way .

		I like to think this true , not because it is charitable , but because I know that the majority of our plays are inferior trash and the majority of our critics cor - rupt or corrupted , and that the economic organization of the American theatre , with its long-run system in
New York	LOCATION	and its touring system on the road , is re - sponsible for both conditions .

		I like to think that it is these facts which have driven me out of the newspapers into THE DIAL .

		At any rate , in my six years of dramatic criticism I collected plentiful evidence of this critical corruption ; and all of it did not leave me with the impression that the `` commercial manager '' was the root of the trouble .

		The public has been fully supplied , of course , with cases unfavorable to the manager : the story of
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	's fight with the Syndicate ; the barring of
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	and
Alexander Woolcott	PERSON	by the Shuberts and of
Metcalf	PERSON	and
Alan Dale	PERSON	and Louis 14 THE DIAL -LSB-

Klaw & Erlanger	ORGANIZATION	; the troubles of
Delamarter	PERSON	,
Hammond	PERSON	, and
Collins	PERSON	in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and of
Salita Solano	LOCATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		But if you are close to the open secrets of the journalistic profession you may have heard that while the
New York	LOCATION	`` Globe '' and `` Times '' supported Hapgood and Woolcott in their fights , it was the news - papers which knuckled down in the cases of
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	,
Alan Dale	PERSON	, and
William Winter	PERSON	, and that at least two crit - ics are supposed to have left a
New York	LOCATION	evening paper because of the hostility aroused in the breasts of a person of the prominence of
David Belasco	PERSON	and com - municated to the owner .

		If you are as close to the newspapers as a critic , you would know that there are not more than half a dozen papers east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	on which a critic has a free hand and is protected from corrup - tion by innuendo as well as intimidation .

		To state only the most flagrant cases , in one of the four leading cities of the coun - try the critic of the largest evening paper is also its advertising solicitor , while a morning paper pays its critic a salary in which is figured a percentage on the re - ceipts from theatrical advertising .

		In an - other of these cities , one dramatic editor may be found of a
Friday	DATE	inspecting the list of
Sunday	DATE	advertising before making up his theatrical page , while persons ask - ing for advertising rates on another page are referred to the dramatic editor for information ; and in the same town a lead - ing progressive paper requires its critic to write an absolutely fixed number of lines about each new opening paying for a corresponding size of advertisement .

		If you are as close to the newspapers as , say , a press agent , you may receive from the dramatic department of a very prom - inent
New York	LOCATION	paper a letter containing the following sentence : `` If you will see that the
Evening	ORGANIZATION	receives the full
Sunday	DATE	copy on
Saturday	DATE	, we will be glad to help your show along when it opens . ''

		This is the usual introduction to the `` dol - lar criticism '' of a chain of the country 's most popular papers , where a rigid ad - herence to `` so much for so much '' replaces the older editorial motto , `` hew to the line , let the chips fall where they may . ''

		Some of us have been lucky enough not to work for this sort of paper .

		But , for all that , our way has not been straight and narrow and simple .

		We have had to meet the competition of the other kind of critic , and the wiles of the commercial manager which these papers are encour - aging .

		In the end it is a moral drive that the honest critic has to face and no of - fensive is harder to stop .

		For instance , it is the custom of the the - atres to send their press agents round to the newspapers once a week with pictures and special articles , and they pick , of all days ,
Tuesdays	DATE	.

		This means , in cities out - side
New York	LOCATION	, that the day the critic 's review appears , he knows he must face and talk to men who earn their bread by the thing that he may have to do his best to kill .

		Worse still , he knows that these men will come from other newspaper of - fices where their wares have been respect - fully received .

		When the manager is not reminding the critic corporeally of the existence of himself and his fortunes , he is doing it by mail .

		Not a week passed in which some notice from one of the major the - atres in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	did not reach me with the penciled message in the bottom corner : `` 30 line ad
Saturday	DATE	, '' or `` 2 col. ad tomorrow , '' or `` 150 lines next week . ''

		Sometimes special notes came along , too .

		Here is a characteristic one : `` The Blank Theatre will use 75 lines of advertising space daily during the week commencing :
Monday	DATE	next .

		In view of this fact , can we ask that you will give extra attention to our press notice and see that this house is well looked after both as re - gards the
Sunday	DATE	notice and also Tues - day 's review ? ''

		To conclude my personal experiences with theatrical corruption , I had one very clear intimation , during my work in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , of what would have happened to me and my job if I had worked on an av - erage newspaper instead of the best in the city .

		It involved , first , a request from the manager of two of the leading play - houses that I cease to review his plays on
Tuesdays	DATE	, while continuing to give them routine advance notices , special articles and pictures ; and , second , the cutting down of the advertising space of all the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 major theatres to four or five lines each , when I added to my criticisms occasional reflections on the effect of economic or - ganization on art in the American theatre .

		So much for the pressure of managers and press agents .

		Its effectiveness , it must be obvious , does not depend on the hon - esty of the business office downstairs .

		Its purely spiritual effect is bound to be felt .

		No critic can face it month in and season out , if he has any of that sensitiveness which is not undesirable in a good critic .

		He knows that his fellow critics are jump - ing through the managerial hoop , and he knows that no matter how loud the busi - ness management of the paper may be in its declaration that the advertising depart - ment has no connection with the editorial , every time he ignores the managerial pleas to which his fellows accede , his pa - per stands to lose revenue .

		In the last analysis he feels at the bottom of his heart that newspapers prefer tact to truth ; and when he contemplates the calibre of the art over which all this pother is raised , he finds it easy to understand the newspaper proprietor 's lack of interest in serious criticism .

		Perhaps some managing editor may think the American theatre and its plays worthy the labor and cost of solving this problem of criticism versus advertising .

		But even if it can be solved , the solution will leave untouched a far worse evil .

		It is a basic evil .

		It underlies both the
Ameri	PERSON	- can theatre and the American newspaper .

		The long-run system of Broadway , with the touring system through the lesser cities , drives steadily towards the production of plays that are more and more broadly and obviously popular .

		The huge profits possible have made competition so keen that the costs of production have risen steadily as managers seek more costly casts and scenery to insure success .

		The increased costs have made only the most prosperous of runs possible .

		And the most prosperous of runs , first in
New York	LOCATION	and then on the road , must hinge on a play that has the broadest and most com - monplace of appeals , and is bolstered up by criticism just as obvious .

		Our amuse - ment gamble , calling for tremendously profitable successes to offset wasteful in - vestments and big chances , calls just as loudly for startling , violent phrases of commendation to throw in the face of a public that has no other guide to what it may expect in any particular theatre .

		The manager does n't have to buy these phrases if he only knew it .

		They are gladly supplied gratis by the man who wants to see his name quoted on the bill - boards and in the electric lights .

		`` There 's too much commercialism in the critics as well as the managers , '' says
George C. Tyler	PERSON	.

		It all means a pandering to man - agerial cupidity and to the public 's taste for sensation .

		The result ranges from banalities like `` a happy hit '' and `` scores a ripping success , '' through extravagances like `` It bites .

		It stings .

		It hits ! ''

		to such a gem as `` Go and see the Barrie play if you have to pawn your socks . ''

		Such criticism is on the face of it the re - flection of an unhealthy theatre , a theatre that has become a combination of 8-day race , gladiatorial contest and a great pub - lic disaster .

		People who are interested in such a theatre want to `` collect '' the suc - cesses to be `` in on '' all the `` events of the season . ''

		They want the critic to help them to tell them when to rush to this or that theatre where a play is sure to be all the vogue .

		Naturally the critic is soon trying quite as hard as the play to be a `` success . ''

		In
New York	LOCATION	, where plays are unknown quantities on their first-nights , he conducts a guessing contest in popularity .

		On the road , where plays bring a record bf Broadway success , he must rise to the still higher function of recording that suc - cess as capably and violently as possible .

		Of course , the best thing that can be said of most critics is that they are no worse than the plays they have to write about ; and the worst thing is that they do not see the system which brings them such plays , and how this system has corrupted their courage and reduced the quality of their work by capitalizing the obvious , the `` punchy , '' in criticism as much as in plays .

		Such criticism matches the system it pre - tends to guide .

		Criticism of that system the most vital service a critic can do the American theatre to-day is too much to expect .

		Until that system shall have been radically reformed we must content our - selves with criticizing the critics .


KENNETH MACGOWAN	PERSON	.

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	Residuary Legatee of the Victorians RECOLLECTIONS .

		By
John	PERSON	,
Viscount Morley	PERSON	.

		2 vols .

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	. -RRB-


John Morley	PERSON	is the residuary legatee of the Victorian age .

		Born in
1838	DATE	, he went to Ox - ford in the late fifties , the Oxford of reaction from the Movement , the
Oxford of Bishop Wil	ORGANIZATION	- berforce and Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, of
Mark Pattison	PERSON	and
Thomas Hill Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		He went up to
London	LOCATION	to become editor of the `` Fortnightly Review , '' one of three new maga - zines which constituted the national forum in which the intellectual controversies of the age were fought out in which Huxley defended
Darwin	PERSON	and Agnosticism against
Gladstone	PERSON	, and Mr.
Frederick Harrison	PERSON	expounded Compte and Positivism , and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	preached the gospel of culture , and Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	sub - jected all the new philosophies to the criticism of his trenchant logic , in the interest of Roman Catholic authority .

		All these
Morley	PERSON	knew as fellow-journalists , and also the greater figures of the background
Carlyle	PERSON	, and
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, and
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	;
George Eliot	PERSON	and
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		He came into contact with the three foreigners who contributed the most powerful romantic strains to English sentiment and polit - ical thought ,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, and
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	.

		He set forth the philosophic sources of the liberalism of the nineteenth century in his studies of
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and
Burke	PERSON	.

		He entered
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
1883	DATE	under the aegis of
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		He wrote the biographies of the two men whose political con - ceptions marked most profoundly , one the earlier , the other the later , Victorian period ,
Cobden	PERSON	and
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		Altogether , if any man is entitled to recollections of the Victorian age that man is
Viscount Morley	PERSON	.

		And recollections these are in form , not studied autobiography .

		Indeed , from the tone of auto - biography , from self-analysis , or self-portraiture , or self-defence , these volumes are remarkably free .

		We are not told of the tragedy , if such there was , of declining faith in
Morley	LOCATION	's abandon - ment of the evangelicalism of his youth for the rationalism of his manhood .

		We are not told of the inner struggle , if such there was , of his separation from
Chamberlain	PERSON	on Home Rule , or from
Asquith	PERSON	and Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	on the issue of the present war .

		We are not told of love , or marriage , or pecuniary and social difficulties in the great world in which he came to move .

		There emerges , indeed , the outline of a splendid and fascinating career of progress from brief - less barrister and publisher 's adviser , to editorial impresario and member of Parliament and
Cabi	PERSON	- net Minister , the Order of Merit and a peerage , but of the personal triumph of the attainment of these steps , not a word .

		The most sustained per - sonal passage is that in which he dwells on his fondness for Lucretius .

		And yet there is a personal note throughout the book which marks
Lord Morley	PERSON	as , by tem - perament , the fit biographer of his age .

		The abiding impression which the book leaves is of an immense genius for friendship .


Morley	PERSON	was personally or intellectually or politically almost the next of kin to an extraordinary number of the great figures whose names fill his pages .

		Per - haps the cordiality with which he , the son of a country doctor , was received and appreciated by men of higher station called forth an answering loyalty .

		At all events , he is content to appear in his memoirs always as the confidant , the acolyte .

		One wonders whether in the whole course of his recollections he has a keener pleasure than when he records the words which he found in
Gladstone	LOCATION	's diary , written during the second struggle for Home Rule : `` J. M. is on the whole about the best stay I have . ''

		It is remarkable indeed to what a number and variety of souls
Morley	PERSON	played the fidus Achates , of how many confidences he was the recipient , of how many farewells and valedictories he was the speaker .

		He tells us with a certain stoic tender - ness of his last meetings with
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, and
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		At the unveiling of the monument to
John Bright	PERSON	he was the orator .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, as death approached , selected him as standing out `` above others as one from whom words would come most fitly . ''

		He paid the last tribute to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	-
Bannerman	PERSON	and
Vernon Harcourt	PERSON	he records in these volumes his final estimate with the beauti - ful and appropriate phrases of a classical epitaph .

		Of
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	he tells us , `` As his end drew near we sent one another heartfelt words of affectionate farewell .

		Meanwhile for thirteen strenuous years we lived the life of brothers . ''

		Nor can we forget his account of the scene in which he fulfilled the duty of a son in breaking to Mrs.
Gladstone	PERSON	the news that her husband 's
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 retirement from his great office was necessary while
Gladstone	PERSON	played backgammon .

		The poor lady was not in the least prepared for the actual stroke .

		Had gone through so many crises and they had all come out right in the end ; had calculated that the refreshment of the coming jour - ney to
Biarritz	LOCATION	would change his thoughts and pur - pose .

		I told her that language had been used which made change almost impossible .

		Well , then , would not the Cabinet change , when they knew the perils with which his loss would surround them ?

		I was obliged to keep to iron facts .

		What a curious scene !

		Me breaking to her that the pride and glory of her life was at last to face eclipse , that the curtain was falling on a grand drama of fame , power , acclama - tion ; the rattle of the dice on the backgammon board , and the laughter and chucklings of the two long - lived players , sounding a strange running refrain .

		This quality of human intimacy , of companion - ship , gives a peculiar charm to the book , as of a sunny and smiling landscape .

		And in a subtle way this serves to characterize for us the Vic - torian era , the epoch which we are only just beginning to see in softening perspective as a checkered afternoon of sunshine and showers between the stormy morning of the opening cen - tury and the threatening evening of its close .

		It was a time of immense unsettlement , religious , political , social , and yet a time of serious confi - dence and of earnest hope .

		The pessimism of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, echoed by
Ruskin	PERSON	, was of the past , and the workers of the present , differing as they did , were united in a belief in progress .

		Huxley believed that man , awakened to a sense of his true place in Nature and the lease which he held of her , would make intelligence a contributing factor in his survival .


George Eliot	PERSON	assured Mor - ley `` that she saw no reason why the Religion of Humanity should not have a good chance of taking root . ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	dared to talk hopefully of the pursuit of our total perfection , and of the state as representing `` the right reason of the nation . ''

		Cobden , Bright ,
Gladstone	PERSON	believed in an international right reason based on the political economy of the Manchester school .

		These were the thinkers who made the psychological climate in which
Morley	ORGANIZATION	grew up .

		This hopefulness , shared by workers in so many different fields , gave to the whole intellectual society a contagious confidence and a mutual buoyancy .

		The sense of great problems pressing for solution raised human intercourse to a higher intellectual level than ever before , and made intellectual respect , even among those who dif - fered most widely , a basis of tolerance .

		Ex - communication was unknown .

		A spiritual urban - ity , as distinct as the literary etiquette of the Augustans , gave manners to dissent and took the sting out of controversy .

		In giving this total impression of his time ,
Lord Morley	PERSON	does for us what the letter writers have done for the earlier , and the diarists for the later , Georgian age .

		Among the throng of poets , novelists , philoso - phers , scientists , publicists called up by his `` Recol - lections , '' he moves with gentle dignity and winning grace .

		Of the kindness , the intimacy , the intellectual Arcadianism of that now so far - away Victorian age no one is more perfectly representative than
John Morley	PERSON	.

		It is , of course , as a representative of Liberal - ism that
Lord Morley	PERSON	is at the present moment a most significant , and , as the survivor of its bankruptcy , a most pathetic figure .

		He entered
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
1883	DATE	, under the ministry of Glad - stone , which
John Bright	ORGANIZATION	had quitted two years before when it surrendered to the imperialists and stamped out the promising national move - ment of young
Egypt	LOCATION	under
Arabi Pasha	PERSON	.

		Mor - ley 's first significant appearance in the
House	ORGANIZATION	was in moving an amendment against the govern - ment in regard to its course in
Egypt	LOCATION	and the Soudan .

		When
Gladstone	PERSON	, as if to avert his eyes from the spectacle of the betrayal of nationalities , and the spectre of universal carnage which loomed behind it , turned with atoning zeal to free Ire - land , however ,
Morley	PERSON	became his lieutenant .

		In the short ministry of
1886	DATE	he was Chief Secre - tary for
Ireland	LOCATION	, and resumed that office when
Gladstone	PERSON	returned to power in
1892	DATE	.

		He was fearless in his reliance on humanity and good faith in his dealings with the Irish .

		Unlike so many liberals when confronted with the responsi - bilities of office , he scorned to take refuge in repression .

		And always with the true faith of the Victorian Liberal he dwelt on the moral aspect of Irish Home Rule , linking it with the great triumph of liberal political thought in the Risorgimento .

		`` Gladstone , '' he says in a characteristic passage , `` was the only man among us all who infused commanding moral conception into the Irish movement the only man who united the loftiest ideals of national life and public duty with the glory of words , the moral genius of
Mazzini	PERSON	with the political genius of Cavour . ''

		When the Boer War came in response to the policy of
Chamberlain	PERSON	and
Milner	PERSON	, once more it was the moral issue that preoccupied
Morley	PERSON	.

		He literally took his life in his hand when he 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	went to Manchester to speak in support of the small republics and against the war .

		`` The war party had publicly advertised and encouraged attempts to smash the meeting , and young men were earnestly exhorted in patriotic prints at least for one night to sacrifice their billiards and tobacco for the honor of their native land ... The Chairman was B right 's eldest son , but not a word was he allowed to utter by an audience of between eight and ten thousand people .

		Then my turn came , and for ten minutes I had to face the same severe ordeal . ''

		But he captured the crowd by the assertion that he was a Lancashire man , and was then allowed to pro- ceed to his splendid peroration .

		`` You may carry fire and sword into the midst of peace and indus - try : it will be wrong .

		A war of the strongest government in the world with untold wealth and inexhaustible reserves against this little republic will bring you no glory : it will be wrong .

		You may make thousands of women widows , and thousands of children fatherless : it will be wrong .

		It may add a new province to your empire : it will be wrong .

		You may give buoy - ancy to the African stock and share market : it will still be wrong . ''

		To one fatal defect in the Liberal political system of these years
Lord Morley	PERSON	bears witness .

		That he was aware of the importance of retain - ing control of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	by the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	is shown by his pregnant account of the negotiation which he and Harcourt con - ducted with
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	on the latter 's assumption of office in
1895	DATE	.

		`` This was to secure the point that the leader of the H. of C. was to see all telegrams and dispatches of the F. O. .

		.

		Harcourt at once drove up to B. Square , surrendered the point , and generally fell in with a
Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	premiership .

		No doubt , if I had joined him in making a protest against a foreign secretary in the
Lords	LOCATION	, with a definite refusal to join unless that point were conceded , this , as R. afterwards told me , would have broken off the plan , and he would have thrown up his task .

		It seems curious that none of us realised how essentially fatal to the very idea of a sound and workable arrangement was the difference between two schools of imperial policy . ''

		`` Curious that none of us realized ! ''

		For the next twenty years , during more than half of which
Lord Morley	PERSON	was a cabinet minister , he knew no more of what the Foreign Secretary was about than his constituents who sent him to Westminster to represent them .

		His recollec - tions of this period are chiefly those of his corres - pondence as Secretary of State for
India	LOCATION	with
Lord Minto	PERSON	, the Governor General , urging always a high-minded and liberal treatment of the people of that dependency .

		Indeed , so per - sistent is
Lord Morley	PERSON	's recollection of his absorption in this one task that he gives the effect of an elaborate alibi from the cabinet of which he was a member .

		When in
1914	DATE	he discovered his total ignorance of the international engage - ments in accordance with which
England	LOCATION	went to war , he resigned .

		Of this there is no mention in the `` Recollections , '' and to present-day politics but one reference , that to the surrender of
Asquith	PERSON	and Lloyd-George to a coalition ministry .

		As it happened in the fulness of time our distin - guished apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power , with a share in the finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle , that could have been imagined .

		Unhappily they broke down , or thought they had -LRB-
1915	DATE	-RRB- , and could discover no bet - ter way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance -LRB- not without a trace of arbitrary proscription -RRB- from the opposing party that counted Liberalism , old or new , for dangerous and deluding moonshine .

		These lines have a note of disappointment , even of bitterness , quite at variance with the spirit of the book .

		More characteristic is the passage in the last chapter in which
Lord Morley	PERSON	pro- nounces , in his noblest manner , his final panegyric on the Victorian age .

		Whatever we may say of
Europe	LOCATION	between
Waterloo	LOCATION	and Sedan , in our country at least it was an epoch of hearts uplifted with hope , and brains active with sober and manly reason for the common good .

		Some ages are marked as sentimental , others stand con - spicuous as rational .

		The Victorian age was hap - pier than most in the flow of both these currents into a common stream of vigorous and effective tal - ent .

		New truths were welcomed in free minds , and free minds make brave men .

		Old prejudices were disarmed .

		Fresh principles were set afloat , and sup - ported by the right reasons .

		The standards of am - bition rose higher and purer .

		Men learned to care more for one another .

		Sense of proportion among the claims of leading questions to the world 's atten - tion became more wisely tempered .

		The rational prevented the sentimental from falling into pure emo - tional .

		Bacon was prince in intellect and large wis - dom of the world , yet it was
Bacon	PERSON	who penned that deep appeal from thought to feeling , `` The nobler a soul is , the more objects of compassion it hath . ''

		This of the great Elizabethan was one prevailing note in our Victorian age .

		The splendid expansion and en - richment of Toleration and all the ideas and modes that belong to Toleration was another .

		Never has the intellectual beauty of the Vic - torian age been more truly and eloquently de - fined ; never has it been more brilliantly and sympathetically exemplified than by
Viscount Morley	PERSON	's `` Recollections . ''

MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 19 Patriotism Without Vision THE WORLD PERIL .

		By Members of the Prince - ton Faculty .

		-LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Seven Princeton professors have undertaken to educate public opinion to the fact that
Germany	LOCATION	is a world peril and to clarify the principles for which the
United States	ORGANIZATION	is contending .

		In so far as it is typical of well informed opinion their book illustrates the urgency of a formative dis - cussion if President
Wilson	PERSON	shall enunciate at the peace conference an intelligent and clearly formulated programme representative of the de - terminations of the American people .

		The pres - ent trend of public sentiment is discouraging for those who have hoped this war might give birth to an international organization which would sub - stitute a regulated behavior for a destructive competition of interests as between absolute sov - ereignties .

		Those who undertake to instruct the people are content to re-emphasize the reasons which made a break with
Germany	LOCATION	inevitable , rather than to concentrate attention upon the ideals which must become actualized if this war shall not have been in vain .

		German historians , statesmen , and writers upon international law are quoted voluminously in demonstration of Ger - many 's purpose to rely upon the law of necessity as over against respectable acquiescence in the precepts of international law .

		It is assumed that international law , to quote Mr.
Edward S. Cor	PERSON	- win , expresses the `` verdict of the tribunal of the civilized world . ''

		And , in this book , Mr.
Corwin	PERSON	seems willing to substantiate the illusion .

		He at - tempts to confute German adherence to the law of necessity in relations between nations by an analo - gous case selected from an English court of law !

		It is important to distinguish between a descrip - tion of fact and a rule of behavior .

		We should realize that the international situation is one in which law is merely the precedent established by the strong nation , observed only in so far as national interests are thereby fostered , and that it in no way voices the collective wishes of nations , and they will unite in an effort to sub - stitute law for an unregulated competition of interests .

		We can admit that the Germans have accurately described the international situation .

		It is necessary , however , if we would make clear the purpose of the
United States	LOCATION	, as expressed by President
Wilson	PERSON	, to prevent the Central Empires from transforming an existing fact into an ap - proved and permanent rule of procedure .

		We hope to assist in the creation of a world of law out of a present world of chaos and anarchy .

		The importance of accurately understanding the correct international situation is re-enforced by reading Mr.
Clifton R. Hall	PERSON	's splendid paper concerning the two Americas .

		He contributes one of the best papers of short compass which has been written upon the relations of North and
South America	LOCATION	.

		It reviews the historical associa - tions of the
United States	LOCATION	and the South and Central American republics , examines the Mon - roe Doctrine in the light of Pan-Americanism , portrays the development of our trade since the war , and discusses the means of cooperation and the requisites for those mutual understandings which alone will unify the two continents .

		Our exports to
South America	LOCATION	have increased three fold since 19.13 .

		They now constitute thirty - three per cent of the total imports to these coun - tries .

		The conclusion of the war will involve the American merchant in a bitter contest to maintain what he has recently won .

		In the past , American business firms have been unable to compete with government supported foreign organizations .

		The English banking system and the German cartel excluded the American from the field .

		Until
1913	DATE	the
United States	ORGANIZATION	banking laws forbade American banks from establishing foreign branch - es , and the Sherman Anti-trust Act prevented combinations of exporters for purposes of foreign trade .

		If by chance American merchants could overcome these handicaps they possessed no means of transportation .

		European lines have discrimi - nated against Americans `` by means of categorical agreements known as ` conferences ' in which Eng - lish , German and other companies have joined , dividing the territory among themselves , fixing rates of transportation , pooling their earnings and administering a system of rebates to crush interlopers . ''

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	outlines the measures which have been adopted to overcome these difficulties .

		The Federal Reserve Act removes financial handicaps .

		The proposed
Webb	PERSON	Law makes possible com - binations of exporters in foreign trade , and the government through the
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce	ORGANIZATION	is now an effective help - mate .

		Secretary
Redfield	PERSON	has developed an effi - cient system `` of regular commercial attaches to collect data and furnish advice , special agents to travel wherever needed to study local conditions , and offices in our principal cities , manned by trained experts , to disseminate information to interested parties all this in addition to our increasingly capable consular service . ''

		Finally , the revolution in the shipping industry brought 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	about by the war , together with friendly Con - gressional legislation , seems to guarantee a period of security and development for the American merchant marine .

		We are not to expect , however , that European nations will relinquish their South American trade without a struggle .

		Says Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, `` Ex - perts have pointed out that , since the war began ,
England	LOCATION	has made greater strides in industrial efficiency than in fifteen or twenty-five years previously ... and that , when peace is de - clared , far from abdicating her sovereignty over the world 's trade , she will appear in the lists re - armed , rejuvenated , and more formidable than ever . ''


Germany	LOCATION	, likewise , will seek to regain the markets abandoned during the war .

		And , `` moreover , the disconcerting activity of
Japan	LOCATION	in developing new ship lines and in greatly increas - ing her emigration to
South America	LOCATION	introduces an added complication into an already perplex - ing problem . ''

		Not only has
Japan	LOCATION	entered
South America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Mason W. Tyler	PERSON	discusses American inter - ests in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		He shows that under pres - sure of the European War
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	have yielded a virtual monopoly to
Japan	LOCATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	has `` forced
China	LOCATION	to recognize her predominant position in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, secured an extension of the lease of Port
Arthur	PERSON	and the Manchurian Railways to ninety-nine years , and full rights to establish in that region any Japa - nese enterprise .

		In Shantung she not only secured all the economic rights hitherto held by Ger - many , but also greatly extended them , including the right to build , under Japanese control , the new railway opening up the northern part of the peninsula .

		She secured the right to control and almost monopolize the great coal and iron fields in the
Yangtze	LOCATION	valley .

		Finally she secured at least a prior right to the development of Fu-Kien province in southern
China	LOCATION	.

		Taken altogether , these concessions constitute the commencement at least , of an economic monopoly for
Japan	LOCATION	in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The Open Door in the
Far East	LOCATION	is closed .

		Now , while Americans clearly recognize that the Great War has ended their national isola - tion , public opinion stubbornly remains blind to the fact that this makes inevitable a conflict with the vital interests of other nations .

		The world trade situation is becoming more and more one in which governments are assistants if not active partners with their subjects in foreign enterprise .

		This presages an international competition more keen than existed before the war .

		Unless there shall be what
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	calls a neutral authority empowered to adjust interests and to institute readjustments peacefully , readjustments by force are inevitable .

		We should expect that a book written primarily to educate public opinion regarding war issues would squarely face this problem .

		The authors of The World Peril have not done so .

		Their emphasis is upon the past , not the future .

		Mr.
Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker	PERSON	writes a chapter on Democracy Imperilled .

		The sum of his argument is to demonstrate that the development of modern
Germany	LOCATION	has been the coalescence of forces antagonistic to democracy .

		The implication is , crush the
Kaiser	PERSON	and the world automatically becomes safe for democracy !

		The contribution of
Honorable Heniy van Dyke	ORGANIZATION	is a Fourth of
July	DATE	address which conforms to traditional standards .

		Only in the concluding chapter of the book is an at - tempt made to outline the essentials for world peace .

		In this chapter Mr.
Philip Marshall Brown	PERSON	rejects the principle of balance of power .

		He represents an opinion the direct opposite of Mr.
Tyler	PERSON	's who writes in behalf of a world balance of power .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	clearly perceives that a peace which rests upon balance of power is a peace ultimately dependent upon force .

		But he suggests no tangible substitute .

		He insists that a first essential for future security is a demo - cratic
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Secondly , the claims of nation - alism must be recognized and in some way combined with local autonomy .

		Tariff rivalries must give way to freedom of trade between all na - tions .

		And when he has thus formulated a pro- gramme for world peace he proceeds to emasculate it in the following words : `` If the law abiding , peace loving nations , however , are able to crush this outlaw -LRB-
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- and then lay the founda - tions of peace in accordance with sound prin - ciples , they may have but little reason to concern themselves about the formation of ` councils , ' ` leagues , ' police , or even of courts .

		The applica - tion of the Golden Rule as the rule of enlight - ened self-interest among nations will need hardly any other sanction than its own sanction . ''

		Exclusive attention to the past is peculiarly short sighted at this time .

		In each of the allied countries there exists a democratic element which favors a world organization for peace .

		Once these elements fuse and unite upon a construc - tive policy , they will sustain President
Wilson	PERSON	and other liberal allied statesmen in the critical period of peace negotiations .

		An indispensable preliminary for this synthesis of views is a con - tinuous discussion of the principles formulated in
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 recent issues of THE DIAL .

		Whatever a denun - ciation of the enemy may accomplish , it makes no approach towards that `` concert of free peoples '' urged by President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The question is no longer what caused us to enter the war , but what ideals we desire to make real through the con - duct of the war .

		Their attainment is conditioned upon translating into definite and concrete terms what is now a more or less vague desire that na - tions abandon their insistence upon absolute sov - ereignty , that each nationality recognize itself to be a cooperative unit in a larger whole , and that the conduct of nations be no longer determined as in the past by reference to their own concep - tions of vital interests but in accordance with rules of behavior based upon equality of oppor - tunity for all and special privilege for none .


V. T. THAYER	PERSON	.

		A Modern Russian Tone - `` Poet SCRIABIN .

		By
A. Eaglefield Hull	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		From his biographical sketches of Handel and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Hull	PERSON	has gone a long way for the subject of the third book in his series , choosing
Alexander Scriabin	PERSON	, the revolutionary Russian tone-poet who , in less than twenty years , made some of the most interesting and important experi - ments which have ever been made in musical art .

		But he has been exceedingly happy in his choice , for he has presented a most cogent and readable analysis of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's development and composi - tions the best analysis available in English .

		Scriabin 's name is as yet scarcely recognized outside the narrow circles of the musical elect .

		Born in
1871	DATE	, his father a young lawer , his mother a gifted pianist ,
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	developed into a musical wonder-child at the age of five .

		His acute ear and musical memory enabled him to reproduce any piece on the piano at one hearing .

		He showed many signs of an independent mind ; he preferred always to invent rather than to copy ; he extemporized on the piano with great credit long before he could write music .

		At the age of eight his creative genius expressed itself in musical composition and the writing of poetry ; he also amused himself by cutting things out of wood and making miniature pianos .

		He was frequently taken to the opera , where his ears were more occupied by the orchestra than his eyes were by the stage , which may indicate why his later devel - opment was along non-operatic lines .

		At ten he was placed in the
Army Cadet Corps	ORGANIZATION	, where he remained nine years , though he showed no love for the science of war .

		Scriabin 's first music lessons -LRB- on the piano -RRB- were taken privately from Professor
G. A. Conus	PERSON	, and later from
Zvierieff	PERSON	, who also had Rach - maninoff for a pupil .

		The breaking of his collar bone at this time forced him during his convales - cence to practice on the piano with his left hand only , which may partly account for the difficulty of the left-hand parts of many of his compositions .

		Later he entered the
Moscow Conservatoire	LOCATION	, where he studied pianoforte with
Safonoff	PERSON	and counterpoint with
Taneieff	PERSON	, both fine men and musicians whose influence was of inestimable benefit to
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scriabin remained under Taneieff for several years , but when the latter withdrew from the conservatoire and his place was taken by
Arensky	PERSON	,
Scriabin	PERSON	left the class in disgust at the end of
Arensky	ORGANIZATION	's first term because
Arensky	PERSON	`` wanted to put him back too far . ''

		He finished at the conservatoire in
1891	DATE	, and entered upon his life work as virtuoso and composer , which was uninterrupted until his death , except by a period of six years beginning in
1897	DATE	.

		About this time also he contracted an unlucky marriage , which was soon dissolved .

		He spent much time in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, besides touring Amer - ica in
1906-7	DATE	, where for a time he conducted the
New York Philharmonic Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	.

		For two years -LRB- 1909-10 -RRB- he lived in
Brussels	LOCATION	, in close touch with a brilliant group of artists , thinkers , and musicians .

		Here his contact with the arts , science , philosophy , and religion undoubtedly in - fluenced his naturally mystic mind , for here his masterpiece `` Prometheus '' was conceived and most of it written .

		Here also he met his second wife .

		He died in
Moscow	LOCATION	on
April 14 , 1915	DATE	from blood-poisoning , after an illness of only ten days .

		In summarizing
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's achievements during a busy fourteen years , it must be said that he was a modernist who evolved a new system of har - mony , abandoned both major and minor scales , as well as modulation , chromatic inflection , even key signatures , and , at the time of his death , had well under way his experiments with the unification of music , color , and mimique .

		As if this were not enough , he also wove a system of theosophy into the art of his latest period .

		Still , one wonders whether Dr.
Hull	PERSON	is not more prophetic than his - toric in his statement that `` the sum total of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's work has brought about an artistic revolution unequaled in the whole history of the arts . ''

		It is too much to expect that
Scriabin	PERSON	should 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	be generally understood so soon after his death .

		No great composer has ever achieved full appre - ciation in so short a time and probably none ever will do so , at least this side of the millennium .

		Indeed ,
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's music has scarcely been played in
America	LOCATION	.

		Outside of his tour of this country , the production of `` Prometheus '' in
New York	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	, and of the
Third Symphony	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- `` The Divine Poem '' -RRB- in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	about the same time , and some of his piano pieces which
Josef Hoffman	PERSON	has played , the music of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	is little known here .

		And because of the immense difficulty of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's music , especially the left-hand parts of his piano pieces , it will always remain beyond the ability of the common run of amateur musicians .

		Hence , sincere students of music will welcome the anal - ysis of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's work which Dr.
Hull	PERSON	has pro- vided .

		Coincidentally , here is a virgin field for the makers of music for player-pianos and sound - reproducing machines .

		The perfectly logical evolution of
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's achievements is emphasized in this book .

		Start - ing with a style that was distinctly Chopinesque , Scriabin early developed piquancy and originality , and , having once found himself , went confidently forward , greatly extending the scope of piano - forte technique .

		Especially is the natural growth of the new harmony shown in the interesting chapter on the ten sonatas , which Dr.
Hull	PERSON	declares `` in every way worthy of ranking with the very greatest things in pianoforte literature . ''

		Similarly ,
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's marvelous skill in orchestra - tion is revealed in the chapter on the five sym - phonies .

		Scriabin abandoned the major and minor scales without inventing a new one .

		But he invented a new style of composition .

		The discoverer of many new chords or combinations , he would take a single chord and out of its extended harmonies evolve a whole composition .

		His foundation chord is accepted as a concord , whether sweet - sounding or not , leaving only `` suspensions , '' `` passing notes , '' and `` appoggiaturas '' as discords .

		Strange his music may sound to unaccustomed ears , but it has wonderful vitality and charm , especially on the evanescent and ethereal tones of the piano .

		Yet his innovations are not mis - takes or the result of ignorance , for with all his adventures into the musically undiscovered , he had a profound knowledge of , and reverence for , form and design , as a study of his symphonies and sonatas shows .

		On the framework of classi - cal form , which
Schumann	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Berlioz	PERSON	considered outworn , he weaves wonderful pat - terns of exquisite coloring and beauty .

		His intimate pieces seem quite as wonderful as
Field	ORGANIZATION	's and
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's , sometimes arabesques of / Eolian vagueness , and sometimes dual ideas poised in rondo form .

		Perhaps it is because of the association of color with music in `` Prometheus '' that one looks eagerly to see what Dr.
Hull	PERSON	says about this .

		But Dr.
Hull	PERSON	is rather non-committal , for
Scriabin	ORGANIZATION	's efforts in this direction were experimental and in no sense intended to be final .

		It is foolish to expect the relation between color and music to be established in one man 's lifetime , when that between drama and music has not been finally determined in three hundred years .

		Of course the analogy between color and sound dates back to
Aristotle	LOCATION	, and many scientists have worked on it ; but the red herring that is always drawn across the trail is the attempt to associate particu - lar colors with certain keys or scales .

		This involves the difficulty that sound is much more quickly perceptible than color , and that what is an entrancing arpeggio or trill in music is a blinding maze when translated into color .

		Also a trumpet note conveys an idea entirely different from that of the same note on a muted violin , though the color organ emblazons both with equal intensity ; that is to say , the color organ of the scientists utterly lacks timbre .

		Scriabin used Rim - ington 's color organ ; but he adopted a color scale of his own , and wrote his music in a novel har - monic and scientific system to give a color sym - phony a fairer opportunity to make itself should I say seen or heard ?

		This was aided also by having the color harmonies follow the bass notes of the musical harmonies .

		If there was little recognized connection between the music and color , at least the latter served to divide the senses of the audience much as opera does .

		Scria - bin associated music and color rather on psychic lines , trying to produce with his colors the same effect on the mind that his music produced , and he must be given credit for new progress in this direction .

		How much further he would have gone if he could have concluded the further experi - ments which were interrupted by his untimely death , one can only conjecture .

		Any attempt at more adequate comment on sep - arate chapters is infeasible ; yet it must be said that the discussions of the `` mystic chord , '' music and color , form and style , and the source of Scri - abin 's inspiration are a distinct contribution to the literature of modern harmony and musical ten - dencies .

		Whether one reads to damn or praise , the value of Dr.
Hull	PERSON	's commentary must be rec - ognized .


RUSSELL RAMSEY	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 23 A Gr ens tone Lad GRENSTONE POEMS .

		By
Witter Bynner	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Fred - erick
A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	. -RRB-

		When
Witter Bynner	PERSON	, some fifteen years ago , discovered `` A Shropshire Lad , '' the direction of his poetic future was settled .

		To him those amazing poems of
Housman	PERSON	meant the purest poetry since
Keats	PERSON	.

		Where else has a simple stanza , or where have a bare two or three of them , gone so freighted with the burden of com - pressed beauty ?

		Bynner learned the `` Shropshire Lad '' not only by heart but by soul .

		He is still informed of it .

		The influence is deeper than any matter of liter - ary chapter and verse .

		Bynner is , so far as an American can be , a Shropshire lad .

		The
Gren	PERSON	- stone Village of `` Grenstone Poems '' is an Amer - ican
Shropshire	PERSON	.

		In one direction Bynner leaves his master .

		There is not much optimism , as all the world knows , in
Housman	LOCATION	; there is a great deal in Bynner ... a lad Who had intended always to be glad .

		The intention to be glad runs through all Byn - ner 's verse , beginning with that long and joyous essay in everything that he published some two years out of college the `` Ode to Harvard '' -LRB- reprinted as `` Young Harvard '' -RRB- and continu - ing down through the resplendent democratic faith of `` The New World '' to the simple cheer - fulness of `` Grenstone Poems . ''

		Of all Bynner 's poetry `` The New World '' stands foremost .

		He came so near trjere to writing a great poem that one is brought to won - der at the accident that prevented him .

		I can not quite discover why it is not a great poem .

		It has certainly the makings of one .

		Its theme is mag - nificent ; it is bodied forth from the two greatest loves a poet could have the loves of woman and democracy here , in their source of `` Celia , '' identical ; it is full of lines of beauty and elo - quence .

		Perhaps , though , I slipped in saying `` the two greatest loves a poet could have '' ; there may be a greater and perhaps its not coming first in `` The New World '' is the reason why that poem does not quite attain the ultimate heights of poetry .

		The love of beauty is , after all , the thing that has made the most extraordinary poetry of the world new or old Music that is too grievous of the height For safe and low delight .

		One does not love simplicity first and therefore produce beauty ; one loves beauty first and the simplicity comes as one of its attributes : one does not make one 's first love democracy and then set out to turn it to beauty ; but the beauty itself must give birth to the democracy .

		Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing was a poet whose first vision was beauty long before she wrote `` The Cry of the Children '' ;
Josephine Peabody	PERSON	had loved and followed beauty and on that road found `` The Singing Man . ''

		Perhaps that is the reason why `` The New World '' fails of the quality of greatness for all its being a very remarkable poem .

		I sometimes wonder whether Bynner loves Beauty just the old-fashioned capitalized Dame that has been so worshipped enough .

		I believe
Housman	PERSON	and
Masefield	PERSON	and
Yeats	PERSON	and even
Arthur Ficke	PERSON	love her more .

		Bynner is a better poet than
Ficke	PERSON	, to my thinking , because he is more in love with life `` and life , some say , is worthy of the Muse . ''

		Bynner is a great deal better poet than a host of American others , but I wonder if he has sufficient blind adoration for the capitalized One .

		I wonder if the
Goddess of Simplicity	ORGANIZATION	has not a little prevailed at her expense .

		Certainly in `` Grenstone Poems '' it is the pur - suit of simplicity that comes first .

		Charming and delicate as they are , full of whim and fancy and loveliness , they are imbued above all with
Byn	PERSON	- ner 's ordered passion for simplicity .

		These poems illustrate his theory of the democratization of poetry , which he feels has been too largely an undemocratic art .


Blake	PERSON	and
Whitman	PERSON	and
Housman	PERSON	in their several ways were poets of a democratic vocabulary .

		Bynner is anxious not only to be clear in thought , not only to convey his idea in as few words as possible , but to make the words themselves such as are found in every - day speech .

		He does not wish poetry to be the charming luxury of the withdrawn few , but the daily fare of the average man .

		And so he writes in such manner that the average man may read .

		The theory is a healthy one ; all poets should have a little of it .

		There has been for years too much `` word-mosaic '' turned out in rhyme .

		The free verse writers have thrown overboard the rhyme ; Bynner has striven , instead , to purify the old music .

		And yet I question if
Bynner	PERSON	has not in `` Grenstone Poems '' gone a little far in his theory if he has not even handicapped himself .

		I feel occasionally in this book that the word or the line which would have expressed more beauti -
24	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	fully the inherent Bynner has been discarded for something not quite so happily expressive which commended itself as more easily understandable .

		Is it necessary to believe that people are more likely to read poetry if it is written from this point of view ?

		After all ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Mil - ton have got themselves more read than most poets and they are anything but monosyllabic .

		I do not believe that a poet of
Bynner	ORGANIZATION	's ability has the right to throAv away a large part of the English vocabulary ; he needs it ; he can not make poems of his own stature without the use of every tool that his native language has given him .

		How express things that are not in the consciousness of the ordinary everyday mortal if one is to be limited to the ordinary everyday vocabulary ?

		And what is poetry but the vision beyond consciousness ?

		Bynner himself has only recently come to the full practice of this theory .

		`` The New World '' was written in just its due richness .

		`` Young Harvard '' was .

		A bit of it , reprinted as a lyric in the `` Grenstone Poems , '' stands up conspicu - ously .

		Of course there were hints of this new philosophy in `` Tiger '' and strong hints in the Bynner translation of `` Iphigenia in Tauris '' of which the second , it seems to me , therefore had to renounce any idea of following Euripides into his moments of more embroidered beauty .

		Per - haps `` The Little King '' suggested what was coming .

		At any rate `` The New World '' did not .

		I question if Bynner could harmonize with his present theory the following splendid passage from that poem , or successfully rewrite it to con - form to that theory : The times are gone when only few were fit To view with open vision the sublime , When for the rest an altar-rail sufficed To obscure the democratic Christ ... Perceiving now his gifts , demanding it , The benison of common benefit , Men , women , all , Interpreters of time , Have found the lordly Christ apocryphal , While Christ the comrade comes again no wraith Of virtue in a far-off faith But a companion hearty , natural , Who sorrows with indomitable eyes For his mistreated plan To share with all men the upspringing sod , The unfolding skies Not God who Made Himself the Man , But a man who proved man 's unused worth And made himself the God .

		I am grateful to
Time	ORGANIZATION	, who got `` The New World '' out of Bynner before he found that `` benison '' and `` indomitable '' could no longer be in his vocabulary .

		How far the theory goes let me illustrate from one
Grenstone	PERSON	poem one of the loveliest of the book , and of all Bynner 's lyrics : Name me no names for my disease With uninforming breath ; I tell you I am none of these But homesick unto death Homesick for hills that I had known , For brooks that I had crossed , Before I met this flesh and bone And followed and was lost ... And though they break my heart at last Yet name no name of ills .

		Say only , `` Here is where he passed , Seeking again those hills . ''

		A manuscript of the same poem , dated before `` The New World , '' shows the last stanza thus : Save that they broke my heart at last Name me no name of ills , But say that here is where he passed , Seeking again those hills !

		I put it to any critic that the first version was more direct , more poignant , than the new .

		The change is due principally to the fact that `` save '' has gone out of usual speech .

		But is n't that the fault of usual speech rather than of `` save '' ?

		Must we who believe in democracy justify the reproach of its opponents that it will cause a lev - elling down rather than a levelling up ?

		There is another defect of the Bynnerian qual - ity that I can not help sensing in `` Grenstone Poems . ''

		It seems to me that he is sometimes almost mathematical in the development of his simplicity .

		He loves to strike poetic balances and make poetic classifications almost to replace poetry by a lengthened epigram .

		There is a poem even called `` The Balance '' which is suc - cessfully typical of a whole series , many of them not so successful : Lose your heart , you lose the maid : It 's the humor of her kind .

		So trim the balance to a shade ; Keep your heart and keep the maid !

		Keep your heart , you keep the maid , But yourself you can not find ... Fling the balance unafraid !

		Find your heart and lose the maid I A charming whim of writing , and worth repeat - ing , but not to take the place of the poetry that Bynner could do , and has done .

		This hankering for precision , for classification , appears also in the elaborately simple arrange - ment of the `` Grenstone Poems . ''

		The book car - ries a table of contents that looks almost like a synopsis for a brief , with subdivision and resub - division , the `` Points '' set up in verse couplets , and a hint of a narrative argument running
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 through it .

		Into this simple elaboration are sorted out nearly two hundred poems , some of which fit excellently , while others are forced into place rather at their own expense .

		For example , the poem that I quoted begin - ning `` Name me no name for my disease '' was originally called `` The Patient to the Doctors . ''

		In the book it is called `` Hills of Home '' and appears balanced against , on the opposite page , `` Foreign Hills , '' another poem with which it has -LRB- really -RRB- nothing to do , both appearing under Article I , `` Grenstone , '' Subdivision 1 , `` On the Way to Grenstone '' the effect of the whole effort at anecdotal veracity being , I think , to devitalize a very good poem and make it try to appear something it rather is not .

		An example that I regret even more is `` The Fields '' a delicate and lovely little war poem placed in Subdivision 2 , `` Neighbors and the Countryside '' : Though wisdom underfoot Dies in the bloody fields , Slowly the endless root Gathers again and yields .

		In fields where hate has hurled Its force , where folly rots , Wisdom shall be uncurled Small as forget-me-nots .

		So that the fields of
France	LOCATION	must become
New England	LOCATION	meadows , and oblige !

		There is another exquisite war poem which should be quoted .

		A trifle shortened from its original form in `` The Nation , '' `` War '' shows Bynner at his most deft and pointed best , where his sense of precision and poignancy combine to produce a perfect thing : Fools , fools , fools , Your blood is hot today .

		It cools When you are clay .

		It joins the very clod Wherein at last you see The living God , The loving God , Which was your enemy .

		And here is a poem which gives the flavor of the whole Grenstone series the thesis of `` The New World '' translated into simpler terms the love of Nature and pleasant things and the dem - ocratic God .

		It is called `` God 's Acre . ''

		Because we felt there could not be A mowing in reality So white and feathery-blown and gay With blossoms of wild caraway , I said to
Celia	LOCATION	, `` Let us trace The secret of this pleasant place ! ''

		We knew some deeper beauty lay Below the bloom of caraway , And when we bent the white aside We came to paupers who had died : Rough wooden shingles row on row , And God 's name written there
John Doe	PERSON	.


Witter Bynner	PERSON	is the possessor of an unusual and lovely gift .

		My only wish is that he would content himself with being a very good and growing poet , instead of tending to preoccupy himself with a theory .

		His gift is sufficient , if he will permit it , to stand above theories .

		Can we not have the real Bynner as he started out , and first continued imaginative , versatile , and una - fraid , while being deft , to be purely spontane - ous .

		So but the harvest be always richer from year to year , what care we what machinery does the threshing ?

Sancho Panxa	PERSON	on His Island UTOPIA OF USURERS AND OTHER ESSAYS .

		By
Gil	PERSON	-
bert K. Chesterton	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Whether it is merely because
Chesterton	PERSON	has given us a characteristic and , in its own way , peculiarly illuminating study of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	or because a subtle spiritual comradeship , underlying all their obvious differences , holds them bound in memory , I find it difficult to keep
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	out of my mind when reading his fellow-craftsman in the art of paradox .

		When
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	makes a neat point or flares out with some unexpected antithesis , I find myself wondering how
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	would have put the same idea .

		Both use their paradoxical panoply for the purpose of charging on us with what they really think or , at least , with how they even more really feel .

		They are always deadly in earnest .

		This is the reason why they can afford to laugh so boisterously , for only such as know what they are about and have found a foothold in the shifting sands of idea can find time and energy and , above all , courage to laugh .

		The well-balanced individual is too busy pairing off alternatives , too busy finding a sensible middle ground , to be capable of more than a preoccupied smile .

		Laughter presupposes comfort ; the proverbial seat on the fence , ad - vantageous as it may be in other respects , is too spiked for comfort .

		Yet , like all similar things ,
Shaw	PERSON	and
Chester	PERSON	- ton are vastly different .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's main concern is with ideals and with romance ; he has a great joke on humanity because he alone sees that ideals and romance are but decorations that humanity has built about the commonplace , though I fancy , to judge from sundry wistful passages in the 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	Shavian writings , that he sometimes wishes his sight were duller .

		Chesterton 's concern is also with ideals and with romance ; but his laughter springs rather from a zestful sense of their abid - ing presence in the commonplace , from a feeling of security in the essential goodnesses and right - nesses of life that leaves him free for quips and fine scorns and puns beastly ones sometimes .

		Shaw laughs heartily on an empty stomach ,
Ches	PERSON	- terton easily on a full one .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	sees with amazing clarity the just beyond , while the present lies shadowed in a penumbra ;
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	sees the just beyond only a trifle less clearly , but he sees it as a distorted shadow cast by the present and the past , especially the mystic past .

		Shaw wan - ders about in search of his perfect No Man 's Land , struggling all the while against the foul machinations of sorcerers who invest spades with glamour ; no wonder that he tilts a lance at an occasional windmill .

		Chesterton accepts the machinations of the sorcerers for the wonderful actualities they are .

		Were
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	desophisticated and dehumorized , he would be
Don Quixote	PERSON	; were Chesterton desophisticated but not dehu - morized , he would be
Sancho Panza	PERSON	.

		.

		But as sophistication and Shavian humor are what the biologists call acquired characters , we are left scientifically free to equate
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	with the illustrious Don ,
Chesterton	PERSON	with his no less illus - trious squire .

		And once we have accustomed ourselves to interpreting them in the light of an exegesis borrowed from
Cervantes	PERSON	, much becomes doubly clear .

		Nature is never more purposeful than when she seems inattentive and accidental .

		Need we now wonder that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is thin and humane , that
Chesterton	PERSON	is fat and human ?

		Are not
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's women as unclaspable as the famed Dulcinea del Toboso , and might not Chestorton find beauty and love in any country wench ?

		But note chiefly this :
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	scorns the governance of a mere island , his fancy must hold sway over vaster realms , the realms of a humanity untainted by localism .

		As for
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	, he is eminently qualified to govern an island .

		Let
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	found the world state , he will be content to rule merry
England	LOCATION	-LRB-
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	will be merry , as she has been -RRB- and pontificate for all of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity that is worth saving .

		In `` Utopia of Usurers , '' a series of reprints of essays first published in periodical form ,
Chester	PERSON	- ton has much to say about his island .

		He is in a bad humor .

		Things have not gone well with the island .

		Not only is a dastardly foe threatening it from without , but there is cause for endless dis - gruntlements within .

		The `` all 's well with the world '' frame of .

		mind of `` Orthodoxy '' has given way to scowls and apprehensive shakings of the head .

		Even the cheery mysticism of that book and of so many of its successors -LRB- `` The Inno - cence of Father Brown '' and `` Magic '' are types -RRB- is somewhat less in evidence than it should be in writing coming from
Chesterton	LOCATION	's pen , though faint-hearted , vestigial formulae are not absent -LRB- ``
Robespierre	LOCATION	talked even more about God than about the Republic because he cared even more about God than about the Republic '' -RRB- .

		The proverb-like epigrams that we naturally look for -LRB- it will be remembered that
Sancho Panza	PERSON	reveled in proverbs -RRB- are with us again , but too many of them are burnished with the anger of the moment to be readily quotable out of their con - text .

		Still , there are some exceedingly good ones .

		For instance : `` the materialistic Sociologists , ... whose way of looking at the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific spectacles , and then shut their eyes '' ; or `` when we talk of
Army	ORGANIZATION	contractors as among the base but active actualities of war , we commonly mean that while the con - tractor benefits by the war , the war , on the whole , rather suffers by the contractor . ''

		Nor is that charming whimsicality , so often edged with as much naivete as paradox , for which
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	is most to be loved , entirely absent .

		Take this opening of an argument , for instance , which has the matter of a Swift and the temper of an angel : `` An employer , let us say , pays a seamstress two - pence a day , and she does not seem to thrive on it .

		So little , perhaps , does she thrive on it that the employer has even some difficulty in thriving upon her . ''

		But all through the volume of essays runs a genuine anger , an anger that is by no means always careful to clothe itself in neat turns and whimsicalities but , on the contrary , may even break out into crude petulance -LRB- `` And if anyone reminds me that there is a Socialist Party in
Germany	LOCATION	, I reply that there is n't '' -RRB- .

		What is it that angers
Chesterton	PERSON	and fills him with grim forebodings for the future of his island ?

		Many things and , especially , many persons .

		But chiefly the capitalists , the upper middle class , the usurers , or however they be termed , and the fear of the servile state , the state in which art and literature and science and efficiency and morality and everything else that has value in the eyes of mortal man become the humble servants of the money-changers , in short , the `` utopia of usurers . ''

		In this state the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	advertises soap , and college professors have to put up with such mental pabulum as can be digested and manages
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 27 to get published by the captains of industry .

		Hear
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's own summary of the nine essays de - voted to the dismal Utopia : `` Its art may be good or bad , but it will be an advertisement for usur - ers ; its literature may be good or bad , but it will appeal to the patronage of usurers ; its scientific selection will select according to the needs of usurers ; its religion will be just charitable enough to pardon usurers ; its penal system will be just cruel enough to crush all the critics of usurers ; the truth of it will be Slavery : and the title of it may quite possibly be Socialism . ''

		There is ex - hilaration in the defiance of this from `` The Escape '' : The water 's waiting in the trough , The tame oats sown are portioned free , There is Enough , and just Enough , And all is ready now but we .

		But you have not caught us yet , my lords , You have us still to get .

		A sorry army you 'd have got , Its flags are rags that float and rot , Its drums are empty pan and pot , Its baggage is an empty cot ; But you have not caught us yet .

		And this , at the end of the poem , will serve to mark the Chestertonian contempt : It is too late , too late , my lords , We give you back your grace : You can not with all cajoling Make the wet ditch , or winds that sting , Lost pride , or the pawned wedding ring , Or drink or Death a blacker thing Than a smile upon your face .

		Other causes for
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's scorn there are in the book , the mean-spirited attempt of those infernal bores , the well-meaning people , to deprive the workingman of his ale ; the dunder - headedness of parliaments and administrators ; the incredible mendacity of the press ; the absurdity of Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	in the role of loyal patriot ; the shameless ignorance of public affairs exhibited by the well informed ; the impertinence of Puritan meddlers , but the capitalist and his Utopia , the servile state , are at the back of these ills , present and to come .

		Don
Quixote	PERSON	-LRB- in his Shavian avatar -RRB- is right .

		The nefarious enchanter , capi - talism , is triumphant ; he has cast his evil spell on all the springs of genuine , straightforward being ; he is nigh unto choking the soul of human - ity .

		It is high time that the

		We are about to come into possession of Chek - hov .

		It will be a priceless possession , for Chek - hov is indispensable to our understanding of the psychology of the great people that has intro - duced into the present world situation an ele - ment so complex , so disturbing , so tragic and beautiful .

		Chekhov is the faithful reporter , unerring , intuitive , direct .

		He never bears false witness .

		The essence of his art lies in a fine restraint , an avoidance of the sensational and the spectacular .

		His reticence reveals the elusive and lights up the enigmatic .

		And what a keen , voracious observer he was !

		Endless is the pro- cession of types that passes through his pages the whole world of Russians of his day : country gentlemen , chinovniks , waitresses , ladies of fash - ion , shopgirls , town physicians , Zemstvo doctors , innkeepers , peasants , herdsmen , soldiers , trades - men , every type of the intelligentsia , children , men and women of every class and occupation .

		Chekhov describes them all with a pen that knows no bias .

		He eschews specialization in types .

		In a letter written to his friend Pleschey '' - ev ,
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	draws in one stroke a swift , subtle parallel between the two authors ,
Shcheglov	PERSON	and
Korolenko	PERSON	, and then he goes on to say , `` But ,
Allah	LOCATION	, Kerim !

		Why do they both specialize ?

		One refuses to part with his prisoners , the other feeds his readers on staff officers .

		I recognize specialization in art , such as genres , landscape , history ; I understand the 'em ploi ' of the actor , the school of the musician , but I can not accept such specialization as prisoners , officers , priests .

		This is no longer specialization ; it is bias . ''

		Chek - hov ignores no phase of the life of his day .

		This inclusiveness , this large and noble avidity that refuses to be circumscribed by class or kind or importance , makes the sum of his stories both ample and satisfying .

		His work illuminates the whole of Russian life , the main thoroughfares , the bypaths , the unfrequented recesses .

		Without
Chekhov	PERSON	, how are we to embark on the discov - ery of
Russia	LOCATION	?

		Within the limits of his day
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	is the perfect guide because his interpretations of a life that is alien to us have the essential qualities of 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	veracity and credibility .

		It is the spirit of wide - eyed , tolerant , dispassionate perception that gives
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	's works their character of true evi - dence .

		For him , subtle and balanced in his sen - sibilities , all reality is innately artistic .

		With no apparent effort , he lifts everything : the common - place , the threadbare , even the banal , to the high plane of art .

		The relations of ordinary exist - ence , the sombre dullness , the gray emptiness of uninspired life acquire interest and meaning .

		He creates , as the Russian critic
Leon Shestov	PERSON	says , `` from the void . ''

		Others flee from these things as from the valley of the shadow of death ; Chek - hov gives them color , harmony , inevitability ; they become significant , infinitely sad , infinitely human .

		We may wish to turn away from these aspects of reality , we may wish to take refuge in dreams and visions and hopes , but the artist constrains us to stay ; his tales become credible and strangely familiar .

		With poignant regret we acknowledge them as a true representation of our own lives .

		A representation of life , but not an explana - tion .

		Chekhov , almost alone among the great Russians , does not set himself the task of solving the riddles of the universe .

		He is the honest physician who knows no panaceas and is skep - tical as to palliatives .

		Explanations , command - ments , reconciliations , consolings he has none of these to offer .

		He shuns the admonitions and the comfortable words of the moral teacher , the impatient outcries of the embittered rebel , the grandiose creations of the symbolist , the vicari - ous solace of the mystic .

		He counsels neither rebellion nor acceptance .

		For this shrinking from all forms of dogma - tism , for this absence of burning indignation and passionate protest , most Russians hold
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	strictly to account .

		They refuse to forgive him for not coming to conclusions with life .

		Against what some of them are pleased to call his `` com - placency in political and social matters '' they invoke the lines of the poet Nekrassov : He loves not the land of his fathers Who sings without sorrow and anger .

		Chekhov was not unaware of his countrymen 's predilection for strong , flaming words on the `` accursed problems of life . ''

		But he was resolved to remain true to his temperament .

		And what was
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	's temperament ?

		In one of his letters to his friend Souvorin , after dwelling on the soothing effects of Nature on his spirits , he writes , `` Nature reconciles man , that is , makes him indifferent .

		And in this world one must be indifferent .

		Only dissatisfied people can look at things clearly , can be just , and do work .

		Of course , this includes only thoughtful and noble persons ; egoists and empty folk are indifferent as it is . ''

		These words , I think , will give us a clue to an understanding of
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	's attitude to life .

		Nor do they stand alone .

		Again and again , in his letters ,
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	replies in the same strain to those who complain that he has not solved the moral or ethical questions that arise in his sto - ries .

		I quote from a few of his letters to Sou vorin : The business of the writer of fiction is only to de - pict how and under what circumstances people speak and think about such problems as God , pessimism , etc. .

		The artist should not be a judge of his personages and of what they say , but only an unbiassed witness .

		I overhear a conversation on pessimism between two Russians , and my business is to report the conversa - tion as I heard it , and let the jury , i. e. , the readers , decide as to its value .

		My business is only to be talented , that is , to be able to distinguish between important and unimportant testimony , to be able to illuminate the characters and speak in their lan - guage ... And if an artist in whom the crowd has faith dares announce that he understands nothing of what he sees this alone constitutes a large acqui - sition in the realm of thought and is a great step forward . ''

		`` In my talks with the writing brethren I always maintain that it is not the business of the artist to decide narrowly specific questions .

		It is bad if the artist undertakes something he does not understand .

		For special problems there are special - ists ... But an artist is to judge only of what he understands .

		His sphere is just as limited as that of any other specialist .

		This I repeat and on this I always insist .

		That in his sphere there are no prob - lems but only answers , may be said by one who never wrote and never had to deal with images .

		The artist observes , selects , guesses , contracts .

		These acts alone , in their nature , presuppose the existence of problems .

		If he had no problem before him there would be no need of selecting and of guessing ... You are right in demanding from an artist a serious attitude to his work .

		You confuse two conceptions : the solution of the problem and the correct statement of the problem . ''

		`` You scold me for being objective and attribute this in me to an indifference toward good and evil and to a lack of ideals , etc. .

		When I depict horse-thieves you want me to say : ` To steal horses is evil . '

		But everybody knows this without my saying it .

		Let the thieves be judged by a sworn jury my business is to show them as they are ... Of course , it would be fine to harmonize art with sermons , but in my case it would be very difficult , and , so far as my technique goes , almost impossible .

		You realize , do you not , that to depict horse-thieves within the space of seven hundred lines I must always speak and think as they do , feel as they feel ?

		Otherwise , if I were to add subjective elements , the image would become blurred and the story would not be compact , as all short stories should be . ''

		This artistic credo does not express the spirit of heartless indifference .

		It conies from the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 resolve to present reality as seen by a calm , bal - anced , comprehensive , luminous temperament .

		Chekhov 's attitude is one of clear-eyed refusal to grapple with the unattainable .

		In the stories and plays of this artist there is no coldness and hardness .

		Despite the reticence and the stern suppression of emotion personal to the author , you discern in these works , in the letters , and in the volume on the convict-colony at
Sakhalin	LOCATION	, the tender , sensitive physician , the mild , understand - ing eye , the kindly , aching heart .

		To the everlasting question of the Russians , `` What is to be done ? ''

		Chekhov answers , some - times with a sad wistfulness , sometimes with a tender compassion , now with a merry twinkle , now with quiet resignation , `` I do not know . ''

		`` Is there a way out ? ''

		And again the reply , `` I do not know . ''

		For him , too , the rest is silence .

		Life goes on , but it has no swing , no forward propulsion .

		It is a strange , rhythmless life that
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	surveys , a life without great adventures or feverish activity .

		It is life playing on muted strings , under gray skies , and in a time of dark reaction .

		And
Chekhov	PERSON	stands awed in the presence of failure , of tragic insufficiency , of death - in-life , of broken hopes , broken hearts .

		Disillu - sionment has come to blight the energies and the spirit of these men and women and children .

		In all but a few there is some sad imperfection , some fatal dmartia that makes them the play - things of the imperturbable Fates .

		And the story of every one in the long procession is only another of life 's little ironies .

		To view this stagnation over which the spirit of the Lord has not passed , to discern it all , to bear the conscious - ness of it in the heart , one must possess some - thing of the imperturbability , the impassivity , the indifference of Nature .

		One must be , as
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	was , a physician who knew himself doomed to an early death .

		I have been asked , `` Are Chekhov 's stories true to life ?

		Do they convey the impression of real - ity ?

		Is the life of the greater number of men and women so colorless , so passive , so full of dull regret , so unfulfilled of all desire ? ''

		I do not know .

		But I have stood in the great City , on
Broadway	DATE	, at the time when the clock struck the hour of six , and I have seen the men and women pour forth from the shops and stores and factories .

		Thousands upon thousands , they emerge after the long confinement of the day 's work , and in a swift procession they walk home in the gathering dusk .

		What are the sudden revelations , the wondrous surprises that the future has in store for them for the millions like them to whom the great adventures in life are a journey underground , supper , the marvels of the motion pictures , sleep ?

		Ah ,
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	knew !

		He knew of the glory of childhood , the dreams of youth , the miracle of hope and fresh beginnings ; and he knew the dreary emptiness in the hearts of those who return home at the end of the day .

		He knew of the ceaseless quest for happiness , for a fuller life , for rest .

		And he knew that , high or low , whatever the path we follow , we are never far from the endless procession of the disillusioned .

		But is there no release , and no fulfilment ?

		Whenever I stand where the long line of those who hurry home in the gathering dusk passes by , I can see , in the west , through the great canyon that is the city street , the glory of the setting sun .

		There the sky is strangely beau - tiful .

		It seems to bend over a new and a dif - ferent world .

		Who can tell ?

		But in that world there seems to be joy and work , beauty and laughter , sunshine , freedom , stretching of limbs , rest .

		And , wondering whether we can create that world , no longer from the void , I recall
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	's many quiet words of encourage - ment and hope .

		Sonia speaks such words in the closing scene of `` Uncle Vanya '' : `` What can we do ?

		We must live our lives .

		-LSB- A pause . -RCB-

		Yes , we shall live ,
Uncle Vanya	ORGANIZATION	.

		We shall live through the long procession of days before us , and through the long evenings ; we shall patiently bear the trials that fate imposes on us ; we shall work for others without rest , both now and when we are old ; and when our last hour comes we shall meet it humbly , and there , beyond the grave , we shall say that we have suffered and wept , that our life was bitter , and God will have pity on us .

		Ah , then , dear , dear Uncle , we shall see that bright and beautiful life ; we shall rejoice and look back upon our sorrow here ; a tender smile and we shall rest .

		I have faith ,
Uncle	LOCATION	, fervent , passion - ate faith .

		-LSB-
Sonia	PERSON	kneels down before her uncle and lays her head upon his hands -RCB- We shall rest .

		We shall rest .

		We shall see heaven shin - ing like a jewel .

		We shall see all evil and all our pain sink away in the great compassion that shall enfold the world .

		Our life will be as peaceful and tender as a caress .

		I have faith ; I have faith . ''

		By
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The world may be in ferment ; but not so
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	.

		He casts his eye upon the vasty deeps of time and remains the Presi - dent of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, orotund , common - place , upper-class , smug .

		One gathers that he has heard of patriotism , service , reconstruction , the Russian Revolution , internationalism .

		His thoughts upon them appear in the addresses and interviews assembled in this volume .

		He has said everything that a deacon and a director would approve of , nothing more .

		There is much talk in these addresses of the process of thought , much speculation as to how the patriot , the wise man , the prudent man , the Butlerized man will think , in fact , there is more such talk than evidence of thought .

		For winged thought does not consort with a leaden style of Rooseveltian alternatives .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's opinions on industry , on international affairs , we all know .

		Suffice it to say they are untainted with the heretical economics and psychology which have been revealing us glaringly to our - selves .

		This aspect of the modern world Mr.
Butler	PERSON	flees .

		He takes refuge in general statements , for the more general your statements the more noble they may be made to seem .

		His volume , there - fore , is interesting not for any interpretation of our time so much as for its revelation of an anachronism the florid oratorical mind still at work in

		THROUGH LIFE AND ROUND THE WORLD .

Raymond Blathwayt	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		LIFE AND LETTERS OF
MAGGIE BENSON	PERSON	.

		By
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	.

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Here are an autobiography and a biography of two rather well-known persons , both of whom were active in work connected with the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Blathwayt	PERSON	as a curate and
Miss Benson	PERSON	as a founder of Bible societies .

		Both offer us their reaction to the creed and the dogmas of that church .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	assures us that there is an immense future before the art of biography and that he believes it should not deal with notable persons alone but with interesting and striking personali - ties as well .

		While we are not inclined to allow this plea to stand when it is a question of indulg - ing the exploitation of Bensonism , it yet carries a tincture of truth .

		It is true , for instance , in regard to Mr.
Blathwayt	PERSON	.

		Here is a man pre - eminently of the world , a man of wit and lofti - ness of purpose , whose conclusions regarding men and things are neither commonplace nor dull .

		He started life as a curate , and rinding himself unable to subscribe fully to the dogma he had to teach , courageously gave up the work , though doing so meant poverty until he discovered an opening in journalism .

		With the rather brief account of his life he includes gossipy bits of information about all sorts of notable people , and the book is a veritable gold mine for the after-dinner speaker , for it is besprinkled with quotable anecdotes .

		The
Benson	PERSON	family think themselves very interesting to the world , an opinion no doubt engendered by their countless admirers , but one is often wearily reminded of the Punch squib , `` Signs of the Times ; Self-Denial Week : Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	refrains from publishing a book . ''

		Their attitude of mind is , perhaps , shown by a habit of
Maggie	PERSON	's referred to in the biography .

		She made up a special book of prayers with alter - nating blank pages .

		On these she put down the initials of the person whose faults and needs the prayer opposite seemed best to fit .

		The story of her life is set down from the first day to the last .

		Nothing is omitted , from the most trivial , meaningless letter of childhood to the girlish gushings of the teens .

		The life impresses her brother as a most useful one but he hardly suc - ceeds in persuading the reader .

		She seemed always seeking self-expression in writing or Egyptology or what not , but found no permanent satisfaction except in her friendships .

		She might be said to have succeeded in life because of what she gave here to both men and women .

		Whether she would have wanted this exploited in a biog - raphy no one can ever know , but there is just a possibility since she was a Benson .

		FAITH , WAR , AND POLICY .

		By
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It would hardly be possible for
Gilbert Mur	PERSON	- ray to write a really illiberal book , but it has not been impossible for him to feel too constantly in this book the weight of his representative posi - tion .

		The result is not altogether satisfying .

		You feel that Professor
Murray	PERSON	has been the vic - tim of those exceptional circumstances which exact their heavy toll of the eminent .

		In acting as spokesman for
England	LOCATION	, he has had to strain his voice by pitching it in the popular key , and he has had to discuss subjects about which his opin - ions are far less valuable than they are about the Greek drama .

		What stands out most sharply and incongruously in the book is Professor
Murray	PERSON	's complaisance in transferring the problems raised by the war to the shoulders of those very diplo - mats and statesmen whose inadequacy is suffi - ciently demonstrated by the present debacle .

		He argues rather superficially against democratic con - trol of foreign policy , on the ground that the
1918	DATE	-RSB- 31 public can not be expected to be as well informed on such subjects as the diplomats , and he is will - ing to assume that , so far as
England	LOCATION	is con - cerned , the diplomats may be trusted to pursue a disinterested and honest policy .

		In discussing the
British Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Murray	PERSON	adopts a tone which is nothing less than smug ; he is frankly the apologist , who can allow him - self to write , `` The fact seems to be that , if , some years ago , an angel had set himself to the task of saving
Europe	LOCATION	, he would not have begun by altering British policy .

		He would have begun by something else . ''

		This fatal complacency extends to everything British : `` In peace we are the most liberal and the most merciful of all great empires ; in war we have
Napoleon	PERSON	's famous testimonial , calling us ` the most consistent , the most implacable , and the most generous of his enemies . '

		It is for us to keep up this tradition , and I believe that the men who rule us do keep it up . ''

		It is true that a watchful critic might be able to cite many instances of a less admir - able sort , but Professor
Murray	PERSON	is ready for such critics .

		He rules out cases that do not come under the definition as exhibiting traits that are essentially `` un-English . ''

		There are fine things in the book , notably the picture Professor
Mur	PERSON	- ray gives of
Arthur Heath	PERSON	, the brilliant young Oxonian who fell in the fighting at
Loos	LOCATION	.

		There is a constant sympathy with the idealism of the young men who gave themselves so unsparingly to save civilization , and it is in writing of their sacrifices that Professor
Murray	PERSON	is at his best .

		But the book as a whole is disappointing , since it exhibits the author in a role which he is not fitted to fill with his usual distinction .

		To
MEXICO	LOCATION	WITH SCOTT .

		Letters of Cap - tain
E. Kirby Smith	PERSON	to his wife .

		Prepared for the press by his daughter ,
Emma Jerome Blackwood	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by
R. M. Johnston	PERSON	.


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Not to the Mexican border with General
Hugh L. Scott	PERSON	in our own time , but into
Mexico	LOCATION	with
Winfield Scott	PERSON	seventy years ago , the reader is conducted in these letters of a gallant officer who fought and died in a cause hardly less per - plexing than is the Mexican question of to-day .

		Here is a passage -LRB- one of many -RRB- that might al - most have been written yesterday instead of
May 6 , 1847	DATE	: `` Some Mexican gentlemen came in
this morning	TIME	from
Puebla	LOCATION	.

		One of them , a very intel - ligent man , educated in
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, represents the country as in a most deplorable con - dition , the Government as utterly disorganized ... not capable of carrying on the war or making peace .

		The roads are filled with bands of robbers under the name of guerillas , who are as ready to plunder and murder the Mexicans as they are to attack us . ''

		Striking and also rather discouraging is the applicability of these letters to present conditions in the turbulent republic to the south .

		The writer fell at
Molino del Rey	ORGANIZATION	,
September 8 , 1847	DATE	, in his forty-first year , and his letters extend over the two years preced - ing his death .

		Professor
Johnston	PERSON	and members of
Kirby Smith	PERSON	's family have done their part well in preparing and annotating these letters for pub - lication .

		CARRY ON .

		By Lieutenant
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Lieutenant
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	of the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian field artillery is chiefly an author .

		As many grateful readers will remember , he has written `` The Garden without Walls , '' `` The Raft , '' and `` Slaves of Freedom , '' which he waited to finish before taking up arms for
England	LOCATION	.

		However , he was not always an author , for upon his graduation from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1905	DATE	he studied theology at the
Union Seminary	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and remained there a year before he reached the conclusion that his life work lay in literature .

		Now , from the trenches , he has written a series of intimate letters to the folk at home , replete with natural affection , with description which is fairly vivid and reflection suggestive of a parson .

		He is essentially a theo - logian in his thinking in the sense that he attempts to put a good showing on a bad mess , translates butchery into sacrifice , and mass psychology into duty and honor .

		When a great soul engages in this revaluation , the result can be magnificent , a tribute to the sheer superiority of man over the world ; but Lieutenant
Dawson	PERSON	is too much of a dear fellow to be in danger of erecting a `` City of God '' upon the agony of our civiliza - tion .

		However , he is particularly effectual in putting himself on paper , and his book affords a clear view into the theological soul .

		The best part of it is that his letters are so full of inci - dent that unless you are particularly interested , you need not bother with the theological inter - pretation at all .

		The interest that leads men into repainting the world to their liking arises in that self-con - sciousness usually known as egotism .

		Further , the self-regarding habit leads men to value with a great ado of words and affection anything touching upon their personal life , and they easily achieve sentimentality .

		Dawson proves this by not being the exception .

		He is the kind of man who loves to dwell -LRB- in his own words -RRB- on `` when I was a kiddie . ''

		He has n't set sail from
Halifax	LOCATION	before he feels he has `` become a little child again in God 's hands . ''

		Spending all of a morn - ing on the dock tending to the baggage leads 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 3	DATE	him to realize `` there are so many finer things I could do with the rest of my days bigger things . ''

		On the voyage , he marvels `` all the time at the prosaic and even coarse types of men who have risen to the greatness of the occasion . ''

		He means his fellow-soldiers .

		Sir
Willoughby Patterne	PERSON	wrote travel letters too .

		When he reaches the trenches , his theologizing immediately goes into action .

		The horrors of the battle field receive a description that sets one tingling ; hopes stir that perhaps this terrible - ness will deter men , at least those who have seen with their own eyes , from ever countenancing its recurrence ; but the tingle dies away in de - spondency over man 's irrepressible trick of turn - ing evil into good when you read Lieutenant
Dawson	PERSON	's conclusion : `` There is a marvellous grandeur about all this carnage and desolation ... when you see how cheap men 's bodies are , you can not help but know that the body is the least part of personality . ''

		There is much more of this sort of immoralizing .

		With con - siderable analysis , he indicates how this war wrecks even the lives and the hopes of its sur - vivors , renders them unfit for future work , `` does to the individual what it does to the landscape it attacks obliterates everything personal and characteristic . ''

		Accordingly , after the fashion of this type of mind , it follows that `` from these carcass-strewn fields of khaki , there 's a cleansing wind blowing for the nations that have died . ''

		And , in the conclusion , all the nations of the earth are invited to step into the breeze .

		One despairs at the hopefulness of man .

		MUTUAL AID .

		A
Factor of Evolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
P. Kropotkin	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This is a new edition at a popular price of the book in which
Kropotkin	PERSON	attacks the idea that mankind has progressed through the `` survival of the fittest , '' that the strong have oppressed the weak and benefitted by their removal .

		He aims to show that on the contrary all forms of animal life have lived and are living better because of mutual aid .

		The author speaks with equal ease of ants , of South American birds , and of mam - mals , and his work gives every evidence of ex - haustive research .

		As regards man , dealing with him chronologically ,
Kropotkin	PERSON	asserts that histo - rians have all wrongly put the stress on battles and armies rather than on the great , unseen fer - mentation of progress among the masses .

		There are chapters on mutual aid among savages , among barbarians , and in the mediaeval city , and on the causes of its decay .

		Kropotkin feels that com - munal possession of the soil and other like enter - prises open the only way of escape from social oppression .

		CASUAL COMMENT GENERAL SIR
IAAN HAMILTON	PERSON	, who com - manded the British forces at
Gallipoli	LOCATION	, has harsh words for the censor .

		`` From my individual point of view , '' he writes , `` a hideous mistake has been made on the correspondence side of the whole of this Dardanelles business .

		Had we had a dozen good newspaper correspondents here the vital , life-giving interest of these stupendous pro- ceedings would have been brought right into the hearts and homes of the humblest people in
Great Britain	LOCATION	... cables ... were turned by some miserable people somewhere into horrible bureau - cratic phrases or dead languages , i. e. , ` We have made an appreciable advance , ' ` The situation re - mains unchanged ' and similar phrases .

		As far as information to the enemy , this is too puerile alto - gether . ''

		The General concludes with an epi - gram which our own eager Prussians , welcoming reaction in the name of war-time necessity , may profitably ponder , `` Democracy and autocracy must fight with their own weapons ; if they change foils in the scuffle , then like Hamlet and Laertes they both of them are doomed . ''

		Sir
Hamilton	PERSON	is really generous in his selection of examples of stupidity .

		He might have sharpened his barbs of satire on `` An
Atlantic Port	LOCATION	'' or `` Somewhere in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Only an insensitive soul could have devised that ghastly euphemism for destroyed young life , `` wastage , '' and where but in a General Staff office could have origin - ated a phrase like `` inappreciable losses '' ?

		A veil of cold technical phrases , like the morning mist over No Man 's Land , interposes itself between the ugly realities of the mud and steel of war and the readers `` back home . ''

		And between them and the beauty of the war , too .

		One might forgive the censor for making fighting mechan - ical , if he at least allowed some of the eerie and tragic beauty of the Gargantuan machine to be reflected in the official dispatches .

		Every cor - respondent , of course , has written his purple pas - sages about the quick spreading splendor of shrapnel and the pyrotechnical magnificence of high explosives .

		But the deeper aesthetic percep - tions , such as we find in `` Le Feu '' and in
Hugh de Selincourt	PERSON	for example , rarely peep through the thick blanket of the censorship dark .


Philip Gibbs	PERSON	is the one notable exception .

		In his dis - patches to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' he contrives to avoid the blighting dehumanization of which General
Hamilton	PERSON	justly complains , and the equally sepulchral obtuseness of the conventional correspondent who has seen so much of the war that he may be said almost to pride himself on his callousness .

		Mr.
Gibbs	PERSON	never has ceased to be shocked by the war in all his writing there is a curiously constant quality of recoil , some - thing of the shattered anger of a fine and sensi -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 33 tive nature before the grimness and living agony .

		You become increasingly aware of this quality in his dispatches excellent bits of accurate report - ing , too through strange metaphors like the sunny slopes with their slow-maturing fruit of young life , and the autumn battle harvest of laughing flesh .

		Imagination and perceptiveness such as
Gibbs	PERSON	possesses , however , are rare , and the average newspaper man eventually succumbs to the industrious blue pencil , what the French cleverly call `` expositions de blanc . ''

		Will Gen - eral
Hamilton	PERSON	's criticism effect a reform ? ' '

		I doubt it , ' said the Walrus , and shed a bitter tear . ''

		MR.
J. L. SYMON	PERSON	'S COMPLAINT IN `` The Eng - lish Review '' that novels are too short has all the air of flaming paradox .

		It was not many months ago that
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	uttered a mov - ing plea for shorter fiction , pointing out that `` swollen novels '' had become as great a pest as `` swollen fortunes . ''

		He even distinguished a new type of serial , beloved of newspaper read - ers , which can be drawn out in successive lengths like a telescope and with a little ingenuity and persistence can be made to run forever .

		If Mr.
Symon	PERSON	had not assured us that the novel is too short , we should never have discovered the fact for ourselves .

		Nowadays trilogies appear to be decidedly the thing among the younger writers and many of the outstanding works of the day have the bulk of `` The Brothers Karamazov , '' if not that of `` War and Peace . ''

		When you consider the substance , they are often unforgiv - ably long and of an exquisite tedium .

		They abuse the privileges of the confessional by fail - ing to respect its natural limitations .

		Yet there has been little complaint , and one is driven to accept Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's explanation that a provi - dent public likes its money 's worth when it comes to fiction .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has acted on that assumption and so has Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	often dis - astrously .

		In fact , it would never occur to anyone to suppose that the publishers were put - ting on the screws or exercising any coercive force whatever on the creative imagination .

		If one considers the commercial novel , then the no - tion of the publishers that `` a very convenient length for a novel is 75,000 words , '' is certainly not far amiss .

		Here there is no question of art at all , but simply of so many hours of `` escape '' from reality and so much bulk in the traveling - bag ; and 75,000 words is surely ample .

		If some sort of mechanical check were not imposed and every ego were allowed to expand to the limits of tenuity , sensible people would soon ask to be excused from inflicting gratuitous boredom on themselves .

		WHEN GREAT
BRITAIN	LOCATION	DECLARED WAR a certain Canadian critic prophesied `` business as usual ex - cept in cut flowers , jewelry , and music . ''

		The prediction was sound .

		First of all
Canada	LOCATION	de - nied herself tournees , sacrificed her one symphony orchestra , and abandoned the hope of opera .

		A tacit moratorium protected all who had rashly subscribed to any artistic enterprise ; luxuries must be done without .

		Now we across the line , being at war , prove once more that the arts are in no way native amongst us , but are house guests , for whose support , if they lack the tact to withdraw , we can no longer be responsible .

		Thus early in the season there are rumors of more than the conventional deficits in opera and of orchestras hard put to it by the curtailment of their usual tour revenues .

		As for the theatre , it is said that
New York	LOCATION	has already seen that is , has already gone without seeing some fifty failures .

		We can well believe that most of the fifty deserved no better , but we can not therefore congratulate ourselves on any sudden reforma - tion of American taste .

		For Americans are also denying themselves the better dramatic fare pro- vided by the little theatres .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, for instance , where for six years
Maurice Browne	PERSON	has somehow maintained a genuinely artistic stage , the seventh year discovers a social mora - torium under which so many of the subscriptions toward his current season have been cancelled that he is forced to close and withdraw .

		This deprivation would be tolerable if it were a real war sacrifice , reluctantly made ; but , with a very few exceptions , the perfunctory letters of can - cellation betray a more than patriotic alacrity in abnegation .

		The war comes as a convenient ex - cuse for redevoting ourselves to the more con - genial maintenance of `` business as usual . ''

		Other peoples may inexplicably crave such decorations as good music and significant drama , achieve them with difficulty , and surrender them grudg - ingly : we Americans , thank God , are made of sterner stuff ; we can take the arts fashionably if we must , and we can leave them alone again as soon as decently we may .

		The strenuous necessities of life we must have ; but the lux - uries of aesthetic feeling , of disciplined thinking , of beautiful expression these are elegances we can still do without .

		* WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE LETTERS from the young men of our new army , showing the spirit in which they have taken up a task that was alien to all their earlier thoughts or hopes .

		They are inspiring letters , full of a manly cheerfulness and the feeling of comradeship ; almost never is there a word of complaint or a hint of reluctance to meet unfamiliar demands and to sink individual purposes in the common purpose .

		There is , on the other hand , an eagerness to take advantage of 34 THE DIAL -LSB-

		See the chapter on
Chicago	LOCATION	, page 43 , `` Your United States , '' by
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	It is recognized throughout the country that we earned this reputation because we have on hand at all times a more complete assortment of the books of all publishers than can be found on the shelves of any other book - dealer in the entire
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is of interest and importance to all bookbuyers to know that the books reviewed and advertised in this magazine can be procured from us with the least possible delay .

		We invite you to visit our store when in
Chicago	LOCATION	, to avail your - self of the opportunity of looking over the books in which you are most interested , or to call upon us at any time to look after your book wants .


Special Library Service	ORGANIZATION	We conduct a department devoted entirely to the interests of Public Libraries , Schools , Colleges and Universities .

		Our Library De - partment has made a careful study of library requirements , and is equipped to handle all library orders with accuracy , efficiency and despatch .

		`` If I were a commu - nist , '' writes one , `` my happiness would be com - plete .

		We are , in fact , communists , and even the fudge which a sweetheart sends belongs to the squad , if not to the whole barracks .

		And as for uniformity , it regulates every detail , even to the way the spare shoes are placed under the carefully aligned cots , and the nine inches of top sheet turned back over the blanket .

		When I was a civilian and a student and utterly irrespon - sible on both counts my greatest concern was to satisfy my conscience for cutting classes , and to find some means for filling up the time between
midnight	TIME	and bed-time with something less bore - some than drinking black coffee at
Franks	PERSON	's while debating the merits of this best of all possible worlds .

		Now my greatest worry is lest some new order absorb what time I call my own , or some additional regulation prescribe the use and stow - age of some as yet unregulated part of my belong - ings .

		THE DIAL Si jFottniff & tty Journal of Criticism and 2Dtecu00ion of literature ano War 's
Heritage to Youth Pierre de Lanux	ORGANIZATION	is the ambassador of a group of ideas and tendencies , in their infancy before the war , and still at the awkward age where they have to be loved a little before they can be understood at all .

		His `` Young
France	LOCATION	and New Amer - ica '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- will for the first time bring to the attention of many people in this country a certain question over which our own writers have long been meditating , without being able to arrive at very definite conclusions .

		He has in mind , if I am not mistaken , a sort of conquest of the world carried out by the common ac - tion of the young people of all nations .

		Conquest , I say ; I mean rather the slough - ing off of the old skin of society , the con - scious and deliberate formulation of a new way of living , a new way of seeing life and arranging its conditions .

		Let us say that industrialism has de - veloped among the nations a certain community of experience , and that this community of experience has in turn given birth to certain universal desires , emo - tions , hopes , ideas , and plans , universal , yes , even in the face of the war .

		Well , M. de Lanux constantly touches upon this group of desires , emotions , hopes , ideas , and plans .

		The writers from whom he quotes , the leaders of the young French intellectual class during the twentieth cen - tury , have ardently expressed perhaps the greater part of them .

		Is it necessary to mention
Verhaeren	PERSON	, for example , a `` good European '' if there ever was one , the spokesman of modern humanity ?

		And behind Verhaeren there is Whitman , whose influence on the French literature of to-day , M. de Lanux says , may well be called decisive .

		What do they portend , these writers , if it is not a heightened common consciousness in all who are still young enough in spirit to harbor generous hopes for civilization , a common aim lead - ing them to struggle for a world that is able to keep and use the whole of its cre - ative energy ?

		I do not mean that M. de Lanux devel - ops this general idea .

		But it is , I believe , the matrix of his argument .

		And it im - plies that if we are to develop this common aim , if we are to unite in this common pro- gramme , it is of the highest importance for us to understand the unique conditions that hamper the creative life in each individual country .

		What we want is the fullest and the freest expression of every people along the lines of its own genius , for it is of the nature of the creative spirit that its mani - festations can not conflict with one another and that the more various they are the richer and the more harmonious life becomes .

		That is why
M. de Lanux	ORGANIZATION	, in selecting certain of our writers to trans - late into French , says that the more genu - inely American they are the more
France	LOCATION	will be inclined to welcome them .

		Now , there is something so disinter - ested and so beneficent in the French spirit and we feel so keenly our debt to it at the present time that we are much more dis - posed to be virtuous for
France	LOCATION	's sake than for the beautiful eyes of virtue itself .

		If M. de Lanux tells us that his country - men are certain to rejoice in the work of
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	, whose `` muse essentially belongs to
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, and knows no other shores , '' adding that `` that is pre - cisely why we shall be glad to welcome her , '' is it not the simplest of all deduc - tions that we ought to set to work imme - diately producing as many poets as the homely muse of
America	LOCATION	can be induced to yield ?

		I say this lightly because I want to take advantage of the present French alliance that seems to appeal so strongly to the common sense of the average American of the dominant class .

		In point of fact , of course , it implies a complete reorientation of American life .

		This of itself the average American of the domi - 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	nant class could never be brought to con - template .

		But how far would he not be reconciled to it if he were obliged to see that it is merely the logical outcome of his own loyalties in the war and that the more closely he draws to any of the societies of
Europe	LOCATION	the more he will have to surrender the baser elements of his own American - ism ?

		We speak of the obligations the war has laid upon us .

		Have we in fact begun to realize how grave they are ?

		We say that the time has come for us to play our part among the societies of the world .

		But we do not yet see that this means infinitely more than `` men , money , and ships , '' that it requires nothing less than a mobiliza - tion of new , characteristic , and unique forces for the universal contest between darkness and light .

		Let us say that , thanks largely to our isolation , the spirit of our life in the past has been innocent of many of those baser elements in European life that produced the war .

		Let us say this if we find it comforting , for it is true .

		But what have we to put beside those finer ele - ments in European life that the war has not been able to destroy and that are even now giving birth to whatever the future seems to hold of promise for the human spirit ?

		A great deal , I should say , but little indeed in presentable form .

		That is what enables our unkinder critics to assert , with a certain air of plausibility , that we really have nothing at all .

		We have been a primitive people , faced with an all but impossible task .

		But is it not abundantly evident now that we have accomplished this task and that most of the customs we developed in the process of meeting it have long since passed into the limbo of `` good customs that corrupt the world '' ?

		The struggle that has hith - erto engaged us has been a struggle not between the more creative and the less cre - ative in man , but between man and nature , and the impulse that has determined it has come not from the pressure of humane desires within , but from the existence , the allure , and the eventual decay of material opportunities outside .

		The resultant char - acter of our civilization we know too well .

		Like children whistling in the dark , we reassure one another that we like it and find it good .

		How simple we are !

		How little we know of the realities that our unconscious life reveals to the least expe - rienced observer !

		Have we never tried to explain to ourselves that weary , baffled expression one sees in so many thousand middle-aged American faces , typical American faces , `` successful '' faces , the faces of bewildered men like Mr.
Henry Ford	PERSON	?

		Has it never occurred to us to com - pare Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's face with Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's recent career ?

		I think , indeed , one could hardly find a more perfect symbol of American life in the present decade than Mr.
Ford	PERSON	pre - sents Mr.
Ford	PERSON	and his millions and his peace ship and the total failure of these elements to coalesce in any effective purpose .

		If , therefore , we are dreaming of a national culture , it is because our characteristic idealism has itself forced the issue .

		The gifts we possess are unique gifts , but of what avail are these gifts if we have no technique that enables them to find their mark ?

		And what sort of technique will ever do this that has not arisen out of a consciousness of those gifts , that is not peculiar as they are peculiar and so adapted as to make them yield their fullest value ?

		We want to share in the higher life of the world , and we are inca - pable of doing so because we have no organized higher life of our own .

		Could there be a more unmistakable demand for just that release , that synthesis of the creative energies of the younger genera - tion which
M. de Lanux	ORGANIZATION	proposes and which the younger generation itself de - sires more deeply even than it knows ?

		An organized higher life that is to say , in the first place , a literature fully aware of the difficulties of the American situation and able , in some sense , to meet them .

		For poets and novelists and critics are the pathfinders of society ; to them be - longs the vision without which the people perish .

		Our literature in the past has failed to produce sufficient minds capable of taking that supreme initiative ; in con - sequence , it has fallen by its own weight under the chaos of our life .

		But for this it has not only the best of excuses , it has also at least one striking precedent .

		Could there be a stranger parallel to the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 state of our literature to-day than the state of German literature in
1795	DATE	, as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	describes it in the following words : ``
Germany	LOCATION	is absolutely devoid of any central point of social culture , where authors might asso - ciate with one another and develop themselves by following , each in his own special branch , one aim , one common purpose .

		Born in places far remote from each other , educated in all manner of ways , dependent as a rule upon themselves alone and upon the impressions of widely different surround - ings ; carried away by a predilection in favor of this or that example of native or foreign litera - ture , driven to all kinds of attempts , nay , even blunders , in their endeavor to test their own pow - ers without proper guidance ; brought to the con - viction , gradually and only after much reflection , that they ought to adopt a certain course , and taught by practice what they can actually do ; ever and anon confused and led astray by a large public devoid of taste and ready to swallow the bad with the same relish with which it has previously swal - lowed the good is there any German writer of note who does not recognize himself in this picture , and who will not acknowledge with modest regret the many times that he has sighed for the oppor - tunity of subordinating at an earlier stage of his career the peculiarities of his original genius to a general national culture , which , alas !

		was nowhere to be found ?

		For the development of the higher classes by other moral influences and foreign liter - ature , despite the great advantage which we have derived therefrom , has nevertheless hindered the Germans , as Germans , from developing themselves at an earlier stage . ''

		How keenly our conscientious writers of the older generation must have experi - enced that regret , those , I mean , who have never quite submitted to the complacent colonialism that has marked so much of our culture in the past !

		But , unfortu - nately , they have left no testimonies behind them .

		They have considered it so much an obligation to justify American life merely as American life that they have glossed their own tragedies , not real - izing perhaps that in this way they have glossed also the failure of those higher aims that they themselves were born to represent .

		`` Not the fruit of expe - rience , but experience itself , is the end . ''

		That is the essential European doctrine , and it is because Europeans value life as such that so great a part of their vital energy goes into the production of minds capable of heightening that value , minds that are able to keep the ball of life roll - ing in the sight and to the glory of all .

		But that was not the doctrine of our for - bears ; quite the contrary , indeed .

		In con - sequence , the writers of the younger generation inherit all the difficulties of their elders , and at compound interest .

		For the intellectual life is sustained by the emotional life ; in order to react vig - orously against one 's environment one must in some degree have been emotion - ally nurtured by it .

		Our gifted minds lack too generally a certain sort of character without which talent is altogether fickle and fugitive ; but what is this character if it is not the accumulated assurance , the spiritual force that results from preceding generations of effort along the lines toward which talent directs us ?

		Profes - sor
Bruckner	PERSON	points out in his history of Russian literature that `` the direct transi - tion from uncultured strata to strenuous mental activity is wont to avenge itself : the individual succumbs sooner or later to the unwonted burden . ''

		And as for us young people , how often do we not wear ourselves out constructing the preliminary platform without which it is impossible to create anything !

		We have so few ideals given us that the facts of our life do not instantly belie .

		Is it strange , therefore , that we have , unlike the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	, no student class united in a com - mon discipline and forming a sort of nat - ural breeding ground for the leadership that we desire ?

		Nevertheless , a class like this we must have , and there are , I think , many signs that such a class is rapidly coming into existence .

		To begin with , the sudden con - traction of the national cultures of
Europe	LOCATION	during the war , owing to which many cur - rents of thought , formerly shared by all , have been withdrawn as it were from circulation , has thrown us unexpectedly back upon ourselves .

		How many drafts we have issued in the past upon European thought , unbalanced by any investment of our own !

		The younger generation have come to feel this obligation acutely .

		At the same time they have been taught to speak a certain language in common by the social movements of the last twenty years .

		Acquainted through study and travel with ranges of human possibility which their ancestors were able to contem - plate only in the abstract , they feel that the time has come to explore these possi - bilities and to test them out on our own 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	soil .

		They see that we Americans have never so much as dreamed of a radically more beautiful civilization , our Utopias having been so generally of the nature of
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	's , complex and ingenious mechanisms , liberating the soul into a vac - uum of ennui .

		They see that it is art and literature which give the soul its higher values and make life worthy of interces - sion , and that every effective social revo - lution has been led up to and inspired by visionary leaders who have shown men what they might become and what they miss in living as they do .

		`` Thought , '' according to one of the greatest of modern philosophers , `` is strong enough to disturb the sense of satisfaction with nature ; it is too weak to construct a new world in opposition to it . ''

		Only desire can do this , they feel , these Americans of the new age ; that is what separates them not only from our traditional leaders , but also from our awakeners , the pragmatists , who are so busily unfolding the social order of which they form an integral part .

		They feel this , I say ; they feel it very deeply .

		How deeply they desire another
America	LOCATION	, not like the
America	LOCATION	of to-day , grande et riche , mals desordonnee , as Tur - geniev said of
Russia	LOCATION	, but harmonious and beneficent , a great
America	LOCATION	that knows how to use the finest of its gifts !

		Is there in this fact any promise for the future ?

		... Who can say ?

		So many of the best minds of our own younger generation have al - ready , owing to the aridity of our cultural soil , fallen victims to the creeping paralysis of the mechanistic view of life !

		So many , more poetically endowed , have lost them - selves in a confused and feeble anarchism !

		So few Americans are able even to imag - ine what it means to be employed by civil - ization !

		Certainly no true social revolution will ever be possible in this country till a race of artists , profound and sincere , have brought us face to face with our own experience and set working in that expe - rience the leaven of the highest culture .

		For it is exalted desires that give their validity to revolutions , and exalted desires take form only in exalted souls .

		But has there ever been a time when masses of men have conceived these desires without leaders ' appearing to formulate them and press them home ?

		We are lax now , too lax , because we do not realize the respon - sibility that lies upon us , each in the meas - ure of his own gift .

		Is it imaginable , however , that as time goes on and side by side with other nations we come to see the inadequacy of our own , we shall fail to rise to the gravity of our situation and recreate , out of the sublime heritage of human ideals , a new synthesis adaptable to the unique conditions of our life ?

COLUM	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 51 The Rhythms of Free Verse An artist works intuitively ; a scientist deliber - ately .

		Yet there seems no reason why each should not recognize the value of the other 's method .

		The long quarrel between artist and scientist is based upon a misconception .

		Neither opponent understands the peculiar language of the other well enough to see when they are say - ing the same thing .

		The more ignorant artists exclaim at the desecration of analysis ; the more unimaginative scientists recoil from what appears to them the illogical and vague mind : processes by which the artist gains his end .

		But let us forget the quarrel ; let us see what can be done when sympathy takes the place of hostility , and let us bear in mind a simple and incontrovertible fact ; namely , that science is merely proven truth .

		I have been a good deal amused lately to read in many of the reviews of Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's book , `` The Rhythm of Prose '' -LRB-
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , that the author has finally disposed of the claims of vers libre to be con - sidered as poetry , and that my theories in particu - lar have hereby suffered a total eclipse .

		This would undoubtedly be an unfortunate thing for me if it were true .

		The facts , however , are quite otherwise .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	and I are not at variance , but perfectly in accord ; and for a year we have been working together to prove , not my theories or his , but the facts .

		It is true that the sun has not yet risen in this first book , `` The Rhythm of Prose , '' but the clouds are beginning to disperse !

		and in his next book , which I believe he is to call `` The Making of Verse , '' there is a good chance that they may be swept away altogether .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has given me leave to state his new theories in this paper .

		But , before doing so , I must first state his fundamen - tal bases and mine , in order that our final agreement may be fully understood .

		In the first place , it should be clearly recog - nized that Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	does not use the words `` verse '' and `` poetry '' as interchangeable terms .

		I speak advisedly , for I charged him with a too narrow conception of `` poetry '' and asked him if he considered metrical verse to be its proper vehicle .

		To my relief , he disclaimed any such idea , and explained that he had carefully used the word `` verse '' throughout his book , never `` poetry '' in that connection .

		This proved at the outset the refreshing accuracy of the scientific mind .

		We are so likely to consider the two words as interchangeable that the distinction has become blurred to the average person .

		The man who could write `` by listening for rhythm in irregular sequences , in the criss-cross lapping of many waves upon the shore , in the syncopating cries of a flock of birds , in the accelerating and retarding quivers of a wind-blown tree , we have found a new form of pleasure , '' knows very well what poetry is .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's theory of prose and verse rhythm as set forth in this first book is very simple to state , but immensely difficult to have conceived .

		It is , briefly , that in `` verse '' the rhythm is what he calls `` coincident '' ; in `` prose '' it is `` syncopated . ''

		This result is achieved through a system of tapping .

		For instance , repeat ``
Mary	PERSON	had a Little Lamb , '' and at the same time tap the rhythm of the stressed syllables with your finger on a table .

		It will be found that the tappings and the stressed syllables exactly coincide .

		Now tap again and read any prose passage you like while you are doing it .

		You will find that the syllables and stresses come every which way , sometimes on the beat , it is true , but more often before or after it , either directly between two taps or at varying distances from one or the other .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has made a great number of experiments with a number of subjects , and his main theory would seem to be absolutely proved .

		His object to show that verse -LRB- really metrical verse -RRB- and prose have a different mechanical base , but that prose also has its rhythm or rhythms he has certainly achieved .

		So far so good , but it is not the whole of the story .

		At the conclusion of the chapter on vers libre in the first edition of `` The Rhythm of Prose , '' is this sentence : `` On the whole , however , the message will always be blunted for those ` timers ' who feel , in reading or hearing these productions , the disquieting experience of attempting to dance up the side of a mountain .

		For those who find this task exhilarating , vers libre , as a form , is without a rival . ''

		It is significant that this pas - sage was omitted from the second edition .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	calls `` timers '' those people who have `` an aggressive time sense '' ; people who have no difficulty in performing complicated tasks of syncopation , and who are capable of holding in their minds a psychologic beat from which they may depart at moments by accelera - 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	tion or retardation , or by sublimating such beat into images , etc. , and yet of holding constantly to the unexpressed rhythm .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has named this psychological beat the `` unitary pulse . ''

		Where the suppressed passage ran thoroughly wrong was just in the premise that an `` aggres - sive timer '' would feel discomfort in tracking the rhythms of vers libre , the fact being that only an `` aggressive timer '' can properly interpret these subtle and various rhythms .

		The mistake came in overvaluing syllabic import .

		Metrical verse , being based upon accent , has everything to do with the counting of syllables .

		Prose , con - taining as it does so many rhythms in a single page , even in a single paragraph , may very well be termed `` syncopated '' as far as syllables are concerned , but it , too , is based upon `` cadence , '' or rather `` cadences , '' for it is just here that it differs from vers libre .

		The returning cadence unit of vers libre has slight counterpart with the changing cadences of even the most rhythmic prose .

		Where the vers libre poem as a whole keeps to a single recurring psychological beat , the prose page or chapter conforms to no unit .

		A passage of prose divorced from its content may sound like a section of a vers libre poem ; but , if it be taken with what goes before and after , the uniformity is lost .

		So long ago as
March 1914	DATE	I wrote an article on `` Vers Libre and Metrical Prose , '' in which I endeavored to prove the difference of `` curve '' in vers libre and even the most rhythmical prose .

		Having neither the psychological training nor the apparatus , I was obliged to rely entirely upon my intuition .

		I felt cadence as a line rising to a certain height and then dropping away to mount again , farther on .

		I called this rising and falling line a `` curve . ''

		In a letter to me , written
last winter	DATE	after one of our experiments , Dr.
Patter	PERSON	- son says : `` It is interesting , first of all , to find that the measurements made from the film on which are recorded your readings of vers libre cadences prove that you possess an unusually accurate time-sense . ''

		Then , after a reference to another poem and an explanation that the figures refer to the inter - vals between the chief accents , he continues : `` Cadence from `
Thompson	PERSON	's Lunch Room ' : 14-15-21-18 The cadence from `
Thompson	PERSON	's Lunch Room ' is also suggestive of syncopating experience , but it is dis - tinctly more subtle .

		The interval 14 rises gently to 15 , then violently to 21 , after which it rebounds to a moderate 18 .

		The curve of progression might be drawn as follows A series of such progressions could possibly be taken as the basis for your feelings of vers libre cadence . ''

		We see therefore that intuition may some - times hit upon a fact , without realizing exactly how such a conclusion is reached .

		I did not meet Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	until after the publication of his first edition .

		We were brought together - by a common friend who felt that we were working toward the same end , but with apparent hostility .

		I confess that I went to this meeting with misgiving .

		I feared to find Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	so wedded to a theory that nothing would induce him to forgo a tittle of his attitude .

		I was wrong .

		I found an open-minded man who cared more for truth than for anything else , who had not an ounce of vanity , and who was chock full of artistic feeling .

		A man who reacted keenly to music and poetry , and whose sympathy and perception made the whole discussion a de - light instead of a labor .

		I told Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	that with his main con - tention in the chapter on vers libre that there is no tertium quid between prose and regular verse I was in perfect accord .

		I insisted that none of the better instructed vers libristes had ever held such an opinion , but that we took our stand from
Paul Fort	PERSON	's dictum , `` Prose and verse are but one instrument graduated . ''

		Of course , Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	could hardly concur with this view , and noting that he has carefully defined `` verse '' as `` regular verse '' his point undoubtedly holds .

		Of course , one might be said to gradu - ate from `` syncopation '' to `` coincidence , '' but that is merely to confuse the issue .

		From the exact scientific analysis of Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	, we find `` regular verse '' to be based upon a rhythmic conception quite other than that of prose .

		Still
Paul Fort	PERSON	's phrase held good for a form of poetry founded upon a different scheme from that of metrical verse .

		Upon a verse built upon cadence , in short .

		What was cadence ?

		How did the cadences of vers libre differ from those of prose ?

		I did not know .

		I could feel it , could illustrate by examples , but of course this was too personal to warrant a scientific deduction 's being drawn from it .

		But Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	was immensely interested .

		He arranged to set up his sound-photographing machine , which had
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 been taken down , in order that we might make some experiments .

		I found out that he had never heard vers libre read by an expert , and I well know how it can be garbled by a poor ren - dering .

		That first day we experimented with two examples only , the passage from one of my own poems given above and `` H.D. '' 's `` Oread . ''

		I read both poems into the machine several times , and then , at Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's desire , I repeated the poems to myself , pronouncing the syllable `` tah '' aloud on the chief accents .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	then gave me certain tests which proved me to be `` aggressively rhythmic , '' and permitted me a certain right to say `` I feel . ''

		This was satis - factory as far as it went , but the result was all to be found .

		The films would have to be developed and the intervals measured .

		I returned to
Boston	LOCATION	and shortly afterwards received the letter from Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	of which I have already spoken .

		The result of his measurements of the passage from my own poem , I have given .

		The measurements of `` H.D. '' 's `` Oread '' were as follows : '' ` The
Oread	ORGANIZATION	' : -LRB- intervals between chief accents given in tenths of a second , roughly estimated -RRB- .

		13-22-15-24-13-13-19-13-15-13 The recurrence or ` return ' of 13/10 sec .

		as the interval length in five cases in the `
Oread	ORGANIZATION	' is quite remarkable , and seems to indicate that you had in your mind an exact interval which you increased or retarded twice by 1/5 sec .

		-LRB- giving intervals 15/10 sec .

		in length -RRB- , and three times by from 3/5 to 11/10 sec .

		-LRB- giving one interval as long as 24/10 sec . -RRB-

		You must tell me exactly what you think about the significance of the figures .

		This much , at least , seems clear .

		The opening sequence of four inter - vals : 13-22-15-24 involves acceleration and retarding of an obviously irregular nature .

		As soon , however , as we strike the 5th intervals , ` return ' is evident in the presence of
' 13	DATE	, ' which interval-size dominates conspicuously the rest of the passage , and so suggests at once coincident and therefore typical ` verse experience . '

		The opening sequence , on the other hand , could hardly suggest anything else but syncopating and therefore ` prose experience . ' ''

		That the reader may understand what this means , I will print here `` Oread '' broken up into time units .

		It will be seen at once that the form is non-syllabic , in that the chief accents come after a greater or lesser number of sylla - bles .

		The units conform in time allowing for the slight acceleration and retardation of the unitary pulse , guided by an artistic instinct but not in syllabic quantity .

		Whirl up / sea / Whirl / your pointed pines / Splash / your great pines / on our rocks / Hurl / your green over us / Cover us / with your pools / of fir .

		/ It was immediately after this that Dr.
Pat	PERSON	- terson published the second edition of his `` Rhythm of Prose . ''

		In the preface to this new edition , Dr.
Pat	PERSON	- terson referred to our experiments , and added the conclusions to be drawn from them .

		As his diction , however , is a little difficult of compre - hension , I will quote the concluding paragraph of the letter already referred to so often .

		It contains the gist of the preface , and is expressed in simpler language .

		`` My own decision at this date ,
February 12 , 1917	DATE	, a decision which depends partly upon my having heard you read with such tremendous effect bits of your own free verse , is that the spell of vers libre is at its best when syncopating experience pre - dominates when the ` cadences ' follow each other in the magical manner and with the occult balance of good prose .

		Is there then no difference between such ` unrhymed cadence ' as you have written and good prose ?

		Yes , I am ready to admit what I have not admitted before .

		There is at times , not always , a difference ; but it is a difference not of kind , but of degree .

		The separate spacing of the phrases , whether printed or orally delivered , puts emphasis upon the rhythmic balancing as such .

		It keeps us from for - getting it when we see the phrases , first of all .

		On the other hand , when we hear them spoken by another , we detect this suggested emphasis on the speaker 's part upon a sequence of balances which might readily be blurred , both for him and for us , were the text from which he reads printed in the solid blocks of ordinary prose . ''

		I quite agree with Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	that `` vers libre is at its best when syncopating experience predominates . ''

		In my `` Tendencies in Modern American Poetry , '' I spoke of
Richard Alding	PERSON	- ton 's and `` H.D. '' 's practice of vers libre as always following the syncopating experience .

		These poets arrived at their conclusions quite independently , and I remember an animated dis - cussion of the subject which I had with them in the
summer of 1914	DATE	.

		This is again a proof of the intuitive working of the artist 's mind , fol - lowed more slowly by the accurate foot by foot advance of the scientist .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's preface goes on to say : `` Miss
Lowell	PERSON	delivers her vers libre with much more swing and vim than one commonly hears in prose ; but surely all particularly vigorous prose , if it is to be valued as a fit medium for vigorous thought and feeling , must also be thus delivered . ''

		This has seemed to the reviewers a negation of my attitude .

		It is no such thing .

		I have always maintained that oratory , being impas - sioned speech , is therefore exceedingly rhythmi - cal , for it is well known that all emotion tends 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	to become rhythmic .

		The rhythms of oratory differ from those of vers libre principally in being so diverse .

		That is , in having no definite time unit for the whole speech .

		It is a fact that vers libre may change its time units several times in a long poem , but these changes fall into sections , a device long practiced in metrical verse where the metre often varies .

		For instance ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's `` Church of Brou '' has three sections and in each section is a change of metre .

		In other metrical poems , changes of metre occur in alternate stanzas , or even at irregular intervals .

		So many examples may be given that I will leave my readers to think of them for themselves .

		It is undoubtedly Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's calling vers libre `` spaced prose , '' which has led reviewers to prophesy my immediate demise .

		And yet Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has carefully , if astringently , explained his use of the term , not only in the preface , but in a paragraph which he has added to the chapter on vers libre .

		He says : `` A word , finally , must be added as to terminology .

		When regular prose becomes consistently emotional , whether through richness of tone-color , abundance of images , or conspicuous ` return ' of certain prose re - frains , such as we find in
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's repeti - tion of ` sweetness and light ' or De Quincey 's ` Fanny and the rose in
June	DATE	, ' all we need is to space the phrases on separate lines in order to obtain some - thing which is not to be distinguished from the best ` free verse . '

		This resulting experience is different from that obtained from ordinary prose in that the spacing serves to focus our attention upon the rhythm as rhythm ; but , in spite of this self-consciousness and its emotional consequences , our ` glorified ' prose still remains a kind of prose .

		What shall we call it ?

		Since all prose has its rhythmic possibilities , ` rhyth - mic prose ' is as misleading a name as vers libre .

		Rhythmically self-conscious ` spaced prose ' is an un - inviting but fairly accurate description of it in its more inspired manifestations , such as abound in the work of Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	. ''

		This last sentence should have proved to the critics that Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	was in no way hostile to the results obtained by the freer forms ; and it must never be forgotten that he is concerned in this book with rhythm only , and that he is juxtaposing , by means of his tapping experi - ments , prose and `` regular verse , '' that is metrical verse .

		The word `` prose , '' in his `` spaced prose , '' has no more significance as far as poetry is con - cerned than the `` prose '' in my own `` polyphonic prose . ''

		He uses `` prose '' because of the syncopa - tion involved in vers libre ; I used `` prose '' because of the typical form in which `` polyphonic prose '' is printed .

		In neither case does it imply an absence of `` poetry '' in the forms concerned , for once more let me call the reader 's attention to Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's strict denial of the identification of `` verse '' and `` poetry , '' in his use of these terms .

		The preface to the second edition is dated
March 31 , 1917	DATE	.

		So we may take the above as Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's theories up to that date .

		But nine months have passed since then , and much progress has been made beyond the standpoint taken in that edition .

		Independently of Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	, I continued to study the rhythms of vers libre as well as I could with no testing apparatus .

		My endeav - ors to beat time to vers libre poems led to the discovery that every poem had a more or less consistent beat .

		That the accents were , of course , determined by the sense ; but that in accepting or rejecting words , the poet was guided by the necessity of having his beat fall con - sistently with this sense .

		It could not come upon connecting words , for instance , like `` and '' or `` the . ''

		Of course , I had always known this subconsciously , but now I began to analyze it consciously .

		I also found that some poems , although apparently read as slowly as others , had a much faster beat .

		What determined this beat ?

		It must be some psychological time unit in the poet 's mind .

		For years I had been searching the unit of vers libre , the ultimate particle to which the rhythm of this form could be reduced .

		As the `` foot '' is the unit of `` regular verse , '' so there must be a unit in vers libre .

		I thought I had found it .

		The unit was a measurement of time .

		The syllables were unimportant , in the sense that there might be many or few to the time interval .

		The form being therefore non-syllabic , Dr.
Pat	PERSON	- terson 's system of tapping seemed not to apply .

		But in setting aside his system , I was wrong , as we shall see .

		In
May	DATE	, I again saw Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	, and again read into his sound-photographing machine .

		I also told him my time unit discovery , and read several poems to a metronome .

		The reading did not , in every case , exactly follow the metronomic swing , but the variance was so slight as to be accounted for by the natural acceleration and retardation of the artistic impulse .

		Dr.
Pat	PERSON	- terson has dealt with this variation from a strict time unit in his chapter on `` The Sense of Swing , '' where he says : `` But surely the sense of swing means nothing unless it be a sense of progressive movement .

		When a melody is played in strict , unvarying metronome time , swing is at its lowest , and the ` psychological moment ' for an accent is merely a matter of remembering that two and two make four .

		What is usually meant by swing is really ` elastic ' swing , where the simple mathematical relations are complicated for purposes
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 55 of expression .

		Compensation figures conspicuously .

		Time stolen in one place , is repaid in another .

		What
Reimann	PERSON	calls ` agogic accent ' -LRB- the deliberate addition of length to a note , instead of stress in order to give it prominence -RRB- and , of course , tempo rubato -LRB- stolen time -RRB- , belong to this category ; so , though it does not seem to be generally remembered , all effects due to accelerating and retarding the standard tempo ... Varying rates of speed , in a broad and general sense , need now to be distinguished from the specific form in which they can appear as ` Progressive motion , ' which means nothing more than varying rates of speed in which the variation is roughly spoken of as ` gradual , ' and more accurately as occurring accord - ing to some law of progressive increase or decrease .

		An interval , for instance , of at first one second , is shortened by one tenth of a second , successively , until it becomes three tenths of a second , after which it is lengthened by similar steps until it reaches its former size .

		This would be a case of rapidly progressing acceleration and retarding .

		The rate of decrease in the interval could be expressed by a mathematical equation .

		Another equation could express the retard - ing movement .

		The number of ways in which an interval could become progressively shorter is , of course , infinite .

		The point to keep clear is that every ` gradual ' -LRB- i.e. , not jerky -RRB- progression , such as is plainly implied in what we mean by swing , must be subject to some law , instinctively felt , no matter how difficult to phrase .

		The ` sense of swing , ' then , would mean the ability to move according to pro- gressive laws , however occult . ''

		I again saw Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	in
September	DATE	, and the results he had then reached commanded my instant admiration and acceptance .

		Working on the possibility of a time unit , he had come to the conclusion that there were really several forms of vers libre .

		These he determined by a combination of time tests and tapping experi - ments .

		One was the `` spaced prose '' which he had cited in the second edition of `` The Rhythm of Prose '' ; another , a more obviously rhythmic form , which he has named `` unitary verse '' be - cause it conforms to a satisfying time unit ; while still a third is marked by an alternation of prose and verse experience .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	defines seven distinct groups , starting from metri - cal verse , in a paper prepared for the meeting of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	held at
New Haven	LOCATION	in
December	DATE	.

		In the bulletin of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	his paper is listed as follows : `` An attempt at a sharper analysis of verse and prose .

		Seven types : -LRB- 1 -RRB- ` metrical verse , ' in which the effect of a repeated stress-pattern is in evidence ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- ` unitary verse , ' in which equal time-intervals -LRB- marked by chief accents and filled in with a quite variable number of less accented syllables -RRB- form a satisfying succession of units ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- ` polyphonic prose , ' in which tone-color patterns are more in evidence than in ordinary prose ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- ` spaced prose , ' in which the balancing of broader groupings in prose rhythm is accentuated by printing the phrases on separate lines ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- ` fluid prose , ' in which the rhythm as rhythm is less obvious than in ` spaced prose ' ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- ` mosaics , ' in which verse and prose , or several kinds of verse and prose , alternate successively ; and , finally , -LRB- 7 -RRB- ` blends , ' in which effects not commonly found to - gether are superimposed . ''

		Of these divisions , it is not necessary here to explain Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's use of `` metrical verse , '' `` unitary verse , '' `` polyphonic prose , '' or `` spaced prose . ''

		Everyone knows what the first is .

		The second and the fourth have been sufficiently noticed already in this article ; it is enough to say that in `` unitary verse '' the sense of swing is more marked than in `` spaced prose . ''

		The third has been so often analyzed as to need no farther explanation .

		By `` fluid prose , '' Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	means a highly stylistic and rhythmic prose , such as is found constantly in
Walter Pater	PERSON	's works , in which , however , the rhythm is not sufficiently conscious to warrant separate spacing for its phrases .

		`` Mosaics '' are those vers libre poems which are sometimes `` syncopated '' and some - times `` coincident . ''

		`` Blends '' are rare in Eng - lish practice .

		He regards `` polyphonic prose '' as practically the only English `` blend , '' but he has found other such forms in Sanskrit literature .

		As `` polyphonic prose '' employs all the rhythms of metrical verse , vers libre , `` fluid prose , '' and prose proper , so combined as to produce the im - pression of a constant weaving , and also affects its own movement by the use of rich timbre and `` return '' of thought and images , we see why it is a `` blend '' rather than a `` mosaic , '' in which verse experience and prose experience follow each other in sharply edged blocks .

		It should be observed that Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's groups differentiate carefully every possible form of rhythmic poetic experience , but that , if we employ the term as a defining artistic form , only three of them properly come under vers libre , These are `` unitary verse , '' under which head he places `` H.D. '' 's `` Oread '' ; `` spaced prose , '' which is illustrated by my own `` Reaping '' ; and `` mosaics , '' where he takes Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's `` Father Malloy '' as an example .

		Metrical verse on the one hand , `` polyphonic prose '' on the other , stand out as individual forms , while vers libre is another , subdivided again into three dis - tinguishable sections .

		`` Fluid prose '' is really a prose form -LRB- the others are really verse forms -RRB- ; but owing to its suitability for poetic content , Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has included it in his grouping .

		It is not very difficult to prove that the cadences of even the most highly developed `` fluid prose '' differ from those of true vers libre .

		I have already shown that `` fluid prose '' is built , not upon one unitary pulse , but upon many .

		To 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	go a step farther , it can easily be demonstrated that although certain single cadences of `` fluid prose '' may coincide with the cadences of vers libre , others , satisfying in their position in a `` fluid prose '' piece , would completely fail to satisfy in a vers libre poem .

		To illustrate , I will take this sentence from
Walter Pater	PERSON	which Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has used in so many of his tests : `` It is the landscape , not of dreams or of fancy , but of places far withdrawn , and hours selected from a thousand with a miracle of finesse . ''

		Leaving out the question of wording as not pertinent to the present discussion , we can hear , if we read the passage aloud , a strange jar be - tween its two halves .

		The first cadence ends with `` withdrawn . ''

		If the passage stopped here we should have a perfect vers libre cadence .

		But it does not stop ; it goes on , and how ?

		No new cadence , conforming to the original unitary pulse , is announced by `` and hours selected from a thousand . ''

		This reads , not like a second self - sustaining cadence , but like a continuation of one already partly completed , and yet the rhythm of the passage ending on `` withdrawn '' is so rounded and final that , read it as we will , we can not consider it incomplete .

		Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has tapped `` hours '' as two syllables , but whether it be taken as one or two , the objection remains .

		To make the passage fall into a perfect vers libre cadence , we should have to add some words to the second part ; for instance , we might say , `` and of hours carefully selected , '' etc. .

		.

		I admit that this spoils
Pater	PERSON	's sentence , but it adds the second cadence necessary to the beating of the unitary pulse .

		I fail to see how any thoughtful person can discard these divisions which Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	has been at such pains to discover .

		To me , they clear up much which had hitherto remained dark .

		For even in
France	LOCATION	, where more attention has been paid to the technique of the freer forms than in any other country , no experiments have been conducted with any such thoroughness , and no such far-reaching results have been achieved .

		Other books upon the subject appear as merely a brushing of the surface .

		For the ordinary reader , it is undoubtedly a pity that Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	's style is so technical and so devoid of explanatory additions .

		He takes no account of misunderstandings arising from the incorrect , but popular , use of words .

		He says exactly what he means , and expects his readers to approach his work with the same exactness .

		He announces that he is dealing with rhythm , and with rhythm only , and he does not allow for those persons who read into his study of rhythms a study of the whole content of poetry .

		Taken for what it is , a technical inquiry into the mechanism of rhythm , his book is a volume rich in knowledge and suggestion , and it must perforce augment , and in many ways supersede , all other textbooks on versification .

		The
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	paper stands as the nucleus of his next book , `` The Making of Verse . ''

		Together , the two treatises form a theory of rhythm more advanced than any heretofore suggested , and it is probable that they will come to be considered as definitive .

		The Structure of Lasting Peace VII .

		SOME PROBLEMS OF READJUSTMENT : CONTRIBUTIONS AND INDEMNITIES That the formula , `` no contributions , no indemnities , '' is sound economics any - body is bound to acknowledge who has read Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	's trenchant and convincing dissipation of the `` great illu - sion . ''

		But that it is sound psychology is itself an illusion .

		If it were sound psy - chology , wars would never be waged by nations , nor murders and thefts commit - ted by men .

		In the long run both are fore - doomed to economic failure and social scorn .

		Both recur , nevertheless , with such constancy and so typically as to be institu - tional to civilization .

		When defining the place of contributions and indemnities in the foundation of lasting peace , there - fore , it becomes more needful to regard their indirect influence on the mental states of the nations between whom they are to pass , than their direct influence upon national economies .

		Now it is significant that the formula against indemnities and contributions is a democratic and socialis - tic formula .

		It is heard in
Russia	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, not in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		And it comes from the mouths of those who are preoccupied with eco - nomic , not psychological , relationships .

		In terms of the latter , contributions and indemnities are of the same type of thing
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 as the pinch and blow of the childish bully .

		They constitute jointly and severally an immediate gratification of the sense of superiority , of the lust for power , regard - less of future consequences .

		They belong to the intoxicants , and although specious ratiocination may give the demand for them the appearance of a policy , they are , if history is to be trusted , the most impoli - tic thing a conqueror can undertake who wishes to hold his conquests with ease and permanence .

		`` Frightfulness '' is merely a nearer and directer view of the gratifica - tion of the same lusts .

		The problem of contributions and indemnities is at bottom the problem of the control and extirpation of these lusts .

		No doubt the democracies allied against
Germany	LOCATION	have them , but precisely because they are democracies , the lusts have their own counterpoise in the national mental states : the creation of the formula about contributions , indemnities , and annexations is sufficient proof .

		The lusts are most constitutional to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The German rule in
Belgium	LOCATION	and northern
France	LOCATION	, for example , has consisted of resurrecting and applying the imperial malpractice of the piratical empires of antiquity .

		This usage has established , in the attitude of the inhabitants of these lands , in their emo - tional set , a hatred toward
Germany	LOCATION	that is deep-rooted and permanent .

		Nothing short of complete extermination can miti - gate the blood-feud which has been cre - ated by the use of the levy and the corvee , the wanton and malicious destruction of property and of the self-respect of women and men .

		Any plan looking toward the permanent holding of these territories by
Germany	LOCATION	, or in case of their evacuation , any friendly relations between their gov - ernments and that of
Germany	LOCATION	after the war , would had it been guided by con - siderations of advantage and the lessons of history instead of sadistic vainglory have required a policy precisely the oppo - site of that adopted , particularly in the very beginnings of the occupation .

		The conspicuous absence of such a policy is symptomatic , and the terms of peace must be such as to remove the causes of the symptom .

		These causes are the German ruling class and the system of education they imposed upon the German masses .

		There are , hence , two sets of consider - ations for the peace conference to heed in the financial adjustments between the Ger - man government and people and the democratic powers .

		The first of these is of reparation for goods stolen and dam - age done .

		All levies should be returned , with interest at an appropriate rate .

		All forced labor should be paid for , at twice the market rate , because it was forced , with interest at an appropriate rate .

		For the murder of helpless civilians there can be no adequate compensation , but their dependents should receive a pension at the hands of the German nation .

		All prop - erty wantonly destroyed should be paid for , with an additional contribution for the absolute loss involved .

		The foregoing stipulations apply to matters individual and private , and the obligation of the Germans on both fronts is not without its analogue in the obliga - tions of the Russians in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The Germans , it is to be remembered how - ever , are the aggressors .

		Damage done is the direct consequence of their initial and malicious act .

		There is a type of funda - mental damage to which the technique of modern warfare compels the defenders also to contribute .

		Such is the damage suf - fered by the terrain of Champagne .

		The soil of that once beautiful and prosperous region has been literally shot away .

		Its subsoil is chalk , of the same formation as the unbearing chalk-cliffs of
England	LOCATION	.

		The latter have been barren from time imme - morial , and the Champagne region is likely to be so henceforth .

		Should this prove to be the case ,
France	LOCATION	has suffered a funda - mental damage , one that means for her an altered economy after the war .

		For this damage full payment is impossible , but that payment should be required , sufficient at least to ensure life and health and security to the natives of the region while their government helps their lives into new r channels , seems not only just , but indis - pensable .

		What that payment should be could of course be told only by a body of geological and economic experts .

		Payment for such and the other dam - ages reviewed above would be in the nature of reparation .

		And for reparation the German people as well as the German government is responsible .

		The people is 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	responsible because the whole nation assented to the government 's aggression , because its representatives in the
Reichs	PERSON	- tag raised at no time and under no cir - cumstance any significant voice against the policy of `` frightfulness '' of the polit - ical and military leaders .

		That not even the Socialists uttered such a protest is tes - timony to the extraordinary grip of the government upon the fears and hopes of its subjects .

		Its grip on their fears is obvious enough .

		Its grip on their hopes would have been impossible without its thoroughgoing and programmatic use of the nation 's educational system for its own especial purposes .

		By its almost absolute control over education , a control the only parallel for which is that exercised by the priesthood over the Catholic 's education , the government succeeded in keeping the people of
Germany	LOCATION	subjects of a dynasty when they should have been citizens of a state .

		By virtue of its control of education the German government is a cause of the iniquity of the German people , instead of one among other constituents in that iniquity .

		According to some thinkers , its control of education makes it the chief , if not the only , cause .

		Now the elimination of this causal power from the government of
Germany	LOCATION	is the second of the two sets of considerations in the financial readjust - ments between that goverment and the democracies of the Entente .

		This set of considerations demands the annihilation in fact , only a little more in
Germany	LOCATION	than elsewhere of governmental control of education .

		Annihilation may be accom - plished in two ways .

		First , educational institutions can be rendered completely autonomous -LRB- a consummation devoutly to be desired everywhere -RRB- at home .

		Sec - ondly , as many as possible of the German youth can be educated abroad .

		For the second method the democratic use of indemnities offers precedent .

		The precedent derives from the relations between the Western powers and
China	LOCATION	, and its application in the form estab - lished by the
United States	LOCATION	to their rela - tions with
Germany	LOCATION	can not but be liberal and liberating .

		When the Western pow - ers exacted from the quite helpless Chi - nese government and people indemnities for the damage done by the
Boxer	PERSON	rebel - lion of which it was a victim even more than they , the
United States	LOCATION	alone , of all the powers , directed the application of its share to defraying the expenses of edu - cating young Chinese in
America	LOCATION	.

		Let the democratic powers follow this precedent with regard to the government of Ger - many .

		Let the terms of peace require that one young German out of every thou - sand , both men and women , shall from his or her twelfth year on be educated abroad in the
United States	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, in
France	LOCATION	, in
Italy	LOCATION	, or in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		An indem - nity should be required to defray the cost of so educating the new generation .

		The money of this indemnity ought not , how - ever , to be raised by taxes from the Ger - man people .

		It ought to consist of a trust-fund , created by confiscating all the properties of the royal families of Ger - many , and of the great German landlord class , the Junkers .

		This trust might be held and administered by an international commission for the good of mankind .

		There are certain desirable extensions of this procedure to other governments that I shall discuss in connection with the organization of peace .

		At present I am concerned only with its influence on the mental set of the government and people of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		An indemnity so specified as the foregoing should be satisfactory to liberals as well as conservatives in the matter of war-settlements .

		It obviously can work no injustice upon the people of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Rather is it a service to them , deriving as it does , not from taxation , but from the appropriation to public use of the property of their exploiters and masters .

		It is bound to set them free from one of the most potent instrumentalities of this mastership .

		Upon the minds of the mas - ters , on the other hand , it is bound to im - press the fact that they have been whipped in the only language that they , like all bullies , are capable of understanding .

		It is bound to go a long way toward converting the bully into a peaceful citizen , for the expropriation of the propertied classes cuts the ground from under their arrogance , while participation , through educated men , in the life and labor of other peoples , leads the citizenry of a land to respect and understanding for these others .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 59 Our
Paris	LOCATION	Letter -LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		M.
Paul Louis	PERSON	is one of the best-informed and shrewdest observers in
France	LOCATION	of interna - tional affairs .

		A Socialist in politics and an active member of the executive committee of his party , he has the faculty , too rare among publicists , of taking an objective view of the facts and not allowing his judgment of them to be warped by his own sympathies , desires , or prejudices .

		Thus he is able without any com - promise of his principles to be the expert on foreign affairs of the `` Petit Parisien , '' to which he contributes daily a commentary on events , as frank and objective as the censors will allow .

		Since the war the number of people able to take an objective point of view has become smaller than ever .

		Indeed , most people seem to regard such a point of view as unpatriotic and to think it their duty always to believe and anticipate what they desire .

		They seem in - capable of understanding that , if one considers at a given moment that things are not going well for the Allies , it is not necessarily because one desires them to go badly ; and they are dis - posed to dismiss any expression of what , in ignorance of the real meaning of that term , they are pleased to call `` pessimism , '' as an indi - cation of `` pro-boche '' sympathies .

		This ten - dency has been encouraged by the governments in all belligerent countries and by the press , which they control by means of the censorship .

		Some of its results were exposed by Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	in his now famous ``
Paris	LOCATION	'' speech .

		Nobody can doubt that one of the causes of the numerous military and diplomatic blunders mentioned by Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	, which have prevented the Allies from profiting by the superiority of their resources over those of their enemies , has been the lack of informed and balanced criticism , due to the press censorship .

		Moreover , this so - called `` optimism , '' which is not optimism but merely a refusal to see things as they are , inevit - ably leads sooner or later to dangerous reactions of real pessimism .

		A whole people , as you were told long ago in
America	LOCATION	, can not be fooled all the time ; sooner or later illusions are dispelled by obstinate facts and those that have cherished them fall from their fool 's paradise into the abyss .

		The few men that have kept their heads and tried to see things as they are , not as they would like them to be , are , therefore , more than ever valuable at the present time .

		M.
Paul Louis	PERSON	is one of such men , as is shown by the little volume just published with the title : `` Trois Peripeties dans la Crise Mondiale '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	; 1 fr .

		25 -RRB- .

		It is a collection the fourth of its series of eight articles originally published by
M. Louis	PERSON	in the `` Revue Bleue '' ; they date from
October 1915	DATE	to
April 1917	DATE	.

		Two of the articles are concerned with the Austrian Em - pire , three with
Russia	LOCATION	, and the remaining three with the policy of President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		A writer that republishes long afterwards , and without the alteration of a word , articles written on the spur of the moment exposes himself to a severe test , for all his readers have now the wisdom that comes after the event ; but
M. Louis	PERSON	stands the test well .

		As he reminds us in his short preface , he had to write under the eye of the censor , so that he could not say all that he thought , but he managed to say enough to prove his possession of that prescience that comes from knowledge .

		The articles on the death of the Emperor Fran - cis-Joseph and on the `` new era '' for
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	that many people anticipated as a re - sult of the new reign have been in many respects confirmed by the events .

		M.
Paul Louis	PERSON	thought
last February	DATE	, when the second article was first published , that this anticipation of a `` new era '' would prove to be an illusion , `` for so old a construction can not easily be repaired , '' and events seem to justify his skepticism .

		He fore - saw that
Austria	LOCATION	must remain under Prussian domination .


M. Louis	PERSON	's historical sketch of the four Rus - sian
Dumas	PERSON	, the first in date of the articles , is still a valuable aid to the understanding of de - velopments in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The article , `` Veille de Crise , '' written a month before the outbreak of the Russian revolution , foretold that revolution as plainly as the censors would allow ; and that on the downfall of the Tsarism , originally pub - lished
last April	DATE	, is a shrewd appreciation of the consequences of the revolution to the Allies and the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	.

		If those consequences have not been quite what
M. Louis	PERSON	anticipated , that is because the Allies have not known how to deal with the forces of democratic
Russia	LOCATION	; their delay in revising the secret treaties , the imperial - ist and aggressive nature of which has now been revealed to the world , their omission to re-state their war aims , the violent and indiscriminating attacks of a large part of the French and English press on the revolution and its leaders : all these factors have contributed to the present state of affairs in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		But
M. Paul Louis	PERSON	is prob - ably still right in his belief , first expressed eight months ago .

		that in the end the Russian revolu - 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	tion will injure the German and Austrian autoc - racies , not the allied democracies , if the latter will not forget to be democratic .

		Of the three articles on President
Wilson	PERSON	's policy , the first was originally published imme - diately after his election , the second last
March	DATE	, and the third , on American intervention and the society of democracies , on
April 21	DATE	.

		All three show an understanding of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's policy and its guiding principles which contrasts with the superficial comments of most of the French papers , which , at the time of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's elec - tion , criticized him very unjustly .

		Last
March M. Louis	PERSON	was able to say that his very different judgment had been completely justified , and to show that the development of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's policy had been perfectly logical .

		He would not admit that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's breach with
Germany	LOCATION	was sudden ; on the contrary , he maintained that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's policy had been settled nine months before , that `` he had foreseen all the hypotheses , particularly that which has been veri - fied , and decided on a line of conduct appro - priate to each of them . ''

		In the last article
M. Louis	PERSON	deals with that `` society of democracies '' which he believes to be Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's chief aim ; he says with truth that even the allied countries are not yet real democracies , but only `` democracies in course of formation , '' and he does not except
America	LOCATION	.

		If I have given so much space to a book which costs only a quarter of a dollar and little exceeds a pamphlet in size , it is because the size and price of a book are no indication of its value and
M. Paul Louis	PERSON	is representative of an important section of contemporary French thought , which is likely to be paramount in the near future .

		For the future in
France	LOCATION	is in the hands of the Socialists and
M. Louis	PERSON	is an in - fluence among the Socialists , although he is not in
Parliament	LOCATION	and has not , so far as I know , any intention of entering it .

		During this war each belligerent country has known very little of what is being thought and done in the others ; all the Americans newly arrived in
France	LOCATION	that I have met agree that there is an astonishing difference between the real state of things here and what it is supposed to be in
America	LOCATION	.

		I gather that even the American military chiefs have had some surprises .

		This is inevitable with a censorship that suppresses facts and doctors opinion .

		It is therefore desirable that the Amer - ican public should not take its notions of French opinion from the newspapers , which can not pos - sibly be well informed in the circumstances , and should make the acquaintance of such representa - tive writers as
M. Paul Louis	PERSON	.

		One by one the great artistic figures that have survived the nineteenth century are passing away ; the death of
Rodin	PERSON	has followed closely on that of
Degas	LOCATION	, who was his senior by six years .

		Renoir and
Claude Monet	PERSON	, who were both born , if I am not mistaken , in the same year as
Rodin	PERSON	-LRB- 1840 -RRB- , still remain , and so does Bartolome , who , al - though he can not be put on anything like the same level as
Rodin	LOCATION	, will still be immortalized by his Monument of the Dead in
Pere Lachaise	LOCATION	, so immeasurably superior to all the rest of his work .

		Rodin was buried in his own garden at
Meudon	LOCATION	, in the tomb surmounted by his famous `` Penseur , '' where lay already the faithful com - panion of his life , whom he had married just before her death .

		To have buried him in the Pantheon would have been to fly in the face of his own formal injunctions , but the Govern - ment thought at first of bringing his body to
Paris	LOCATION	for a
State	ORGANIZATION	funeral before its interment at
Meudon	LOCATION	; the idea was abandoned , however , in consequence of the present critical military conditions and there was only a simple lay cere - mony at
Meudon	LOCATION	, at which a member of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	spoke .

		It was a touching scene , that last farewell to the great artist in the hill - side garden under whose trees he had so often walked with many of those present .

		Rodin , who had once been so violently at - tacked by all the artistic pontiffs and regarded by the public as a crank , lived to become one of the chief glories of
France	LOCATION	.

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	gladly accepted from him the generous gift of his works , and the
Hotel de Biron	ORGANIZATION	, that beautiful old house with its huge garden at the corner of the rue de Varenne and the boulevard des In - valides , will in future be the
Musee Rodin	LOCATION	.

		By an irony of fate
Rodin	PERSON	died just at the moment when the Academic des Beaux Arts had at last discovered that his absence from its ranks was not to its credit and was thinking of asking him to allow himself to be proposed as a member .

		Would he have accepted ?

		I hardly think so , for the proposal came too late to confer any honor on him and there was no particular rea - son why he should have honored the last ram - part of artistic obscurantism .

		You have , I believe , no official academies in
America	LOCATION	and you may be thankful for it .

		They are the bane of litera - ture and art , and the enemies of individuality .

		A pupil of the
Ecole	ORGANIZATION	des Beaux Arts , which is controlled by the Academic , has either to sink his individuality and ruin himself for life as an
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 artist , or else to live in a state of constant con - flict with his teachers , unless , like
Degas	PERSON	, he leaves it in disgust after a few months .

		It is melancholy to read the list of former `` Prix de
Rome	LOCATION	'' and notice how very few of them count at all as artists ; there is not among them a single painter or sculptor of the first rank .

		Nor have the great artists of modern
France	LOCATION	belonged to the Academic des Beaux Arts , not
Rodin	PERSON	, nor
Degas	LOCATION	, nor
Renoir	ORGANIZATION	, nor
Claude Monet	PERSON	, nor Bar - tolome , for instance .

		Yet , because the
Acade	PERSON	- mic is an official institution , it is to the academicians that the
State	ORGANIZATION	has almost always given its commissions ; that is the reason why public monuments and paintings ordered by the
State	ORGANIZATION	are usually so bad .

		As
Degas	PERSON	used to say , art should not be `` encouraged . ''

		Even the unofficial Academic Goncourt , founded by the brothers
Goncourt	ORGANIZATION	in order to encourage the sort of literary work that the
Academic Franchise	ORGANIZATION	discourages , is falling into the conservatism of its official prototypes .

		It has just preferred to
M. Georges Courteline	PERSON	a gentleman called Aj albert , who is generally liked and is the director of the
State	ORGANIZATION	tapestry factory at
Beauvais	LOCATION	, but whose literary production is unimportant both in quantity and quality .

		The election had been postponed several times because no candidate could obtain a clear majority .

		Yet the claims of M. Courteline were infinitely su - perior to those of all the other candidates .

		The author of `` Le Train de 8h .

		47 , '' of `` Messieurs les Ronds-de-cuir , '' of `` Boubouroche , '' of all the marvelous studies of military service , is a genius , with limitations , it is true , but with a power of observation hardly ever surpassed .

		Moreover , his work , so intensely realist , is exactly of the kind that the Goncourts wished to encourage .

		It is understood that the objection to him was that he is a `` humorous author '' ; I hope that this is not true , for it would imply a failure on the part of the majority of the Academic Goncourt to recognize the pathos that underlies
M. Cour	PERSON	- teline 's humor , like that of
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		He might say with
Beaumarchais	ORGANIZATION	's Figaro : `` Je me presse de rire de tout ... de peur d'etre oblige d'en pleurer . ''

		During the last month we have had
Lord Lansdowne	ORGANIZATION	's letter and President
Wilson	PERSON	's speech to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which agreed on several important points .

		Both have had a great effect on public opinion , but perhaps that of
Lord Lansdowne	LOCATION	's letter was the greater , for the simple reason that it was shorter and set forth clearly five definite propositions .

		The speech to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, being of an entirely different character , could not take the same form and , as it was rather long , too many people have not taken the trouble to read it through and have been content with cross head-lines and newspaper comments .

		The French translation of the speech , by the way , was much better than that of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's reply to the Pope .

		Some of the papers , for their own pur - poses , selected for comment only such passages of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's speech as seemed , when sep - arated from their context , to support the theory that the war must be continued until the Allies have a victory in the field , or that of an eternal boycott of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		M.
Maurice Barres	PERSON	, for instance , in an article in the `` Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' actually represented Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	as having declared that we must never again have any rela - tions of any kind with
Germany	LOCATION	in any circum - stances , basing the assertion on the passage in the speech about `` this intolerable thing of which the masters of
Germany	LOCATION	have shown us the ugly face , '' which says nothing of the kind .

		`` Nothing that is German , '' said
M. Barres	PERSON	, `` must ever again come out of
Germany	LOCATION	or remain in our midst . ''

		Previous articles of his show that this means a permanent boycott even of Goethe and
Wagner	PERSON	.

		The result of all this is that there is considerable confusion in the public mind here as to President
Wilson	PERSON	's real meaning .

		It would seem desirable that the American administration should have some means of correcting misunder - standings and misrepresentations .

		There were at first few press comments on Lord Lansdowne 's letter , for the papers that would have liked to criticize it hesitated to at - tack the statesman who is universally respected in
France	LOCATION	as the founder of the
Entente Cor	ORGANIZATION	- diale .

		The `` Figaro '' and the `` Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	'' even deprived their readers of any extracts from the letter .

		But , although no paper published a complete translation , the extracts given in the press excited immense interest .

		Lord Lansdowne , in fact , said what the majority of the French people already thought ; that is the explanation of the profound effect of his letter .

		The force of public opinion is shown by a leader in the `` Intransigeant '' warmly supporting Lord Lans - downe 's views .

		For the `` Intransigeant , '' which has the largest circulation of the Parisian evening papers , is extremely Nationalist and jingo .

		Another sign of the influence of public opinion is the declaration made by
M. Clemen	PERSON	- ceau to the
Foreign Affairs Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the Chamber that if the Central Empires made serious peace proposals , he would consider them .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	There is a great deal of talk about `` pacifists '' and `` defaitistes '' -LRB- a barbarous word recently coined -RRB- , but in reality the difference is between those who say , with President
Wilson	PERSON	, that the war will be won when we have attained our aims by any means and , therefore , also say that our aims must be clearly defined , and those who hold that our sole aim is a military victory and that it will be time enough to decide what use to make of it when we have won it .

		M.
Clem	PERSON	- enceau has hitherto belonged to the latter cate - gory ; he seems now to have joined the former .

		To the numerous scandals has now been added a far greater one , the proposal of the Govern - ment to prosecute
M. Caillaux	PERSON	for treason .

		It is already plain that
France	LOCATION	will be divided into two hostile camps and we shall have another
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair .

		Ever since he prevented war in
1911	DATE	,
M. Caillaux	PERSON	has been pursued by , the bit - ter hostility of a certain party both in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' in
1911	DATE	opposed an arrangement between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and has never forgiven
M. Caillaux	PERSON	for making one .

		Lord Northcliffe was the first to begin the campaign against
M. Caillaux	PERSON	in re - gard to his visit to
Italy	LOCATION	a year ago , which is the chief basis of the present accusation .

		Yet
M. Caillaux	PERSON	went to
Italy	LOCATION	with the consent of the
Foreign Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, which gave him a diplomatic passport , and
M. Briand	PERSON	and
M. Ribot	PERSON	, who were respectively
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	at the time of the visit , took no action on the reports now made the ground of a charge of treason , nor did their successors until
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	came into power , after a violent controversy with
M. Caillaux	PERSON	.

		Another reason of the hostility against
M. Caillaux	PERSON	is the fact that he was the author of the income tax , which is deeply resented by the French rentiers .

		As to
M. Caillaux	PERSON	's policy in
1911	DATE	, there can be no doubt that he made an excellent bargain for his country when he obtained complete con - trol of
Morocco	LOCATION	in return for a small piece of the
Congo	LOCATION	and that , by preventing war , he saved
France	LOCATION	from disaster .


Russia	LOCATION	had definitely de - clared that
France	LOCATION	must not count on her sup - port in the event of war with
Germany	LOCATION	about
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		Since the present war , he has un - doubtedly been one of those that desired to make peace whenever it should be possible to obtain our conditions , and he has always advocated a clear statement of war aims on democratic lines , and opposed imperialist designs .

		But none of his friends has ever heard him suggest that
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	should make a separate peace behind the back of
England	LOCATION	, which is the crime now alleged against him .

		There has been so much personal and party animosity against
M. Caillaux	PERSON	that suspicion of the motives of the present affair is inevitable ; it has all the appear - ance of a political move and its preliminary stages have had a disquieting resemblance to those of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair .

		I am convinced that
M. Caillaux	PERSON	's innocence will be established , if he has a fair trial -LRB- a secret court martial would not be one -RRB- ; the whole affair might in certain cir - cumstances turn out to his advantage and lead to the discomfiture of his enemies .

		But the pos - sible consequences , to both

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 63 Greek Meets Greek THE GREEK GENIUS AND ITS INFLUENCE .

		SELECT ESSAYS AND EXTRACTS .

		Edited , with an Introduc - tion , by
Lane Cooper	PERSON	, Ph.D. -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Lane
Cooper	PERSON	has performed another of those creditable tasks that fall in the twilight zone between pedagogy and scholarship .

		It is neither a handbook nor a set of texts that he has pre - pared , but a sort of anthology , in the main culled from the broad meadows of prose criticism , but ribboned by a few passages from the poets
Shelley	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	.

		The immediate purpose of the book , so the preface tells , is to supply the need of background to a class study - ing Greek and Latin masterpieces in standard translations ; yet it looks , with an ulterior eye , also to the classical specialist , and again to the incorrigible possessed of `` the provincial notion that we have nothing to learn from the past . ''

		This comprehensive order is met by a score of selections chosen with that studied wilfulness which is in the anthologist 's charter .

		To say that they are of various value were platitudinous ; besides , it might not be true , for the selections are obviously chosen for various ends not all of them self-evident .

		Certainly , the levy is made only upon the irreproachable , and it is stoutly international and without taint of the tempestive
Newman	PERSON	,
Jebb	PERSON	,
Gildersleeve	LOCATION	,
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Murray	PERSON	, or again , Croiset and Renan ,
August Boeckh	PERSON	and von Wilamowitz-Moellen - dorff , all honorable men .

		Certainly , too , the reading is good reading , for the whole two hundred odd pages .

		Only and one must ask it why is n't it edited ?

		If the book were merely for the scholar , other editing than the arranger 's meticulous bibliography would be unnecessary ; but then , the book is hardly neces - sary for scholars .

		If it is primarily for the collegian and the more studious of the public called general , it is absurd to let such a characterization of Attic education as
Newman	PERSON	's go with an unexplained apology for anachronism , to pass without exposition a polemical con - demnation of neo-classicism such as is represented by
S. L. Wolff	PERSON	's review of one of
Mahaffy	PERSON	's books , or , more than all , to present without something of the correction which stores of more modern learning afford , such a myopic view of ancient paganism as
Kenan 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The `` keystone of my arch , '' says Professor
Cooper	PERSON	-LRB- referring to the structural self-sufficiency of his collection -RRB- is the translation from
Boeckh	PERSON	's `` Encyclopadie und Methodologie der Philologischen Wissenschaf - ten '' -LRB- pp. 263-300 -RRB- , devoted to a general ap - praisement of the nature of antiquity .

		Many of
Boeckh	PERSON	's specific studies are , of course , of unsu - perseded value , and in this particular extract there are numerous sagacious observations ; but not only as a whole does it move in that omni - conscious Weltanschauung and
Geschichtsphi	PERSON	- losophie which make the stream of German speculation such muddy swimming , for there are few of the thirty pages that do not contain judgments challenged or condemned by the course of time .

		An instance is
Boeckh	PERSON	's state - ment that `` it was a fundamental notion of antiquity that fate necessarily determined every - thing , even the will of the gods . ''

		The essay by
Abby Leach	PERSON	, which follows
Boeckh	PERSON	in the sequence , is devoted to refutation of this judg - ment though it must be confessed that the brand of fatalism which Miss
Leach	PERSON	is inter - ested in showing to be non-Greek probably never had any existence except as a fiction - writer 's explanation of his hero 's foolhardiness or of his heroine 's inability to control her passions .

		Boeckh , indeed , gives the proper cor - rective of his own statement when he adds that , after all , the old idea of necessity and the mod - ern idea of freedom are the same , `` since in God freedom and necessity are identical . ''

		What the Greeks were concerned about , as are most
Chris	PERSON	- tians , was not the absence of
Providence	LOCATION	but its inscrutability which is the devil of it for us poor mortals .

		In any case , a note on the sub - ject should have added philosophical quality to the implied controversy .

		But it must not be inferred that the editor is blind to what might be termed the indiscre - tions of contributors .

		Their differences of opin - ion , he hopes , will be so neutralized by their agreements that in the composite presentment which results the accidental will dissolve away and the pure Hellene be shown in true perspec - tive .

		And something like this actually takes place as a result of the collocation ; for the reader can hardly turn from the book without a vivid image of
Lane Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's true Greek .

		Needless to say , this Greek is stylistically correct , and not at all unfamiliar .

		He is verily humanistic and rationalistic and is endowed with all the aca - demic virtues nice as to his pomades , with manner so subdued as to convert his thorough conceit into a proper charm , as to his tongue with just enough of the risque to give him spice , and what with his garlands and his architec - 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	tural backgrounds -LRB- a sort of archetypal college campus -RRB- converting the whole of life into a series of pleasantly plastic tableaux .

		Any teachers ' bureau would guarantee to place him from the mere description !

		To add , as it were , the grace of a final modesty to this image , our Greek is already deprecatingly rearing his altar to the `` Unknown God , '' in solicitous anticipation of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- my reference here is to the last of the essays , in which
Gilbert Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	defends Christianity as against
Lowes Dickin	PERSON	- son 's honeyed paganism -RRB- .

		Now I , too , have a Greek , but of quite another build a most fascinating savage -LRB- for , culpa meal I move with the anthropologists -RRB- , with whom I should dearly love to do `` field work . ''

		He has all the unblushing vices and shameless imaginings that beset the natural man , and he roars with vainglory and panics with peril like the other barbarians whom , incidentally , he despises in proportion to his ignorance of them .

		Yet , for all this , his utter - ance is endowed with so wicked a sagacity as shall never cease to ruin human complacency , and such mordancy of double intention as shall eternally tantalize human ingenuity .

		Like his books , so his art : all is two-faced for , by all the singing heavens !

		my Greek knew that the power of his handiwork was in no smooothness to the sense , that his marbles are but horrible blanks of life if they be not transfigured by unearthly glories , that than sensuous beauty no thing is less possible , and that the very essence of the beautiful is something never serene , but always troubled .

		Very likely an historical Hellene , could he sojourn among us , would regard both these , and the multitude of other portraits by which his memory has been perpetuated , with small recog - nition ; certainly he would feel some wonder at the attention paid him .

		To be sure , as he became habituated , this attention would gradually grow intelligible to him , and eventually he , too , would be looking back to his native age with a sigh for an hour happy in that , for once , the life of the mind was lived unweighted by apparatus .

		Which is a noble argument for the most direct possible acquaintance with the classical books .

		The roads of indirection lead by facile grades ; they are pleasant , and not profitless .

		But what would one not give to take Plato or Euripides aside for a quiet quiz , or to treat Aeschylus or Sophocles to an honest pipe after the play ?

		Keats as Thinker JOHN KEATS : His LIFE AND POETRY , His FRIENDS , CRITICS , AND AFTER-FAME .

		By Sir
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 4.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Thirty years ago Sir -LRB- then Mr. -RRB-
Sidney Col	PERSON	- vin published his life of
Keats	PERSON	in the English Men of Letters series ; it has held the field ever since as the best treatment of the subject for the general reader .

		Even now , when the author re - turns to the subject in his admirable new work , he seems to find little cause to revise or to re - tract any of his former judgments ; his task is chiefly one of amplification .

		Books will still be written about the poetry of Keats ; but it may be doubted whether the present biography will ever be superseded , either in completeness or in charm .

		It is a book to read with delight ; better still , it is a book that compels one to turn back and reread the poet himself .

		Its form is at - tractive ; the illustrations are well chosen and well executed ; even the very exhaustive index is inviting .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	is fortunate in his subject , for the material is abundant he is able occasionally to add to our knowledge by tapping sources hitherto not available and much of this material con - sists of writings by men of talent , if not of genius .

		He does well to paint carefully for us the society in which the young poet found his wings , quoting freely from the letters of
Keats	PERSON	and of his friends ; for
Keats	PERSON	was nothing if not impressionable , and even when he reacted most decidedly against his environment , it is only by understanding that environment that we can hope to understand him .

		So we welcome the por - traits of his friends and acquaintances :
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, elegant and always sipping the delicious - ness of life , tea-cup fashion ;
Wordsworth	PERSON	, vain and rather heavy , but indubitably a great poet ; the irrepressible Lamb ;
Shelley	PERSON	, during the life of
Keats	PERSON	, never in spirit more than a neighbor ; the faithful
Cowden Clarke	PERSON	;
Haydon	ORGANIZATION	, the sure critic and pompously mediocre painter ; and Sev - ern , to
Keats	PERSON	a fidus Achates .

		We are glad to learn , through liberal quotation , such homely de - tails about the poet 's life as these , by himself half-humorously recorded : `` the candles are burnt down and I am using the wax taper which has a long snuff on it the fire is at its last click I am sitting with my back to it with one foot rather askew upon the rug and the other with the heel a little elevated from the carpet ... To know such trifles , '' observes
Keats	PERSON	, `` of any great Man long since dead it would be a great
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 65 delight : As to know in what position Shakes - peare sat when he began ` To be or not to be ' such things become interesting from distance of time or place . ''

		More important is the biographer 's record of
Keats	PERSON	's mental life .

		Here again we trace the workings of a personality quick to appropriate vicarious experience , whether it is old English poetry , in which
Keats	PERSON	was at times entirely steeped , or an engraving of a painting by
Claude	PERSON	or a print of an ancient vase .

		Not that
Keats	PERSON	ever slavishly imitated anything or anybody .

		In such a matter as the handling of the heroic coup - let , as Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's masterly sketch makes clear , he was bound by no worship of precedent ; meanwhile he was learning to take what he needed for his purposes from the graphic arts and from myth and from romance and to jumble them without much consideration of context .

		When is the story recounted in `` St.
Agnes	PERSON	' Eve '' supposed to have taken place , in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, or
last night	TIME	?

		And how much does it matter what the setting is supposed to be ?

		So even a life of Keats proves to be necessa - rily much more than a calculation of influences and counter-influences .

		The central fact is not that
Keats	PERSON	enjoyed this or disliked that ; it is that various experiences , almost always felt as concrete images , were by him fixed in the most musical of verse .

		More than that ,
Keats	PERSON	was thoroughly cured of his early tendency , bred by his association with Hunt , merely to voice the de - liciousness of things .

		We have learned to real - ize how large a part of him was `` flint and iron , '' to use
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's phrase .

		Mere re - action to the stimulus of the beauties of nature was not for him ; `` scenery is fine , '' he wrote as early as the
spring of 1818	DATE	, `` but human nature is finer . ''

		Hence his devotion to `` the continual drinking of knowledge . ''

		Let any one who thinks of
Keats	PERSON	as the mere dreamer , preoccupied with sentiment and romance , listen to the poet 's own words : `` I find there is no worthy pur - suit but the idea of doing some good to the world ... There is but one way for me .

		The road lies through application , study , and thought .

		I will pursue it ... An extensive knowledge is needful to thinking people ... The difference of high Sensations with and without knowledge appears to me this ; in the latter case we are falling continually ten thou - sand fathoms deep and being blown up again , without wings , and with all -LSB- the -RSB- horror of a bare-shouldered creature in the former case , our shoulders are fledged , and we go through the same air and space without fear . ''

		The man who could write thus was not the man to be killed by adverse reviews , and one is glad to see with what emphasis Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has disposed of the foolish legend to the contrary .

		Whether
Keats	PERSON	was altogether wise in trying to pack so much significance into such a poem as , for ex - ample , `` Endymion , '' a poem that was from the first bound to be read , if at all , chiefly for its purple patches , is another question .

		The gift of `` invention '' and of making images was his in a supreme degree , as well as the gift of music ; yet a great part of his glory lies in his ability to enter into the spirit of an old myth or an old work of art , and to seize with unerring instinct that element of it which is as much alive for us as it was for its first creator .

		Such interpreta - tion and transmission of the life of things is in itself a claim to originality of the first order .

		Rediscovery is , after all , discovery .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's
England	LOCATION	A SHORT HISTORY OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
G. K. Ches	PERSON	- terton .

		-LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-


G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	has committed a great sin ; he has written a didactic poem , a work of art , and has called it history .

		It is no easy thing to give a list of all the complex sanctities that he has violated by this one act ; as a mere incident in the accomplishment of his main purpose he has arrayed against himself anti-Catholics , material - ists , aristocrats , plutocrats , and the whole tribe of scientific historians .

		But it is true of
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	, '' as it is true of any work of art , that the sanctities which it violates are not so important as the vision which inspires it The hero of this poem is the people of
England	LOCATION	; and it is
Chesterton	LOCATION	's central thesis that the people of
England	LOCATION	spent the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	in fighting and earning its way towards liberty and independence , that in the fourteenth century the people made an unsuccessful revolution in the attempt to consecrate and complete its partial independence , that
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, an aristocratic and plutocratic council , frustrated that revolu - tion , and that the sixteenth century was marked by a successful counter-revolution of the rich .

		From that time on the condition of the populace grew worse ; the social reforms of the nineteenth century all tended in the direction of the
Servile State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sign of the
Servile State	ORGANIZATION	is the per - mission granted to employees `` to claim certain 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	advantages as employees , and as something per - manently different from employers . ''

		The relapse into slavery was interrupted by the war .

		`` The English poor , broken in every revolt , bullied by every fashion , long despoiled of property , and now being despoiled of liberty , entered history with a noise of trumpets , and turned themselves in two years into one of the iron armies of the world .

		And when the critic of politics and literature , feeling that this war is after all heroic , looks around him to find the hero , he can point to nothing but the mob . ''

		Now this is poetry ; and the fact that it is didactic does not destroy or even seriously impair its essential value .

		Chesterton intends to wake men up , and to urge them to see the past for themselves .

		He addresses himself to his task with all the .

		vigor of a man trying to rescue a friend from the deadly effects of an over-dose of opiate .

		Hence comes his use of paradox and emphasis .

		They are far from being the idle devices of a man who `` stands upon his head and cries that the world is upside down '' ; on the contrary , they are desperately earnest attempts to awaken the public out of its torpor .

		It is no more relevant to criticize
Chesterton	PERSON	for his extravagance than to praise him for his brilliance ; we do not criti - cize a doctor , under similar circumstances , for shaking the patient roughly , any more than we praise him for rare intelligence when he announces that the patient has been drugged .

		The real and relevant question is the question of fact .

		Has the patient been drugged ?

		If not ,
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's poetry is superfluous , to say the least .

		But if the public has been drugged , then we must also ask who the criminals were that put the people to sleep , and what was the nature of the opiate .

		To each of these questions ,
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	has an answer ready ; but the philosophy on which they are based is so unfamiliar to most men that it runs a risk of being denounced without being understood .

		Chesterton believes that the torpor of the nineteenth century , which still afflicts much of our thinking , was due to a radically false con - ception of the past , to a misinterpretation of history , administered by popular scientists and popular historians .

		`` The complaints of the poor were stilled and their status justified '' by a fairy story told in the name of evolution and of prog - ress .

		The only remedy , therefore , is to inform the public that progress is not automatic , and that the sufferings of men in the present are not due to the impersonal action of rigid social and economic `` laws , '' but to entirely human and per - sonal causes which are quite within the power of the public to control .

		Thus
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	issues a direct challenge to the historians , and thus at the same time he pub - lishes his recipe for the improvement of society .

		For decades past , historians have proclaimed that `` the aim of history is not to please , nor to give practical maxims of conduct , nor to arouse the emotions , but knowledge pure and simple . ''

		They have thought that it was sacrilegious , a sin against science , to write a history which suggested any particular course of political or moral action .

		And now , ironically enough ,
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	accuses them of having done the very thing they were most anxious to avoid ; inasmuch as all their his - tories did suggest a course of action , or rather of inaction , to the disinherited English people .

		But if this is true , it is obvious that history can never be `` knowledge pure and simple , '' since whatever men believe about their past is bound to affect their action in the present .

		Therefore the `` scientific '' historian may struggle as he will ; he can not prevent his history from being in some degree a pamphlet and a creed .

		Chesterton 's `` History of
England	LOCATION	'' is both a pamphlet and a creed ; but he has one great advantage over his `` scientific '' rivals .

		He really knows what he is writing and why ; whereas the science of the ordinary historian has not even taught him what history is .

		Chesterton is a poet , and therefore he is still capable of the emotion of wonder which is the beginning of all philosophy ; while the historians who try to treat the past as if it were knowledge pure and simple , prove perhaps their simplicity and their purity , but not their knowledge .

		It is to be hoped that
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's book will assist in destroying this old and popular but false conception of the relation between past and present .

		Otherwise intelligent men are always telling us to forget the past and set our faces resolutely towards the future , which is like urging us to be really progressive marble statues .


Noth	PERSON	- ing forgets the past more readily than inanimate matter ; nothing has its face set more resolutely towards the future .

		The very definition of living beings is that they do not wholly forget the past ; and it is worth noting that their control over the future is precisely proportionate to their control over the past .

		One does not render a baby more gloriously and gladly free by telling it each day to forget all that it learned the day before .

		On the contrary , memory is essential
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 67 to freedom .

		But it is equally essential that the memory should be correct .

		We maintain asylums for men who remember that they were
Napoleons	ORGANIZATION	and
Caesars	ORGANIZATION	.

		But if the delusion of past grand - eur is mad , so also is the delusion of past slavery .

		Neither the growth nor the loss of human free - dom is automatic ; and as men can be enslaved by being taught that they were never free , so can they be liberated by being taught that they were never wholly slaves .

		`` Such are the victims of fathers who have married in ignorance of things which you now know , things which I should like to shout in the market-place !

		I have told you everything , with - out dramatising anything . ''

		Thus the doctor , mouthpiece of the author , in `` Damaged Goods , '' and the declaration may stand for the epigraph of
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	's theatre .

		There are many things he would shout from the house-tops and he finds the stage the most effective medium .

		He uses it as a rostrum to bring before a wide audience the great social questions of the day .

		For him the theatre has no nobler goal , and he would doubt - less say with Voltaire : `` J'ai fait un peu de bien ; c'est mon meilleur ouvrage . ''

		Many of us may disapprove this mingling of stage and pulpit , but
Brieux	PERSON	is a master of his craft and the thesis seldom proves fatal to the artist .

		One of his most successful and admired plays , `` Le Berceau , '' seems almost a challenge to the critic .

		The text there shall be no divorce where there are chil - dren is never for a moment forgotten , and we are reminded of a geometric demonstration .

		The theorem is rather ostentatiously enunciated in the first scene , and each one following adds a line to the construction figure ; at the end we have the
Q. E. D.	PERSON	, where the thesis assumes the dignity of the ancient fate .

		`` I see dimly something which is soaring above you , above me , above us all , above human laws , and of which we may well be only the victims . ''

		Unfortunately the work by which
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	is best known in
America	LOCATION	is `` Damaged Goods , '' perhaps the unique example in his theatre of a thesis without a play .

		It is in the effort to right this injustice that Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	has published his book .

		He makes no attempt to discuss the legiti - macy of thesis drama , but it is obvious that he has no quarrel with the genre .

		His one obiter dictum on the subject , in a footnote , will scarcely satisfy hostile critics .

		`` If the thesis is good , why should the play not be good also ? ''

		Of course the thesis must not only be `` good '' in itself , but adapted to treatment on the stage .

		And even so , there is always the lurking danger that the thesis may warp the characters or lead to special and undramatic pleading .

		Brieux is by no means beyond censure here .

		But Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	is chiefly concerned with his author as a realist , dealing with certain social conditions in
France	LOCATION	.

		He analyzes in detail sixteen plays , gives a rapid historical sketch of the question treated , and ex - amines the same problems as presented by contemporary dramatists , novelists , and social and literary critics .

		Thus the reader is given a large perspective and is made to realize the vital - ity of
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	's themes .

		One of his constant pre - occupations is the lot of children of divorced parents .

		No fewer than eight of his plays turn on this subject and there is hardly one in which the welfare of the children has not a prominent place .

		Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	's chapter on the place of the child in French life at the present time and in the past is among the best in the book .

		Probably no two critics will agree on the lit - erary merit of the different plays .

		Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	is so intensely interested in their value as social documents that he is too often lenient toward the havoc wrought in character-portrayal by the requirements of the thesis .

		There are too many examples in Brieux of a sudden shift from cling - ing-vine weakness to Cornelian heroism , or the contrary .

		A dash of skepticism concerning the legitimacy of thesis drama might have led with profit to a study of the greater or less intrusive - ness of the thesis in
Brieux	LOCATION	.

		As it is Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	finds thesis everywhere and fails to mark its rela - tive importance in the plays .

		Thus he remarks in passing of `` Les Hannetons '' that it `` explodes the claim that free love is less enslaving than marriage . ''

		Possibly , but
Brieux	LOCATION	is wont to use explosives of higher power , which leave no doubt of his intentions , and it is probable that ninety - nine out of a hundred spectators will see in `` Les Hannetons '' only a delicious bit of realistic farce .

		In general , Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	deplores the comic or farcical scenes , although these are always in char - acter , as lessening the serious effect of the play .

		He fails to see that , in addition to the needed relief from angry denunciation of social injustice , these little scenes , which are intensely realistic , prove close observation and incline the spectator to accept the whole play as true to life .

		The 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	thesis drama , if it is to make for reform , must at least give the impression of realism .

		We must be convinced that the giant is genuine and not a windmill before we charge .

		Doubtless this is the explanation of the introduction of statistics into certain of
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	's two introductory chapters are excellent .

		The first contains a brief biography showing Brieux 's humble origin and early strug - gles for recognition , to which he owes his sym - pathy for the working classes .

		His six years ' sojourn as journalist at
Rouen	LOCATION	perhaps gave him his insight into the provincial character .

		His peasants are among the best that French literature has produced .

		The second chapter gives a rapid survey of the author 's early plays through which he was led to find his proper field .

		The American public owes a large debt of gratitude to Mr.
Scheifley	PERSON	for his scholarly and sympathetic treatment of Brieux .

		He has shown admirably Brieux 's sincerity and versatility , and amply justified , for American eyes , the place accorded to the author in his native land .

		A Thwarted Cosmopolite LIFE AND LITERATURE .

		By
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		With an Introduction by
John Erskine	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		This is the third volume of selections from the lectures delivered by
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	at the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of Tokio prior to
1902	DATE	.

		The other vol - umes appeared in
1915	DATE	and
1916	DATE	.

		All three have been constructed in great part from the notes of his Japanese students .

		Hearn , as Mr.
Erskine	PERSON	instructs us , spoke slowly and distinctly , using simple words and constructions ; and in some instances the students were able to take down his lectures word for word .

		These volumes are different indeed in text and tone from those which he addressed directly to the English and American public .

		Here we sip from a cup of clear cold water a succession of draughts quite uncolored and unseasoned .

		But it all serves admirably for the high-school or university student in our own country , as well as for the older reader who enjoys being fresh - ened up by a series of capable resumes .

		The range of subjects seems quite hit-or-miss .

		Doubtless the young Orientals need to know about the French romantics and about
George Meredith	PERSON	's poetry -LRB- which is presented both in the original text and in a series of careful para - phrases -RRB- ; but who would quite have expected to find them learning about the verse of Lord De Tabley or about the fairy literature of the North ?

		For matured Anglo-Saxons the most interesting of
Hearn	LOCATION	's chapters are the first three , which deal with general opinions and which state his views on the reading and writing of litera - ture particularly the one in which he gives his ideas on Composition .

		He considers the architecture of composition : How shall one overcome the difficulties of be - ginning ?

		he asks .

		By not beginning at all , he answers .

		When you draw a horse , do as the Japanese artist does : he is no more likely to start with the head than with the tail or the hoof .

		Hearn , in fact , seems to see a work of literature evolving and shaping just as nebula ?

		spin and whirl into concrete solidity .

		Once more we are conscious of him as the devotee of color rather than as the devotee of form .

		`` The literary law is , let the poem or the story shape itself .

		Do not try to shape it before it is nearly done .

		The most wonderful work is not the work that the author shapes and plans ; it is the work that shapes itself ... '' In other words , one may best put his intellectual pride in his pocket , and plunge himself , at hazard , into an irresponsible emotional welter .

		Hearn 's observations on style may meet with more acceptance .

		What we once called `` style , '' he says , no longer exists .

		What is called `` style '' ought to be called `` character . ''

		He might have paused to mark the distinction between style and diction .

		Style , of course , is `` of the man '' ; it will attend to itself must do so inevitably , since anything a man writes is necessarily a dis - closure , a give-away .

		Yet diction , that lesser concern , is by no means to be neglected .

		What the books on rhetoric and composition have to say about `` clearness , '' `` correctness , '' `` unity , '' and the like still holds valid .

		No due heed to sen - tence-structure or to paragraph-building is going to screen the essential man from his per - ceptive readers though
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, address - ing the Japanese student-body according to its peculiarities and needs , does offer , to those fa - miliar with his usual manner , an aspect which is almost a disguise .

HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		A Primer of Revolutionary Idealism POLITICAL IDEALS .

		By
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Cen - tury ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		`` In dark days , men need a clear faith and a well-grounded hope , and as the outcome of these the calm courage which takes no account of hard - ships by the way .

		The times through which we are passing have afforded to many of us a confirmation of our faith .

		We see that the things we had thought evil are really evil , and we know more definitely than we ever did before the direction in which men must move if a better world is to arise on the ruins of the one which is now hurling itself to destruction . ''

		The emotion with which one reads these open - ing sentences of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	's must be like nothing so much as the thrill which went through the men who opened `` Le Contrat Social '' and saw on the first page : `` L'homme est ne libre , et partout il est dans les fers . ''

		Just as they must have felt that in
Rousseau	PERSON	were the liberating ideals of the immediate future , we feel that it is around the ideas expressed in this book that the younger generation will rally for a clear faith and a well-grounded hope .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has expressed these ideas in his other books .

		But here they are organized into what is virtually a primer of revolutionary idealism , written with a passionate soberness that stirs the mind as deeply as it moves the heart .

		In him intellectual power and concern for human values have fused at a more intense point than in almost any other mind of our time .

		He has welded together ideas from the newer psychology , from syndicalist socialism , from the philosophy of internationalist aspira - tion , into a coherent and creative philosophy , at once the basis for a personal as well as a social idealism .

		The need of liberating the creative rather than the possessive impulses , the principle of growth , the value of reverence towards individuality , the obsolescence of a society based on property and power , the inadequacy of security and liberty as sole political ideals , the need of autonomy within the state for subordinate groups , the hope for gild socialism , and the organization of an international order that shall harmonize with the true community of sentiments among mankind these are the ideas which have been made familiar in `` Justice in Wartime '' and in `` Why Men Fight . ''

		In this summary , one finds the same style , the calm , clear , pragmatic flavor of science and not of religion .

		Without any mystical taint , and with none of the traditional vague symbols that have become charged with emotion ,
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	's fusion of intelligence with what we can only call `` love for humanity '' gives these ideas an emotional drive that we are accustomed to associate only with the mystical .

		This is the novel power of his writing .

		`` Political ideals must be based upon ideals for the individual life .

		The aim of politics should be to make the lives of individuals as good as possible .

		There is nothing for the politician to consider outside or above the various men , women , and children who compose the world .

		The problem of politics is to adjust the relations of human beings in such a way that each severally may have as much good in his existence as possible . ''

		Is there not a peculiar appeal in these clear old truths , so almost trite in their expression ?

		Russell keeps something of the noble intellectual - ity of Huxley and Mill , but with an added de - classed revolutionary spirit that they did not feel .

		We have no thinker in this country to do this forward-pointing work .

		What irony that it is
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	who comes from the chill and remote regions of mathematics with this liberat - ing idealism !

		From time to time , and often with surprising mildness , we hear complaints of the low quality of magazine fiction and the even lower opinions that the editors of most of our `` leading jour - nals '' have of the public that reads and runs .

		`` The New Republic '' has attained its position of authority in so short a time , since it realized from the first the force of
F. P. A.	PERSON	's epigram that the average reader was a good deal above the aver - age .

		And it is because most of the magazines still fail to recognize the essential truth of this simple paradox that they remain -LRB- at least as far as their fiction is concerned -RRB- the flabby , cheaply sensual , or falsely sentimental monthlies that fail to interest even the proverbial mid-western bar - ber 's wife for whom they were designed .

		Espe - cially shortsighted has been the `` happy ending '' fallacy .

		The theory behind tragic tales and dramas holds as good today as it did in the time of Sophocles and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		All art is an un - conscious catharsis ; and it takes a violent purge to rid us of violent emotions .

		This old philosophic platitude is given new life daily in every extreme , from a consideration of the most horrible of wars in the most peaceful of ages to a scrubwoman weeping at the movies .

		The need of violence and tragedy is something that many of our editors do not dare or do not desire to believe in .

		They forget that the great mass of people is no less interested in the dark hazards of life than were the Greeks or the Elizabethans ; they refuse to believe that the tamer we become , the wilder grows our only half-repressed imagination .

		They offer an adventure-hungry public a series of pink and white heroines with perfume in their veins , endless variations of the Cinderella-Zenda romances , wax dummies with virile pretentions on their lips and riding breeches on their souls and wonder why they can not compete with the eloquent , richly detailed , and elementary though its psychology still is the more searching spool of film .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	hints at the reason in the preface to this interesting volume , which started as a discussion around the fire .

		After a few speculations by the six who had gathered there , it became clear that , in spite of many differences , there was a taboo against the gruesome stories and `` that American editors believed the public demanded the happy ending . ''

		`` We began to call a roll of American story-tellers , and as name after name was mentioned , the question arose in our minds as to whether or not every story - teller might not have one story in his private drawer which no magazine would agree to publish because of its gruesome character .

		, The conviction grew among us that a grim story , no matter whether it was a little masterpiece or not , was hoodooed .

		And then the inspiration came .

		Why not try to find thirteen hoodooed masterpieces by thirteen un - lucky masters , and throw them upon the mercies of the public for a vote ?

		No sooner suggested than done .

		Story-tellers , critics , and publisher for once agreed .

		If there were thirteen unlucky stories in
America	LOCATION	good enough to print in a book , we would find them and publish them with our appeal for judgment . ''

		This book is the result an excellent record for the now fortunate thirteen and a definite indictment of the editors that made it necessary .

		The consistent rejection of some of these stories is nothing short of amazing .

		And the puzzle deepens as one examines them in detail .


Vance Thompson	PERSON	's `` The Day of Daheimus '' is sev - eral shades less `` grim '' than some of
Irvin Cobb	PERSON	's tales published a few years ago in so rep - resentative a publication of the middle-class as `` The
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post . ''


Dana Burnet	PERSON	's `` Rain , ''
Richard Matthew Hallett	PERSON	's `` Razor of Pedro Dutel , '' and
Wadsworth Camp	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Draw-Keeper '' might have appeared in `` Col - lier 's '' or `` Every Week . ''

		And
Robert Alexander Wason	PERSON	's ``
Knute Ericson	PERSON	's Celebration , '' far from having the prohibited `` unhappy ending , '' comes to a major and decidedly buoyant climax .

		Truly the American editor 's mind moves in a myste - rious way its wonders to perform !

		There is not one story in the volume that is mechanical , medi - ocre , or of the merely competent order that suf - fices for our monthly fiction .

		And what is similarly surprising is the distinguished style , the poetic perception , the high literary quality revealed in most of the rejected thirteen .

		Exam - ine
Vincent O'Sullivan	PERSON	's story , `` The
Abigail Sheriff Memorial	PERSON	, '' and observe how delicately yet deeply the characters , the landscape , and the psychology are etched with a masterly hand .

		I snatch one illuminating fragment a description of a house in
New England	LOCATION	from its context to indicate his power : `` Something unfriendly and depressing emanated from the house as soon as you crossed the threshold .

		If I were a practiced writer , I suppose I could bring the sensation home to you ; but as it is , it baffles me to realize it on paper .

		It was not so much a sensa - tion of mystery as of secrecy .

		Those who had died in that house , in the seventy years or more it had been standing , had not quite gone away ; something of them remained in the still rooms .

		At mealtimes there always seemed to be some other presence , or presences , at the table besides the master and mistress of the house .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 71 The word for them is subdued .

		They are subdued to the atmosphere of their house , to their traditions , to the na'ive furniture they sat among .

		This unpro - testing acquiescence in the unlovely was , of course , to be expected , given the locality .

		The tradition was the same as that of the British small tradesman , nonconformist in religion and politics the stock ^ they originated from .

		Dreary and unpicturesque religion had no doubt in the first place inspired the dreary and unpicturesque surroundings .

		In a community which had never opened its eyes to any of the arts except literature , and to that only on its inartistic side , the absence of any testimony to aesthetic needs was not surprising . ''

		It is too bad that these highly differentiated stories end on so obvious and overemphasized a note , a note that is in many ways the weakest .


Frederick Stuart Greene	PERSON	's tale , `` The Black Pool , '' has , in common with one or two of the others , a specious and melodramatic horror that tries to take the place of raw strength .

		In its very desire to adhere to a realistic programme , it ceases to be real at all and depends on a fictitious and forced romanticism ; a plot whose villain is as overdrawn , whose terrors are as stereotyped , and whose atmosphere is as artificial in its way as the pallid and precise society-fiction from which it revolted .

		Otherwise the collection is an unusual and noteworthy one , and its publication is not only a sort of trial of the public but a test of our editors .

		It is something more than an interest - ing assemblage ; it is an experiment that is also a challenge .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS OREGON THE PICTURESQUE .

		By
Thomas D. Murphy	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Oregon is one of the few states west of the Rockies that have not been advertised to the point of familiarity .

		References to it in history centre chiefly around the
Columbia River	ORGANIZATION	, which it shares with
Washington	LOCATION	for the last few hundred miles of its course , but the bibliography is limited in comparison with that of almost any other state .

		Tourists are only beginning to know it for its more spectacular sights , such as Crater Lake , the
Columbia River Highway	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Pendleton	LOCATION	Round-up .

		Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	endeavors to show that these are but a few of
Oregon	LOCATION	's claims to the attention of the world in general and motorists in particular .

		The subject is pre - sented in an informal and somewhat personal manner , as one might write a detailed record of a trip by automobile , including comment on hotels , garages , the price of gasoline , and the color of sunsets .

		Although
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	furnishes the inspiration for most of the book , the trip chronicled begins at
Sacramento	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, and includes
Lake Tahoe	LOCATION	and other points east of the
Sierras	LOCATION	on the way north .

		There is a short account of a stopover at
Reno	ORGANIZATION	,
Nevada	LOCATION	, a town which , it will occur to the reader , is one of the least familiar of places , though its name is celebrated in song -LRB- of a kind -RRB- and story .

		The chapter on Crater Lake embraces most of the data included in the
Government	ORGANIZATION	bulletins , and its originality consists principally of notes that may assist future motor - ists .

		Its value to motor tourists is , in fact , the book 's best justification , for as a piece of descrip - tive literature it does not take high rank .

		The author fails to invest the open road with the charm that it has in this region , while his por - trayal of the major scenic marvels lacks the power of conveying even a modicum of the re - actions produced by the originals .

		`` Into the Yosemite by Motor '' and `` A Run to the
Roose	PERSON	- velt Dam and to the Petrified Forest '' are articles supplementing the main narrative .

		There are automobile maps showing the routes covered , and many excellent illustrations in color and halftone .

		BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY IN
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		By
Hugh E. Egerton	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		It has often been charged `` by German publi - cists and historians that the past history of British foreign policy has been conspicuous for its display of perfidy and unscrupulousness . ''

		So impressed was a recent German writer with the vicious character of English diplomacy that , while heart - ily supporting the movement to rid his native language of foreign words , he felt that an excep - tion should be made of the word `` perfidious '' in its German form , as otherwise it would be impos - sible to characterize properly the policies of Westminster .

		Apparently Englishmen have come to feel that the charge ought to be refuted ; and Professor
Egerton	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, has undertaken to provide the refutation .

		Professor
Egerton	PERSON	is widely known for his studies in colonial history ; and since the growth of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	is in large measure the result of diplomatic activities , a student of colo - nial problems is peculiarly fitted for the task in question .

		The author has produced a readable , interesting , and useful work , but it is not likely to add to his fame as a historian .

		The book is to a large extent a compilation and gives evidence of somewhat hurried preparation , as is true of so many of the `` timely '' books that have been published since
1914	DATE	.

		Professor
Egerton	PERSON	is less concerned with the details of diplomatic history than with the opinions and purposes of the states - men who have controlled the policies of the Brit - ish foreign office ; his work is consequently a discussion rather than a narrative .

		After having 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	presented and examined all the important facts relating to English foreign policy since the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, he concludes that , while English diplomats have always watched carefully over what were supposedly British interests , the treat - ment accorded to neighbors and allies by the English government has nearly always been in agreement with the highest political morality of the time .

		He denies that the Emperor was betrayed in
1713	DATE	and that
Frederick II	PERSON	was deserted by the English in
1763	DATE	; in both instances the original issues of the conflict had been settled and there was no longer any good reason for continuing the war .

		During the wars with the French Republic and the
Napoleonic Empire England	ORGANIZATION	alone of all the countries allied against the French was steadfast in maintaining the cause of European freedom .

		Time and again
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	came to terms with the enemy and left
England	LOCATION	in the lurch ; and the record of
Russia	LOCATION	during that trying period is scarcely more creditable than that of her Teu - tonic neighbors .

		The author discusses in some detail the many difficult problems of the nineteenth-century diplo - macy , and he finds that with few exceptions the positions assumed and the methods employed by the English government have been not only defensible but in accord with rational principles .

		As one might expect , the problem of
Belgium	LOCATION	in its various phases is given a prominent place in the history .

		Professor
Egerton	PERSON	concludes his sur - vey with a chapter on British sea power : he holds that the vulnerability of the British Isles makes a large navy necessary ; that in the treatment of enemies and neutrals the English admiralty has shown less arbitrariness and ruthlessness than any other naval establishment ; and that in times of peace the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	has rendered important service to humanity , the suppression of the slave trade being cited as a conspicuous instance .

		AT THE RIGHT OF THE BRITISH LINE .

		By Captain
Gilbert Nobbs	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		A war book likely to be widely read is
Gilbert Nobbs	PERSON	's `` At the Right of the British Line . ''

		A civilian officer of the new English army , Captain
Nobbs	PERSON	was only five weeks in the fighting line .

		His small command was given what proved to be an impossible task in the fighting on the
Somme	LOCATION	, and after losing most of his men , Captain
Nobbs	PERSON	was struck blind by an unlucky bullet and lay many hours in a shell hole until found and made prisoner by the Germans .

		After a short term of captivity , which enabled him to write an inter - esting description of two German prisons , he was sent back to
England	LOCATION	where he is today , `` hap - pier , '' as he says with pathetic cheerfulness , `` than he has ever been before in his life . ''

		This is not a great book .

		It is so unpreten - tious , indeed , that one wonders why one has finished it at a single sitting .

		But as a graphic , moving picture it will hold any reader .

		The story is rapidly told , the scenes are unforgetable , the human touches vivid , and underneath all runs the tone of cheerfulness and quiet courage of the man who has forgotten that he is brave .

		Such a book is a tonic and its popularity will be richly deserved .

		A SOLDIER 'S MEMORIES .

		By
Major-Gen	PERSON	- eral Sir
George Younghusband	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		It is not the fortune of everyone , General
Younghusband	PERSON	says , `` after traveling six thousand miles and arriving in time for lunch , to discover incidentally in the course of conversation that he is expected to take part in a bloody battle shortly after the completion of the meal . ''

		But it was repeatedly his own experience .

		Conse - quently he has in greater degree , perhaps , than any other writer about modern warfare the spirit of the soldier-adventurer .

		His .

		remi - niscences reflect an unshackled joy in adventure , and an evidently keen delight in sharing his mem - ories to the full with his readers .

		`` One learns much , and sees much , '' is his own conclusion after his years on the Indian frontier and his campaigns during the Boer War , the Burmese War , and the Egyptian Cam - paign .

		The reader sees much , too , through his eyes , and possibly because the author is not con - sciously pedagogical , the reader also learns much of the feelings and the character of the men of every sort and degree that he has known .

		Of
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	and his evolution there are some interesting revelations .

		`` I myself , '' he writes , `` had for many years served with sol - diers , but had never once heard the words or expressions that
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's soldiers used .

		Many a time did I ask my brother officers whether they had ever heard them .

		No , never .

		But sure enough , a few years after , the soldiers thought , and talked , and expressed themselves exactly like
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	had taught them in his stories !

		He would get a stray word here , or a stray expression there , and weave them into general soldier talk , in his priceless stories .

		Rudyard Kipling made the modern soldier . ''

		Whether General
Younghusband	PERSON	writes of
Kitchener	LOCATION	and
Lord Roberts	PERSON	, of his dogs , his Indian servants , the too frequent sallies of other native gentlemen `` who were out for a short road to Paradise by killing a British officer , '' of the long marches over dusty Indian roads , or of life in the officer 's mess , he writes with appreciation of that individual difference in men that makes part of the infinite humor of life , with vigor and good humor , and care that every point in his narrative shall be well made .

		`` Memories , ''
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 73 from the point of view of interest and of work - manship , is one of the best collections of remi - niscences that have recently been brought out .

		One is envious of the life that has made them possible .

		THE EARLY LIFE OF ROBERT SOUTH EY , 1774-1803 .

		By
William Haller	PERSON	.


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Southey played so prominent a part in the intellectual and literary generation that sprang from the French Revolution that a competent study of him has long been needed .

		That need is now being supplied .

		Dr.
Haller	PERSON	's biography , as published thus far , brings the story down to the poet 's settlement at
Keswick	ORGANIZATION	in
1803	DATE	.

		If the second volume is marked by the same qualities of care , accuracy , and poise , the biography will be indispensable to students of the period .

		Materials for a study have not been lacking , for
Southey	PERSON	was a prolific author .

		The mere bulk of his writings has frightened scholars , how - ever , and the vanity of the man has to some extent repelled them .

		Nobody has been willing to grapple with an author who wrote endless let - ters , reviews , biographies , lyrics , and epics , and complacently deemed them all masterpieces .

		Yet the story of this man is not only worth the tell - ing ; it is rich in interest besides .

		In this interest the chief elements are his association with
Cole	PERSON	- ridge in the pantisocracy scheme , the condemna - tion along with
Wordsworth	PERSON	as a Lake poet , and the savage mockery he underwent at the hands of Byron .

		But these elements are by no means all .

		Before he settled at
Keswick	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	was an outspoken rebel against the existing order .

		He was expelled from
Westminster School	ORGANIZATION	; he was driven from his aunt 's house on a rainy night ; he was distrusted as an enemy of the country and religion .

		Yet this man , like
Wordsworth	PERSON	, only in greater degree , became in his old age a hidebound conservative .

		Burke had not loved change , but had been willing that the rotten bough should be lopped off that the tree might be saved .

		Southey grew unwilling that a single bough should be touched .

		From his beloved library by the lake he hurled anathema after anathema at the champions of political , economic , or religious innovation .

		In the course of this metamorphosis from iconoclast to conventional - ized laureate ,
Southey	PERSON	was absolutely honest and outspoken .

		That is why he is so interesting .

		He always wished that everybody should know exactly where
Robert Southey	PERSON	stood .

		In the days of his respectability , to be sure , he was vexed that his enemies should make known where he had stood when he wrote `` Wat Tyler . ''

		But this was only a token of his hatred for what he himself had once been .

		The two halves of his life show the extremes to which men rushed dur - ing the French Revolution and the reaction to institutionalism afterwards .

		On
Southey	PERSON	the writer , time has already given its verdict .

		He was better in prose than in verse , he always had merit , and yet he was always sec - ond-rate .

		Still , he played for high stakes and it often seemed he was destined to win .

		Those ambitious epics of his have nearly every analyz - able quality of great poetry .

		Southey put into them practically everything that counts except the ultimate thing genius .

		HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		By
Henry William Elson	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.80	MONEY	.

		This `` revised edition '' is merely a reprint of the original edition of
1904	DATE	, with the addition of two new chapters .

		The first , on `` The Twen - tieth Century , '' carries the story from
1904	DATE	down to the election of
1916	DATE	; another on `` Latest In - dustrial Progress and Inventions '' purports to give in some eight pages a survey of American industrial development since
1850	DATE	.

		Any ex - tended discussion of the older parts of this book is out of place here .

		The reader is referred to contemporary reviews .

		But time is a sore trier of books and especially books of history .

		In this case the author 's habit of illuminating text and footnotes with forward-looking passages and his finality of statement render the book especially vulnerable .

		The fact that similar generaliza - tions in the new chapters attempt to set matters right but calls attention to the need of real re - vision .

		Perfunctoriness might be expected in the new chapters published under such conditions , and in this the reader will not be disappointed .

		Espe - cially is this true in the chapter on industrial progress , which is not at all illuminating , is dis - tressingly inadequate , and contains many irrele - vant things that belong in earlier chapters .

		It gives the impression of being dragged in to meet the growing demand for more industrial history , and serves only to furnish the book with an anti- climax .

		The chapter on the twentieth century is better .

		But even here there is almost an entire failure to correlate events into movements or to show their significance .

		Legislative acts are listed with apparently little regard for their connec - tion with each other and less for their bearing on the industrial development hinted at in the succeeding chapter .

		The author is left with a group of miscellanies , which he must crowd into the closing paragraphs for want of some better place .

		The result of the whole is to come short of a real explanation of recent United States history , an achievement which was quite within reach .

		Since the middle of the nineteenth century a great change has taken place in American life .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	In unnumbered ways it has been apparent that
America	LOCATION	has been growing up .

		Rank individu - alism , born of our frontier and of our rapid ex - pansion , has been giving way to socialization and group action .

		At times scholars have singled out special phases of this change and given us accurate and permanent appreciations of their meaning , even while the change was going on .

		It has remained for the present decade to bring to American scholarship generally a realization of the national development as a whole which had expressed itself in these various ways to va - rious observers .

		In
1904	DATE	Dr.
Elson	PERSON	purposely foreshortened and condensed that part of his his - tory treating the period subsequent to
1884	DATE	, on the ground that the events were too close to ad - mit of proper perspective .

		Since then events have moved so rapidly and so much light has been thrown upon them that it would seem pos - sible and practicable now to present a unified story of our national development down to the present .

		There is a real place for a medium - sized history of the
United States	LOCATION	such as Dr.
Elson	PERSON	conceived , and a thorough-going revision of his book in the light of recent scholarship with a greater emphasis on recent history would be welcome .

		But it should be done rightly or not at all .

		THE MUSEUM .

		By
Margaret Talbot Jackson	PERSON	.

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		As a pioneer in its field this study of the mu - seum , its site and its architectural plan , its needs , its management , the preparation and care of its collections , and kindred matters , is a notewor - thy book .

		The author has spent several years in visiting and examining the chief museums of this country and of seven European countries , and her advice on the practical questions presented is therefore worthy of a respectful hearing .

		Among other wise counsels she urges economy of space in the architectural plan of a museum .

		The grand staircase , which in a European museum is often a reminder of the original palatial charac - ter of the building , of its having been erected in the first place to house royalty or nobility , has no useful or appropriate place in a modest museum planned for the preservation and exhibi - tion of a growing collection of art objects , nat - ural-history specimens , or other products of genius or skill , industry or research .

		On the topic of wall-coverings the writer well character - izes the too-prevalent burlap as somewhat suggestive of potato sacks .

		Miscellaneously com - prehensive museums , such as the South
Ken	PERSON	- sington and the Metropolitan , she pronounces `` monstrosities '' and advises instead a number of smaller specialized collections `` dotted about in the different quarters of the city . ''

		But there is something to be said in favor of the vastness and variety of a great museum .

		Such a storehouse of wonders attracts the young especially , and facili - tates certain studies of a widely inclusive nature and those which call for research along parallel or divergent lines .

		THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD .

		By
George A. Barton	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Instruction in comparative religions has had a varied history in American colleges .

		When it first appeared , it was as an advanced course in `` Bible . ''

		Later , anthropologists began to talk about primitive religions , diverging from them into the higher types .

		But recently sociologists have been claiming the field as theirs .

		They have not succeeded , however , in substantiat - ing their claim to any great extent .

		The present work makes one wish they had , for its author is obviously a Protestant theologian , though one who has read some anthropology .

		His work is colored throughout by the convic - tion of the Protestants that man is saved by faith alone ; his book is little more than a summary of the views which various peoples have enter - tained in regard to God , the soul , immortality , and so on .

		The following passage , which con - tains not the slightest hint that it is to be taken ironically , well sets forth the author 's opinion : `` Among primitive peoples the essential part of religion is not belief but practice .

		One must be careful to do the things that are pleasing to the gods .

		They are supposed to be pleased not with what men think of them , but by the service that is rendered them .

		The emphasis in early re - ligions is quite different from that in the so - called positive religions . ''

		As we read this book , therefore , we see a number of religious philosophies spread out be - fore us .

		One can take one 's choice .

		In con - cluding his chapter on Christianity , the author tells us that he prefers his own particular choice , and that he thinks it would be better if all men were of his opinion .

		But if men persist in disagreeing , it can , in the last analysis , only be because tastes differ ; perhaps with the advance - ment of public education tastes will be brought into closer harmony .

		But this is all that can be said so long as it is generally believed that a religion is merely a system of metaphysical prop - ositions , unanimously admitted as true by all the believers in that particular religion , and rejected as false with equal unanimity by all others , and as to the truth or falsity of which , argument is impossible .

		As a matter of fact , we are told to-day that concepts are but tools , and that philosophical systems are generally ex post facto justifications
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 75 of what we are doing or at best rationalizations of it .

		A society organized in a certain way , and pursuing certain aims , may find the metaphys - ical statement of one religion useful , and another prefer a different one .

		Thus these differences of metaphysics reduce to differences of social envi - ronment : a history of religious thought should be the story of the repercussions of society and metaphysics upon one another .

		But our author does not realize this .

		For example , in the chapter on the Hebrew religion , he speaks of the development which that religion underwent at the time of the prophets ; he is apparently oblivious of the fact that at just that time the Hebrew people were engaged in a life - and-death struggle for their national existence .

		In agony and bloody sweat ,
Isaiah	LOCATION	,
Jeremiah	PERSON	,
Eze	PERSON	- kiel , and the others hammered out a conception of God and the world , which they induced their countrymen to accept and which enabled this people to survive when another would have gone into oblivion .

		To speak of this conception as `` purer '' or `` higher '' is meaningless ; it was more useful on that particular occasion .

		In so far as all races of men are generally in a position some - what analogous to that of the Hebrews in the sixth century B. C. , this conception will be use - ful to them all though of course another may be still more useful .

		If religious beliefs were thus shown in the environment in which they were born , we might come to see that belief is not so important a part of religion as practice , after all , though of course it may determine ac - tion .

		If studies were made along this line if religions were watched working in their social environment we might eventually arrive at an answer to the perennial question of what religion is .

		To this , the most fundamental of all ques - tions in the study of comparative religions , the author gives no answer : we lay his book down no better able to answer it than we were before , nor could we recognize a new religion , if we saw it , without a label .

		TOWN PLANNING FOR SMALL COMMUNI - TIES .

		Edited by
Charles S. Bird	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Apple - ton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Civic beauty has come to be almost as much a popular demand as that for civic efficiency .

		Indeed , the two are not infrequently comple - mentary motives .

		But hitherto the smaller cities and the semi-rural communities have been sadly neglected in matters both of efficiency and of beauty .

		This little volume is a practical pre - sentation of the reasons for , and the methods of securing , planned cities and towns .

		So many communities have already embarked upon schemes for physical reorganization that it would seem scarcely necessary to raise the question of feasibility , but because many do raise a question of policy , it may be pertinent to say that the gains in property values and the greater security of life from an improved sanitation , to say nothing of bettered recreational , transportation , and civic facilities , make town-planning decidedly worth while from most or all angles from which it may be considered .

		This volume concerns itself with such aspects of town-planning as the organization and improvement of housing , parks and playgrounds , streets and roads , town forests , social life , public health , and transportation .

		The book itself is an outgrowth of the research of the
Walpole	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB-
Town Planning Committee	ORGANIZATION	, which got together for their own guidance the source mate - rials here published .

		Parts two and three of the volume consist of detailed plans for the work - ing over of
Walpole	LOCATION	and descriptions of the publicity methods employed to arouse popular interest in the project .

		The inclusion of this practical matter renders the book all the more useful as a guide to other communities seeking to rebuild themselves in a scientific and eco - nomical manner .

		ANTHOLOGY OF SWEDISH LYRICS .

		Trans - lated by
Charles Wharton Stork	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American-Scandinavian Foundation ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		There is something reminiscent of the textbook in the bird 's - eye view of Swedish poetic literature shown forth in this volume .

		It boasts not merely notes on pronunciation , textual and biographical notes , but an introductory sketch as well .

		From this one gathers that the lyric poetry of
Sweden	LOCATION	`` is inferior to none '' in quality , `` and in richness it is not far behind the best of any nation during a similar period of time , '' that is , from the mid -
eighteenth century	DATE	to the present .

		Free compari - sons are drawn between the poets represented and
Burns	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		One turns to examples of their emphasized excel - lences with an eagerness not unnaturally tem - pered by fear .

		The compiler and translator does not transmit his enthusiasm in the verse which he presents .

		The distinctions which shine out so clearly to him between the work of the
Horatian Bellman	PERSON	and the realist Froding are less apparent to one who depends on the anthology for his appreciation of them .

		One receives less a definite impression of the change and development of Swedish poetry , as suggested by the introduction , than of certain things which the lyrists of
Sweden	LOCATION	continuously celebrate .

		The awful majesty and bright loveli - ness of the forests and the fields , a cherishing of the name of
Sweden	LOCATION	, recurrence to her martial history as well as to dim , mythical legend , these inform the lyrics of both the older and the more recent poets .

		Whether the naive sentimentality 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	and morality which prevail are due to the man - ner of translation or to the poems themselves , it is difficult to say .

		Inversion and frequent dac - tyls combine to detract from that intensity which is the essence of lyrism .

		The variance between the significance of the poetry presented and that which its translator believes to attach to the an - thology weakens the effect of the interesting poems it contains .

		THE LIFE OF
ULYSSES S. GRANT	PERSON	.

		By
Louis A. Coolidge	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Of those personalities emerging from the Civil War with distinction ,
Ulysses S. Grant	PERSON	, next to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, commands the largest share of our interest .

		But for the monumental achieve - ment of the `` Personal Memoirs , '' we should doubtless have had , by this time , a greater num - ber of serious attempts to represent him through the medium of biographical writing .

		The vol - ume just added to the `` American Statesmen Series '' is written by Mr.
Louis A. Coolidge	PERSON	, and differs in general from the other volumes of the series in being less academic in style .

		Not only is the book highly readable , but it fills the need of a biography giving an adequate proportion of attention to the eight years of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's presidency .

		After a rapid survey of the early life and educa - tion of Grant , the writer engages attention upon those military operations in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Val - ley culminating in the brilliant coup de maitre at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	.

		The credit for this determining blow against the rebellion in the West is given , on the authority of General
Sherman	PERSON	, exclusively to
Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chapter on the campaign against
Chattanooga	LOCATION	shows Mr.
Coolidge	PERSON	at his best in the ability to unite picturesqueness with due restraint in narration .

		It concludes with the interesting judgment that the three days ' fight at
Chattanooga	LOCATION	was `` the most completely planned of all his battles , a feat unmarred in its perfec - tion and as a spectacle unequalled in the history of war . ''

		The `` Clinch with Lee '' constitutes the heart of what remains of the military history .

		The interest deepens at this point because of the unpromising situation in the
East	LOCATION	when
Grant	PERSON	took that situation in hand .

		That he approached his new problem with the silence and tenacity with which he conducted his western campaigns was to be expected .

		The feverish state of North - ern opinion , with its criticism and discourage - ment , is forcefully described .

		The North was impatient for the capture of
Richmond	LOCATION	; Grant , on the other hand , wanted
Lee	PERSON	's army .

		The North was anxious for a swift conclusion of the struggle ; Grant saw from the beginning that the question of endurance was involved .

		His power of offensive was his military distinction .

		His genius is ascribed to his intuition , not to his knowledge of the science of war .

		Mr.
Coolidge	PERSON	presents an informing and , on the whole , judicial account of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's presi - dency .

		The student of our history knows that this is no easy task .

		Under the burden of delicate foreign questions and the unexampled problems of reconstruction ,
Grant	PERSON	's habit of following his own counsel led him , in the absence of political experience , into numerous difficulties .

		The author brings him out of the several scandals involving subordinates in the administration without personal stain .

		It is admitted that
Grant	ORGANIZATION	erred in overdevotion to his friends , in a too rig - orous enforcement of the law in the South , in his disposition to interfere unduly with the proper function of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and in his failure to say `` good-bye '' to politics when he left the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Per contra , the biographer gives the reader a fair and interesting presentation of the achievements of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's presidency .

		The more notable of these achievements , in which
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's own statesmanship shares a highly hon - orable part , are the handling of the Virginius affair , the introduction of civil-service reform , the establishment of a basis of sound finance , and the arbitration of the
Alabama	LOCATION	Claims .

		The author quotes Grant 's `` dream '' of a world court for the adjudication of international problems .

		One of the best features of this excellent biog - raphy is the liberal quotation from
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's let - ters and state papers , written in that simple and forceful style which proceeded from his integrity and strength of character , and was prophetic of the remarkable literary performance with which he closed his great career .

		THE LIFE AND WORK OF
GEORGE SYL	PERSON	-
VESTER	PERSON	MORRIS : A Chapter in the His - tory of American Thought in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
R. M. Wenley	PERSON	.


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
G. S. Morris	PERSON	is known to students as the learned translator of
Ueberweg	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of Philosophy , '' and editor of
Grigg	PERSON	's `` Philo - sophical Classics . ''

		That is to say , his published writings are such as to suggest the suspicion that the erudition is an outer garment , and that the real personality of the man expressed itself in his life rather than in his books .

		The present study of his `` life and work '' is thus peculiarly welcome , as introducing us to the real
Morris	PERSON	, of whom most of us had caught only occasional and doubtful glimpses .

		For his is a personality worth knowing .

		Typ - ical , in a way , for the age in which he lived , his spiritual development enables us to span the bridge which separates the present from the gen - eration which has just passed away .

		Brought up in the intensely religious atmosphere of New 1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 77
England	LOCATION	, he is representative of the transition from a ready-made , traditional creed to that reasonable faith which is the outcome of whole - hearted devotion to sincerity and truth .

		Devel - oping though it does on the soil of
New England	LOCATION	traditions , his philosophical position and final spiritual home is with
Green	ORGANIZATION	, the Cairds , and other British idealists with the thinkers who enlarged the rivulet of empirical thought which trickles down through
Locke	PERSON	,
Hume	PERSON	, and Mill , so as to make room for the wider and deeper rivers which form the main stream of European philosophy , the work of
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is impossible to read the book and it is very readable without feeling that Professor Wenley is peculiarly fitted to be its author .

		It is not only the fine qualities of style and ripe knowledge * of men these one would expect from a writer of Professor
Wenley	PERSON	's reputation but the remarkable personal sympathy with every phase of spiritual experience through which Mor - ris passes , which especially impresses the reader .

		Rare glimpses of the biographer 's own personal - ity reveal a kindred spirit , who not only appre - ciates , but is one with his subject , because he has himself passed through the fire .

		This personal penetration is dominant , and produces a living artistic unity rare in literature ; so that the book is no mere biographical study , but a living drama , a true Odyssey of the spirit .

		NOTES ON NEW FICTION `` Every race , '' writes
M. Gustave le Bon	PERSON	, `` possesses a mental constitution as determined as its anatomical constitution . ''

		The clash of tem - peraments and traditions when two races are brought together in marriage has been the theme of many a novelist :
Henry James	PERSON	,
Edith Whar	PERSON	- ton ,
Pierre de Coulevain	PERSON	, and
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	.

		These international novels vary in treatment from the psychological analyses of a genius to chauvinistic pictures of conquering , athletic heroes .

		The latest venture in this field , `` Mr.
Gushing	PERSON	and Mile , du Chastel , '' by Fran - ces
Rumsey	PERSON	, is worthy of respect and thoughtful perusal .

		It is a study of the reaction to each other of the French and American types .


Paul Gushing	PERSON	marries Mile , du Chastel .

		Af - ter two years she suspects him of infidelity and leaves him ; they are divorced ; she becomes the mistress of
Arthur Irish	PERSON	, an art collector ; he tires of her ; she leaves him free ; Gushing seeks her and persuades her to return to him .

		The plot , however , is the least of the story .

		Gush - ing is an idealist who trusts to his feelings for guidance .

		With Mile , du Chastel , on the other hand , all is calculated every gesture , word , act .

		She is forever seeing nuances in what he accepts as simplicities , or simplicities in his nuances , which she can not even express to him .

		In short , they are profoundly unlike , and their love , though deep , is too delicate to stand the test of their racial antagonisms .

		He wishes to find in their marriage the beauty of the ad - venturous ; to her , their marriage has never been marriage in the French moral and social accepta - tion of the term , but her idea of the proprieties requires her to put up with what she dislikes until she is offended by
Cushing	ORGANIZATION	's imaginary in - fidelity .

		After losing him , however , she becomes sud - denly sensible of fresh nuances ; she has found
Cushing	PERSON	's points of view contagious and his re - finement of attitude and imagination unforget - table .

		She fears the uncertainty of her control over
Irish	LOCATION	and longs to return to the restrictive and conventional , so she returns to
France	LOCATION	.

		There she feels a rebirth of love for her country , and she attempts to content herself again with the significance of the perfunctory .

		But she finds her relatives narrow , their conversation confined to localisms , their social rules rigid , their capacity to feel , limited .

		In short , her own imagination has expanded ; she has insurgent rushes of feeling , impulses of rebellion , that lead her back in thought to the early days of her marriage with Gushing .

		Then Gushing himself yields to an impulse to disregard the formal codes , to which
Anne	PERSON	-
Marie	PERSON	is clinging so fiercely .

		He goes to see her , and before the interview is over , she realizes what this idealist in sentiment means to her .

		She gives up what has always seemed most im - portant to her : her personal dignity , the sense of expediency ; and consents to marry the man who had been her husband .

		Thus the author formulates the `` impasse '' of this couple for us , a formulation compact and veracious .

		She puts before us the significant episodes in their life together and shows us into what spiritual changes these contacts grow .

		She never fumbles in handling the various episodes all are rich in details ; but the details always contribute finally to the theme .

		We have nothing in our tiled apartment buildings , nor in

		It is not a sad book ; it is hilarious and pathetic .

		No pains are spared by the crafty von

England	LOCATION	; but
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	appears , like a bad fairy , to punish his Prussian pride .

		The other stories in the book are characteristic of our old friend
Holmes	PERSON	, but have been successfully developed without the aid of the needle .


Joseph C. Lincoln	PERSON	's style and his
Cape Cod	LOCATION	folk are too well known to need introduction .

		We have , in `` Extricating Obadiah '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , a simple sea cook much at the mercy of designing , unscrupulous landsmen ; a shrewd old sea captain , who comes to his rescue and more than spoils the game for the confidence men ; the step-daughter of the chief villain ; her lover , much troubled by the villain 's machinations ; and a good housekeeper , who eventually tests the sus - ceptibility of the captain .

		The story moves for - ward at a leisurely gait and is full of the humor that we associate with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	.

		In `` The Unholy Three '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB-
C. A. Robbins	PERSON	gives us the history of a dwarf , a giant , and a witless fellow who escape from a circus and go forth to spread terror of themselves in the world .

		They commit various gruesome mur - ders and always escape by means of clever dis - guises , the dwarf being dressed as a baby and the witless one as a woman .

		For one of the murders , an innocent by-stander is arrested .

		He rather enjoys the experience until he realizes that his life is in danger , for the notoriety enables him to sell the murder and mystery stories he has been trying to sell in vain .

		The book is rather better than this short resume of it would indicate , for the tale is told in a fantastic , charm - ing style .

		Mr.
Vincent O'Sullivan	PERSON	is one of those American novelists who return to their country - men with a letter of introduction from English critics .

		If he had come with only `` Sentiment '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- as a visiting-card , we should have to express a slight disappointment .

		The book has all the materials of charming comedy ; his style has a light and yet assured touch ; his manner is ingratiating .

		But just what is he trying to do ?

		The situation is comic enough : the matter-of-fact young
William	PERSON	, brought down by his aunt to the country from his hated
London	LOCATION	job to woo the plump and innocent heiress his aunt has selected for him ; his posing as a poet in order to defeat a lawyer rival ; the coming of the wilful young woman to whom
William	PERSON	has engaged himself in Lon - don ;
William	PERSON	's alarm , and his aunt 's impatience .

		The author , however , before the story is finished , deserts his opportunity for farce , to draw this neurotic fiancee in rather deep and telling strokes .

		Her intrigue with the rival assumes a tone far from comic , and leaves
William	PERSON	's fall into the arms of the heiress as a note of bathos rather than of comedy .

		The book ends with the amorous
Penelope	PERSON	seeing her hero in khaki off for the wars a note that is utterly false in such a comedy as the story began to be .

		This shift in emotional tone betrays an unexpected inexpert - ness in Mr.
O'Sullivan	PERSON	.

		And this sense of in - security one feels in him is reenforced by a sententiousness of comment which now and then cuts across the comedy .

		`` Sentiment '' seems like the work of a talented but not assured crafts - man .

		`` The Secret Witness , '' by
George Gibbs	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , and `` The Green Tree Mys - tery , '' by Roman Doubleday -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , are sops to the public that loves a mystery .

		`` The Secret Witness '' is political .

		A supposed plot of
Germany	LOCATION	's against
Austria	LOCATION	, a plot which the latter thwarts by the famous assassination at
Sarajevo	LOCATION	, affords an Englishman and an Austrian countess whom he loves , all the agonies of separa - tion caused by difference of political views .

		`` The Green Tree Mystery '' is a story of murder , sus - picion , and suspense .

		Its interest is largely due to the skill with which the author keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome .

		If romance be taken as a synonym for un - reality , then `` Fishpingle , '' by
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	-LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is a veritable master - piece of romanticism .

		We have come to the conclusion that publishers and reviewers must frequently adopt this meaning of the word ; perhaps their readers accept it as a recommenda - tion .

		All that can be seriously commended in `` Fishpingle , '' however , besides the title , is the attempt , rather half-hearted , to discuss in fic - tional terms the problem of the passing of Eng - land 's landed gentry .

		Beyond that , it is simply a conventionally cheerful story of the variety termed pleasant .

		In `` My Wife , '' by
Edward Burke	PERSON	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , a husband tells us about his wife what a deceitful , wilful , untidy person she is .

		The point of the humor lies in his unwitting disclosure of his own conceit , crudities , and faults .

		The love story is supplied by the affairs of his son and daughter .

		Here the father through stub - bornness and muddle-headedness both hinders and helps the wistful lovers .

		`` Paradise Auction , '' by
Nalbro Bartley	PERSON	-LRB- Small ,
Maynard	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is a garrulous tale that is chiefly occupied with a description of the disas - trous effect of falling in love with the right per - son after one has already fallen in love with and married the wrong one .

		It is a rather futile and exhausted subject , handled in a manner that is skilful , though lamentably typical of modern magazine fiction .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 79 CASUAL COMMEXT WHY DO NOT STATESMEN ABANDON THE HABIT of giving speeches and devote themselves entirely to talking in the sign-language ?

		This query is prompted by the kind of editorial interpretation which everywhere greeted
Lloyd George	PERSON	's defi - nition of Allied war-aims , delivered before the congress of English trade unions .

		Whatever else may be said of this speech , it was certainly the clearest and most explicit utterance which had yet come from any responsible political leader , until President
Wilson	PERSON	's moving and strikingly straightforward announcement , less than
four days later	DATE	, of the objects for which we are fight - ing .

		Its temper was admirably calm and judicial .

		The old hysterical pugnacity about a `` knock-out '' and a swaggering
Prussia	LOCATION	, the ancient vague phrases about `` crushing Prussian militarism , '' the early boastfulness and threats all seemed sublimated into a balanced , sane , intelligent address .

		Nothing could be more obvious than that
Lloyd George	PERSON	felt deeply the responsibility for continuing the war `` even for a single day '' and that he was determined to justify what he still believes its necessary continuance , not only by general principles , but by concrete application of these principles to the actual war-map of the world .

		On the whole , his effort was successful , and it is safe to assert that no speech of any Entente statesman had hitherto surpassed it in importance .

		Yet how was the speech in fact received ?

		Evidently , according to the individual predilection and caprice of the editor comment - ing upon it .

		For example , nothing could be more definite or emphatic than
Lloyd George	PERSON	's contention that the principle which is to govern all territorial settlements after the war must be that of `` self-determination , '' or , as the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	phrase goes , `` consent of the governed . ''

		Apply this principle to the difficult and delicate question of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		Does it mean the `` restoration '' of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	?

		Yes pro- vided the peoples of that unhappy province them - selves wish for it .

		In other words , it means a plebiscite , or else words mean nothing at all in statesmen 's speeches .

		Even when
Lloyd George	PERSON	comes specifically to the question , he is extraor - dinarily careful not to use the word `` restoration . ''

		He employs the milder term `` reconsideration . ''

		Nevertheless most editors jumped at once to the conclusion that
England	LOCATION	had com - mitted herself to `` restore '' Alsace-Lorraine to
France	LOCATION	, whatever the peoples of
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	might themselves have to say on the subject .

		On other points , equally wilful blindness was displayed .


Lloyd George	PERSON	did not pretend that he loved the German constitu - tion .

		Neither did he pretend that
England	LOCATION	would fight to change it , if the Germans were so perverse as to wish still to live under so archaic and feudal a governmental system .

		He expressed a wish rather than a war-aim .

		But he did make clear what he was doing .

		Most editorial writers spend all their time expressing wishes and little else , only they do n't make clear what they are doing .

		Again we ask , why do not statesmen talk in the sign-language ?

		Then perhaps our publicists could understand them .

		IT IS , ONE BELIEVES ,
MR. PERCY MACKAYE	PERSON	who has made the greatest noise about the possi - ble role of the pageant in our national life .

		He has written many , and the name of one , `` Caliban on the Golden Sands , '' has been conspicuous on the hoardings .

		All his pageantry has been pic - torial .

		Some of it has attained the dramatic ; but none of it has been intelligible .

		When one says intelligible , one means on the stage , during production , not by the fireside , in a book .

		Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	seems to be eye-minded , and to think in terms of print .

		He is a poet of tender conceits and pretty fancies , but a poet too lettered , allu - sive , and dressed-up for the necessarily broad and sweeping simplicities of the chronicle stage .

		These reflections come to one who looks over Mr.
Thomas Woods Stevens	PERSON	's `` The Drawing of the Sword . ''

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	makes a direct , specific , and unmistakable symbolization of the nations and causes involved in the war .

		His text is straightforward almost to baldness , but it has a masculine marching rhythm , and its meaning is beyond doubt .

		No wonder great audiences rose to it , again and again , miners in West Vir - ginia no less than mine-owners in
New York	LOCATION	.

		THE COMPLACENT ASSUMPTION THAT WlL -
LIAM BLAKE	PERSON	was incapable of portraiture must now give way .

		In `` Arts and Decoration '' for this month Mr.
J. E. Robinson	PERSON	makes public the presence in this country of an important
Blake	PERSON	collection `` consisting of portraits in fresco and water color , original manuscripts , drawings , and books , none of which is mentioned in any of the biographies . ''

		The collection , which once belonged to Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, is now in the possession of Dr.
John W. Bartlett	PERSON	, President of the
American Institute of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		The half hundred portraits are chiefly of men of letters and include
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Jon	PERSON	- son ,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Sheri	PERSON	- dan ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and many others .

		The
Keats	PERSON	, which is among those reproduced in `` Arts and Decoration , '' is striking for a certain refreshing vigor in the features .

		The question as to whether the manuscripts will prove as important must wait upon their publication .

		There is a fifteen page folio in verse , `` Theodicy '' ; a seven 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	page folio in verse , ``
America	LOCATION	'' ; poems on a num - ber of persons ; a
1767	DATE	`` Handmaid to the Arts , '' with manuscript poems on the fly leaves ; etc. .

		It is almost incredible that this rich collection should so long have escaped the eye of modern publicity .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	thinks the nucleus of the hidden treasure may have been a collection formed by the elder D'Israeli and mentioned by
Dibden	PERSON	in
1824	DATE	.

		The D'Israeli collection is not noted in
Gilchrist	PERSON	's `` Life of
William Blake	PERSON	, '' the manuscript of which was edited by
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	after the author 's death in
1861	DATE	.

		It happens that the
Bartlett	PERSON	collection contains a letter from
Rossetti	PERSON	which discloses the fact that in
1856	DATE	he was buying `` wonderful drawings and manu - scripts ... portraits and poems '' by
Blake	PERSON	, and also an agreement to sell them , dated the same year .

		If we assume that
Benjamin D'Israeli	PERSON	inherited his father 's collection in
1848	DATE	, that it passed to his friend
Rossetti	PERSON	in
1856	DATE	, and that
Rossetti	PERSON	disposed of it before revising
Gil	PERSON	- christ 's book , we can understand for what reason
Rossetti	PERSON	may have avoided mentioning it five years afterward .

		But such an explanation only makes the case more extraordinary : a col - lection of portraits of literary men , done by a prominent poet , passes from an author to his son , who is a popular novelist and a cabinet minister shortly to be premier ; thence to one of the most brilliant poets and painters of the day ; thence , after an interval , to the most famous actor of his day ; and finally crosses the
Atlantic	LOCATION	but receives no public mention between the years
1824	DATE	and
1918	DATE	!

		WOULD ANY SINCERE LOVER OF PEACE DERIVE JOY from pointing out the fortunate by-products of war ?

		Assuredly not .

		This is the type of casuistry so congenial to the apologists for mili - tarism one legitimately suspects the historian who attributes all the verve and splendor of Elizabethan literature to the defeat of the Armada or who makes the Peloponnesian war synonymous with the glory of Athenian civiliza - tion , forgetting , of course , that it was precisely this war and no other which destroyed that civi - lization .

		It is usually from the intellectual brothers of
Bernhardi	LOCATION	that one hears of `` the canker of a long peace . ''

		Certainly no recog - nized thinker today would urge a war merely for the sake of its spiritual by-products .

		No honest realist would attempt to balance gains and losses and call them equal .

		Of
France	LOCATION	alone , can one bear to think of the human potentialities gathered so prematurely to the earth , whose beauties might otherwise have been sung in new accents or re - flected in new forms ?

		Now , the reaction in
Europe	LOCATION	after the war may take unexpected turns .

		Many believe that when again confronted with the strange unreality of peace , the hundreds of thousands who do return from the grinding battle physically whole will be broken in will and spirit .

		Other competent observers maintain that after the war something like anarchy or at least polit - ical violence will spread slowly over the Con - tinent and perhaps embrace the British Isles .

		Yet nearly everyone agrees that the great tradi - tions of Western civilization what we know as the unbroken heritage of art and science and literature will for a generation be in supine hands .

		Lassitude and fatigue , relief from strain , will smother the creative impulses that are al - ways , in the end , the outgrowth of a gracious and liberal and economically unworried environ - ment .

		For many years after the declaration of peace the artists of
Europe	LOCATION	must call upon a Muse of somewhat grim visage .

		Art is not a flower of impoverishment , any more than phi - losophy or verse .

		And the task of carrying on those achievements and purposes in the more gracious traditions of Western civilization may inevitably fall upon us .

		The cluster of activities which we call art may have to rely upon
America	LOCATION	for the necessary vitality to continue it unbroken through
Europe	LOCATION	's barren years .

		It is a responsi - bility of which our artists and our writers are hardly yet aware , although a responsibility which ultimately they can not shirk .

		IF WILLIAM JAMES HAD LIVED ,
January 11 , 1918	DATE	, would have been his seventy-sixth birthday .

		Almost the last thing he wrote before he died was `` The Moral Equivalent for War . ''

		In these days of opposed madnesses , of the mad - ness of militarism over-shouting the madness of pacificism , it is worth while , as we recall the philosopher 's nativity , to recur to the sanity of that essay for strength and vision .

		It takes the mind from the secondary passions and interests of controversy , to their original source in the nature of man .

		It defers to that nature in its wholeness ; reverently , as is the manner of Wil - liam
James	PERSON	.

		It regards its assumptions and its repressions , and withal it finds that the adven - ture of making the world a better place to live in affords all the needed satisfactions , and more , to the `` military '' instinct and the aboriginal blood-lust whose gratification motivates so much that is war .

		We in
America	LOCATION	, under the guid - ance of the President , are set to look forward to the incarnation of the ideals of liberty , jus - tice , and democracy whose danger has led us to take arms .

		In this latter of the American phi - losopher 's works we possess an instrument whereby we may be helped to a realizing vision of both the soil and the root , the flower and the fruitage of these things .

		J918J THE DIAL 81 BRIEFER MENTION For the past forty years Dr.
J. H. Kellogg	PERSON	, who really made the
Battle Creek Sanitarium	ORGANIZATION	, has been answering questions pertaining to health , and in `` A Thousand Health Questions Answered '' -LRB-
Good Health Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , he has published some answers that he considers of most importance .

		The book may be considered authoritative , though in some regards , such as in the use of tea or coffee , the author is an extremist .

		Where medication is needed , he asks his readers to consult their physicians .

		If the versatile Mr.
Dole	PERSON	may be said to have a vocation as distinguished from his many literary avocations , it might not unfairly be considered to concern itself with
Tolstoy	PERSON	and his works .

		Years ago he distinguished himself as a pioneer in this country in the translation and popularization of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and now he has written `` The Life of Lyof N. Tolstoi '' -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- .

		No fresh discoveries or hitherto unknown facts are claimed for this retelling of the familiar story ; its merit lies in its sympathetic understanding , its compactness , and , in all essentials , its completeness .

		After Mr.
Aylmer Maude	PERSON	's two ample volumes of a few years ago we seek rather condensation than amplification in any subsequent biography for general reading and handy reference .

		This 467 - page book meets the requirements and is also notably in sympathy with the views and teachings of its subject .

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's anti-militarism is as pronounced as
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's , and in liberality of creed he is not unworthy to act as literary portrait-painter to the author of `` Reason and Religion . ''

		Not yet has the history of General
Botha	PERSON	's cam - paign in German
West Africa	LOCATION	become so familiar as to render uninteresting such details of army experience as are given in Dr.
H. F. B. Walker	PERSON	's `` A Doctor 's Diary in Damaraiand '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	, Green ;
$ 2.10	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Six months of hardship in his struggle to follow up his brigade with his hospital unit are vividly described in these notes of minor events which are none the less significant because of their comparative unimportance .

		A side-light on the vexed question of dumdum bullets is thrown by the remark of a German officer who `` was shot and captured .

		The first thing he said , when taken , was , ` Was I shot with one of our rifles or one of yours ? '

		On being told he was shot with a German rifle , he replied , ' I am done for , then . ' ''

		And the writer continues : `` One thing I have certainly noticed with regard to the
Mauser	PERSON	bullets is that , if they meet with resistance , such as buttons or bones , they are very easily stripped of their nickel casing , and the lead , spreading or breaking up , makes a very large wound ; sometimes , indeed , there are several exit wounds . ''

		The `` Hun '' of
West Africa	LOCATION	is pictured as true to type .

		He has a very elastic conscience , we are told , and `` is soldier to-day , Red Cross man to-morrow , civilian and spy combined the next , whichever serves his purpose best .

		On more than one occasion I have been asked to release German wounded because they were ` civilians . ' ''

		A reading of the book does not leave one impressed with the desirability of restoring
Germany	LOCATION	's African colonies to her after the war .

		On first noting the title of
Richardson Brigham	PERSON	's book , `` The Study and Enjoyment of Pictures '' -LRB- Sully and Kleinteich ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , one is tempted to speculate whether the author makes any malicious distinction between the study of pictures and the enjoyment of them , but one is reassured and de - lighted on opening the book to discover that art is something to be enjoyed .

		Only too often the dense fog of analysis and theory settles down between picture and spectator , embracing the emo - tions and the intellect like a strange malady .

		The author , seeking to make an abridged statement of artistic principles , wisely searches at once for the milk in the cocoanut : `` The merit of a picture lies , in general , not so much in what it represents as in how it is painted .

		As a basic quality in Art simplicity may be named . ''

		`` With simplicity as a fundamental must be closely associated Beauty . ''

		Browsing still further through the book , one encounters a wise quotation from
Innes	LOCATION	: `` A work of art does not appeal to the intellect .

		It does not appeal to the moral sense .

		Its aim is not to instruct , not to edify , but to awaken an emotion .

		Its real greatness consists in the quality of this emotion . ''

		To emphasize further the fact that literature and painting are something to be enjoyed , the author refuses to interpret works of art or literature for anyone else , which is a noble resolve .

		However , the author has evidently made up her mind about Futurism and Post-Impressionism , for she consigns them to limbo .

		There are chapters on composition , on the relation of poetry to painting , and on what pictures to see in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The function of chemistry in the development of the civilization of to-day , as well as in its appalling destruction , is made plain for the non - technical reader , if he be diligent and thoughtful , in
Ellwood Hendrick	ORGANIZATION	's `` Everyman 's Chemistry '' -LRB- Har - per ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		At least Mr.
Hendrick	PERSON	attempts the seemingly impossible task of its presentation for the man in the street .

		He may not succeed in making wholly lucid many of the obscure phases of ions and valencies , asters and ethers , and the other more formidable features of the jargon of the laboratory , but he lures the reader on from soap to candles and from bees to `` deresinified Pontianak rubber '' or , to be bald about it , cheap chewing - gum .

		In fact the industrial profiteers of crude stuffs must feel somewhat abashed to find their ways so fully explained as they are by our chemical reporter .

		One should use this book as a guide to the industrial advertising pages of our magazine press .

		There is much of the whimsical interlarded with formulae and reactions .

		It shocks the scientific mind to find the Brownian movements served up in lilting doggerel and the Periodic Law `` put into Irish . ''

		Indeed , ere one has finished the book , as he is tempted to do before putting it down , he has a strong suspicion that the author is no mere chemist , but a journalistic bull that has broken loose in the reagent room .

		One reads with interest of the magnanimous action of one chemical inven - tor ,
Frederick G. Cottrell	PERSON	, whose income-producing chemical patents now support the
Research Corpora	ORGANIZATION	- tion , while their author lives on a modest govern - ment salary .

		He learns also of the wonderful progress made in this country , since the war , in the 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 17	DATE	dye industry , with all its infinite ramifications in drugs , explosives , and photographic chemicals .

		The butcher , baker , and candlestick-maker , and all their patrons , can find much to interest , much to learn , and not a little to reread with care in these pages .

		With a fine feeling for artistic detail and setting Sir
Thomas Graham Jackson	PERSON	, the well-known English architect , presents his short book of recol - lections of Italian travel , `` A Holiday in
Umbria	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		- Less than a dozen cities of north - eastern
Italy	LOCATION	comprise the list , but each castle , each doorway of artistic importance , brings with it a mass of rich historical detail .

		And to present to the reader in the midst of this development , extracts from the famous `` Cortegiano of
Castiglione	PERSON	, '' which Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	called `` the best book that was ever written on good breeding , '' is to present him in person at that delightful court of
Urbino	LOCATION	in the fifteenth century .

		The author 's contribution to the literature of travel is a valuable one .


Thomas F. Millard	PERSON	has recently published the third of his volumes on the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		The present one , `` Our Eastern Question '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , possesses the desirable qualities of the earlier works , the voluminous appendixes made up of state papers and other documents , the gathering up of interest - ing bits of information , and the generally readable presentation .

		But it also contains all the old faults , and to a higher degree .

		The work is frankly `` a journalistic summary rather than a literary production , '' and the author might well have said , `` rather than a sober , well-reasoned , and well-balanced production . ''

		The great bulk of the work is devoted to a scathing indictment of the conduct and of the policies of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		In this part of the work , as another reviewer has said , `` he is vindictive when he should be impartial ; vitupera - tive where he should be expository ; condemnatory to the exclusion of all mitigating facts or qualify - ing circumstances . ''

		In addition , Mr.
Millard	PERSON	makes a plea for the enforcement by the
United States	LOCATION	of the so-called `` Hay Doctrine . ''

		In this argument he proceeds from false premises to generally erroneous conclusions .

		The `` Hay Doctrine '' so casually cited by Mr.
Millard	PERSON	will have to be defined by the student of international law and diplomacy rather than by the journalist .

		For one who is fairly well informed concerning what has happened in the
Far East	LOCATION	in the past few years Mr.
Millard	PERSON	's work is of little value , and for one who is not in a position to check up his statements and his inferences it may prove a source of much misinformation .

		Two interesting volumes of the `` Worth Know - ing Series '' are `` Trees Worth Knowing , '' by
Julia E. Rogers	PERSON	, and `` Wild Flowers Worth Knowing , '' adapted from
Neltje Blanchan	ORGANIZATION	's works by Asa
Don Dickinson	PERSON	-LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Paee	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	each -RRB- .

		To nature students , the names of
Julia E. Rogers	PERSON	and
Neltje Blanchan	PERSON	are well known , for they have written , in large and small volumes , of trees and flowers .

		`` Trees Worth Knowing , '' ^ for example , is a compromise between the author 's comprehen - sive `` Tree Book '' and her small `` Tree Guide , '' recently published .

		An essay , `` The Life of the Trees , '' and general paragraphs on tree and flower families contain elementary information of value .

		Both volumes are attractively illustrated in color and are of a convenient size to carry about for purposes of identification .


Alfred M. Hitchcock	PERSON	found
Japan	LOCATION	a land of unfailing and ever-fresh interest ; hence `` Over
Japan	LOCATION	Way '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is free from the ennui of the way-worn traveller and the author 's quick eye catches many points of interest which have lost their charm to the expert in Japanese matters .

		His book is therefore an excellent introduction to
Japan	LOCATION	as it is to-day , in the process of rapid com - mercialization and industrial transformation .

		He presents an occidental interpretation of this part of the Orient , sympathetic and critical without being either rapturous or caustic .

		The main points of interest to the tourist are touched upon and not a few of the less frequented paths of travel are followed .

		For a quick introduction to the life of
Japan	LOCATION	it is satisfactory and reliable as well as entertaining , a welcome relief from the indis - pensable but verbose
Terry	PERSON	and the damascened minutiae of the official imitations of
Baedeker	LOCATION	with which the enterprise of
Japan	LOCATION	is providing the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		The woman with the hoe is not so common a sight in
America	LOCATION	as in
Europe	LOCATION	; but the trend of events is fast habituating us to the spectacle of women engaged in what hitherto has been regarded by us as men 's work , and if the work is strength - ening and health-giving , there will be cause for felicitation rather than for regret at this latest industrial development .

		England has , naturally enough , gone ahead of us in discovering fresh fields of usefulness for women , and
Canada	LOCATION	, with a new country 's freedom from restraining conventions , has led the way for the parent land .

		Viscountess
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	, founder and head of the
College of Gardening	ORGANIZATION	at
Glynde	LOCATION	, depicts attractively and hope - fully in `` In a College Garden '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	-RRB- the agricultural possibilities open to young women in quest of a vocation .

		An experience of twelve years or more in teaching the more ladylike branches , if one may so express it , of farming has qualified her to speak with authority upon what may and what may not be profitably and properly undertaken by women in the tillage of the soil and the marketing of crops .

		Also , glimpses are afforded of woman 's work and woman 's capabilities in other directions .

		`` In the Claws of the German Eagle , '' by
Albert Rhys Williams	PERSON	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , the war corre - spondent for the `` Outlook , '' last year met with a favorable reception in its serial form .

		Accounts of frightfulness might have added to the attractive - ness of his story for those who enjoy shuddering , but Mr.
Williams	PERSON	finds himself unable , as an eye - witness , to record any such atrocities , and so very wisely leaves them for others to write down .

		Yet it is no flattering picture he paints of German conduct in
Belgium	LOCATION	, and without the prompt and energetic intervention of Ambassador
Whitlock	PERSON	he himself might have fallen a victim to Teutonic severity .

		IF you are paying more than
$ 49	MONEY	the price of a brand new Oliver Nine whatever you pay over that amount is merely the extra cost of selling a typewriter to you .

		By eliminating such wasteful selling methods , the price of the Oliver Nine has been reduced from
$ 100	MONEY	to
$ 49	MONEY	, without changing the typewriter in the slightest .

		Mind you , this
$ 49	MONEY	Oliver is not second hand , nor rebuilt , but exactly the same
Oliver	PERSON	in size , material and workman - ship that formerly sold at
$ 100	MONEY	.

		This
Oliver Nine	PERSON	has a universal keyboard so any oper - ator may use it visible writing , wonderful durability ,
2000	DATE	fewer parts .

		It is built in our own factories , devoted exclu - sively to the manufacture of Olivers .

		Additional factories have increased our output over 300 per cent .

		Over 600,000 Olivers have been sold .

		Among the users are such large concerns as those listed below .

		Do n't you think that you , too , should take advantage of this new economy in office equipment ?

		You save
$ 51	MONEY	without the slighest sacrifice .

		Used machines accepted in exchange at a fair valuation .

		THE
DIAL Si jFortniff & tty Uournal of Criticism	ORGANIZATION	and 2Dtecu00ton of Eiterature anu ^ t flrtg And What of Art ?

		When I was in the
United States	LOCATION	in the
early winter of 1914	DATE	I was continually being asked how the war was going to affect art .

		As if I knew !

		As if anyone knew !

		I soon became weary of this ques - tion .

		But as the war bites deeper into our lives , those who are interested in art as a living thing can not help asking it of themselves , even if they forbear from worrying others with it ; and it is worth while to face the question and see whether there is anything that can profitably be suggested in answer .

		The first thing to note is the fact that no analogies from the past are likely to help us .

		So far as we can see , the Franco-Prussian war made no difference to French art , which just went on as before .

		And one may doubt whether the far more pro- longed , world-engulfing wars of
Napoleon	PERSON	made much greater difference to the art of the countries involved , except by reac - tion .

		The Romantic movement of
1830	DATE	in
France	LOCATION	may well have been the reaction of youth from a period of drab , following on a time crowded with glorious life and itself full of the romance of action and of marvelous events .

		In
England	LOCATION	the long peace after
Waterloo	LOCATION	meant increased manufactures and a new wealth which got the kind of art it wanted , an art reflecting comfort and complacency rather than any - thing heroic or inspired .

		But this war is not like any other war , and we can not expect that the years which have irrevoca - bly altered the world for so vast a number of its inhabitants will not affect in some way all the activities of life .

		In this war the whole of a country 's population , if not actually engaged , is tried and challenged ; there is no sitting at ease , a remote and indifferent spectator , as in older days .

		And the artists of the young generation in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	at least ; I can not speak with knowledge of the other coun - tries are most of them in the war them - selves , those that have not already given their lives .

		On the day I write this I have seen
Wyndham Lewis	PERSON	, the leader of the Eng - lish Vorticists one of the groups inspired by the new reaction from `` representative '' art on his way back to the front .

		He is now a gunner in
Flanders	LOCATION	.

		He told me he wanted to paint a picture of a gun-pit , and he was sure that with his intimate knowledge of the guns he would produce something of far more character than the pictures by those artists who draw such subjects from outside after a casual visit .

		Since he has the real artist 's gift , as well as the gunner 's knowledge , he is probably correct , and I hope he may get the chance .

		Already in
England	LOCATION	we have had many pictures of the war from
Nevinson	LOCATION	, a young artist who was something of a Cubist but who , from contact with the moving and terrible reality of war , has struck out a new style , in which his pre - occupation with geometrical forms finds a natural outlet .

		Modern war-machinery , the march of drilled men , the searchlights and aeroplanes , give him the straight lines and angles formerly wooed rather forci - bly and capriciously from peaceful and reluctant landscapes .

		But it is not only the young men , those who have been in the actual fighting , men like
Nevinson	PERSON	and like
Eric Kennington	PERSON	-LRB- a painter who promises great things -RRB- , who have painted at the front .

		JMuirhead Bone ,
William Orpen	PERSON	, and now
Augustus John	PERSON	are among the brilliant painters who have been sent on official missions to portray the war for
Britain	LOCATION	or
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It is somewhat sur - prising , indeed , to find how well the authorities have chosen , how awake their advisers have shown themselves to the liv - ing forces in English art .

		But , after all , pictures of the war wo n't 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	in themselves make a new art .

		The war may beget images as terribly memorable as
Goya	ORGANIZATION	's `` Desastros de la Guerra , '' and the deeply flowing currents of art remain in their old channel .

		Artists as a race have a faculty for remaining wonderfully impervious to external circumstances .

		Yet can we relegate this planet-convulsing war to external circumstances ?

		Does it not go too deeply into mankind 's experience ?

		It comes to us all man , woman , and child , noncombatants no less than soldiers as discipline , suffering , sacrifice .

		We endure and hope through it all , but not perhaps till it is over shall we - realize either the extremity of the stress we have borne or the tremendous changes it has wrought .

		It is then that we may expect a difference in mood among those who express , in whatever form , the desires and emotions of men .

		Was there not in the years just preced - ing the war 's outbreak a wave of restless - ness and violence visible in the arts , among the young men ?

		It seemed an energy that craved to break itself upon something , it did not quite know what .

		I think it may have been partly the result of the tenden - cies which had imposed themselves on modern painting .

		Pictorial art has been trying to empty itself of content .

		The dogma that one should paint only what one sees with one 's eyes had been widely accepted .

		The fear of being `` literary '' had become a perfect terror .

		Hence a narrowing-down of theme and motive , and an enforced passivity in the artist .

		Then came a younger generation which wanted to conquer a new kingdom , but was still afraid of imagination and romance , and , using the same meagre stock of subjects , tried to force into them a significance they did not possess .

		Primitive and savage art have come into fashion ; the advanced youth are all for the fierce emphasis of the roughhewn .

		Ludicrous things sometimes result , as when one sees a picture of what , twenty years ago , would have been a cozy group in a parlor , ambitiously trans - formed into savagely angular figures , with a false air of being tremendously signifi - cant of something for which there is no motive in the picture .

		It seems to be a hunger to be heroic in style , combined with a determination to have nothing heroic in subject an outbreak and a suppression at the same time .

		Curiously , art seems to have anticipated the atmosphere of war before the war itself exploded .

		I will not prophesy about the effect of the altered world on the arts ; I will only say what I hope .

		That is that art may recover its full freedom .

		The lat - est movement in art is of real value , in spite of numberless eccentricities , affectations , and incongruous applications of a new for - mula , because it tends to get away from surface-imitation , to liberate energy , to bring into use a more direct and vibrant means of expression .

		What it lacks is adequate content ; it tortures itself with self-consciousness , obsessed by theories of revolt .

		It is not human enough .

		Well , I hope that in the world of new experience after the war , art will no longer be afraid to take all that is human for its province , will picture for us things imagined as well as things observed .

		To confine painting to what is presented to our eyes is to rob it of a whole world of riches , the world of dynamic movement , of forms in com - plex rhythm , which imagination alone can master and express .

		Why turn away from that mine of creative symbol , for fear of being called `` literary '' ?

		Poets are not reproached for being pictorial in their poetic way .

		Painters need not become `` literary , '' in the only sense in which that term is a condemnation I mean by trying to express in paint what words could bet - ter express because they take into their range of subject matter not only sense - impressions but the memories , the dreams , the central emotions and spiritual desires of our race .

		Triviality of approach is a worse sin even than encroaching on another art .

		And if once painters can rid themselves of the bad old habits of the studios , the dressing-up of posed models and the copying of them so posed in a static arrangement against a pseudo-nat - uralistic background , there will not be the prejudice now justifiably prevalent against the painting of history and legend .

		A con - gruous and coherent symbolism , the find - ing of an idiom in which the essence of a theme can be pictorially expressed , with no false out-of-key elaboration of the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 95 parts that is what is wanted : a method that uses the spirit and not the letter .

		Whether the style be summarily short - hand or piercingly imaginative in detail does not matter , so it be personal and native to the artist .

		Intensity , conviction , human emotion , directness , breadth these are the essentials .

		And here , it seems to me , is the true , as yet unrealized , goal of the new movement in contempo - rary art , which as yet is so uneasy and restless because it is so clogged by lega - cies of dogmas it has no need for .

		The tragic and spirit-searching experience of the war , the wrestle of fundamental causes which underlies all its waste and horror , draws us down into the burning elements and energies of man .

		Why should not these find as direct and potent expression in painting and sculpture as in poetry and music ?


LAURENCE BINYON	PERSON	.

		The Folk Culture of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	Cumberlands I venture to assert that , in spite of all that has been ' written , less is really known about the Cumberlands than about any other corner of the country .

		The reason is that those who have done the writing have usually had a very slight , or else a very narrow and limited , knowledge of their subject .

		Often they have had none at all , at first hand .

		This applies particu - larly to the novelists .

		I know of two mountain novels whose authors had never seen the mountains .

		Not , of course , that it is in the least necessary to see them .

		The mountain novel has become stand - ardized , and anyone can easily get the formula .

		Several stock types the moon - shiner , the feudist , and the rest con - stantly reappear in them , and the dialect is passed along from one hand , or mouth , to another .

		But the novelists are not the only offen - ders .

		The same evidence of superficial acquaintance is to be encountered in much that is not fiction .

		It is to be encountered even in the work of such a writer as Miss
Ellen Churchill Semple	PERSON	, who is an author - ity on the relation of geographic environ - ment to historic development , and whose article `` The Anglo-Saxons of the
Ken	PERSON	- tucky Mountains , '' which appeared orig - inally in the `` Geographical Journal , '' is , all things considered , the best descriptive account of the mountain world of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky .

		To begin with ,
Miss Semple	PERSON	's title is a misnomer .

		She herself admits the pres - ence of Scotch-Irish , French Huguenot , and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch elements , though she seeks to minimize this admission by the rather loose assertion , regarding the former , that they are `` largely Teutonic in origin '' ; but she says nothing at all here of the aboriginal element , which she refers to elsewhere as `` insignificant . ''

		Now , on the contrary , Indian blood is widely diffused , and it is a question whether there is a single family without at least a trace of it .

		Some families have much more than a trace .

		In short , far from being `` the purest Anglo-Saxon stock in all the
United States	LOCATION	, '' as Miss
Semple	PERSON	calls them , these mountaineers are perhaps the most composite ; though the thorough - ness with which the melting-pot has done its work , and the freedom from any recent tide of immigration , may entitle them , in a very special sense , to be called `` pure Americans '' types strangely prophetic , it may be , of the Americans of the future .

		But the most remarkable passage in
Miss Semple	LOCATION	's article is that dealing with the negro .

		If the mountains have kept out foreign elements , still more effectively have they excluded the negroes .

		This region is as free from them as northern
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		There is no place for the negro in the mountain economy , and never has been .

		In the days of slavery this fact had momen - tous results .

		The mountains did not offer condi - tions for plantation cultivation , the only system of agriculture in which slaves could be profitably employed .

		The absence of these conditions and of the capital wherewith to purchase negroes made the whole Appalachian region a non-slave-hold - ing section .

		Hence , when the rupture came between
the North and South	ORGANIZATION	, this mountain region declared for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and thus raised a barrier of dissatisfaction through the centre of the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		It had no sympathy with the industrial system of the South ; it shared the demo - cratic spirit characteristic of all mountain people , 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	and likewise their conservatism , which holds to the established order .

		Having , therefore , no intimate knowledge of the negro , our
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountain - eers do not show the deep-seated prejudice to the social equality of the blacks and whites which char - acterizes all other Kentuckians .

		It would be difficult to compose a single paragraph more completely packed with misstatements and false conclusions derived therefrom .

		There is , indeed , but one gleam of truth in it .

		This appears in the last sentence .

		It is a fact that the mountaineers do not show the deep-seated prejudice to the social equality of the blacks and whites which characterizes all other Kentuckians ; but it is not a fact that this is because the mountaineer has no intimate knowledge of the negro , though the theory is undoubtedly a convenient and comfort - able one for the `` other Kentuckians , '' who can find in it a sort of negative support for their own attitude .

		For there are negroes in the mountains .

		Not many , to be sure , and not in all parts alike ; but still enough , and of sufficiently wide distribu - tion , to confute Miss
Semple	PERSON	's broad state - ment of fact , and to discredit her theory based upon it .

		There are negroes in
Clay County	LOCATION	, where they are thick-settled all about
Manchester	LOCATION	, the county seat ; and there are negroes also in
Knott	LOCATION	and
Perry	PERSON	coun - ties , where they have their principal set - tlements on the waters of
Carr	ORGANIZATION	's Fork .

		What is more , these negroes are all the descendants of slaves , and of slaves held in the mountains .

		For it is , again , not true that slavery did not exist there .

		The mountains as a whole certainly did not offer conditions for plantation cultivation ; but there are certain creeks with broad bottoms that did , and slaves were owned there , precisely as they were in the
Blue Grass	ORGANIZATION	.

		These sections , moreover , did have a very decided sympathy with the industrial system of the South , sided with Secession , and fought for it ; so that , in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, at least , the mountains were by no means the absolute barrier of disaffection they are represented to be .

		Indeed , the division of sentiment which marked the state of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky as a whole , extended right through this southeastern end of it .

		Hence the bit - ter guerilla warfare that raged there , and hence the dominance of the Democratic party in at least one mountain county
Knott	PERSON	at the present day , and its strength in several others .

		For there is by no means that `` staunch adherence to the Republican party '' on the part of the mountaineers as a whole , that
Miss Semple	PERSON	speaks of later on in her article , and it was not so many years ago that a party of `` furrin '' women daring and devoted settlement workers riding through the North Fork country , came near being mobbed by the mountaineers because they displayed an American flag , known in that particular locality only as the Republican , or `` Radical , '' emblem !

		I have thought it worth while to men - tion these misstatements , first , because so far as I am aware they have never been corrected before ; and second , because they illustrate so well the prevailing ignorance about the mountains , even among those who , like
Miss Semple	PERSON	, herself a Kentuck - ian , have actually been there .

		I am not , however , primarily interested in ethnolog - ical questions ; nor do I , as Miss
Semple	PERSON	does , attach any particular importance to these racial differences , an importance which clearly cloaks an Anglo-Saxon chau - vinism in her case , as when she turns certain admirable traits of the mountain - eer his gentle , gracious manners into a tribute to the `` inextinguishable excellence of the Anglo-Saxon race . ''

		My own prin - cipal preoccupation is with the civilization , the culture , of the mountain people , or perhaps more exactly , with the cultural survivals among them ; and these , I am quite prepared to admit , are pretty nearly pure Anglo-Saxon , or English .

		It is really amazing , when one considers the number of racial elements that have entered into this strange mountain amal - gam , how little they have contributed to the common store .

		Or it would be amaz - ing , if we did not already know how com - pletely one culture can dominate , and eventually supplant , all other cultures , even when it is that of the Submerged minority as in
Rumania	LOCATION	, where we have the spectacle of a nearly pure Slav people with a Romance language and literature .

		I have met mountaineers with German
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 97 names , such as
Schell	ORGANIZATION	,
Huff	PERSON	,
Gayhart	LOCATION	,
Amburgy	LOCATION	,
Eversole	PERSON	,
Reisner	PERSON	, and so on , who could recall that their grandparents spoke German ; but not a vestige of that tongue remains in the mountains to-day , or , indeed , anything else that is specifically Germanic .

		For surely we can not so regard that Faustian legend of a man who sells his soul to the Devil , a legend which one encounters everywhere and of which , in one of my mountain tales , I have given a version almost verbatim as a mountain story-teller told it to me .

		It is the same , or nearly the same , with the French ; since the few French words , or derivatives , that survive such as `` ner - vous '' -LRB- nerveux -RCB- for `` strong , '' `` muscu - lar '' ; and `` denounce '' -LRB- denoncer -RRB- for `` announce '' may very well have entered into the popular speech -LRB- as the second , of course , did into legal phraseology -RRB- long before the migration to
America	LOCATION	.

		In one instance what persists , apparently , is not the word itself , but the idea underlying it .

		In the little village of
Hindman	PERSON	,
Knott County	LOCATION	, there is a settlement school , the first of its kind instituted in the mountains .

		Among the buildings that belong to it is one small cottage , high up on the hillside , where tired workers may rest and recuper - ate .

		It is called `` Rest Cottage . ''

		But the village people have another name for it , `` pouting-house . ''

		Now one has only to consider the derivation of the French boudoir from bonder `` to pout '' or , in the older sense , to `` absent oneself '' in order to perceive the curious interest , if not necessarily the etymological signifi - cance , of this quaint mountain coinage .

		When we come to the Scotch-Irish or , better , the Scotch and Irish for there are both the case is somewhat different .

		Certain traits of the mountaineer suggest the
Scotchman	PERSON	, and a trace of the Scotch dialect is often discernible in his speech .

		Also , there is his passion for theological discussion , coupled with the harsh ,
Cal	LOCATION	- vinistic cast of his historic creed .

		Finally , he may have contributed to the common stock of songs and ballads ; though it is difficult to determine to just what extent , inasmuch as the two countries ,
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	-LRB- Lowland -RRB- , constitute , I believe , a single area for the folklorist .

		Next to the speech the mountain speech at once so fresh , so vigorous , and so archaic ; so close to that of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans these songs and ballads are , of course , the chief cultural possession of the
Cumberlands	LOCATION	.

		There , favored by the widespread illiteracy , they have been handed down from generation to gener - ation by authentic oral tradition .

		Every - one to-day knows something about the romance of their recovery there , long after it was assumed that they had all but disappeared from the modern world .

		It was on this assumption that the late Pro- fessor Child made his monumental com - pilation of `` English and Scottish Bal - lads , '' deriving them almost entirely from printed sources .

		He included a few vari - ants reported to him as still surviving in the
United States	LOCATION	but he attached no importance to them , and after his death those who , in a sense , became his heritors committed themselves to the view that bal - lad-singing , like ballad-making , was a lost art .

		Yet to-day between 70 and 80 of
Child	ORGANIZATION	's 305 have been identified on Amer - ican soil , besides many not included in his collection , some of which he doubtless never knew .

		In this number , however , it is necessary to distinguish between those found in such sophisticated sections as
New England	LOCATION	, and those collected in the South , where alone they may be said to survive in any vital sense .

		Of these last Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, the head of the move - ment in this country , gives a total of 42 .

		Mr.
Cecil J. Sharp	PERSON	includes versions of only 33 in his recent book , `` Folksongs from the
Southern Appalachians	LOCATION	, '' which is largely confined to the
Carolina	LOCATION	moun - tains ; but since then he has visited
Ken	PERSON	- tucky and increased his bag to 46 .

		He has also taken down a thousand tunes .

		For the modern collector understands bet - ter than the old that the ballad is not a mere literary composition ; it is song a form of musical speech , or story-telling .

		This speech lingers to-day , as perhaps nowhere else in the civilized world , on the lips of men and women in the
Smokies	LOCATION	and in the
Cumberlands	LOCATION	.

		In
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	tells us , only the old people , past seventy , sing these ballads ; in this country 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	he hears everyone sing them , even the chil - dren especially the children .

		I myself have heard them everywhere on the creek , in the cabin , in the cornfield and I know of nothing more strangely moving than to listen , in those lost lands , to the slow , mournful , tragic strains of such forgotten old-world songs as ``
Barbara Allen	PERSON	, '' `` The Jew 's Daughter , '' and `` The Turkish Lady . ''

		Nor is the initial creative impulse itself by any means exhausted .

		Indeed , in nearly every community will be found someone who `` follers makin ' ballets . ''

		A robbery -LRB- rare occurrence in this region -RRB- , a railroad wreck , an assassination , like that of
Goebel	PERSON	or
Marcum	PERSON	any one of these affords fitting material for a new folksong which , married to some old tune , passes thus into general circulation , to be sung alone or to the accompaniment of banjo or dulcimer .

		For the mountaineer has an instrument of his own , no less than a distinctive music and literature .

		It is a curious instrument , and there is considerable mystery as to its origin .

		In fact , the one thing absolutely certain about it is that it is not a dulcimer , that instrument being , of course , one whose strings are struck with little mallets , or hammers , whereas these are plucked , or `` picked . ''

		Nothing resembling this so-called moun - tain dulcimer has been found among the peasants of
England	LOCATION	.

		The suggestion has been made , therefore , that it may possibly be the degenerate form of some court instrument brought over by an early gen - tleman-adventurer one of
Raleigh	LOCATION	's , per - haps , since there is a tradition that they found their final refuge in the moun - tains .

		But this is , to say the least , doubt - ful ; for , as far as I know , there is nothing among the courtly lutes , viols , gitterns , or citoles that shows the slightest affinity with it .

		My own theory is that it is descended from the medieval monochord , once common throughout
Europe	LOCATION	and still found among savage races .

		It is true that the monochord has , as its name implies , only one string ; but two of the three strings of the dulcimer are merely the `` drone '' strings that are found equally in other descendants of the monochord , such as the hurdy-gurdy and the `` zithers '' used by German peasants and
Vosges	LOCATION	mountaineers as late as the eighteenth century .

		It is to these last , perhaps , that the mountain dulcimer comes closest .

		Indeed , there is in the Metropolitan Museum an instrument , catalogued as `` German ,
18th Century	DATE	, '' that seems to be identical with the standard
Kentucky	LOCATION	type .

		If this description is correct , then of course the question of origin is settled .

		But the dulcimer has nearly disappeared nowadays in favor of the inevitable banjo , and the ballads are fast following after it .

		Nothing primitive or peculiar can long withstand the advance of civilization in the

		Progress is very rapid at the present day , and will be still more rapid when the war is over and the price of steel rails recedes .

		The whole region is one vast coal field , and the railroads are invading it from every direction .

		It will not be many years before every creek has its spur , its mining town , and its coal tip - ple .

		Then goodbye to the ballad and all that strange , fascinating , semi-barbarous life that has so long survived in these hills and has made them the `` Balkans of

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 99 The Structure of Lasting Peace VIII THE ORGANIZATION OF PEACE The business of organizing lasting peace is , after all , only the business of making more extensive , deeper , and more thorough-going in application the irreduci - ble principles which are the commonplaces of all community life .

		They are so implicit in the simplest act of cooperation between men that it is not until they are maimed and bruised as they are par excellence by war that they are ever brought to vividness and focus .

		Ironically and pathetically enough , we then herald them as original and triumphant methods for creating and organizing international amity , although they have been known and repeated since the days of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's `` Repub - lic . ''

		What are some of these ancient principles to which the war has brought a new dignity ?

		The history of social development is largely the history of the acquirement , as private property , by a few peoples and by a few individuals among those peoples of most of the tools and materials of life .

		One phase of history then becomes the attempt of the expropriated to recover a control over the necessities of life , a chance for freedom , and a hope for happiness .

		What we call the principles of democracy and nationality is simply a shorthand sign for this endeavor .

		Its success is marked by the socialization of what is private , by the application of the principle of `` emi - nent domain '' the substitution of the rule of law , which is only force made imper - sonal , for the rule of force , which is only law taken by the individual into his own hands .

		Hence , between states , exclusive sovereignty has invariably meant interna - tional anarchy ; equalization of sovereign - ty , international peace .

		As for the peace within the nation there is the law , be - fore which all men are equal , so for the peace between nations there must be a law before which all nations are equal .

		Such an equality does not mean similarity .

		On the contrary , such an equality means the opportunity for each natural human group to liberate , to develop , and to perfect its spontaneous natural differences from its fellows .

		The cases of the Irish in the British commonwealth and of the Poles under Prussian rule will aptly illustrate how these principles apply .

		Fifty years ago
Ireland	LOCATION	was a landlord - ridden country with a terribly exploited and miserable agricultural population .

		It was a population overtaxed , underfed , and hunted , Catholic in religion yet paying tithes to the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was without opportunity for decent edu - cation , without means or help wherewith it could preserve and study and develop the Irish language and literature and the other contents of the Gaelic culture .

		In
1869	DATE	essential reform began .

		The Prot - estant
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	was disestab - lished and disendowed ; the expropriation of the landlord and the establishment of the Irish peasant was begun , and the gov - ernment with its law and its credit has ever since stood behind the latter against the landlord .

		It initiated and is still car - rying on a great housing reform ; it gave aid to home industries ; it made local self-government universal ; it created a department of agriculture and technical instruction for the whole island ; it estab - lished and endowed the
Irish National University	ORGANIZATION	, with its headquarters in
Dublin	LOCATION	and with colleges in
Cork	ORGANIZATION	and
Galway	LOCATION	; it made knowledge of the Irish language obli - gatory for entrance .

		This language , be - cause it was the speech of the poor and the miserable , with prosperity began to be abandoned by the Irish in favor of English .

		The event follows the definite law of imi - tation which governs such matters .

		The law operates in precisely the same way in the
United States	LOCATION	, where immigrants aban - don their mother-tongues for that of the English-speaking upper classes .

		The Irish politicians noted the process but gave no heed to it .

		When the Irish Renais - sance came and the
Gaelic League	ORGANIZATION	was organized , it was not the politicians but the British government that endowed its endeavors , and endowed the teaching of 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	Irish in the public schools .

		Indeed , since
1901	DATE	the government has paid about
$ 60	MONEY	, - 000 a year from the Imperial funds for these purposes twice what was collected in the same period from voluntary con - tributions in
Ireland	LOCATION	and the rest of the world .

		The result : four million Irish - men , mostly small farmers , have lent the British government very nearly
$ 250,000	MONEY	, - 000 since the war broke out .

		The Irish Renaissance has added to
Ireland	LOCATION	's phys - ical as well as spiritual stature .

		Home Rule is here an issue beside the point , and no one would pretend that the Irish prob - lem is solved .

		The significance of the sit - uation is in the fact that the establishment of equality before the law for the Irish has liberated the Irishman , given him at any rate the beginnings of prosperity , and made him loyal to the British common - wealth and the war to the extent of almost a quarter of a
billion dollars	MONEY	.

		Now consider Prussian
Poland	LOCATION	: the Prussian policy has offered the Poles the alternative of extirpation or Prussianiza - tion .

		For a score of years the Prussian government spent
$ 5,000,000	MONEY	anually try - ing to buy out the Polish landowners ; and failing that , enacted repressive laws ; and finally , in
1908	DATE	, passed a law providing for the compulsory expropriation of Polish landowners who would not
Prus	PERSON	- sianize .

		Although
the Treaty of Vienna	ORGANIZATION	definitely provided for religious and cul - tural freedom for the Poles that then came under Prussian dominion , the use of Polish at public meetings is prohibited .

		Since
1873	DATE	German alone may be taught in the national schools ; teachers , under a decree of
1899	DATE	, may not speak Polish in their own homes .

		Teaching the language and possessing Polish literature are crimes punishable with imprisonment .

		The Poles are unequal before the law , and their atti - tude toward
Prussia	LOCATION	expresses the inequal - ity .

		As Plato points out in the first book of the `` Republic , '' there must be honor among thieves if thieves are to make com - mon cause against honest men .

		How much the more amongst honest men if they are to live in freedom and safety !

		And that the system of exclusive sovereign - ties makes every nation think of every other nation as a thief , should become clear even after a cursory reading of history .

		Only if the common bases of the com - mon life , only if the world 's highways , harbors , raw materials , and undeveloped lands are possessed and used in common , only if a violation of community can be swiftly and adequately punished , can men be free for the life and the pursuit of happiness appropriate to each accord - ing to his kind .

		In a word , we require no political nostrums to secure lasting peace .

		We need only shift our attention , and profit by our own example .

		How may this may be done ?

		Well , turn to the conduct of the war itself , par - ticularly to its failures , for answer .

		In the past three years there have arisen occasions when complete military victory might perhaps have been attained by the armies of Democracy .

		Such victory is indispensable , and we must go on fighting until it is won ; we must go on killing yet more and more of the most hopeful and bravest of our blood , and leaving more and more of the future in the hands of men too old for preoccupation with any - thing but the past , in the hands of back - ward-looking men .

		Why ?

		Because , in truth , though the democracies have been fighting a single enemy , they have not been fighting a single war .

		Between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Rumania	LOCATION	, between
Italy	LOCATION	and
Serbia	LOCATION	, even between
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	there have been conflicts of desire .

		Each was fighting first for its own ends , then for the common end .

		Lacking a common end , there could not be a common front ; lack - ing a common front , there could not be final victory .

		So our soldiers paid and our workers paid for the illusion of exclusive sovereignty .

		So they will continue to pay unless the precarious alliance of the democ - racies is turned into a real one , into a gen - uine international organization .

		It took the defeat of
Rumania	LOCATION	, the disintegration of
Russia	LOCATION	, the Italian debacle to teach us this .

		And we have still much to learn .

		As
Norman Angell	PERSON	has pointed out again and again , military victory is indis - pensable , but not sufficient .

		Only the mobilization of the public opinion of the democracies in behalf of a democratic and lasting peace can actually establish such a peace .

		The needed mobilization requires
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 common understanding and assent between the democratic powers , particularly be - tween the powers of the West and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The President 's message of
January 8	DATE	recognized this necessity in clear and vig - orous terms .

		Prostrate in a military sense as
Russia	LOCATION	seems to be , she is today the one saving and constructive factor in the whole international situation .

		To those who have been following the political history of
Europe	LOCATION	since the German assault upon civilization began , it must be clear that the Russian revolu - tion has not merely overturned Czardom and its bureaucracy ; it has seriously shaken the whole war-breeding structure of secret diplomacy among the Allies .

		It upset the arrangements of the misguided
Paris	LOCATION	Conference ; it strengthened liberal - ism in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	; the Bolshevik publication of dynastic trea - ties shamed into withdrawal and retire - ment the ruling Tories who had made them ; the Bolshevik negotiations with the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	have now exposed the duplicity of the German government and have farther deepened the gulf between the government and the German people .

		Lord Lansdowne 's magnificent protest was made possible by the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	.

		The religiously uncompromising adherence to the international position by the leaders of the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	has thrown the prepon - derance of influence at last with the plain people of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Without it , the second of the great constructive formations of the war , the new
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, could not have been encouraged to announce so radical a programme ; without it the state - ments of
Lloyd George	PERSON	and President
Wilson	PERSON	would hardly have been forthcom - ing .

		The
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are making the war not only a war for democracy , but a war at last of democracy and by democracy .

		For when the war began , the Tories everywhere got into the saddle .

		They were the men of affairs and enterprise , accustomed to dealing efficiently with large matters .

		They controlled , as they still are controlling in this country , men and mate - rial to please themselves .

		The masses of the people were only to feel , to pay taxes , and to serve in army and factory .

		The masses of the people everywhere did so willingly and happily .

		Labor gave up its rights , and intellect its necessary preroga - tive ; and a heyday of profiteering , tax - dodging , and bitter-endism began .

		But the people soon grew restive .

		England and
France	LOCATION	changed the incidence of taxation ; their governments deferred more and more to the condition of labor , though not to its position .

		Liberalism and intelli - gence were everywhere censored and repressed .

		Secret diplomacy prevailed ; the obvious will of the people to a just and democratic and lasting peace was ignored .

		An abyss developed between peoples and governments , an abyss which
Lloyd George	PERSON	's address to the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	closed in
England	LOCATION	, but which the intransigeant attitude of Clemenceau widens in
France	LOCATION	.

		Governments , speak - ing for the future of capital , saw peace in the old terms of diplomatic deceit .

		Peo - ples , war weary , hungry for freedom and happiness , saw peace in the new terms of a commonwealth of nations .

		Friction and unrest began to show themselves , with one terminus in the Rumanian debacle and another in the Italian disaster .

		Mean - while came the Russian revolution and the fear of it and revulsion against it by the Tories , embattled everywhere but in the trenches , where Toryism can not survive .

		Accusations , condemnations everything that the interests who saw their preroga - tives threatened thereby could hurl , was hurled against the revolution .

		Mean - while events in
Russia	LOCATION	took their inevitable course .

		Two provisional governments that failed to execute the deep-lying will of the Russian people for a just , demo - cratic and lasting peace disintegrated and disappeared in much smoke and some blood .

		The history of the present
Bol	PERSON	- shevik administration merits all that Pres - ident
Wilson	PERSON	said of it , and much more : it is the one fertilizing force that through - out
Europe	LOCATION	is making governments answerable to peoples .

		By its mere being it is forcing an extension of the scope of democracy not less in
England	LOCATION	than in
Rumania	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The one country where it has not this effect is the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The reasons are not too ambiguous .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	at least I will not say our government 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	has an international vision coincident with the Russians ' .

		The very causes that brought us into the war throw together the hopes of the two democracies .

		And so the government of the
United States	LOCATION	has from the beginning stood by the new
Russia	LOCATION	with men , material , and opinion ; and it has in this carried out the will of the American people .

		But the vocal class of our country , the class that controls the press , that is amassing fortunes because of the war , that resists equitable taxation such as our allies have ordained , that is administratively in the saddle , and that demands the -LRB- to it -RRB- profitable establish - ment of permanent and universal military service this class has opposed that coop - eration .

		It has done all it could , by denunciation and what not , to destroy the understanding , precarious at best , between
Russia	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		So has it given aid and comfort to the enemy .

		It has strengthened the morale of the enemy by creating materials that the enemy gov - ernment could use in urging the German people to go on fighting in `` self-defence . ''

		It has used patriotism as a cloak for par - tisanship , and national loyalty for local advantage .

		It has been loud in denounc - ing freedom of speech and of the press .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	this class , the
Junker	PERSON	and ruling class , has been heard and discussed far more than any other American class .

		To the Russian democracy they are
America	LOCATION	, and until the democracy of
America	LOCATION	makes itself heard as the democracy of
England	LOCATION	has made itself heard they will remain
America	LOCATION	.

		Today it is not believed in
Russia	LOCATION	that President
Wilson	PERSON	will be able to carry out that wise programme of war aims , restated upon the demand of the democracy of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Only the action of American labor , in common with all our country 's other liberal forces , discussing and endorsing these aims , can awaken that belief .

		Only the action of labor , in com - mon with all our country 's other liberal forces , in demanding and helping to create an international machinery , can make that belief secure .

		Such action will render dem - ocratic and lasting peace inevitable .

		It will enable the democratic allies to reap the full benefit of military victory because it will detach the German people from the German government .

		It is an action that must be taken at once , in common with the workingmen of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It means getting efficiently behind our President at home and holding up the hands of our soldiers abroad .

		But how is such action to be taken ?

		What is to be asked for and how is it to be obtained ?

		All the peace conferences that have ever been , have been held by diplomats under appointment and behind closed doors .

		How can the forthcoming conference be held otherwise ?

		There is no precedent .

		But there is a precedent , and a prece - dent that is absolute in similarity .

		It is to be found in the history of our own country .

		We do not regard it as a prece - dent , because we have come to think of the
United States of America	LOCATION	as one nation .

		But between
1776	DATE	and
1787	DATE	the thirteen independent and sovereign states that underwent the American Revolution were in precisely the same position and con - fronted precisely the same problems , in principle , as the present states and gov - ernments of the world .

		They won through to a combination of interstate unity with state sovereignty from which we benefit today .

		There is far less reason why the peoples and states concerned in the present war should not win through , and by methods analogous or the same , to an analogous end .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 103 Our
London	LOCATION	Letter -LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The war poets are always with us ; and as if there were not enough of them appearing every day , Mr.
E. B. Osborn	PERSON	has made a selection of pieces which have already been published and has called the volume `` The Muse in Arms . ''

		Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	is a member of the staff of the `` Morning Post , '' which is almost the only paper in
England	LOCATION	which has not paid even lip-service to the creed that the winning of the war stands above our ante-bellum internal quarrels .

		But in spite of this it is perhaps the most vociferous and blood-thirsty of all the organs which demand a fight to the finish , and Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	himself re - joices in a sort of academic blood-lust which is terrifying to witness .

		Even our determined jus - qu ` auboutistes I am one of them can not bring themselves to believe that war is a thing in itself good or to do anything but deplore the necessity under which we find ourselves of continuing this riot of misery and pain .

		But from the begin - ning Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	has taken the attitude that slaughter is the queen of outdoor pastimes and has written about it very much in the spirit of a football reporter who has at last found some - thing worthy of his most frenzied paragraphs .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	caricatured him mercilessly in `` Boon , '' drawing him in several pictures as the embodiment of the martial spirit .

		One of them that I remember was a spirited composition enti - tled `` Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	, in a moment of virile indig - nation , swiping St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	one with a club . ''

		But Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	survived ridicule that would have oppressed a man whose thirst for blood was less fervent , and the great `` Morning Post '' building in the
Strand	LOCATION	still echoes daily with his calls for carnage .

		But , oddly enough , this quaint aberration has done nothing to rob him of a taste in literature singularly fine and exact .

		His newspaper arti - cles have always been distinguished by a curious talent for apt and unhackneyed quotation , and his judgment and skill have enabled him to make a very presentable volume out of a highly miscel - laneous mass of material .

		He has not given each of his poets in a lump but has divided his book into sections according to subject and has arrayed the pieces really `` in the most poetically effective order , '' as Palgrave called it .

		It can not be said that the war has yet produced much which could startle any critic who tested it by the highest standards of English literature , but it has pro- duced a dozen or more fine pieces and a mass of stuff the average level of which is really much higher than we had any right to expect .

		All the established favorites are here , set against a back - ground of lesser work which Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	has disposed so cunningly as to draw from it the utmost effect of which it is capable .

		Indeed the only offense committed against literary standards is that the book is so well edited as to make a great many poems seem better poetry than they actually are .

		The chief weakness revealed is one that can be detected not only in our own war - poetry but also in that of previous ages ; namely , a certain lack of concreteness .

		Love-poets write , thank Heaven !

		not only about Love but also about love-affairs .

		War-poets prefer to confine themselves to War , and the best of them seem unable to come to grips with the things that hap - pen in war .

		This has been due in the past largely to the fact that poets have not often been fighters and , like wise men , have dealt very gin - gerly with affairs of which they had no first - hand knowledge .

		Most of the men writing to - day , though they have the requisite first-hand knowledge , are imitative souls and can not get past the only models available to them .

		But the few who are real poets are getting closer to the facts , and we shall have the full fruit of their experience when the war is over .

		Meanwhile Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	's anthology provides an excellent interim report from the poets upon the matter , and at the same time it owes much more to its editor than anthologies usually do .

		Were Mr.
Osborn	PERSON	to encounter my timid attempt at prais - ing him , he would no doubt repudiate it and call me I am not a constant reader of the `` Morn - ing Post '' and so I am not aware of the present state of its vocabulary of abuse , but I think he would call me either a Bolshevik or a Bolo .

		But he would be wrong .

		And I am inclined to believe that if he could read the thoughts of some of his fighting contributors he would call them
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and Bolos also , and be equally wrong .

		One at least among his contributors has pub - lished a volume which deserves to be better known than it can be by a few extracts in an anthology .

		Mr.
Robert Graves	PERSON	is a captain in the
Welsh Fusiliers	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is also a son of Mr.
Alfred Perceval Graves	PERSON	, who wrote `` Father O'Flynn '' and other well-known pieces .

		These two influences , presumably , have bred between them an odd mongrel of a book called `` Fairies 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	and Fusiliers , '' which it is the kind of book that calls for a personal recommendation has given me huge and undiluted pleasure .

		Mr.
Graves	PERSON	has a pleasant phantasy , a strong , whim - sical sense of humor , an equally strong vein of poetry , and a good style ; and he has just man - aged , as the mythical sergeant advised his men , not to take this war too seriously .

		He is gay without affectation and can be proud without pomposity or false sentiment , as in this first stanza from `` To Lucasta on Going to the Wars for the
Fourth Time	ORGANIZATION	'' : It does n't matter what 's the cause , What wrong they say we 're righting , A curse for treaties , bonds , and laws , When we 're to do the righting !

		And since we lads are proud and true , What else remains to do ?

		Lucasta , when to
France	LOCATION	your man Returns his fourth time , hating war , Yet laughs as calmly as he can And flings an oath , but says no more , That is not courage , that 's not fear
Lucasta	PERSON	, he 's a Fusilier And his pride sends him here .

		The easiness of the piece substantiates its swag - ger , and a certain exactitude in the style justi - fies the presumption implied in using the name
Lucasta	LOCATION	.

		This poem is a genuine and individual attempt at expressing a genuine and individual emotion .

		And in some way the poet has con - trived to get far enough away from his trench experiences to make vivid pictures of them in a few words , as : Here by a snowbound river In scrapen holes we shiver , And like old bitterns we Boom to you plaintively .

		This is not quite what we expected our best war-poetry would be when we should get it at last ; but after all what right have we , in a war of surprises , to predict exactly what kind of war - poetry it will produce ?

		Enough that Mr.
Graves	PERSON	has genius and that he writes neither haughtily about War nor vulgarly on subjects suitable for recitation , but sincerely and humanly about what he himself has felt .

		Mr.
Graves	PERSON	is included with other new poets in the new volume of `` Georgian Poetry '' which has just appeared for
1916-7	DATE	.

		Among the other new men are Mr.
Robert Nichols	PERSON	, whom I have mentioned in a previous letter , and Mr.
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	.

		Both of these are soldiers and owe , I think , some of their popularity to the fact ; and both of them show promise and should improve considerably when they have forgotten the war .

		Neither of them can render military experience as can Mr.
Graves	PERSON	.

		`` Georgian Poetry , '' of course , is a periodical publication , purporting to gather up every couple of years or so the best verse which has been produced .

		Such a venture is obviously open to criticisms , which are , as obvi - ously , not sufficiently profitable to be worth the trouble of making .

		I will content myself there - fore with random observations , such as that it includes Mr.
J. C. Squire	PERSON	's magnificent poem `` The Lily of Malud '' and an outwardly less impressive but deeper piece by him called `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There are also six very remarkable pieces by Mr.
W. J. Turner	PERSON	.

		Eighteen poets in all are included ; but of the rest I will only men - tion Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	, and him only because , having established for himself a factitious popu - larity in
England	LOCATION	, he will probably soon make an attempt on the American public .

		I can see in his work only a sort of essence of bad poetry , all the poetical common-places of all time embodied in a language of the utmost splendor , the meaning of which is very imperfectly understood by the author .

		I can not see , for example , anything but sheer pretence in this : Lord Rameses of
Egypt	LOCATION	sighed Because a
summer	DATE	evening passed ; And little Ariadne cried That
summer	DATE	fancy fell at last To dust ; and young
Verona	LOCATION	died When beauty 's hour was overcast .

		Theirs was the bitterness we know Because the clouds of hawthorn keep So short a state , and kisses go To tombs unfathomably deep , While Rameses and Romeo And little Ariadne sleep .

		It seems to me to be nothing more than the merest manipulation of the counters of poetry , an appeal to facile emotion , what in short is called by low-down newspaper reporters a `` clutch-at - the-heart-strings story . ''

		I would not thus go out of my way to attack Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	if he had not made a reputation ; Heaven knows there are too many bad poets for even the most zealous of critics to be always weeping over them .

		But I hereby solemnly warn the American public against Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	's verse .

		I may be wrong .

		It may be that , instead of showing too patently the effects of a study of
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- with others -RRB- , he is the
Swinburne	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- with others -RRB- of our time , all in one .

		But I think not .

		It would have been more profitable perhaps to have left myself space to say something about Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's new `` Moments of Vision '' instead of attacking a man who has never done me any harm for , after all , I am under no compulsion
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 105 to read Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	's voluminous and rap - idly increasing works .

		But , on the whole , I think I have done right .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's book is a glorious collection of over one hundred and fifty new poems , not one of which is not thoroughly characteristic , none of which are without merit , and a large proportion of which are in his very best manner .

		But there is nothing new to say about Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	.

		As is only natural , he shows no special change or development .

		He continues to perform miracles with a style which would at once sink any other poet to the bottom ; and he sends the reader away in a state of mind in which only delight at the power of his poetry mitigates the profound gloom it induces .

		Thistles and Grapes in `` Professor
Sherman	PERSON	's Garden ON CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE .

		By
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Holt	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		To say that Professor
Sherman	PERSON	's book is a reprint of essays from `` The Nation '' would not give an adequate description of it .

		For the es - says have been retouched , have been adjusted to one another as component parts of a general scheme , and have been provided with an intro - duction of some explicitness , as well as with a Shakespearean epilogue to drive the thesis home .

		In addition to all these points , which disclose themselves gradually , the reader is met at the start with a motto from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	on the title-page and a dedication to
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	.

		These last arouse expectations or apprehensions .

		Arnold 's line says : `` Man must begin , know this , where nature ends . ''

		Nature , one soon comes to surmise , means that body of `` natural men '' who are more intent on indulgence in in - dividual latitude than on a due deference to an established social organization .

		More specifically , and for the purposes of this book , the `` natural - ist '' is the writer who gives the natural man and his lawless ways support and countenance , and who shows but a light regard , or none , for the conventional framework of things as they have come to be .

		Possibly the blackest of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's betes noires though not the most important is The - odore
Dreiser	PERSON	, as he shows himself in his five notorious novels .

		Those who feel that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's work is essentially a complete nega - tion of all artistry will think that he has re - ceived too much attention has drawn too much space too emphatically employed .

		But the critic is determined to drive his point home .

		He will make the distinction between a `` naturalist '' and a `` realist . ''

		The realistic novel , he maintains , is a representation based on a theory of human conduct , whereas a naturalistic novel is a repre - sentation based on a theory of animal behavior .

		Thus is
Dreiser	PERSON	sealed of the tribe of Zola and branded as a follower of a discredited theory of fiction .

		If
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	is the blackest of Pro- fessor
Sherman	PERSON	's beasts ,
George Moore	PERSON	is the `` highest '' the most odoriferous .


Moore	PERSON	, it is declared , denies the notion of a rational self - determination , of an intelligible object guiding a man to ideal ends : man is but the victim of the same unconscious energy that animates the beasts of the field .

		But to maintain the concurrence of nature in the moral ends of man is impossible .

		The fork in the road awaits us : either `` we must turn to the right with reason to guide us into the walled and steepled cities and the civil life of our kind , or turn to the left and trust to instinct . ''

		In that case , there lies ahead the land whose chief offer is but the flush and fading of sensual excitement .

		`` When a man has shaken off the bonds that united him with civil society , the only confession that he can make of sig - nificance to civil readers is that such emancipa - tion is exile . ''

		But , after all , Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's favorite bete noire appears to be
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		A recent American critic has declared that
Wells	PERSON	will be thought to have played in his own time a part much like that played by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in his : `` Wells , on Education , on Criticism , on Politics , ... even on Religion , continues the propa - ganda of Arnold . ''

		This , Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	indig - nantly and with full circumstantiality denies ; he finds , with a circumstantiality as full , the earlier Wells not in
Arnold	LOCATION	but in
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		This serv - ice , he thinks , should be gratefully received by
Wells	PERSON	and his followers : `` for I have denied him the rank of a Victorian critic only that I might elevate him to the rank of a Georgian angel . ''

		An analogue equally acute and startling `` places ''
John M. Synge	PERSON	.

		Synge 's years in
Paris	LOCATION	left their mark .

		He became steeped in
Anatole France	LOCATION	: `` the two men are absolutely at one in their aloof , pyrrhonic irony and their homeless laughter the laughter of men who have wan - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	dered all the highways of the world and have found no abiding city . ''

		Synge , among the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, was as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	or as
Loti	LOCATION	in
Polynesia	LOCATION	: `` he wished to escape into a per - fectly strange and virgin environment '' ; and `` the drift of all his work is to emphasize the eternal hostility between a harsh and repugnant world of facts controlled by law , and the inviting realm of lawless imagination . ''

		Well , all these items are on one side of the ledger .

		Let us look a little on the other .

		Come , here are
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	and
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		Yes , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.


Henry James	PERSON	, it will be recalled , gave due recognition to
Bennett	PERSON	's prodigious accumulation of facts , but asked , in effect , `` Where does it all get you ? ''

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	gives the answer .

		He quotes
Bennett	PERSON	's own words : `` The full beauty of an activity is never brought out until it is subjected to discipline and strict ordering . ''

		This represents , says Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, the views of a man who has taken his stand against
Wells 's Utopia	ORGANIZATION	on the one hand and
Dreiser	PERSON	's jungle on the other .

		Such views , as old as civilized so - ciety , have the conservative complexion of all tra - ditional and enduring things .

		The line of prog - ress in human society can not possibly lead `` back to nature '' society being in great part an or - ganized opposition to nature .

		The promptings and inclinations of the natural man the man detached from social relations are not to be ap - proved and encouraged .

		No novelist can quite afford to treat a small detached group `` in the round . ''

		Socialized man cries for relationships and background .

		Nothing less praiseworthy than amorous wantonings in an ethical vacuum or , what is just as bad for the present purpose , a social vacuum .

		That way
D'Annunzio	PERSON	lies .

		A novelist who paints men in preference to tigers , supermen , or scientific angels , justly says our author , has interestingly taken sides .

		His pref - erence is indeed `` an entirely discussible ` criticism of life . ' ''

		The essay on `` The Democracy of Mark Twain '' contributes less to the cause .

		I find it perfunctory and pumped-up .

		I do n't blame the writer .

		If I were doing an essay on
Mark Twain	PERSON	, I should be even more perfunctory and pumped-up .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	seems to feel it ap - propriate that he , a highly literate inhabitant of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, should show himself ap - preciative and sympathetic toward one of that valley 's major literary lights .

		But he does n't quite bring it off .

		He is too self-disciplined , too refined , too fastidious .

		I know the type , and like it .

		Let us pass on to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Shakespeare is present because our author finds him the most interesting and suggestive of living writers .

		His presence helps one to distinguish the value of his competitors .

		His humanism serves as a measure of the degrees of their naturalism .

		Banish the current notion that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was but a neutral , unmoral , unconscious creative force .

		On the contrary : he knew immensely well what he was about .

		Though he ranged through various planes , he `` dwelt habitually in that cleared and settled and spacious region of con - sciousness in which a man 's thinking is right and his feelings are sure , in which the elementary human values are fixed , in which truth and good - ness and beauty remain the same from age to age . ''

		All these differing names by no means exhaust the items found in Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's ledger .

		Vary - ing testimonies in addition are wrung from
George Meredith	PERSON	,
Henry James	PERSON	, and even from that `` complacent tory , ''
Alfred Austin	PERSON	.

		But we know by this time about where we stand .

		We are asking for a definite social order , and we re - quire that man be responsibly exhibited in re - sponsible relations to that order .

		But what are that order 's characteristics ?

		The fixed , the static .

		We are in the qualified paradise of the middle - aged conservative .

		The young man of the new generation and the young-spirited genius of the earlier generation must not bumptiously , defi - antly , deliriously presume to ask for change .

		This order is , in perhaps too great a degree , one in which an exceptional Middle-Westerner has been found worthy to write for `` The Nation '' and now enjoys the privilege of dedicating his volume to its former editor .

		It is an acceptable order , of course , but one in which even the best of us does well to mind his p 's and q 's .

		This is all just a bit of a pity .

		For Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	really offers us many acute and many weighty pages ; there is a subterranean stream of humor from whose half-hidden courses one may occasionally sip a gratefully saline draught ; and his intro - duction , which is really the essence of the book , begins on a charming , captivating note , and rises toward the end , where the war enters , to a tone of noble gravity .

		Yet one finds a little too much deference , however cloaked , for our farther East , and an unwillingness to give recognition to the fact that this spinning world must change .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 107 A Pilgrim Interprets the Promised Land AN AMERICAN IN THE MAKING .

		The Life Story of an Immigrant .

		By
M. E. Ravage	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Harper	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In my Bahama picture gallery I have a pic - ture of a walk along the flat shore of
Andros	LOCATION	, now on a curving beach , now on a rough-cobbled , shrub-bordered path a walk where neither coral sands nor cocoanut trees nor translucent seas were as usual first claimants on attention ; but in their stead a retinue of barefoot little girls , no longer shy and dumbly curious , but full of questions about the world outside or of chat - ter about that notorious island pair , B ' o
Rabby	PERSON	and B ' o Boukee , in whom the stranger from
New York	LOCATION	had shown such unexpected interest .

		On this occasion , however , it was the questions rather than the folklore that appealed to me .

		`` They say you can go in a store in
New York	LOCATION	and get everything you want ; is that so ? ''

		`` Is it true houses in
New York	LOCATION	are ten story high ? ''

		It was a fairy land they wanted to hear about .

		As we neared the settlement where lived the old man who told so well the `` ol' storee , '' I could not forbear adding to the legend of
New York	LOCATION	that after all there were no beaches there to run on , no seas to swim in , no piles of pink conchs , but little sunshine and much cold .

		But in this supplement the children were not in - terested .

		They were as little interested as I find certain
New York	LOCATION	friends in accounts of life or culture outside of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Some years ago I had a `` revelation '' of
New Mexico	LOCATION	of its mesas and skies , of its Indians and ranchers and returning home I tried to share the revelation ; but I soon saw it was impossible to give the friend who slept between linen and silk , and who ate a five course dinner served by Englishmen , any desire to sleep between blankets on a roof or eat from a common bowl off an earthen floor , even were she to wake to glorious sunrises or to find sitting next to her hospitable members of a race whose culture allured to endless study .

		Such indifference of one culture to another as
New York	LOCATION	has of
New Mexico	LOCATION	, or such mis - understanding as
Andros Island	LOCATION	has of Manhat - tan
Island	LOCATION	, is described with marvelous skill and charm in `` An American in the Making . ''

		For the townspeople of
Vaslui	LOCATION	,
Rumania	LOCATION	, the
New York	LOCATION	legend is initiated by the return of a townsman bringing with him such impressive presents as a safety razor , a fountain pen , and a music box .

		From an American millionaire the unwitting ex-Rumanian is elevated in popular fancy into a prefect , a minister , and at last , that he may live up to the picture , by his own admis - sion , into an American Ambassador .

		Then with fervor indeed he sets in to preach the gospel of
New York	LOCATION	, pointing out in the advertisements in the Yiddish papers he has with him the choice positions offered to all , even to girls in that amaz - ing land where girls are not a burden .

		In
New York	LOCATION	is one not paid even for voting ?

		There were other reports : `` that in
New York	LOCATION	the rail - ways ran over the roofs of houses ; that the dwellings were so large that one of them was sufficient to house an entire town in
Rumania	LOCATION	; that all the food was sold in sealed metal pack - ages ; that the water came up into people 's homes without having to be carried ; and that no one , not even a shoemaker , went to the temple on
Saturdays	DATE	without wearing a stovepipe hat . ''

		In - flamed by such lore , the
America	LOCATION	fever spreads and in the year
1900	DATE	a national exodus across seas begins .

		The propertied classes are the first to go , selling houses and farms and forest-hold - ings , and giving away their personal goods in such quantities that trade comes to a standstill .

		For the poorer sort the Walking Movement de - velops , a phenomenon curiously reminiscent of the Children 's Crusade .

		As a belated member of one of these pilgrim groups our autobiographer himself starts forth , leaving home with two gold napoleons sewed into his waistcoat and in his bag the gold-clasped prayer-book given his mother by his father at betrothal .

		When he has arrived in
New York	LOCATION	and the
East Side	LOCATION	, his spirit of high adventure becomes an acute sense of depression , broken only by bewilderment over the life he sees his own people leading .

		He sees them eating cake for breakfast , and meat twice a day , not to speak f eggplant in midwinter and cauliflower , a rar - ity at home at any season .

		They even drink beer in their houses .

		To go to market his kins - woman wears the taffeta dress she had been mar - ried in .

		To clean her kitchen she uses soap too good at home to wash clothes with , and this kitchen and the other rooms are located on the third floor , whereas at
Vaslui	LOCATION	only the rich lived upstairs , and only one flight up at that .

		And yet in this kitchen his kinswoman and her baby would sleep at night on the washtubs , and the parlor sofa became a bed for four boarders , with others sleeping on the floor .

		The air was fetid and the elevated road clattered by the sealed up 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	windows .

		And at home was it not only the very lowest people who kept boarders ?

		As for the other shifts to make money the newcomer sees his townspeople put to Here was
Jonah Gershon	PERSON	, who had been the chair - man of the hospital committee in
Vaslui	LOCATION	and a prom - inent grain-merchant .

		He was dispensing soda-water and selling lollypops on the corner of Essex Street .

		This was
Shloma Lobel	PERSON	, a descendant of rabbis and himself a learned scholar .

		In
America	LOCATION	he had at - tained to a basket of shoe-strings and matches and candles .

		I myself recognized young Layvis , whose father kept the great drug store in
Vaslui	LOCATION	, and who , after two years of training in medicine at the Uni - versity of
Bucharest	LOCATION	, was enjoying the blessings of American liberty by selling newspapers on the streets .

		More and fuller pictures of the seething life of the
New York	LOCATION	ghetto follow , of that life which is neither Old World nor New , where as one of `` the semi-independent allied states of the miniature federation of the East Side '' a gay Rumanian city is `` framed in the stench and squalor and the oppressive , noisy tenements of
New York	LOCATION	's dingiest slums '' ; where vermin and filthy ways unknown at home are taken as a joke ; where respect for the elders has disap - peared , the elders aping the `` Americanism '' of their more facile juniors ; where `` a grossness of behavior , a loudness of speech , a certain repellent American smartness in intercourse , were thought necessary if one did not want to be taken for a greenhorn or a boor '' !

		Max , who at home was known as
Mordecai	LOCATION	in this land names , like the rest , lose their dignity and romance
Max	PERSON	passes through the greenhorn period of struggle , starvation , and disappointment , an experience known to the
East Siders	LOCATION	as `` purification , '' a heart-breaking circle in which American clothes are necessary to get the job without which Amer - ican clothes are ungetable .

		After peddling and tending bar Max reaches the sweatshop , his cradle of liberty and first university .

		Here literature and labor problems and socialism are talked of ; here books are read during the lunch hour ; and here Max becomes aware of the cleavage of East Side society into `` clodpates '' and `` intelli - gents , '' those who care more for dollars than ideas , who work hard so that some day they may have others to work hard for them , whose amuse - ments are dance hall or card party , and whose course is that scrupulous respectability which qualifies for business success and , let me add , even for the possession of an opera box in the Metropolitan and those whose nights are spent in school or lecture hall or at serious plays , young people to whose radicalism the only choice is between socialism or anarchism , who are ut - terly intolerant of the American heathen given over to wealth and show , and who keep an ever burning faith in the regeneration of human society .

		After vicissitudes in private night school and public high school
Max	PERSON	, the indomitable , turns away from the intelligentsia of the East Side to seek out `` the real Americans '' and to qualify for the professional life he has always dreamed of .

		He enters the
Missouri State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dis - cerning and subtle as are the pictures of the con - tacts between
Vaslui	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, they are surpassed by the pictures of Max in the
Western	LOCATION	college town , where he felt farther from
New York	LOCATION	than in
New York	LOCATION	from
Vaslui	LOCATION	.

		From the spiritual fervor of the
East Side	LOCATION	it was a far call to the practical indifference of the Mis - sourian to things of the spirit .

		Talk of religion was tabooed by the college boys ; their Christian - ity they took as a sort of drug to make them feel good .

		Socialism was dreaded by them , and all reference to sex was precluded except by way of the funny story .

		Their worship was of the `` strong man , '' their talk was mostly of ath - letics , and their cult was football .

		A football match in full swing had all the solem - nity and all the fervor and color of a great religious service .

		The band and the songs , the serpentine processions and the periodic risings , the mystic sig - nals and the picturesque vestments , the obscure dra - matic conflict with its sudden flights and hot pursuits , the transfigured faces of the populace , the intense silences alternating with violent outbursts of approv - ing cheers and despondent groans all this was plainly not a game but a significant natioml worship .

		A diverting bit of ethnology , is it not ?

		The East Sider grasped these general aspects of alien life , but in little personal ways he was baffled by his college mates .

		He could not make his successive roommates stay with him ; he found it was but a matter of time for them to look the other way when he spoke to them , or to take the other side of the street .

		Their manners were not his .

		Too `` polite '' for decisiveness in argu - ment , yet they would go whistling about indoors ; insistent on elaborate introductions -LRB- one of the oddities , let me say , not only of
Missouri	LOCATION	but of certain American circles anywhere -RRB- , yet they would toss biscuits at one another in the dining - room .

		To get into touch with them the in - domitable adventurer read
Mark Twain	PERSON	aloud for the vernacular and labored over the Mis - sourian vocabulary ; he set about acquiring that lore of field and forest and workshop taken for granted by his fellows but sealed to him ; he even joined the cadet corps and went scrupulously to chapel , although the speeches bored him and
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 the prayers jarred .

		The harassing discipline and the tragic loneliness were made supportable by a growing realization that , given the normal openness , and even the warmth , of the distinctive pioneer neighborliness of the Missourians , if he was not taken in among them the fault was not with them but with himself .

		That insight went far to take the conceit out of him and to give him , as he truly observes , something novel for an East Sider a sense of humor .

		Finally
Max	PERSON	made a college friend , his first American friend , and the exchange of values friendship brings rescued him from his heart - sickening isolation .

		Even this process in denat - uralization has its price , however ; for when Max returned in the vacation to his people in the
East Side	LOCATION	he seemed different to them , and to him the atmosphere around them had become re - pellent .

		Even the ardent revolutionary meeting he attended with his girl friend seemed a sham what did they know of Americans ?

		Given this stirring of the defensive impulse , it needed but the genial welcome Max received on his re - turn to college for his allegiance to be made valid , for him to feel that now at last he was an American .

		An American , yes , if you like , but not a Mis - sourian , and not a
New Yorker	LOCATION	, East Side or West Side or
Morningside	LOCATION	, indeed not the product at all , thank God !

		of those American - izers who would purify the newcomer of the dross of the Old World and improve him by making him as much like themselves as can be a practical , clean , and humorous American , uncritical of spiritual values , without passion , drab and anaemic .

		These loud mouthed senti - mentalists to whom the city slum is merely an importation , better at that than the conditions of life the immigrant has escaped from , and the immigrant himself blank paper to write on or fresh putty to mold , these complacent and fatu - ous Americanizers will find scant comfort in `` An American in the Making . ''

		Indeed , there is perhaps little encouragement in the book for any American if the experience of the immi - grants in bulk be considered a vastly demoral - izing experience .

		And yet a country is revealed where there are at least no insuperable walls for the spirit that will not succumb in the small - est degree to the mere pressure of untoward cir - cumstance .

		That indomitable spirit is incorporated , as nowhere else in the country , in Jewish youth .

		In it , too , are incorporated other inspiring traits .

		As far as
North America	LOCATION	is concerned the Jews are indeed the chosen people .

		To what other element in the population can Americans look for that leaven of spiritual fervor they so sorely lack ?

		Unfortunately the function is not always recognized even by the Jew himself .

		The dif - ferentiation between `` clodpate '' and `` intelligent '' is not limited to the
East Side	LOCATION	.

		Throughout
America	LOCATION	the Jew tends to be either the betrayer of modern culture or its regenerator , the leader in science or the exploiter of gullibility , the fem - inist par excellence or the cadet , the interna - tionalist or the profiteering politician , the Judas or the Jesus of American society .

		But not as a portrayal of the Jewish spirit nor as a recognition of its leaven , not as a study in Americanization , despite the rather unfortu - nate title and the occasional lapses to conform to title , is this book primarily arresting .

		It is a remarkable sketch indeed of contacts between diverse cultures , but it is not alone an ethno - logical sketch ; it is a picture of the life of the spirit , it is literature .

		In its ironic restraint and subtle interpretation the book is unsurpassed , it seems to me , in the literary art of this country .

CLEWS PARSONS	PERSON	.

		The ` Painted T -RRB- evil of Politics THE UNITED STATES AND PANGERMANIA .

		By
Andre Cheradame	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.00	MONEY	. -RRB-

		M. Cheradame is an ingenious gentleman who has spent some twenty years of his life elaborately proving a plot which everyone knew existed beforehand ; namely , the
Berlin	LOCATION	to
Bagdad	LOCATION	railroad scheme of the German im - perialists .

		In fact the `` plot '' was so fully known in
England	LOCATION	before the war that the Eng - lish government had come to a written agree - ment with the German government concerning a division of capitalization in the project .

		This agreement had been sanctioned by the dip - lomatic representatives of both powers and awaited only the formal approval of their re - spective governments .

		Yet
M. Cheradame	PERSON	did a useful service in pointing out the dangerous political ambitions involved in this seemingly innocent commercial enterprise .

		He discovered Pangermanism and he labored to make others see its menace .

		Unquestionably it would have been of immense value to the Allied nations if they had given more heed to
M. Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's warning and admonitions before the war began .

		110 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31 Today	DATE	, however , the value of his advice is ex - tremely questionable .

		Why ?

		Because the basic presumption of
M. Cheradame	PERSON	that the
Pangerman	PERSON	plot has been largely accomplished is in fact a false presump - tion .

		Furthermore , in so far as
Pangermany	LOCATION	does exist today , it is , paradoxically enough , an asset to the Allies rather than an asset to Ger - many as such .

		Mittel-Europa is not so much an accomplished fact for Prussian militarism as a precarious adventure already bristling with difficulties and likely to collapse totally on the resumption of peace .

		And as to Pangermanism outside Mittel-Europa well , ask the Ham - burg exporter , ask the
Berlin	LOCATION	business man , ask the
Munich	LOCATION	manufacturer for Argentine how much of that
Pangermania	LOCATION	exists today .

		Not even
M. Cheradame	PERSON	pretends any longer that there is serious danger from German influence beyond the seas .

		He still clings , however , to his idea of
Middle Europe	LOCATION	, and he never tires of to quote President
Wilson	PERSON	's phrase `` From
Hamburg	LOCATION	to the Persian Gulf the net is spread . ''

		Now what warrant has anyone for saying that Mittel-Europa , in
M. Cheradame	PERSON	's sense , is by no means an accomplished fact ?

		First of all , let us look at the map to which he himself so frequently refers us ; just where is the British line today in Palestine ?

		Is it this side of Bag - dad , or is it on the Turkish side ?

		In fact , was
Bagdad	LOCATION	not in the possession of the British for many weeks , even before President
Wilson	PERSON	gave his Flag Day speech ?

		Second , what of the famous reorganization which the German general staff was to effect in the Turkish army ?

		Has M. Cheradame read
General Allenby	ORGANIZATION	's recent report that over 160,000 Turkish troops have deserted within the last few months ?

		The Persian Gulf , except as an object of desire , hardly enters into the calculations of even the most extreme Pan - germans when confronted with the realities of today .

		Mesopotamia seems definitely lost to Ger - man influence .

		So much for the war map .

		And how about the vassal states
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	which , accord - ing to
M. Cheradame	PERSON	, are willing accomplices in the German plot because of military and financial obligations to
Prussia	LOCATION	?

		Does M. Cheradame re - call
Arthur Balfour	PERSON	's recent statement in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	that , whatever the outcome of the war in other respects , it was the object of the English government to see that it resulted in a `` strong ''
Bulgaria	LOCATION	?

		Could even this obsessed author contend
today	DATE	that
Turkey	LOCATION	is blissfully happy in her alliance ?

		Yet it is true that chief consideration revolves after all around Aus - tria-Hungary .

		As long as the Dual Monarchy follows the leading strings of
Berlin	LOCATION	, the peril which M. Cheradame pictures will be more or less a reality .

		It is a pertinent question , however , just to what extent
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	is a vassal of
Germany	LOCATION	, and if she is , how long she is likely to remain so .

		Certainly she is not a vassal in an economic sense , even after nearly four years of war .

		Professor
Naumann	PERSON	's plea for a better un - derstanding between
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	was after all a plea .

		The great customs union has not yet come into existence , even under moral isola - tion , economic blockade , and close military inter - dependence .

		If the economic alliances which are to make Mittel-Europa a reality can not be put through under such stress , then in the name of common sense how can one reasonably ex - pect them to be put through when that pressure is removed ?

		Consider
Hungary	LOCATION	, for example : not once during this war has
Hungary	LOCATION	furnished an ounce of bread or other foodstuffs to
Germany	LOCATION	, or even to
Austria	LOCATION	, her own neighbor , except for a definite quid pro quo .

		Or read carefully this dispatch : `` When the Brest-Litovsk developments made it less likely that the German military leaders could carry out undisturbed the program of absorbing
Lithuania	LOCATION	and
Courland	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	apparently began pressing
Austria	LOCATION	for this grant of commercial concessions .

		At the same time it appears that this grant began to lose its attractiveness for
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Both
Vienna	LOCATION	and
Buda	LOCATION	- pest began to put obstacles in the way of a commercial settlement . ''

		-LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Daily News , ''
January 22 , 1918	DATE	, page 2 . -RRB-

		For a vassal ,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	s ` eems to have an embarrassing amount of individual spirit .

		We need to regard the larger outlines of the re - lations between
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As long as
Russia	LOCATION	existed as a unified militaristic nation controlled by an irresponsible autocracy ,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	could feel , perhaps with some justification , that there was a Panslavic menace .

		Of course German militarism , while outwardly bewailing the existence of this menace , secretly was thankful for it , if , indeed , the Junkers did not encourage it .

		It gave her an opponent against whom she could claim the legitimate right to arm .

		But the whole political complexion of southeast - ern
Europe	LOCATION	has undergone a radical transforma - tion since the Russian revolution .

		That worst bugaboo of European politics , the
Panslavic	LOCATION	menace , has vanished .

		Austria-Hungary , who allied herself with
Germany	LOCATION	for protection against
Russia	LOCATION	, has now no reason for that unpleasant
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL in defensive alliance .

		Unpleasant ?

		Well , it would be difficult anywhere in the world to find more cordial hatred of Prussian militarism today than exists in the
Dual Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the Allies really wish to embarrass
Germany	LOCATION	, they could play no worse trick upon her than by making her an open gift of Mittel-Europa .

		After the experience of this present war , it is no paradox to state that
Germany	LOCATION	may find many of her former allies more embarrassing to any policy of commercial expansion than her former enemies .

		As with all industrial nations ,
Germany	LOCATION	's future depends upon her ability to take her place in the in - ternational organization of world trade a place which she so frivolously threw away when she started on her great imperial adventure .

		Against this real place in the sun the sullen resentment of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	at the suffering she has gone through will act for many years as a definite bar - rier .

		Indeed , at no time in recent modern history has the outlook for Pangermany , in any effective sense , been so black .

		Why , then , does M. Cheradame insist on paint - ing
Germany	LOCATION	's prospects for the accomplishment of this desire in such rosy colors ?

		Primarily , be - cause he is afraid of what he calls the `` drawn game , '' or a negotiated peace .

		Anything short of that will of course be but a respite and breath - ing space before the next attack .

		So sure of this is M. Cheradame that he states that nothing would be so agreeable to the Prussian militarists as a peace `` without annexations and without in - demnities . ''

		This sort of peace is , according to him , nothing but a German `` plot . ''

		Yet it would be easier to believe
M. Cheradame	PERSON	if the German militarists had in fact showed alacrity in accept - ing the Russian formula in all its implications .

		What is the homely , unromantic truth ?

		They appear to regard it as a defeat , and they have not - hesitated to say so .


Russia	LOCATION	offered them the chance to accept this formula ; yet they were so crude in their practical rejection of it that even the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	lost their temper .

		Who would deny today that
Germany	LOCATION	is split in two in a polit - ical fight between the annexationists and the no - annexationists a real fight , not a sham one ?

		But this is very curious .

		If , as
M. Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	would have us believe ,
Germany	LOCATION	would give us even Alsace-Lorraine for the sake of retaining
Middle Europe	LOCATION	, why this sudden reluctance of the Pangermanists even to come within reasonable dis - tance of the minimum demands of the Allies for restitution ?

		According to
M. Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's view ,
Middle Europe	LOCATION	is such a prize that they would jump at the chance of abandoning their `` map '' of conquests to retain this jewel .

		Somehow , however , the facts appear to be otherwise .

		The Pan - germans cling desperately to the jewels of con - quered land and say very little about
Berlin	LOCATION	to
Bagdad	LOCATION	.

		The truth is , of course , that the Ger - man imperialists realize that
Middle Europe	LOCATION	is only a painted devil wherewith to frighten the Allies .

		They themselves are quite aware of its difficulties , its lack of permanent value and its meagre compensation for what they cynically term `` sacrifice of the people . ''

		They know only too well that the average German citizen will not regard a very problematical winning of a road to the

		Who it was that started the - current poetic fad for curio-collecting is a question not hard to answer :
Ezra Pound	PERSON	is the man , let the Im - agists and others deny it as loudly as they will .

		Pound has from the outset , both as poet and as critic , been a curio-collector a lover of trinkets , bijoux of phrase , ideographic objets de vertu , carved oddities from the pawn-shops of the past , aromatic grave-relics , bizarre importa - tions from the Remote and Strange .

		There is no denying , either , that it is a delightful vein in verse .

		No great exertion is demanded of the reader ; he is invited merely to pause before the display-window and to glance , if only for a mo - ment , at the many intriguing minutiae there ar - 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	ranged for him in trays .

		Is he tired of strug - gling with the toxic energies of a Rodin ?

		Then let him rest in contemplation of a carved ushabti .

		Does a
Strauss	PERSON	drag his spirit through too vio - lent a progression of emotional projections ?

		Does a Masters overburden him with relevant facts ?

		A
Fletcher	PERSON	fatigue him with aesthetic subtleties prolonged ?

		Let him concentrate on a gargoyle .

		This method in the writing of poetry is to be seen at its purest in the Others anthologies , the second of which Mr.
Alfred Kreymborg	PERSON	has now edited , apparently undeterred by the suc - cess of the first .

		Nevertheless it is a variegated band that Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	has assembled , and if they have in common the one main tenet that their poetic business is the expression of a sensation or mood as briefly and pungently -LRB- and oddly ? -RRB-

		as possible , with or without the aids of rhyme , metre , syntax , or punctuation they are by no means the slaves of a formula and present us with a variety that is amazing .

		There is much here , of course , that is merely trivial , and a measurable quantity of the proudly absurd and naively preposterous ; but if there are no such outstandingly good things here as `` The Portrait of a Lady '' by
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	in the earlier issue , or
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	's ``
Peter Quince	PERSON	at the Clavier , '' or
John Rodker	PERSON	's `` Marionettes , '' we can pass lightly over the studiously cerebral ob - scurantism of
Marianne Moore	PERSON	, the tentacular quiverings of
Mina Loy	PERSON	, the prattling iterations of
Alfred Kreymborg	PERSON	, the delicate but amor - phous self-consciousness of
Jeanne d'Orge	PERSON	,
Helen Hoyt	PERSON	, and
Orrick Johns	PERSON	, and pause with ad - miration and delight before the `` Preludes '' and `` Rhapsody of a Windy Night '' by
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, and `` Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black - bird '' by
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	.

		It is not that one is at all indifferent to the frequent charm and de - licious originality -LRB- at least as regards sensibil - ity -RRB- of the other poets , but that one finds in the two last mentioned not only this delicate original - ity of mind but also a clearer sense of symmetry as regards both form and ideas : their poems are more apparently , and more really , works of art .

		In comparison , most of the other work in this volume looks like happy improvisation .

		It is sig - nificant in this connection that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	uses rhyme and metre , a telling demonstration that the use of these ingredients may add power and finish and speed to poetry without in any way dulling the poet 's tactile organs or clouding his consciousness provided he has the requisite skill .

		Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's `` Preludes '' and `` Rhapsody '' are , in a very minor way , masterpieces of black-and - white impressionism .

		Personality , time , and en - vironment three attributes of the dramatic are set sharply before us by means of a rapid and concise report of the seemingly irrelevant and tangential , but really centrally significant , obser - vations of a shadowy protagonist .

		From Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	to
M. Jean de Bosschere	PERSON	, the Flemish poet whose volume `` The Closed Door '' has now been translated into English by Mr.
F. S. Flint	PERSON	, is a natural and easy step .

		It would appear , indeed , that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	has learned much from M. de Bosschere ; certainly he is , in English , the closest parallel to him that we have .

		It is a kind of praise to say that in all likelihood Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's `` Love Song of
J. Alfred Prufrock	PERSON	'' would not have been the remarkable thing it is if it had not been for the work of
Jean de Bosschere	ORGANIZATION	: in several respects de Bosschere seems like a maturer and more powerful Eliot .

		What then is the work of
M. de Bosschere ?	ORGANIZATION

		To begin with , and without regard to the matter of classification , it must be emphatically said that this book has the clear , unforced , and captivating originality of genius .

		Whether , as Miss Sinclair questions doubtfully in her intro - duction , we call him mystic or symbolist or deca - dent and all these terms have a certain aptness is after all a secondary matter .

		These poems , in a colloquial but rich and careful free verse , occasionally using rhyme and a regular ictus , very frequently employing a melodic line which borders on the prosodic , seem at first glance to be half-whimsical and half-cerebral , seem to be in a key which is at once naif and gayly pre - cious , with overtones of caricature ; in reality they are masterpieces of ironic understatement and reveal upon closer scrutiny a series of pro- found spiritual or mental tragedies .

		The method of M. de Bosschere might be called symbolism if one were careful not to impute to him any delving into the esoteric ; his themes are inva - riably very simple .

		One might call him a mystic , also , if one could conceive a negative mysticism of disbelief and disenchantment , a mysticism without vagueness , a mysticism of brilliantly colored but unsustaining certainties .

		But per - haps it would be more exact to say that he is merely a poet who happens to be highly devel - oped on the cerebral side , as well as on the tactile , a poet for whom the most terrible and most
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 beautiful realities are in the last analysis ideas , who sees that as in life the most vivid expression of ideas is in action , so in speech the most vivid expression of them is in parables .

		These poems , therefore , are parables .

		In `` Ulysse Batit Son Lit '' we do not encounter merely the deliciously and fantastically matter-of-fact comedy , naif as a fairy story , which appears on the surface ; we also hear in the midst of this gay cynicism the muffled crash of a remote disaster , and that dis - aster arises from the attitude of the animally selfish crowd towards the man of outstanding achievement .

		He refuses to be one of them , so they kill him .

		`` They roast
Ulysses	PERSON	, for he is theirs . ''

		Likewise , in `` Gridale , '' we do not wit - ness a merely personal tragedy ; the tragedy is universal .

		We see the crucifixion of the dis - illusioned questioner by the unthinking idolaters .

		In `` Doutes , '' under a surface apparently idiosyn - cratic in its narration of the humorously bitter discoveries and self-discoveries of a child , we have really an autobiography of disillusionment which is cosmic in its applicability .

		And yet he still believes , This burlesque of a man Who has given himself a universe And a god like an immense conflagration Whose smoke he smells ; And indeed it is perhaps only a bonfire Made with the green tops of potatoes .

		Nevertheless he still believes , Axe in hand , this burlesque of a man still believes ; He will cut his dream , four-square , in the hearts of There is nothing to laugh at , nothing to object to , We are not animals Living to feed our seed .

		There is something to believe .

		All men are not made of pig 's flesh .

		There is something to believe .

		Who said that I am a poor wretch , Mere flotsam Separated from its imaginary god ?

		Again , in `` Homer Marsh , '' we make the ac - quaintance of the gentle recluse who loves and is loved by his house , his fire , his kettle , his pipe and tobacco , his dog , his bees ; but he goes away to travel , and lends his house to his friend
Peter	PERSON	; and on his return finds to his bewilder - ment and despair that all these beloved things have curiously turned their affections to
Peter	PERSON	.

		The tone is lyric , seductively playful and simple ; the overtone is tragic .

		It is a translation into action of the profound fact that ideas , no mat - ter how personal , can not be property ; that they are as precious and peculiar and inevitable in one case as in another , a natural action of forces universally at work .

		It would be rash , however , to carry too far this notion of parables .

		Some of the poems in `` The Closed Door '' are so sensitively subjective , so essentially lyrical , so -LRB- confound the word ! -RRB-

		naturally mystic in the sense that they make a clear melody of the sadness of the finite in the presence of the infinite , of the conscious in the presence of the unconscious that one shrinks from dropping such a chain upon them .

		All one can say is that they are beautiful , that for all their cool and precise and colloquial preciosity , their sophisticated primitivism , they conceal an emotional power that is frightful , not to say heartrending .

		What is the secret of this amaz - ing magic ?

		It is not verbal merely , nor rhyth - mic ; for it remains in translation .

		It springs from the ideas themselves : it is a playing of ideas against one another like notes in a harmony , ideas presented always visually , cool images in a kind of solitude .

		It is not that M. de Bos - schere is idiosyncratic in what he does , that he sees qualities that others do not see ; but rather that he combines them unexpectedly , that he felicitously marries the lyrical to the matter-of - fact , the sad to the ironic , the innocent to the secular the tender to the outrageous .

		He sees that truth is subtler than it is supposed to be , and he finds new images for it , images with the dew of truth still on them .

		If novelty sometimes contributes to the freshness of the effect , it is by no means novelty alone : these novelties have meanings , unlike many of those factitiously achieved by some members of the
Others	ORGANIZATION	group .

		This is a poet whose quaintness and whim and fantasy are always thought-wrinkled : they are hints of a world which the poet has found to be overwhelming in its complexity .

		Song is broken in upon by a doubting voice ; flowers conceal a pit ; pleasure serves a perhaps vile purpose ; beauty may not be a delusion , but is it a snare ?

		And what do thought and memory lead to ?

		... Nevertheless he still believes , Axe in hand , this burlesque of a man still believes ... Axe in hand !

		It is precisely such bizarre but significant imaginings that constitute the charm of this poet .

		And it is a part of his genius that , although hyperaesthetic , he is able to keep clearly in mind the objective value of such images , and to contrast them deliciously with the sentimental , or the decorative , or the impassioned .

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS THE ROMANCE OF THE ROMANOFFS .

		By
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Evidently it is not without ironical implica - tions that Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	entitles his tale of tyranny and bloodshed , of licentiousness and intrigue , of sordid greed and revolting cruelty , a `` romance . ''

		`` To any who find romance , '' he says in his preface , `` in such behavior as kings and nobles were permitted to flaunt in the eyes of their people in earlier ages the story of the Romanoffs must be exceptionally attractive . ''

		Being the story of a dynasty , not the chronicle of an empire , the narrative concerns itself largely with the personal peculiarities , the greater or lesser degrees of depravity , the pet foibles and dominant vices , historical or legendary , of the
Peters	PERSON	and
Catherines	ORGANIZATION	, the
Ivans	PERSON	and
Elizabeths	PERSON	, of the
Romanoff	PERSON	line .

		And a most wondrous wicked lot they show themselves to have been .

		The last of them is made by this writer to outdo , voluntarily or involuntarily , even the most con - scienceless of the tyrants that had preceded him on the Russian throne ; for `` his reign was dis - graced by a more bloody and cruel coercion than had reddened the reign of any of his predeces - sors . ''

		But it was , of course , weakness of character rather than viciousness of disposition that must be blamed for the crimes of
Nicholas the Second	ORGANIZATION	's reign .

		He never could have con - ceived the horrible exploits , such as soaking his adversaries in brandy and setting them afire , that gave to Ivan the Terrible his unique fame .

		Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	's book would be more useful , and the story of the Romanoffs could be followed more easily and intelligently , if he had appended a family tree of this not too familiar line of monarchs , or if he had even given a chronological list of the
Romanoff	PERSON	czars .

		ASGARD AND THE GODS .

		Adapted from the work of Dr.

		EPICS AND ROMANCES OF THE MIDDLE AGES .

		Adapted from the work of Dr.
W. Wagner	PERSON	by
M. W. MacDowall	PERSON	and ed - ited by
W. S. W. Anson	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		In
1880	DATE	there was published under the title of `` Asgard and the Gods '' an adaptation from the work of Dr.
Wagner	PERSON	intended to supply a need not previously met the need for `` a com - plete and popular English account of the reli - gious beliefs and superstitious customs of the old Norsemen , suited to our younger readers . ''

		Two years later , when the second edition of this vol - ume was brought out , the decision was made that it should be supplemented by a volume devoted to the legendary lore of our northern ancestors .

		The new volume bore the title `` Epics and Romances of the Middle Ages . ''

		Both works are now republished .

		They are accompanied by numerous illustrations which , though of scant artistic merit , will entice youthful readers .

		The first volume gives in more detail than is found in ordinary handbooks of mythology the stories that connect themselves with
Odin	PERSON	,
Loki	PERSON	, Thor ,
Freya	LOCATION	,
Baldur	PERSON	, the Norns , the
Valkyries	ORGANIZATION	, Fenris the
Wolf	PERSON	, the
Midgard Serpent	ORGANIZATION	, the tree Yggdrasil , and the other wonders and wonderful figures of those stanch and primitive times .

		These conceptions
Wagner	PERSON	philosophized in a way that sometimes seems arbitrary , but that the conceptions themselves have been written into the life of our people may be seen from the deri - vation of the names for our days of the week and from both the name and much of the spirit of our Easter .

		The second volume consists of a retelling in prose of the great northern hero lays , supplemented by the French Carolingian and the British Arthurian cycles .

		It does not always ad - here meticulously to the details of the epic ac - counts , but it catches their spirit admirably and is true to their broader facts .

		In short , the two volumes bring alive for us the pristine era of robust heroism , and even after the lapse of thirty - five years constitute for us `` a fairly complete treatment of the mythical and traditional lore of the Germanic race . ''

		RlNCONETE AND CoRTADILLO .

		By
Miguel de Cervantes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated , with an intro - duction and notes , by
Mariano J. Lorente	PERSON	.

		With a preface by
R. B. Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	.

		Four Seas ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It is extremely interesting to read
Cervantes	PERSON	' `` exemplary '' tale of Spanish thieves in an unaca - demic and spirited English translation by a coun - tryman of the great novelist .

		The thief is an exciting figure in literature as in life , but com - paratively little has been written of his organi - zations his despotisms and hierarchies -LRB- for thieving seems to preclude democracy -RRB- and this old Spanish classic has an almost contemporary interest in its social satire .

		`` The little master - piece , '' writes
Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	, in a pref - ace which graces the new translation , `` gives perhaps the best sketch of Spanish low life which has come down to us ... The meeting of the two vagrant boys , their entering into the confra - ternity of thieves , with the picture of the house in which dwelt
Monipodio	PERSON	, the arch-thief of
Seville	LOCATION	, all are touched in as only Cervantes could touch in such scenes .

		He uses but few words and yet in the short sketch there are a dozen portraits which once read are as indelible in the mind 's eye as is a picture of
El Greco	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 115 About half the present volume is devoted to illuminating notes and introductions , for beside
Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	's preface there is Cer - vantes ' prologue , containing the writer 's full - length lovable portrait of himself , and a long introduction by the translator , bristling with controversial points .

		Cervantes and Cunning - hame
Graham	PERSON	wrote genially , for they had not read Mr.
Lorente	PERSON	's introduction , and they were not concerned with translators .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	, in fact , does not seem to care how often or how ill `` Rinconete and Cortadillo '' has been done into English .

		`` An idiomatic translation of a classic is never out of season , '' he remarks toler - antly , `` and there are intricacies of the Spanish tongue hard to present . ''

		Mr.
Lorente	PERSON	, on the contrary , has a cudgel in hand for all previous translators , attacking them one at a time and chronologically .

		He leaves very little of their pretensions to accuracy or excellence .

		Finally , he informs us that it was the `` mediocrity '' of
Norman McCall	PERSON	's version , made intolerable by
Fitzmaurice-Kelly	ORGANIZATION	's `` fan - tastic praise , '' which moved him to attempt some - thing more worthy of the original .

		Mr.
Lorente	PERSON	does not claim infallibility , only superior accu - racy , for his `` Rinconete and Cortadillo . ''

		It is certainly very human and lively .

		`` I know one is not always in the churches , '' wrote
Cervantes	PERSON	, `` nor is one always occupied with business ... there are hours of recreation in which the afflicted spirit rests . ''

		`` Rinconete and Cortadillo '' was written for just such hours .

		A PRIEST OF THE IDEAL .

		By
Stephen Gra	PERSON	- ham .

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		What
Stephen Graham	PERSON	calls a `` novel '' will probably , so limited are our definitions , appear to the average reader anything but a novel .

		`` A Priest of the Ideal '' is in the fullest sense the Russian sense and the spiritual sense a novel .

		It has been said that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is the thermome - ter of current opinion .

		It was said in praise .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	is , rather , barometric ; he does not tell us what we already know -LRB- and consequently love to hear well said -RRB- ; he interprets for us the unseen values of the age , and predicts the coming changes .

		He makes vivid the relation of permanent and of transitory elements in the national fabric ; he makes us pause in our un - thinking acceptance of modern organized life ; he points out the things that
England	LOCATION	is proud of in her past and by implication the things that she could very well do without today .

		It is always the `` unseen significance '' which is the most significant , only the `` not for sale '' which is imperishable .

		But it is true that this quality may rest disregarded until someone asks its material value in order to deprive us of it .

		It was not until
Washington King	PERSON	, the rich
Ameri	PERSON	- can , began his altruistic mission of exporting unnecessary English ruins for the spiritual en - richment of his native country , that
England	LOCATION	looked upon them with seeing eyes .

		King 's fruit - less quest is Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's concrete expression for the ideal that his lay priest ,
Richard Hamp	PERSON	- den , preached .

		His self-imposed mission was the illumination of the pages of history by mystic and individual interpretation .

		Where the present was concerned , his power came through his re - liance upon hence his appeal to the individual .

		`` Dedicate your life to men and women , to personal relationships .

		You will find that the causes look after themselves , '' said
Hampden	PERSON	.

		`` Causes always disappoint , human beings seldom disappoint . ''

		In Mr.
Graham	PERSON	, there is a voice as fearless if not as exceptional as
Tolstoy 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book is , in fact , a review of
England	LOCATION	through Russian eyes , in Russian terms .

		Though it is formless in the formalistic sense , yet it possesses the most enduring form of all : it transfers its message into the fabric of human imagination and mem - ory .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	makes the reader cooperate in the writing of his book .

		The author serves , that is , to suggest , to point here and there , as might the perfect guide , and to illustrate his meaning through his characters , who are not , we must admit , vividly real .

		It is the reader 's work to follow the road thus suggested rather , per - haps , to make his own path .

		There is no hard brilliance here , no cleverness , no mere reflection of the current temperature , but a very genuine , if over-sober , consideration of the problems con - fronting modern
England	LOCATION	.

		MILITARISM .

		By
Karl Liebknecht	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Liebknecht 's resistance to Prussianism has stimulated an unusual interest in his book , `` Mil - itarism , '' written ten years ago and now trans - lated into English .

		It is but fair to
Liebknecht	LOCATION	, however , to point out that his present opposition to German militarism is not based upon the con - viction that the cause of the allies is just .

		His attitude is a consistent application of views expressed in
1907	DATE	.

		He is an international social - ist of the Marxian school .

		Militarism , for Liebknecht , is a phenomenon , `` deeply rooted in the very nature of societies divided in classes , '' which assumes various shapes `` in societies of equal structure , all according to the physical , political , social , and economic con - ditions of states and territories . ''

		At all times it is designed to perpetuate the control of capital - ism .

		It does this in two ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it serves as an instrument of aggression or protection with reference to foreign nations ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it is a `` pillar 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	of capitalism and all reactionary forces in the war of liberation engaged in by the working classes . ''

		The standing army , navalism , and the colonial army are means of serving the first purpose .


England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	have each utilized the colonial army to drive `` the mis - erable natives to slave in the bagnios for capital - ism , and to shoot and cut them down and starve them without pity whenever they attempt to pro- tect their country against foreign conquerors and extortioners . ''

		Liebknecht sees nothing but injury to the proletariat in this function of militarism .

		He believes it perpetuates a ruthless system of capitalistic exploitation of the masses and leads to international complications which imperil the existence of civilization .

		He would point to the war as a tragic verification of his words written ten years ago .

		The duty of the worker is clear .

		`` There is only one real enemy of the proletariat of every country the capitalist class which oppresses and exploits the proletariat '' ; `` the international coalition of exploiters and oppres - sors must be opposed by the international coali - tion of the exploited and oppressed . ''

		In confirmation of his statement that the sec - ond function of militarism is to protect capital - ism within the nation ,
Liebknecht	ORGANIZATION	describes the army organization of the European nations and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He particularly condemns the organization of the Belgian civic guard and the employment of gunmen by American capital - ists .

		While not strictly a part of the American military organization , these private armies are permitted to exist under state laws and thus directly assist the capitalist in his war against labor .

		Liebknecht maintains that in all coun - tries the police and the military forces stand ready in an emergency `` to preserve order , '' while in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	, and even
France	LOCATION	soldiers have been used as strike breakers .

		The chapter `` Means and Effects of Militar - ism '' discusses the methods of education which create a military spirit in the army and the people .

		Here Liebknecht deals primarily with the Prussian system of military education .

		The last chapter presents what he believes to be the fundamental contradictions in militarism which , in obedience to Hegelian dialectical development , will lead to its ultimate destruction .

		He does not plead for an international organization which shall regulate international competition and thus control , if not abolish , militarism .

		`` Militarism , '' he writes , `` is one of the original sins of capital - ism which may be susceptible of being mitigated here and there , but of which it will be purged only in the purgatory of Socialism . ''

		PAIN AND PLEASURE .

		By
Henry T. Moore	PERSON	.

		Moffat , Yard ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This volume , which is the second in a series of ten devoted to the senses , surveys a field of peculiar interest .

		In general , the sensations on the basis of which we lead the mental life are divided between the special senses , which bring us , for the most part , the things from without , and the organic senses , contributing to the same end within ; but mingled with these , and over - lapping them , are the general feelings of pain and pleasure for which the sensory life so plainly stands .

		The contrast between the epicurean , who lives in the pleasures of sense , and the stoic , who cultivates an indifference , as well as the ascetic , who deliberately discards every comfort and satisfaction , lies in the manner of accep - tance of the parts of pain and pleasure .

		The phy - siology of this process has only recently been intelligible , though the peculiar role of pain in the diagnosis of disease has always been recog - nized .

		Beginning at this level , pleasures rise rapidly to the aesthetic field , and beyond that there is always a penumbra of moral value .

		It is this field that Professor
Moore	PERSON	surveys in a popular and systematic fashion .

		THE SENSE OF SIGHT .

		By
Frank N. Spind	PERSON	- ler .

		Moffat , Yard ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This , the third volume in the series on the senses edited by Dr.
George Dearborn	PERSON	, is in many ways the most important of the ten vol - umes which together are to survey the field of sensation .

		Sight is rightly called the queen of the senses , and the scope and direct prominence of its contributions are unassailed .

		So far as bare requirements go , the volume considers ac - ceptably the structure of the eye , the mode of its functioning , the character of the sensations which it brings , and something about the bear - ing of vision in the general mental field .

		It rarely rises above this meagre adequacy ; and it is in a measure unfortunate that so important a subject fails of any distinctive handling .

		The presentation is rather casual : the high points in the field of vision are covered , but the oppor - tunity of such a volume has hardly been met .

		The arrangement of the chapters is admirable , passing rapidly from the study of process to the interpretation of the work of sight as we see it , then to the effect of our eye-mindedness upon our general psychology , including our emotional nature .

		A practical chapter on the character of vision is added .

		It takes more , however , than a proper plan and an acquaintance with the data to bring to the reader an appreciation of the marvelous sense of vision and the manner in which the eye makes the mind .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 117 NOTES ON NEW FICTION Even war , as certain harassed officials at
Washington	LOCATION	might be willing to testify , can not engulf the `` woman question . ''

		The roots of that question are too deep in the foundations of things to be swept away , as less relevant issues are swept away , by the current that seems , sometimes , to be undermining life .

		War has proved woman 's ability to bear her share of the burdens of society and has thus substantiated her claim to be con - sidered as an individual entitled , under her own right , to the privileges of society that her male protectors , acting vicariously , formerly enjoyed for her .

		There are however beyond doubt , for the
Congressional Record	ORGANIZATION	reveals them certain purblind people who are unable to read the clear proof that the hour of woman 's emancipation has arrived .

		It was for them , doubtless , that `` The Sturdy Oak '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- was assem - bled .

		`` The Sturdy Oak '' is , so to speak , an all-star novel , written by fourteen leading American authors , each of whom after the fashion of the old game of capping verses furnished a single chapter .

		Though it is obviously a tour de force , it turns out to be no worse , if no better , than dozens of novels set adrift by the publishers each season .

		However , the personnel of its authors

Marjorie Benton Cooke	PERSON	,
Leroy Scott	PERSON	,
William Allen White	PERSON	,
Mary Heaton Vorse	PERSON	,
Ethel Watts Mumford	PERSON	, and
Anne O'Hagan	PERSON	fortunately releases one from any obligation to regard `` The Sturdy Oak '' from the point of view of literary criticism ; for there is probably not a writer on the list who would advance any claim to literary merit for the book as a whole or for his share in it .

		`` The Sturdy Oak '' is propaganda pure and simple , dedicated to the cause of suffrage .

		Its writers have received no recompense ; its publish - ers expect no profits ; the entire proceeds from its sale are to be devoted to the achievement of votes for women .

		The prospect of getting four - teen leading authors for the price of one should entice the public into making the propaganda profitable from a pecuniary point of view .

		Assuming that only the unintelligent are left in the ranks of the unbelievers , it may prove to be popular also from the point of view of morale .

		As a presentation of the `` woman question , '' of which suffrage of course is only a phase , `` The Sturdy Oak '' is absurd , even though it advances all the stock pros and demolishes all the stock cons .

		It is made to seem the more absurd by comparison with the new edition of `` A Woman of Genius '' -LRB-

		It is a passionate protest against the conditions that keep women from being persons , and at the same time it is a decidedly creditable piece of work .

		It is the kind of propaganda that will succeed with intel - ligent people , for the simple reason that it is not propaganda at all .

		Sound advice to the reading public would be : Buy `` The Sturdy Oak '' for the sake of the cause and read `` A Woman of Genius '' to find out what it is all about .

		In `` Missing '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	tells the story of a pretty , clinging Englishwoman , who learns through the war 's hard lesson the essential dishonesty of clinging .

		Work brings her spiritual freedom , as it has brought spiritual freedom to hundreds of women since the beginning of the war .

		`` Miss - ing '' might be a contribution to the contemporary literature about woman , as vital in its way as `` A Woman of Genius , '' but , like most of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's work , it lacks reality .

		It is a cleverly staged , well-managed drama of the
Pinero	PERSON	type .

		You look on , are interested , entertained , but never for a moment carried away .

		It is all a play .

		It might have happened , you are willing to admit , but that these very clever ladies and gentlemen are living it , not acting it that is too great a demand upon your credulity .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	can produce polished drama ; but she can not reproduce life .

A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	, the author of a collection of stories by that name , loves to describe .

		From an intriguing robbery at the Semiramis Hotel in
London	LOCATION	his imagination flits to
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and the bomb plots of the miserable
Peiffer	PERSON	; from the story of `` Green Paint '' in a
Latin Republic	LOCATION	, to murder and suicide in an English country house .

		But though his imagina - tion has range and facility , it has little depth .

		He has been reading
Freud	LOCATION	, or perhaps a book review on
Freud	LOCATION	, and to the varied complexes of his personages he has brought his own excellent short story technique .

		They are very enjoyable , these stories ; and if writers like
Conrad	PERSON	,
Thomas Burke	PERSON	, and
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	had not projected into the short story a quality that gives it vitality and endurance , we should perhaps be fully con - tent with the temporary satisfaction to be got from `` The Four Corners . ''

		According to the standard created by these writers , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's work is flat .

		According to the standard of the average , it is most excellently good .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT IN HIS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA President
Butler	PERSON	states that the academic society of which the teacher is a mem - ber owes him `` protection from unfair attack , as well as from all avoidable hamperings and em - barrassments in the prosecution of his intellectual work . ''

		Fair words !

		Yet they would somehow have a more genuine ring if Dr.
Butler	PERSON	had ever attempted to protect Professor
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	from the unfair attacks of the
New York	LOCATION	press when the notorious `` flag incident '' took place ; if trustee inquisitions had never occurred at
Columbia	LOCATION	; if newspaper accounts of the ac - tivities of Professors
Dana	PERSON	and
Cattell	PERSON	had not been accepted at their face value .

		Dr.
Butler	PERSON	must be an adept in casuistry to square his moral precepts with his recent conduct .

		Or is the phrase `` academic freedom , '' like `` freedom of speech , '' merely a verbal idol to be adored pub - licly by those who in private expend their ef - forts on its destruction ?

		Probably Dr.
Butler	PERSON	would defend himself by stressing the equivocal adjective `` avoidable '' : in this case he could plead necessity and so lay claim to exemption from all the consequences of the phrase .

		Does not this , however , suggest a similar ingenuity exhibited by a recent Chancellor of
Germany	LOCATION	?

		Dr.
Michaelis	PERSON	, it will be recalled , gracefully accepted the
Reichs	PERSON	- tag resolution of
July 19	DATE	respecting `` no forcible annexations , '' and so on .

		That is , he accepted it verbally .

		But he repudiated it in fact by a light modifying clause `` as I interpret it . ''

		Thus do certain distinguished minds exhibit their basic identity of method .

		A MELANCHOLY JAQUES WRITES US in iron - ical mood from `` an
Atlantic	LOCATION	port . ''

		He says : `` We here are in the dark , and the more numer - ous the news items become , the sabler grows the night which everywhere engulfs us .

		The news keeps arriving from the four corners of the earth : `
Copenhagen	LOCATION	Czar
Nicholas	PERSON	escaped yesterday ;
Stockholm Lenine	LOCATION	is said to have been hanged by the Cossacks ;
Rome	LOCATION	A meeting has been arranged by persons interested in a separate peace between
Turkey	LOCATION	and the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	;
Zurich	LOCATION	The
Kaiser	PERSON	seemed deeply moved by the news that
Russia	LOCATION	was inclined to return her German prisoners .

		Such an act would markedly complicate the food-problem in
Germany	LOCATION	... ' When I was a kid , I was passionately interested in the mysteries of the telegraph , that I saw only as little knobs and iron wires .

		I used to wonder how such a simple arrangement could send so far the important news entrusted to it .

		I used to stop on the road to listen to the music of the wind in the wires , and each time the mysterious sound was repeated I used to tell myself , ` There goes a telegram . '

		After a bit I persuaded my playmates , finally myself , that I understood the messages in those sounds .

		I used to put my ear against the base of that science-grown tree , the telegraph pole , and announce the latest news : ` The chief of the secret police is ordering the arrest of a murderer ... A gentleman is telegraphing his wife that ... A general is ordering ... ' Later I studied physics ; and for a few months I was a journalist , young , naive , ardent , and I had new illusions about the rectitude of the telegraph .

		The war , my dear friend , has dissipated whatever remained of them .

		I now know that the telegraph is just what I knew it for in my small-boyhood .

		I know that the agencies of information employ scholars and poets who just seat themselves on the grass at the foot of telegraph poles and hearken to the song of the wind in the wires : `
Berlin Kaiser	LOCATION	and Crown Prince have quar - reled .

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	smacked the Crown Prince ;
New York	LOCATION	A new explosive , of unprecedented power ... ' O my friend , the season 's greet - ings to you .

		And my best New Year 's wish is that your serenity remain unshaken by the song of the wind in the telegraph wires . ''

		IN THE DAYS BEFORE
F. P. A.	PERSON	DESCENDED from his `` Conning Tower '' in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune '' to take a hand in this war , he was wont to keep a sharp , but withal friendly , eye upon the editing of the `` Bookman '' a fact re - called this month , with graceful acknowledgment , both by the editor of that magazine and by a distinguished contributor .

		`` How we all miss him ! ''

		exclaims the contributor ,
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	.

		And indeed the month 's `` Bookman '' might be said to carry internal evidence of its loss .

		For a correspondent takes Miss
Jessie Rit	PERSON	- tenhouse to task for having confused her pro- nouns in the preceding issue .

		Later we read that '' `
Richard Mahoney	PERSON	' will be called a dif - ferent book to `
Maurice Guest	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		And then comes Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	himself -LRB- a professor of Eng - lish at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- mislaying a modifier : `` One night , half-dead with fear , the giant crane swoops down upon him , clutches his bed , and swings him , bed and all , above the sleeping city , among the blazing stars . ''

		Professor
Phelps	PERSON	is not re - porting a thousand and second tale ; the crane is not a fabulous bird , but a swinging arm of steel .

		The `` Bookman 's '' correspondent added that `` other examples could readily be cited , for our magazines are fairly bristling . ''

		As a mat - ter of justice then , here are two dangling bristles plucked from other esteemed contemporaries : from a recent `` Nation '' `` Situated at an alti -
1918	DATE	-RSB- 119 tude expected to provide an Alpine climate in
summer	DATE	, it is not strange that frozen pipes made it impossible to fight the flames '' ; and from the
January	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' `` After wishing each other good-night and a Happy New Year , I climbed the dark , dirty stairway to the fourth floor . ''

		-LRB- And this last is not a case of the double per - sonality that afflicts many New Yorkers on New Year 's Eve . -RRB-

		... Such editorial phenom - ena , occurring in such high places , are something more than casual contributions to the gayety of `` colyums '' ; they are symptomatic of a relaxing disorder in English speech .

		While the rhetori - cians have been busy elaborating their quaint jargon of faulty reference , solecism , misplaced modifier , cleft infinitive , and dangling participle , the actual users of our tongue have somehow enjoyed increasing license to orphan pronouns , outrage idioms , jostle modifiers , cleave infinitives asunder , and hang participles to any incongruous peg .

		While the experts have employed them - selves compiling manual after manual of mis - leading short-cuts to `` correctness '' and rules of thumb annulled by their exceptions , there has grown up without effective let a `` magazine Eng - lish '' only less licentious and much more in - sidious than `` newspaper English . ''

		Until the young student of the mother tongue , utterly be - wildered by the intricacies of an hypothetical `` correctness , '' remarks the gulf that stretches between the theory of the classroom and the practice of the world and wisely concludes that there is also a `` Freshman English , '' which he must contrive to hoodwink in college and ignore after graduation .

		And indeed the silken Eng - lish which is meticulously woven on the loom of rhetorical dogma bears as faint a resemblance to the homespun English which carries the day 's thought , as the classical `` correctness '' of the rhetoricians bears to any pragmatic correctness implicit in everyday usage .

		No correctness , however , will help a writer very far : the im - portant difficulties in composition are not mat - ters of what is right or wrong , but of what is more or less effective , and more or less agree - able .

		Had the experts been writing current English instead of compiling outworn taboos , they might have guided a living technique , they might even have relieved editors from the thankless task of mooring derelict modifiers in manuscripts otherwise effective and agreeable .

		Lacking such practical guidance , however , and staggered by the complicated elegance of a `` correctness '' thrust at them in toto , young writers have caught the trick of evading stylistic issues .

		This habit of evasion is chiefly responsible for the disappearance of the subjunctive and the ascendancy of `` would . ''

		It leads away from the clarity of technical assur - ance into a fog where participles hover without visible means of support .

		EVERY RIGHT-THINKING MAN MUST HOPE that
F. P. A.	PERSON	is only temporarily absent from his watchtower .

		Meanwhile
B. L. T.	PERSON	remains to light the matutinal eye of him who runs and reads another `` Tribune . ''

		And in his `` Line o ' Type or Two ''
B. L. T.	PERSON	sometimes performs for THE DIAL the sharp , but withal friendly , office that
F. P. A.	PERSON	performed for the `` Bookman . ''

		Nevertheless our faith in the Mentor 's infalli - bility has been shaken .

		Not long since , Mr.
Kenneth Macgowan	PERSON	used the word `` panderer '' in these columns and unexpectedly `` made the Line , '' where it was announced that no such word exists .

		Even the
Collegiate	ORGANIZATION	`` Webster '' is more hospitable ; it not only admits `` panderer '' but with a magnificent impartiality opens the door to `` panderess '' as well .

		THE WAR SERVICE OF THE AMERICAN Ll -
BRARY ASSOCIATION	ORGANIZATION	has now a fund of a million and a half dollars for erecting library buildings at the camps , purchasing books , and meeting the expenses of administration and distribution .

		Thirty-four such libraries are built or building .

		In addition , three or four hundred branch libra - ries are reported as established in clubs , etc. .

		The public has already donated more than a half million volumes for distribution , and
the Service	ORGANIZATION	has bought a hundred thousand more , chiefly non-fiction .

		Indeed , one of the surprises in the work has been the demand for serious , and especially for technical , books and for all kinds of advanced reference material ; the libra - rians have had to meet thousands of these special requests by purchase and inter-library borrowing .

		At Camp Sherman the record of issues on a recent
Sunday	DATE	showed 46 fiction as against 67 non-fiction .

		The former ran all the way from Mr.
Henty	PERSON	to Lord Dunsany , from Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- bers to
H. G. Wells	PERSON	; the latter , from `` Magi - cians ' Tricks '' to `` How to Judge a Picture , '' and from the `` Foolish Dictionary '' to
Henry George	PERSON	's `` Law of Human Progress . ''

		But probably some 40 of the issues might legiti - mately be grouped as war books and as directly pertinent to the work in hand , the rest dividing between entertainment and general -LRB- or often very particular -RRB- information .

		Their library is to accompany these men to
France	LOCATION	, and the fact is arresting .

		Is the soldier 's leisure , so long devoted to the romance of foraging for the day 's necessities or the
night	TIME	's violent luxuries , now to be dedicate to the cultural pursuits of peace ?

		Time was when no army was complete without its train of loot and camp followers ; is the time coming when no army will be complete without its library , lecture room , concert hall , and art gallery ?

		Is the phrase `` civilized warfare '' to take on yet another overtone of irony ?

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 31	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION The avalanche of war literature increases .

		We are told a great deal these days about bombs and mud and cigarettes , and yet we continue to read about them with avidity .

		`` Best o ' Luck '' by
Alexander McClintock	PERSON	-LRB- Doran ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is a sort of technical primer of explosives and other weapons , their use and dangers , told naively in purest Ameri - can .

		Mr.
McClintock	PERSON	declined a lieutenancy in the
Canadian Grenadier Guards	ORGANIZATION	, in which he had served as sergeant during some of the hardest fighting of the war , to enlist in the American army .

		`` It 's the army of Uncle
Sam	PERSON	for mine , '' says Mr.
McClintock	PERSON	, `` It 's up to us to save the issue where it 's mostly right on one side and all wrong on the other and I 'm glad we 're in . ''

		`` The First Canadians in
France	LOCATION	'' by
Colonel F. McKel	PERSON	- vey Bell -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- is a random set of reminis - cences , a trifle wordy , but sincere , of the first Canadian hospital unit in
France	LOCATION	.

		It is another answer to the question , `` What is it like , over there ? ''

		Written in the form of a diary ,
Agnes Edwards	PERSON	's `` A Garden Rosary '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- is a record of her garden , which calls forth imagistic reactions and philosophical musings on the part of the author .

		The rush-and-tumble coming up of the tulips hastily `` flung in at the last moment , '' she compares to women pulling on their gloves as they hurry down the street ; the soullessness of the columbine , she likens to the same quality in a certain little Japanese manservant ; the lily of the valley evokes reflections upon virginity .

		And so it happens that there is much in these pages which might find its way into free verse .

		It should be added that a genuine and delightful tenderness obtains throughout for the memory of the author 's mother , to whom the `` Rosary '' is dedicated .


E. F. Borst-Smith	PERSON	's `` Mandarin and Missionary in Cathay '' -LRB- Button ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- is a `` story of twelve years ' strenuous missionary work during stirring times mainly spent in
Yenanfu	LOCATION	, a prefectural city of
Shensi	LOCATION	,
North China	LOCATION	, with a review of its his - tory from the earliest date . ''

		The writer was a pioneer in the district he describes , being the first English resident in
North Shensi	LOCATION	, while his wife was the first European woman ever seen there , and his little girl the first non-Chinese baby ever born there .

		Of this he assures us after a careful scrutiny of
North Shensi	LOCATION	annals for the past four thousand years and more .

		His twelve years ' ex - perience was evidently not lacking in variety , and it occasionally had its thrilling episodes .

		Life in a country undergoing the pains of transition from monarchy to republic is not likely to be without excitement , including the element of danger to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

		Thus the pages of this book offer rather more of varied interest than is commonly to be found in a mis - sionary chronicle .

		A series of experiments and observations on health control on estates and plantations in the tropics is presented in a lucid and pleasing manner in Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's `` Rural Sanitation in the Tropics '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author has had much practical experience on rubber , tea , and rice plantations in the Straits Settlements , in the
Federated Malay States	LOCATION	, and in
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, has visited
Sumatra	LOCATION	and
Hongkong	ORGANIZATION	, and has made an exhaustive in - quiry into the American methods and accomplish - ments in sanitation at
Panama	LOCATION	.

		Of especial interest to every American is the high tribute paid by the writer to work at
Panama	LOCATION	and to the men who have accomplished the conquest of disease in that infamous sink-hole of fever and death .

		He notes the singularly happy spirit in the
Panama Sanitary Department	ORGANIZATION	, the spirit of cooperation , the esprit de corps , and regards it as one of the greatest privileges of his life that he saw the department at work .

		He urges the complete publication of the accumulated records of the work and of the investigations connected therewith , believing that `` in these records we have observations and truths of infinite value to all tropical countries and that their publication in full would be a lasting benefit to mankind . ''

		Colonel
Gorgas	PERSON	has done far more than assist in the construction of a great canal , `` he has conducted a school of Applied Sanitation whose lesson will benefit the world I say with confidence for all time . ''

		Wherever large num - bers of laborers are employed in the tropics , the appalling mortality of the past need not recur .

		The book deals mainly with the practical measures for the prevention of malaria and its extermination in isolated country districts under tropical condi - tions .

		The breadth of vision and penetrating crit - icism of the writer combine with his wide experience to make this work one of unusual sug - gestiveness and value to all who deal with prob - lems of sanitation and preventive medicine .

		In `` A Green Tent in Flanders '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- Miss
Maud Mortimer	PERSON	, an Ameri - can nurse , describes her experiences in a hospital five miles back of the British line in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The story moves along with much spirit and no little humor ; and it is entertaining , cheerful , human , and natural , like a clever woman 's letters home .

		The wounded soldiers who pass under Miss Mor - timer 's care are portrayed with graphic , sympa - thetic touch , and the numerous anecdotes could only have been told by an acute observer with a sense for the picturesque .

		Altogether the book is pleasant company for an evening .

		In `` Green Trails and Upland Pastures '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB-
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	shows once more that he can write with ease and first-hand knowledge of the whole outdoors , from maple seeds to the
Grinnell Glacier	ORGANIZATION	, from song sparrows to sky lines .

		He talks of weather , trees , snow , stone walls , rural free delivery , gardening , wild flowers , bridges , and mountain peaks with impartial and quiet enthusiasm .

		His spirit is as much at home on the wind-swept heights of the Rockies as amid the soft contours of the
Berk	PERSON	- shires .

		But the shining merit of these nineteen essays is the fact that their author treats nature simply ; there is little or none of the extravagant rhapsody and the tiresome homily that mar many `` nature books , '' early and late .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 121 In `` The Hilltop on the Marne '' Mildred Aid - rich had something to say and said it well .

		In `` On the Edge of the War Zone '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- she appears to have nothing of much mo - ment to write of and she only succeeds in being tiresome .

		One suspects that the success of the earlier work led to a call for more `` copy , '' with an unhappy result .

		The hilltop is now back of the French line and little seems to happen there except as soldiers pass to and fro along the road .

		The days go by in comparative monotony , and the intimate details of household affairs fill up many weary pages .

		With so many interesting stories of war to be told one can only regret this long-drawn - out , gossipy chronicle of small happenings .

		That
Starr King	PERSON	, `` Saint of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, '' was a good deal more than a mere pulpit-pounder was long ago made clear , and is again demonstrated in Mr.
William Day Simonds	PERSON	's study of that re - markable man 's services to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and free - dom `` Starr King in
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Elder ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A short opening chapter devoted to King 's early life in
New England	LOCATION	is followed by two longer ones on
California	LOCATION	in the early sixties and
King	PERSON	's part in helping to turn that state to the side of the North in those critical times ; then comes a review of his work as philanthropist and preacher , and finally a brief retrospect of his career as a whole .

		Contemporary sources of information have been diligently sought out and judiciously drawn upon , a few of King 's old friends and acquaintances being still alive to contribute their testimony and reminiscences .

		The book is a scholarly and con - clusive estimate of the part played by the great preacher and orator in saving his adoptive state from joining the Confederacy or , perhaps , from proclaiming a
Pacific	LOCATION	republic of its own .

		COMMUNICATIONS `` LA MALQUERIDA '' -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Reading Mr.
Padraic Colum	PERSON	's review of Mr.
Underbill	PERSON	's translation of
Benavente	ORGANIZATION	's plays , I was struck by the justness of the criticism of `` La Mal - querida , '' which Mr.
Colum	PERSON	declares '' ... has dis - tinction by reason of a strange reserve that goes through it all . ''

		I have heard `` La Malquerida '' acted in Spanish and I have heard
Mimi Agulia	PERSON	in `` La Lupa , '' and as the plots are very much alike I can , I believe , contrast `` fury out-topping fury '' with the `` strange reserve '' through which , Mr.
Colum	PERSON	adds , `` we are made to feel the gravity and the dignity of the Spanish character all through the play . ''

		`` La Malquerida '' won phenomenal praise in
Madrid	LOCATION	, a well-known critic going so far as to de - clare that it is in line with the great tragedies of the Greek stage and dramas such as `` Hamlet '' and `` Othello , '' and that as a national work it ranks with
Calderon	PERSON	's `` El Alcalde de Zalamea , '' with
Lope de Vega	PERSON	's `` La Fuente Ovejuna , '' and so on , and so on , ad libitum .

		But the author would certainly be more pleased to read Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's appreciation with its penetrating phrase about `` the strange reserve '' than to hear such meaningless and bombastic comparisons .

		When Mr.
Colum	PERSON	tells us of `` La Malquerida '' I regret that he does not mention the scene be - tween the husband and the outraged wife , for it is inseparable from one 's memory of the play as an unequaled example of the conflict of simul - taneous emotions .

		The wife , raging at her hus - band as she gives him a glass of water , is angry to the point of cursing the water , that it may poison him , and yet at the moment he is to gulp it down , her habit of wifely solicitude gets the better of her and she warns him not to drink while he is hot and perspiring .

		I agree with Mr.
Colum	PERSON	that `` La Malquerida '' should be given a hearing on the American stage : aside from the value of the play itself , it would prepare the taste of the public for the Spanish theatre with its rich inheritance of fine plays .

E. A. POE	PERSON	.

		So sweet the hour , so calm the time , I feel it more than half a crime ,
When Nature	ORGANIZATION	sleeps and stars are mute , To mar the silence ev 'n with lute .

Adeline	PERSON	.

		But list , O list , so soft and low Thy lover 's voice to night shall flow , That scarce awake thy soul shall deem My words the music of a dream .

		Thus , while no single sound too rude , Upon thy slumber shall intrude , Our thoughts , our souls O God above !

		In every deed shall mingle , love .

1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 Strangling the
Periodicals Congress	ORGANIZATION	at its last session passed a hasty postal law increasing the postage on periodicals from FIFTY TO NINE HUNDRED PER CENT .

		Some periodicals will be killed all will be restricted in circulation and crippled .

		There will be fewer readers , and the habit of reading curtailed .

		The great function of periodicals is to assist in the spread of ideas by printing the achievements in the world of thought , culture , and science .

		Thus to shut out farm journals as these zone rates will will lessen the productive power of our country by
millions of dollars	MONEY	through loss of better methods .

		Shut off trade journals and you decrease the manufacturing power by more millions .

		Shut off the religious papers and there are shut off channels that have raised
millions of dollars	MONEY	for distressed humanity .

		Shut off the great peri - odicals of the home and there is throttled an avenue that has given expert in - struction to hundreds of thousands of mothers and saved their babies to health and citizenship .

		These national periodicals are printed in the big cities and the first zone , the cheapest zone , is in or near those cities ; there are many educational oppor - tunities near cities , and the cities will read anyway .

		Small towns and distant districts depend to a large extent upon periodicals ; thus this law increasing peri - odical postage where it is most needed shuts off opportunity where needed .

		It penalizes periodical readers .

		It is not a War Tax .

		It is postal legislation , pure and simple .

		Repeal this law .

		Repeal this FIFTY TO NINE HUNDRED PER CENT periodical postage increase .

		Sign the petition below and mail it .

		PETITION TO CONGRESS Sign Here !

		The spread of education , of culture , of scientific knowledge and advancement , and of our vast internal mer - chandising : and manufacturing has been , and always is , vitally dependent upon the freest and cheapest circulation of periodicals .

		The penalties resulting from any restriction on the freest possible circulation of periodicals will be destructive of the best interests of our economic life and the opportunities of developing our best citizenship .

		The postal amendment passed by the last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	increasing the postage on periodicals from FIFTY TO NINE HUNDRED PER CENT will throttle or destroy our periodicals at a time when the widest and most extensive circulation of publications is essential to the patriotism , education , and upbuilding of our country .

		Therefore , I , the undersigned , do most earnestly demand the repeal of this burdensome periodical postage amend - ment .

		Professor
W. M. DAVIS	PERSON	, Professor Emeritus in

Johnson	PERSON	's ` Topography and Strategy of the War ' pleases me greatly because of the clear statement that it makes of the importance of geographical features in affecting military move - ments .

		Current newspaper reports are very deficient in this respect .

		Summary statements of prog - ress in the various campaigns are too often little better , apparently because their authors have small knowledge or appreciation of the topography on the different fronts .

		Johnson is , on the other hand , exceptionally competent as a geographer ; from the beginning of the war he has given especial attention to the movements of the opposing armies as affected by the form of the surface .

		His book is , therefore , a valuable contribution to a phase of contemporary history that has too generally suffered from neglect . ''

New York	LOCATION	When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL .

		THE DIAL Si jFortniff & tty Journal of Criticism ann 2Di0cu00ion of Hftrtature anto Unromantic War When I first read
Barbusse	ORGANIZATION	's `` Le Feu , '' now more than a year ago , I knew it for what it is the most searching , the most revealing statement of what modern war means both morally and physically .

		The book has all those intimate signs of truth that carry immediate conviction even to him who has had no personal experience with which to corroborate its record -LRB- as all vital literature convinces as
Dostoev	PERSON	- sky or Gorky convince millions who know nothing personally about
Russia	LOCATION	and Rus - sians -RRB- .

		I have read many books , private as well as published diaries , which attempt to reveal what men suffer and endure in this most hateful of all wars .

		Not one of them and there are many honest revela - tions , unaffected , simple , and sincere ef - forts to put into words the meaning of this monstrous calamity has approached `` Le Feu '' in perception , in sheer capacity for truth .

		Nothing since heard or read has effaced its stinging impression .

		Others deal with familiar surfaces , with personal and incomplete reactions , often noble and sensitive , humorous and philosophical ; but Barbusse gives the thing itself War .

		I sent the book to soldier friends , asked many others , `` What do you think of ` Le Feu ' ? ''

		The invariable answer was , `` That 's it War !

		He 's got it all in . ''

		Grimly , taciturnly , as soldiers speak of the bitter mystery into which fate has plunged them .

		The book began to go , enormously , among soldiers , also among civilians .

		It soon ran into the tens of thousands in the French editions before the attention of Americans was gained for it by an English translation , supplanting in popu - larity such journalistic triviality as `` Gas - pard . ''

		Civilian comment on
Barbusse	ORGANIZATION	's book was less direct , often given with a reserve , almost a resentment , even where the praise was loud enough for its extraor - dinary `` literary strength '' as if its author should be punished for violating the decencies and reticencies of our civi - lization .

		So I came to regard a man 's judgment upon this single book as a kind of test of his soul , especially of the civilian soul of its ability and its willingness to face the truth , to understand War .

		I put my question to every sort of French - man whom I met , in order to sound the civilian temper en derriere , for that after all must ultimately determine the destiny of the terrific conflict .

		The sentimental - ist , I found the incorrigible middle class romanticist , who can never swallow life without some sugar coating condemns Barbusse because he has sternly torn away the last shreds of illusion from the horrid business .

		`` It is not fine , '' the literary per - son complained .

		-LRB- I am thinking of a cul - tivated French professor . -RRB-

		`` It is not Art , '' he said .

		-LRB- O sacred Art , how many petty cowardices shelter beneath thy mys - tic robe ! -RRB-

		`` It is like Zola all dirt and horrors , no ` relief ... Not the whole truth ... Without that elevation of spirit which art requires ... Without the sense of beauty ... '' And so on accord - ing to the chatter of the pretty-pretty school of literature .

		The raw truths which we moderns must face do not fit these politer canons of the old world .

		We are creating new ones to hold a new wine .

		What the literary person thinks counts for little .

		There is another sort of objec - tion to `` Le Feu , '' which carries more weight .

		`` The book does not show a good spirit '' this from a serious minded , patri - otic Frenchman engaged in the work of propaganda .

		His is a political , a patri - otic , a moral condemnation of the picture of War as presented in `` Le Feu . ''

		Bar - busse has shown us soldiers , not only as dirty and unidealistic , degraded by the occupation to which they are condemned , but also as too obviously the blind sport of life human sacrifices of human soci - ety , killing and being killed in a war that 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	is insanity , whose origin and conclusion they can not affect .

		A recent letter in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' contains the same objection to the book .

		Barbusse , the correspondent charges , is a pacifist in disguise , preaching an `` insidious propa - ganda '' against War !

		He has failed to pre - sent the stereotyped poilus dying with `` La France '' on their lips , a smile on their faces .

		Instead he has shown that unfor - gettable company of civilian soldiers awaiting quietly in the gray morning the order to attack , each one fully conscious of what lies beyond the parapet : `` These are men , not heroes , '' he says of them .

		Which is the higher heroism ?

		Of course
Barbusse	PERSON	is a `` pacifist , '' if that wretched word means anything after all the mishandling it has received by patriots .

		If a disgust for the insanity and the inhumanity of War , a steady per - ception of its futilities and its crimes , means `` pacifism , '' I think there must be some millions of such `` pacifists '' on the European battle fronts .

		All the intelli - gent soldiers and officers whom I have met are pacifists in this sense heroic and mili - tant pacifists and it is from them that hope for the world must be born again .

		For they know War , and knowing it they hate it .

		They know how War is con - ducted , the full stupidity of it .

		They sus - pect how wars are bred and do not believe in their inevitability .

		It is the warriors en derriere some of them women who have any illusions about the glory of mass slaughter , and some of the journalists , statesmen , business men , who run the war machine from behind and often run it very badly .

		Those who know best what it is like abhor its every aspect : many of them are fighting with the splendid faith that they are giving their lives to end War , not just this war .

		And others are dying with splendid resignation , in the hope that somehow their sacrifice may serve against the evil of the world .

		They are fighting pacifists , if you like than whom there can be no braver fighters .

		Indeed , what
Barbusse	PERSON	believes and what the person who thinks in terms of newspaper and politician formulae can not see , is that War is most of all an awful process of religious conversion through which the minds of all men will be awak - ened to the recognition of supreme sin .

		It must drag on its dreary , blood-stained course until all whose selfish , thoughtless conduct in times of peace , all grasping and power-loving statesmen , journalists , busi - ness men , indifferents , have received suffi - cient vision to recognize their errors , which cause wars .

		Until , as Prince Lvoff so nobly and sadly said , ``
Europe	LOCATION	and the world has accomplished a new soul . ''

		That new soul will hardly be achieved while we lie to ourselves about War , even from the highest literary or patriotic motives .

		What the French novelist has courageously perceived , all of us must be brought to see and accept .

		Humanity is on the way there are sure signs even in
Germany	LOCATION	to this great realization .

		Those who for self-interest or cowardice or mistaken zeal would conceal or disguise any least particle of essential truth about the War are hindering the coming of the day of our final release .

		The most lament - able immediate effect of War upon human psychology is the tendency to cover up , conceal , distort the truth , for one or an - other of innumerable specious reasons .

		To the stupidity of military censorship , which is fit subject only for opera bouffe , we add the misguided zeal of propagandists and self-appointed guardians of national mo - rale , who serve out the Truth to the public in homeopathic doses , tardily , and agree - ably disguised .

		To this fatal tendency toward obscurantism must be attributed , among other things , the slow awakening of our own country to the crisis upon us .

		Why Prussianize our minds ?

		With the fatal example of
Germany	LOCATION	before us , of a people in blinders to whom after three and a half years of War the first gleams of truth are slowly penetrating , why do we imitate the very vice that we are combat - ing in our foes ?

		Why do we admit that `` there are things which must not be said '' in public ?

		Barbusse 's soldiers filthy , des - perate , subjected to infamous degrada - tions suffer without seeking to evade their fate , for a cause in which every one of us has his personal responsibility .

		Why , then , can we not look steadily at the truth about War ?

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 135
Edward Thomas	PERSON	In the war , we have lost , among thou - sands of young men of high intellectual gifts , a few whose literary talent has been recognized to the full , as
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's ; but the sorest loss to English literature is that of
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, poet and critic , born
March 3 , 1878	DATE	, killed in the Battle of
Arras	LOCATION
April 9 , 1917	DATE	.

		The general public has , I believe , heard of `` The South Country '' -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , `` Rest and Unrest '' -LRB-
1910	DATE	-RRB- , `` Light and Twilight '' -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , the `` Life of Richard Jefferies '' -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , `` The Happy-Go-Lucky Mor - gans '' -LRB-
1913	DATE	-RRB- , the five books most steeped in
Thomas	LOCATION	's beautiful characteristic qual - ity .

		Thomas wrote many books , for , mar - rying early , he had to support his young family by miscellaneous literary work and constant reviewing .

		In youth he was fas - cinated by the work of
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, our great nature writer , whose essays and romances , abounding in the joy of life , are saturated with passionate feeling for the magic and abundance of nature ; and some years before he died
Thomas	PERSON	repaid his debt by the `` Life of
Richard Jeffer	PERSON	- ies , '' one of the most perfect biographies in the language .

		In the first chapter , a preliminary survey of the
Wiltshire	LOCATION	down lands ,
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's native place ,
Thomas	PERSON	shows that he himself is a poet richly dow - ered with observation and imaginative insight into the great pageant of rural life under the open sky .

		It has been said that
Thomas	PERSON	was not sufficiently himself in his nature books , and this is true of such early work as `` The Woodland Life '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- and `` The Heart of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- , but the few passages in `` The South Country '' which recall
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's example one would not alter .

		The writer has perfected his own manner of recording what he sees and feels , and his discipleship is now bearing its spiritual fruit .

		Thomas 's rare individuality , however , found its most perfect expression in his exquisite prose sketches , `` Rest and Unrest '' -LRB-
1910	DATE	-RRB- and `` Light and Twi - light '' -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , and I believe that his claim to high , permanent rank rests on these little books .

		-LRB- `` Rose-Acre Papers '' 1910 a reprint from some early essays , is too self-consciously `` literary '' in style to rank with them . -RRB-

		We have heard a good deal about Celtic magic in literature since
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's famous article appeared , but without denying the claims of other men , I think
Edward Thomas	PERSON	a finer example of the Celtic sense of beauty than any of the young Irish school .

		Thomas , though born and reared in
England	LOCATION	, was of Welsh blood on the paternal side , and in his spir - itual affinities he harked back to the old ruling caste which speaks to us in litera - ture through the `` Mabinogion '' and the poems of
Daveth Ab-Gwylliam	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ex - tremely fastidious , diffident , and proud ,
Thomas	PERSON	by his reticence and fine reserva - tions of feeling rather chilled the com - mon man .

		His sensitive self-consciousness did him no good with editors , who , busy mortals , were as incapable as their public of appreciating the unique quality of his imaginative sketches .

		To his intimates
Thomas	PERSON	's quiet , cool irony , his proud del - icacy of feeling , his shy hauteur wafted an atmosphere as refreshing as a mountain stream 's or a spring birch grove 's in the
Welsh	LOCATION	mountains .

		A fresh chastity of spirit , a nobility of strain -LRB- he had a touch of Spanish blood -RRB- , an aloofness from everything mediocre in human affairs , pre - served his nature from the least touch of worldliness .

		Poet and scholar , however , as
Thomas	PERSON	was , he had a keen eye for men and manners and when he wished he could get into touch with homely people and enjoy , none better , whatever is racily human .

		His noble head , his tall figure , and sensitive bearing often attracted peo - ple 's eyes , but of this he was unconscious .

		His temperamental melancholy and a touch of hypochondria he combated by long , solitary walking-tours in the south of
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, where he found fresh material for his nature books and prose sketches .

		But how is one to depict the spiritual essence of Thomas 's work ?

		I shall not speak here of his critical studies of Swin - burne ,
Pater	PERSON	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and
George Borrow	PERSON	, which , highly individual in insight , are perhaps sometimes marked bv 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	judgments of too fastidious severity .

		As a critic of poetry Thomas particularly excelled , and I may mention here that a posthumous volume of his poems is shortly to appear .

		Some remarkable specimens given in `` An Annual of New Poetry '' -LRB-
1917	DATE	-RRB- are as new a departure in English verse as was Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	's `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	'' in American verse .

		But what - ever may be the verdict on his poetry ,
Thomas	PERSON	was essentially a poet , thinly dis - guised , in his imaginative prose sketches , as in `` The Flower Gatherer , '' `` Home , '' `` Mothers and Sons , '' `` Olwen , '' and , indeed , in the scores of others that make up `` Rest and Unrest '' and `` Light and Twilight . ''

		In these little volumes he shows he is master of English , pure , lim - pid , delicate and for clear beauty of imagery and sensitive grace of contour he rivals even
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		To
Thomas	PERSON	, a poet , a thing betrays its spiritual origins .

		And his descriptions relate a thing seen to the main stream of human activities , to which it is as a drop in a sentient ocean .

		Thus `` A Group of Statuary '' a haunting description of a group of broken men with heads bowed in weary apathy , seated in a hot , dusty Lon - don Square contrasts this human wast - age , cast aside by industrialism 's hurrying wheels , with the dull indifference of the passers-by , to whom this sight brings neither wonder nor pity .

		The civi - lization that bears an abundance of such malformed fruit is indicted by the writer 's grave detachment .

		But the shades of
Thomas	PERSON	's reflective irony here are too fine for more than one in twenty readers to grasp their deep import .

		This sketch , `` A Group of Statuary , '' came to my memory the other day on a journey by train which carried me through the six-mile breadth of mean streets , huge fac - tories , dirty tenements , wharves , ware - houses , and workshops of
East London	LOCATION	, lying under their dreary pall of dusty smoke .

		I reflected that probably not a score of people among these millions of workers had ever heard of Thomas or read a line of his writings .

		Yet `` Light and Twilight '' and `` Rest and Unrest '' will be read as classics when all this mass of dirty brick and mortar and frowning stone and iron has passed away to the scrap heap .

		So powerful is the written word and the spirit of beauty !

		And to
Thomas	PERSON	beauty was no cult of sestheticism cloistered or divorced from reality , but the simple love of whatever is gracious , pure , precious in human feeling , and of all that purges the spirit and awakens it to joy in the earth and in nature 's activities .

		His finest prose sprang from direct contemplation of the old-world hills and valleys , the coasts and streams , the woods and fields and pastures from which the inhabitants of the mon - strous modern towns have , in one genera - tion or another , severed themselves .

		And this strange , incongruous spectacle of the new and the old life in the country and the towns , pushing from roots interlaced in our British soil , arrested
Thomas	PERSON	's imagination .

		With what perfection
Thomas	PERSON	captured the essential character of a landscape and its inhabitants is shown in `` Mothers and Sons , '' a sketch , cunningly exact , of a
South Wales	LOCATION	mining village where all the horrors of raw industrialism , crude , glaring , and greedy , are seen at work , swallowing up the quiet simplicity of an old-world parish with its three or four farms , watermills , the chapel in the ancient oak wood , and scattered cottages in the brambly lanes .

		And
Thomas	PERSON	was no sentimentalist .

		The realities of the old life and the new are shown in the chat of wise Mrs.
Morgan	PERSON	and Mrs.
Owen	PERSON	, and the virtues of the mining folk shine forth in this picture of a Welsh family 's hospital - ity and homely kindliness .

		In a companion sketch , `` A Cottage Door , ''
Thomas	PERSON	sums up , in his poetic apostrophe , the contradic - tions in this `` demon of humanity '' which is `` hideous and beautiful , cruel in igno - rance , recking not what it is making , as it squats there upon the earth .

		It is old but it is a babe .

		It would be noble but it must be vile . ''

		`` Home , '' this beautiful vision of the Welsh countryside , conveys a truer sense of the wild character , the strange beauty of
Wales	LOCATION	in her fierceness and her antique melancholy , than any other passage I have met in literature .

		For a study of character , read ``
Sunday	DATE	After - noon , '' where the spirit of a narrow - minded , exacting , steely-natured woman , Mrs.
Wilkins	PERSON	, dreadful in her hard virtue
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 137 and intense unimaginativeness , is explored .

		We give unstinted praise to the great Rus - sian realists for the spiritual truth of their pictures of life ; but the sketches I have cited , and others , such as `` Olwen , '' `` The Attempt , '' `` The First of
Spring	DATE	, '' vie in delicacy of perception and poetic in - sight with
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	's `` A Sportsman 's Sketches . ''

		Thomas , too , shows that he has grasped with unerring intuition the evasive secrets of human life .

		Thomas , however , rarely treats a man 's character at full length .

		He is too subjective , too introspective a writer to do more than sketch the figures of men and women seen in their appropriate atmos - phere .

		As a poet he is more intent on observing and recording the beauty of life as it mirrors itself in the calm glass of his imagination .

		``
July	DATE	, '' the description of two lovers lost in the stream of their mutual joy as they wander hand in hand through the forest , is very characteristic of the brooding depth of his thought human joy is shown here in the waning light of nature 's mutability .

		As `` poetical , '' but more characteristically Welsh in romantic feeling , are the beautiful `` Win - ter Music , '' `` The Castle of
Lostormel	PERSON	- lyn , '' `` Snow and Sand , '' `` The Queen of the Waste Lands , '' and `` Maiden 's Wood . ''

		The extreme subtlety of
Thomas	PERSON	's thought , his apprehension of the finest shades of those mysterious sensations which declare the unity of all life and the oneness of time and eternity , is expressed with con - summate felicity in `` The Fountain , '' `` The Queen of the Waste Lands , '' and `` Winter Music . ''

		That such perfect poems in prose are so little known to our public is a reflec - tion on the intelligence of our critics .

		I did not myself , I fear , ever fully express to Thomas my appreciation of these exquisite achievements .

		Now he lies in his grave in
France	LOCATION	and his own epitaph he has written in one of these sketches : In that company I had learned that I am some - thing which no fortune can touch , whether I be soon to die or long years away .

		Things will hap - pen which will trample and pierce , but I shall go on , something that is here and there like the wind , something unconquerable , something not to be sep - arated from the dark earth and the light sky , a strong citizen of infinity and eternity .

		I knew that I could not do without the Infinite , nor the Infinite without me .

		The Structure of Lasting Peace IX .

		THE FEDERALIZATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES : A PRECEDENT NOT ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW The thirteen original British colonies in
America	LOCATION	, united against the aggressive exploitation of the British government , differed in one fundamental respect from the free states
today	DATE	in alliance against
Germany	LOCATION	: they had no `` problems of nationality . ''

		By and large , they were of one blood , one language , and one legal and political tradition .

		That this did not prevent bitter quarrels and even warfare among them is only another evidence that nationality , even when sovereign , is not the antidote to warfare its contemporary protagonists assert it is .

		Men go to war from other motives as well , and the phe - nomenon of two states of the same nation - ality at each other 's throats is not so infrequent in history that it may be ignored .

		Members of the thirteen colon - ies were at each other 's throats for a variety of reasons , religious and economic , and it was only the menace of a common enemy that at first drew and held them together .

		They came together as `` sov - ereign and independent states , '' reluctantly , strongly suspicious of one another and inclined to act each in its own behalf .

		To meet an enemy strong , well armed , and well supplied , they had to provide an army with all that an army needs for effective effort in the field .

		And they had to create this provision out of practically nothing at all , to secure the very finances with which to create .

		From the beginning each state held to its right to perform its share of this work for itself and as it chose , without regard for , or any attempt at cooperation with , the other states .

		From the beginning each state failed to do its proper share , out of fear , largely , that it 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	might be doing more than its share ; and each state , correspondingly , complained of the inefficiency of the central authority , the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the Con - gress was in effect a consulting and ad - visory body , becoming negligible through inaction , and doomed to inaction because it was without real power .

		The war , in - deed , was not truly one war but many wars , and the remoter states were colder to the issues and conditions of the conflict than those at its seat .

		These issues and conditions were the inevitable ones of finance , of the control of the food-supply , of the army commissariat .

		The lack of common action and unified authority on these points caused untold suffering to the soldiers and indefinitely prolonged the struggle .

		To secure the necessary unity the Con - gress had discussed for a year and finally submitted to the legislatures of the states articles of a confederation without which the war could not successfully be carried on .

		These articles did not win final rati - fication till
1781	DATE	.

		They were accompanied by a circular letter the following extract from which is relevant : The business -LSB- of unification -RSB- , equally intricate and important , has in its progress been attended with uncommon embarrassments and delay , which the most anxious solicitude and persevering dili - gence could not prevent .

		To form a permanent union , accommodated to the opinion and wishes of the delegates of so many states differing in habits , produce , commerce , and internal police , was found to be a work with which nothing but time and reflection , conspiring with a disposition to conciliate -LSB- italics mine -RSB- could mature and accomplish .

		Hardly is it to be expected that any plan , in the variety of provisions essential to our union , should exactly correspond with the maxims and political views of every particular state .

		Let it be re - marked that , after the most careful inquiry and the fullest information , this is proposed as the best which could be adapted to the circumstances of all , and as that alone which affords any tolerable pros - pect of general satisfaction .

		The Articles of Confederation were primarily a war measure , designed to make the efforts of many sovereign states effect - ive against one common enemy .

		They were by second intention an instrument of security between the states themselves , designed to maintain lasting peace between them and to strengthen each with all and all with each .

		They provided therefore that the states were to retain all un - delegated sovereignty ; that they were to constitute an absolute military unity against the enemy assaulting any one of them ; that the citizens of one , moving to another , were to receive equal treatment with the citizens of that other ; that each should have equal authority with the others , large or small , on the basis of one state , one vote ; that no state might enter into special relations with another , or with a foreign power , except by general consent ; that no state might ordain a tariff at cross-purposes with the general interest ; that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	alone , representing the general interest , might determine the armament of each state ; that no state might go to war except by general con - sent ; that hence treaties , alliances , the making of war and peace were to be the functions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to be the `` last resort on appeal on all dif - ferences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more states con - cerning boundary , jurisdiction , or any other cause whatsoever . ''

		Its proceedings were to be publicly recorded in a journal to be kept for that purpose .

		The Articles provided , please observe , for all the con - tingencies that liberal opinion finds it desirable to guard against in the relations between contemporary states .

		They are a programme of internationalism .

		Under them the Revolutionary War dragged out to a successful conclusion .

		But with the coming of peace the force of the inter - national authority , of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	they provided for , lapsed altogether .

		The states reverted to their aboriginal sovereignty , and worse .

		The central authority carried an enormous burden of debt , the states were destitute , the country disorganized .

		Patriotism , that is , local loyalties of the peoples to their different state govern - ments , was intense .

		The mutual antipathies and clashing interests of the Americans , their difference of governments , habitudes , and manners -LSB- wrote
Josiah Tucker	PERSON	-RSB- indicate that they will have no center of union and no common interest !

		They can never be united into one compact empire under any species of government whatever ; a disunited people till the end of time , suspicious and distrustful of each other , they will be divided and subdivided into little commonwealths or principalities , according to natural boundaries , by great bays of the sea , and by vast rivers , lakes , and ranges of mountains .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 139 Add dynastic and national interests , and the description absolutely dots the present and future of both the powers within the democratic alliance and those opposed to it .

		But the Dean of
Gloucester	LOCATION	was mis - taken .

		The situation he described , the unnecessary length and hardship of the war , the horrible civil blunders never would have arisen at all if the Articles of Confederation had made
Congress	ORGANIZATION	truly authoritative and had provided it with power to enforce its ordinances .

		Its power unfortunately was like that of the
Hague Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	, purely advisory : `` They may declare everything , '' wrote
Justice Story	ORGANIZATION	, `` but can do nothing . ''

		Only the presence of the common enemy kept Con - gress in force during the war .

		With the coming of peace , not only did its power tend to lapse ; it was scorned , and the several states treated it with the sus - picion due an encroaching foreigner .

		`` The Confederation was , '' according to
J. Q. Adams	PERSON	, `` perhaps as closely knit together as it was possible that such a form of polity could be grappled ; but it was matured by the
State Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	without consul - tation with the people -LSB- the italics are mine -RSB- and the jealousy of sectional collisions and the distrust of all delegation of power , stamped every feature of the work with inefficiency . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	hit upon the very heart of the difficulty .

		The Con - federation was a thing made by statesmen and diplomats .

		Reputable though they were , their mere authority could not win for it the allegiance of the masses , and without that it could have no force .

		Had the masses been instructed by discussion and analysis , and had public opinion been awakened to reenforce the obviously wise programme , the history of these
United States	ORGANIZATION	would have been otherwise written .

		Because public opinion had not been roused , the removal of enemy pressure was followed by a reversion to pre-war conditions , aggravated by the disabling consequences of the war .

		The separate states at once began to act upon the tradi - tional principle that a government 's safety depends upon its own strength and its neighbors ' weakness .

		Tariff war began almost immediately .

		Various ententes and alliances were initiated .

		Massachu - setts tried to detach the other
New Eng	LOCATION	- land states into a separate union .


New York	LOCATION	went to war with
Vermont	LOCATION	, which had declared its independence of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, over the strip of
Vermont	LOCATION	settled by
New Yorkers	LOCATION	and paying taxes to
New York	LOCATION	.


Maryland	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	organized a sort of zollverein which Dela - ware and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	were later invited to join .

		It did seem as if the threatened distintegration of the Confederation were inevitable .

		One thing held it together and kept for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	such authority as remained to it .

		This was the public do - main .

		Prior to the confederation the various states had held or claimed enor - mous reaches of territory , stretching to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	or beyond .

		-LRB- These territories correspond to the colonial possessions of today 's warring states . -RRB-


Maryland	LOCATION	's refusal to confederate until all the holdings of the states should be surrendered to the common authority compelled the pooling of these lands , and the lands pooled thereupon became the national domain .

		The domain consti - tuted a tangible obvious interstate interest and was in effect the cornerstone of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the same time , the best minds in all of the states not those in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	but those that had the respect of the masses were agitated by the difficulties of the situation .

		The problems that needed ad - justment were precisely those that so largely need adjustment today , the prob - lems of international commerce and fi - nance , of the common highways of trade , of tariffs , of undeveloped territories .

		Their solution , it was recognized , re - quired an effective easement upon the ex - clusive sovereignty of each state .

		The initiation of the Maryland-Virginia zoll - verein was an attempt at such an easement with respect to a vital matter , analogous in contemporary
Europe	LOCATION	to the inter - nationalization of the
Danube	LOCATION	.

		The movement to include all the states in an extension of this arrangement led to the Constitutional Convention , an `` assembly of demigods '' that owed its existence as much to the self-sacrifice and initiative of the non-administrative leaders of political 140 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The `` Fait de la Semaine '' -LRB-
Grasset	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- is a periodical of which each number is a complete pamphlet on a given subject .

		The idea is an excellent one since it enables an important ques - tion to be treated much more fully than it could be treated within the limits of a review article .

		Recently the subjects have often been not only important ones but also ones about which the public is least informed .

		Number Three , for instance , was entitled `` Ce qu'un Frangais doit savoir des Etats-Unis '' and was the joint pro- duction of four authors : MM .


Emile Boutroux	PERSON	,
Jules Lepain	PERSON	, Firmin-Roz , and Mr.

		Most people in
France	LOCATION	know very little about
America	LOCATION	; the only type of American with whom they have come into contact or of whom they know something by repute is the multi-millionaire for the humbler tourist is known chiefly to hotel-keepers and their con - ception of the American people is consequently not very accurate .

		An account of
America	LOCATION	, its institutions , its people , and its leading character - istics , was therefore useful and timely .

		Now that
Paris	LOCATION	and certain other localities in
France	LOCATION	are full of the American army and its auxiliary services , the French public is acquiring a per - sonal knowledge even more valuable , which can not but strengthen the traditional ties of friendship between the two peoples .

		Another country about which we talk a great deal just now , but of which most of us know nothing , is
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is with
Russia	LOCATION	that the issue of the `` Fait de la Semaine '' of
December 22	DATE	-LRB- Number Nine -RRB- deals .

		Its title is `` Perdons - nous la Russie ? ''

		and its author is

M. Moutet	PERSON	,
M. Laffon	PERSON	, and
M. Marcel Cachin	PERSON	, who have all visited
Russia	LOCATION	since the revolution , all succeeded in penetrating below the surface and getting into touch with the pro- letariat .


M. Cachin	PERSON	, in particular , discovered why the Germans gained so strong a hold in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We are accustomed , says
M. Sembat	PERSON	, to think of the Germans as having played the parts in
Russia	LOCATION	of spies , courtiers , government officials , and even generals ; but it was not their intervention in this respect that gave them their influence before the war .

		As
M. Cachin	PERSON	dis - covered , the secret of their influence was that they had also been the educators of the Russians .

		At
Moscow M. Cachin	ORGANIZATION	was entertained most hospitably by some charming Russians , devoted to
France	LOCATION	, but he noticed that all their furniture was in the
Munich	LOCATION	style and he could not help remarking upon it .

		His hosts , after a moment 's hesitation , explained that whereas the French were hardly seen in
Russia	LOCATION	, the Germans had been the constant educators of the Russians .

		There was a French colony at
Moscow	LOCATION	of from 1,000 to 1,200 , but the German colony before the war numbered about 100,000 .

		At the great
Moscow Coooperative	ORGANIZATION	, which has millions of members all over the country ,
M. Cachin	PERSON	heard the same story .

		It was the German cooperator ,
Muller	PERSON	of
Hamburg	LOCATION	, who came to start the insti - tution and teach the Russians how to run it , and the first managers were Germans .

		`` We are their pupils , '' said the
Moscow	LOCATION	cooperators ; `` how can we help being grateful to them ? ''

		This discovery made a profound impression on
M. Cachin	PERSON	and , as
M. Sembat	PERSON	says , it pro- vides matter for reflection ; the preponderant German influence in
Italy	LOCATION	was , he adds , due to exactly the same reasons .

		I myself remember an Italian friend 's lamenting to me some five or six years ago that it was almost impossible to attract English capital into
Italy	LOCATION	, in spite of the marvelous openings there .

		We prefer the English to the Germans , he said , but the English will neither settle in
Italy	LOCATION	for business purposes nor invest in Italian enterprises and the Ger - mans do both ; the result is that the Germans control a large proportion of Italian commerce and industry .

		Instead of denouncing the Ger - mans for their industry and enterprise , it would have been wiser on our part to imitate them .

		The success of the Maximalists is attributed 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	by
M. Sembat	PERSON	to three causes : the desire of the Russian people for men of action , their fear of the restoration of the Czardom by a military coup d'etat , their longing for peace .

		Kerensky came to grief because he did not act , and his government ceased to have any support in the country ; it fell so easily because nobody cared to defend it .

		The Korniloff attempt , which so large a proportion of the French and English press foolishly supported , aroused the fear of a Czarist restoration ; Kerensky was more or less compromised in it and the people were driven into the arms of the extremists , who became the saviors of the revolution .

		Above all , the Maxi - malists triumphed because they promised peace .

		Not that the Russian people had the least desire to make a separate peace or to desert the Allies ; it wished to go on defending
Russia	LOCATION	against the invaders , but it also wished that there should be general peace negotiations while the war con - tinued .

		All the official declarations of the Soviets prove that .

		In
M. Sembat	PERSON	's opinion it is the mistaken policy of the Allies that has driven the Russians into separate negotiations with the Cen - tral Empires .

		Another mistake was the refusal to permit the
Stockholm	LOCATION	conference , which would have had the immense advantage of not compromising the governments , since the Social - ists alone would have taken part in it , at their own risk and peril , and they could subsequently have been disowned , if necessary , by their respec - tive governments .

		M. Sembat urges that the mistake should be immediately rectified so far as it can be at the eleventh hour .

		The only hope of keeping
Russia	LOCATION	in the
Alliance	ORGANIZATION	is to get into contact at once with the men that have the power in
Russia	LOCATION	, and only Socialists can do that with any hope of success .

		The French govern - ment has made use of Catholics in
Spain	LOCATION	, very rightly since it was the Catholic party in that country that was Pro-German ; why should it not make use of Socialists in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		If the objection is the fear of increasing the importance of the Socialist party , it is a very petty one .

		Perhaps the recent courageous attitude of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	has somewhat mitigated that objection .

		This extremely able and interesting pamphlet comes at an opportune moment , for the Russian situation occupies much of our attention .

		Nat - urally , popular feeling in
France	LOCATION	is very strong against the Russians .


France	LOCATION	was dragged into the war by fidelity to the Russian alliance and it is felt to be very hard that
Russia	LOCATION	should now leave
France	LOCATION	in the lurch .

		Natural as that feel - ing is , it is not altogether just and
M. Sembat	PERSON	's wise remarks may help to modify it .

		He treats his serious and thorny subject with that light - ness of touch that is characteristic of him ; the pamphlet is full of wit and of tact .

		His dex - terity in skating over thin ice is marvelous .

		This apparently almost frivolous way of dealing with a grave question does not in the least detract from the value of the pamphlet ; on the contrary , it merely makes it eminently readable .

		There is a certain intellectual affinity between
M. Sem	ORGANIZATION	- bat and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	; dull people think that neither of them is serious and complain of their tendency to paradox , as if the most pro- found truths were not expressed in paradox .

		One of the greatest of living Frenchmen once said to me that he could not stand anybody that had not a touch of the paradoxical .

		It is a long time since we had a new play by
M. de Porto-Riche	ORGANIZATION	, one of the most accomplished and interesting of contemporary French drama - tists , and we had pleasant anticipations of `` Le Marchand d'Estampes , '' recently produced at the Athenee theatre .

		But the reality was rather a disappointment , for the play is not equal to its author 's best work .

		Of course , it is admirably written , for M. de Porto-Riche could not write otherwise than well ; it is also undoubtedly inter - esting , but it is not entirely convincing .

		It is the story of a print-dealer , who has been wounded at the front and whose nervous system has been so shaken that it has suffered permanently .

		He comes home , discharged from the army , to a wife whom he has adored and who has returned his devotion ; but he has fallen in love with another woman .

		The latter refuses his advances and he is reduced to a state of helpless depression , while his wife bravely continues to run the shop and bear her trouble .

		When at last the other woman consents to become his mistress and they are about to go away together , he can not bring him - self to leave his wife ; he confesses to her the step that he contemplates and they agree to die together , since happiness is henceforth impossible for them both .

		Considering the mental condi - tion of the man , this conclusion is quite possi - ble and natural on his part ; he might well have committed suicide in such circumstances .

		But given the character of the wife as M. de
Porto	LOCATION	- Riche depicts her throughout the play , it is not natural and hardly possible on her part .

		And it is here that the play fails to convince .

		Such a woman might have been capable of sacrificing
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 143 herself and abandoning her husband to the other woman to secure his happiness ; she might have proposed to her husband to give up their shop and leave
Paris	LOCATION	to try a new life elsewhere ; there are many solutions possible .

		But never would she have consented to commit suicide .

		Nevertheless , the play is a welcome contrast to most of those that we have been given since the war and even for some years before it .

		What - ever its faults , it remains the work of a great dramatist and , with the exception of M. Ger - aldy 's `` Noces d'Argent , '' it is the only new play worth serious notice that has been produced since the war .

		Let us hope that now that
M. de Porto	ORGANIZATION	- Riche has broken his long silence we had had nothing from him for several years before the war he will not again desert the theatre .

Paris	LOCATION	,
January 4	DATE	, iQi8 .

		Trotzky , A Doubtful Ally THE BOLSHEVIKI AND WORLD PEACE .

		By
Leon Trotzky	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by
Lincoln Stef	PERSON	- fens .

		Boni and
Liveright	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Suppose the war were to end tomorrow where would the historian look for his Car - lylean hero ?

		Even the most churlish Prussian would scarcely begrudge admission that
France	LOCATION	's levee en masse was as thrilling as anything we have seen since nationalism became a political reality .

		But
France	LOCATION	's spiritual energy seemed well-nigh exhausted in the achievement .

		Cer - tainly she has not yet brought forth leaders who are the complete inheritors of her glorious tra - ditions .

		Can
Clemenceau	PERSON	or Joffre or Poincare fill the bill ?

		The pettifogging deputies of the Chamber ?

		Hardly .

		Nor has
England	LOCATION	done much more than reveal the enduring virtues of her liberal and laborite leaders , like
Asquith	PERSON	and
Henderson	PERSON	, when contrasted with the stark reac - tionism of the Tories .

		Her present leader ,
Lloyd George	PERSON	, can not stir us .

		Many of his own coun - trymen regard him as the apotheosis of middle - class mediocrity , energy disguising itself as in - sight , an early Chauvinism and braggadocio modi - fied into a later temperateness by the unrelenting casualty lists from
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	then ?

		Surely not the
Kaiser	PERSON	, with his childish vanity and love of a bright uniform ; the
Kaiser	PERSON	, who in the words `` Vorwarts '' employed to describe Bethmann-Hollweg `` means well feebly . ''

		Not an emperor who is the football of his Genera -RSB- Staff ; who is too weak to decide whether or not to chance his dynasty on the stopping of a war , which , begun to enhance his prestige , will unless soon ended destroy him utterly .

		Not a sovereign who cowers before a possible military dictator - ship , yet lacks the courage to lead his people from the morass of misery and shame into which their Hindenburgs and Hoffmanns and Ludendorffs and von Steins have led them .

		The little kinglets and petty tyrants of the
Balkans	LOCATION	, or even young
Charles	PERSON	, protesting his innocence and good inten - tions loudly to heaven , with an uneasy glance backward towards
Berlin	LOCATION	?

		All , all are gone , even
Enver Pasha	PERSON	.

		America , you say .

		Yes , but we have only one leader
Wilson	PERSON	and he has himself repudiated the laurel of leadership .

		He prefers to regard himself as an `` interpreter . ''

		Nor is it likely that the future historian 's estimate will disagree with his own .

		In contrast to most teachers who have come into power ,
Wilson	PERSON	has exhibited an ex - traordinary flexibility of mind before actual events .

		He has been able to learn as well as teach ; he has imbibed knowledge as well as im - parted it .

		In other words , he has not been stub - born before the logic of circumstances .

		When he could not control , he has chosen the path of wisdom and adopted as his own as in the case of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		This , according to the modern doc - trine , is `` interpretation , '' and it is soundly pragmatic .

		It means that one learns , but not necessarily that one leads .

		Of course it may be that the `` hero '' in the Carlylean sense is only one more of the many myths that the war has subjected to the barrage fire of everyday reality .

		Leadership of the grandiose , old-fashioned sort becomes rather ar - chaic in a world of machines , `` coordination , '' and technical experts .

		It is unquestionably risky .

		Today the powerful man appears not so much as the fountainhead of moral forces as the skilful juggler of parliamentary majorities , the com - promiser and astute trimmer among the winds of unreason , greed , and flickering nobility , the adjuster and adapter of circumstances .

		Every intelligent man seems fascinated with the `` in - strumental '' theory by which the grapes of `` pri - ority '' and `` centralized control '' are cheerfully plucked from the bloody thistles of the trenches .

		Forces grow up imperceptibly to be `` directed . ''

		It is sheer arrogance to become a force oneself .

		To be downright , consistent , clear , uncomprom - ising all that , we were told , is merely for the doctrinaire and the ineffectual , the declasse who 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	hover jealously on the fringes of authority .

		So ran the song of the day .

		Until Trotzky appeared .

		By all the rules of the game , as heretofore played , he should not have counted .

		He lacked birth and manners and taste .

		He was a fanatic , an obsolete
Marx	PERSON	- ian who clung pertinaciously to a theory of the class war which up-to-date thinkers regarded as outworn .

		He had been exiled from one country to another , landing finally in the
East Side	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		There he lived the obscure and hand-to - mouth existence of the Socialist orator and feuilletonist according to well-fed radicals , a pathetically unimportant figure .

		Even on his return to
Russia	LOCATION	, after a few weeks ' detainment , he was regarded as only mildly dangerous and on the protest of the Kerensky government per - mitted to continue his journey .

		When his name began to appear more frequently in the Allied and neutral press , the ostrich game of belittling his importance went cheerfully on .

		He was merely one of the crazy `` reds '' then leading Rus - sia on to her dance of death , a wild-eyed , long - haired anarchist to be laughed at as long as he was out of power and roundly cursed as a traitor to the Allied cause when he came into power .

		All this , of course , was absurd how absurd his book , written before the Russian Revolution , now shows .

		Does he repudiate the idea of na - tionality ?

		Not at all : his choicest epithets are reserved for the archaic and feudal Austro-Hun - garian government .

		Nothing would please him more than to see the
Dual Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	smashed and the `` suppressed '' nationalities given their own language , schools , government .

		He argues with great force for something less mild than federation as a solution of the
Southeastern Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean question .

		Provided the curse of imperial jealousy and economic aggrandizement to him , an inevitable consequence of the present capital - istic system can be overcome by revolution of the proletariat everywhere , it is merely a matter of taste , `` self-determination , '' how many national states are in existence .

		In the new world of proletarian control , according to Trotzky , na - tional states will lose their menace .

		When the workers of the world are united , they will save their machine guns only for the bourgeoisie everywhere .

		You will be a worker before you are a Russian or German or American .

		Does he excuse
Germany	LOCATION	for starting this war ?

		On the contrary , no bitterer indictment of Ger - many 's guilt has ever been written than
Trotzky	ORGANIZATION	's analysis of the Germans ' claim of a war of self - defense .

		Has he brotherly words for the meek German Socialists ?

		Listen to what he has to say of `` Vorwarts 's '' exhortation to the German workers `` to hold out until the decisive victory is ours '' : Of course we must not look for ideas , logic , and truth where they do not exist .

		This is simply a case of an ulcer of slavish sentiments bursting open and foul pus crawling over the pages of the workingman 's press .

		It is clear that the oppressed class which pro- ceeds too slowly and inertly on its way toward free - dom must in the final hour drag all its hopes and promises through mire and blood , before there arises in its soul the pure , unimpeachable voice the voice of revolutionary honor .

		He condemns the German Socialist Party for too tender regard for their party organization , too much `` minimalism , '' too solicitous an eye for their prestige and power .

		In tying itself to the chariot wheels of the imperialistic state , the party lost its own soul .

		It developed the `` machine , '' which for its continued existence was as de - pendent as any other political `` machine '' in
Germany	LOCATION	upon the government 's success in the war .

		Thus developed , as a by-product of op - portunism , the frightful spectacle of working - class imperialism .

		Trotzky has full realization of the danger of a German victory .

		Why then does he want immediate peace ?

		Because on its military side he believes the war has reached a deadlock , and its continued pro- longation means the mutual exhaustion of the fighting spirit in the working-class .

		He wants the war to end before the belligerency of the proletariat is sucked dry in what he regards as this irrelevant conflict .

		Enough force must re - main in the proletariat to overthrow their gov - ernments and to conduct a first-class revolution , Russian style .

		With the disillusion which will inevitably follow peace negotiations , he feels that events can be so maneuvred that revolution will result in almost every country but especially in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		And he warns all and sundry governments that when the revolutions do start , the working-class will have learned a lesson from this war which it will not speedily forget the lesson that necessity knows no law .

		Bourgeois legalism will not frighten workingmen who have lain in the mud and shot their brothers .

		Had the average good citizen read this book a few months ago , he would probably have re - flected : `` Well , this fellow is certainly a devil , and if he ever gets loose nobody 's property will be safe .

		Whatever else he may be , he 's certainly not Pro-German .

		He 's a ' clear and vigorous thinker , a dangerous revolutionist .

		But there 's
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 145 one consolation .

		If he ever does get into power in
Russia	LOCATION	, he wo n't be able to put his ideas across .

		On the other hand , he 's a real menace to the Allies .

		With all his fine talk , an agitation for an immediate peace will only , as a matter of cold fact , result in an advantage to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The Russian army is already gone ; its morale is broken .

		The people want peace at any price .

		Trotzky will be in no position to be impudent to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He will have to truckle .

		He may have words , but the Germans have guns .

		Let us get together and call him a Pro-German any - way and discredit him .

		Then he can keep his theories to himself , and not sell
Russia	LOCATION	out to
Germany	LOCATION	in the name of the holy Revolution . ''

		Such , at any rate , seemed to be the tactics of the reactionary press in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		They were content to remain in the intellectual twilight of opinion which has characterized them since the war began .

		They exhausted the vocabulary of mud on Trotzky : his pockets bulged with German gold -LRB- as per - haps they did , for the Junkers believed , on Allied authority , they had found an easy mark -RRB- ; he was a traitor for whom hanging was too good .

		In this strain the abuse continued until
Brest	LOCATION	-
Litovsk	PERSON	.

		Then something happened , which sur - prised the Germans no less than the Allies .

		Trotzky did n't truckle .

		He was impudent , truthful .

		Armed with his idea and his honesty of purpose , he snapped his fingers at the entire German army and told them to come on , what good would it do them ?

		Did the diplomatists dare to go back home and tell their proletariat that they did n't want a democratic peace ?

		British Labor responded almost immediately to this amazing spectacle ; so did
Wilson	PERSON	in a speech which was his finest accomplishment .

		Of course it had always been plain what Trotzky would do , plain , that is , to anybody who knew how religiously our newspapers misinterpret , plain to those who had ever seen or talked to Trotzky .

		Today it is plain to the world .

		The Russian delegates at Brest-Litovsk have the public , open approval of our President .

		Today , with the news of
Russia	LOCATION	's exit from the war , the situation remains a puzzle .

		Has Trotzky sold out to the Germans ?

		On the surface it looks like it .

		For it is one thing to take control of a nation which has gone to pieces , which has lost its army , and to try to make cap - ital out of this very weakness as
Trotzky	ORGANIZATION	did at Brest-Litovsk .

		It is quite another thing to throw open the economic resources of a country to the enemy , even while you refuse to sign a `` formal peace treaty . ''

		Yet it is impossible to read his book without searching for a more complex ex - planation .

		No man could be such a consummate liar , so shameless a betrayer of his own prin - ciples .

		No : Trotzy is risking everything on an ultimate revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	, brought about by passive and moral resistance , propaganda , words .

		It is a terrible chance to take , and may result in handing
Russia	LOCATION	over to German dom - ination for a century .

		What lesson is there in this tragedy of
Russia	LOCATION	for the Allies ?

		How can it be stopped ?

		What chance have we now to make
Germany	LOCATION	revolt ?

		It is too late to retrieve our former blunders and diplomatic stupidity .

		All we can do is to make sure that the much - heralded German `` drive , '' if it comes , is blocked .

		When that fails as it must fail the arrogant Junkers will not have a single card left to play .

		Then in truth the revolt may come in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		What irony if the democratic peace Trotzky preaches shall be won for him on the fields of Flanders by the blood of those he has , in his skep - ticism , repudiated !

		if those whom today he ques - tions should tomorrow prove his doubts groundless !

		HAROLD STEARNS .

		a Poet Should Never Be Educated FIRST OFFERING .

		By
Samuel Roth	PERSON	.

$ 1	MONEY	.

		RENASCENCE , and Other Poems .

		By
Edna St. Vincent Millay	PERSON	.

		Kennerley ;

		FIRST POEMS .

		By
Edwin Curran	PERSON	.

		Published by the author ,
Zanesville	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	; 35 cts .

		These three first volumes , with their curious kinship and even more curious contrasts , furnish a variety of themes .

		They offer material for several essays : on `` What Constitutes Rap - ture '' ; on `` The Desire of the Moth for the Star '' ; on `` The Growing Tendency among Cer - tain Publishers to Ask One Dollar and
Fifty Cents for Seventy Pages of Verse	ORGANIZATION	'' ; on `` A Bill for the Conservation of Conservative Poetry '' ; on `` Life , Literature , and the Last Analysis '' ; on `` Why a Poet Should Never be Educated . ''

		One can not deal with all these fascinating con - siderations , but I hope to suggest the crippling effect the college usually has on the embryonic poet ; how imagination is slurred over and form is magnified ; how rhapsody is tuned down to rhetoric and regularity ; how poetry , in short , 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	emerges not as an experiment , a record of varied days , meditations , and adventures , but as an orderly procession of standard thoughts , a codi - fied treatise , a course in pattern-making .

		Take these three books , for instance .

		Mr.
Roth	PERSON	has been brought up at a university , and its formal stamp is over all his pages .

		Miss
Millay	PERSON	wrote two of the most fresh and beautiful lyrics which contemporary American poetry can boast before she went to
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since that time she has pro- duced nothing that has more than a trace of her initial spontaneous quality ; her subsequent poems strain to make up in intellectual concepts what they have lost in naivete .


Edwin Curran	PERSON	is a railroad telegrapher , a beginner , ignorant of the laws of prosody , of scansion , even of gram - mar ; he would not recognize a chant royal or an amphibrach even if it were introduced to him .

		And yet there is more vitality and vision in these paper-bound and undiscriminating twenty-seven pages than in a score of more elegant and more erudite volumes .

		It is impossible to tell how far the universities are -LRB- from a literary point of view -RRB- responsible for so many sudden blossomings and so many early deaths .

		But everyone can name at least half a dozen examples .

		Was it not less precocity than the hot-house atmosphere of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	which made
John Hall Wheelock	PERSON	bloom too quickly a forced growth that almost sapped him for a sturdier flowering ?

		And , at the other extreme , -LRB- to change the metaphor -RRB- was it not the uni - versities that almost succeeded in extinguishing
Robert Frost	PERSON	's guarded flame with their damp disapproval ?

		Perhaps it was not so much dis - approval that they exhibited as , what was worse , a ponderous indifference to what did not conform to the curriculum of prescribed beauty .

		It was this placid unconcern which made Frost realize that these halls of learning -LRB- he attended and left two of them -RRB- were built not to prepare the future but to perpetuate the past .

		The list of ruined or rejected originators might be extended to the back cover of this magazine ; every reader might add his own quota .

		But catalogues are tiresome and unsatisfactory as evidence .

		I shall return to my trio and particularize .

		Mr.
Roth	PERSON	's volume contains thirty-three son - nets , half a dozen lyrics , a few efforts in vers libre ; all of them pleasant , precise , undistin - guished .

		There is grace in them , an echo if not an evocation of beauty , and sparks from what , in other circumstances , may have burned with an authentic flame .

		But the cold compress of formalism has smothered all originality out of the lines .

		For example : Lo , I have touched the waters of the tides Of many days , who through dim vision spun Of sheltered deeds now catch the glow of Sun As o'er grey waters ploughed by Morn he rides , Waving aflame the reckless flag of dawn , Breaking the doors of caves where darkness hides , And having freed the world , loftily glides The blue resplendent mountain peaks upon .

		It is no single teacher , no one influence that has shaped these lines with such academic accents ; it is something more institutional which places its determined or half-conscious emphasis on tra - dition an emphasis that makes the student bend and conform or , if he is made of tougher fibre , react with a violent desire to shock .

		Both of these impulses are thwarting and inhibitive , for neither of them is the result of natural and free creation .

		And so what here should have been flexible , young , and frankly experimental has been hardened in a tough and time-eaten mold .

		Turning to the second volume is like opening a window in a musty class-room .

		Here is air and motion , sunlight and the reflection of cloud - driven skies even though the shadows are some - times seen upon charted walls .

		For the greater part , these pages vibrate with an untutored sin - cerity , a direct and often dramatic power that few of our most expert craftsmen can equal .

		Turn , for instance , to the opening poem that begins like a child 's thoughtless rhyme or a scrap of nonsense verse : All I could see from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood ; I turned and looked another way , And saw three islands in a bay .

		So with my eyes I traced the line Of the horizon , thin and fine , Straight around till I was come Back to where I 'd started from ; And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood .

		An almost inconsequential opening , but as the poem proceeds , one with a haunting and cumu - lative effect .

		Over these things I could not see These were the things that bounded me , it goes on .

		And then without ever losing the simplicity of the couplets , it begins to mount .

		There is an exquisite idyllic passage beginning : The grass , a-tiptoe at my ear , Whispering to me I could hear ; I felt the rain 's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips , Laid gently on my sealed sight , And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see A drenched and dripping apple-tree , A last long line of silver rain , and suddenly , beneath the descriptive rapture ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 147 one is confronted with a greater revelation .

		It is as if a child playing about the room had , in the midst of prattling , uttered some shining and terrific truth .

		This remarkable poem is , in parts , a trifle repetitious , but what it repeats is said so poignantly that one thinks of scarcely any lesser poet than
Blake	PERSON	when one begins the ascending climax : I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day ; God , I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart !

		Or witness the first of the unnamed sonnets , that has a similar mixture of world sadness and a painful hunger for beauty , a hunger so great that no delight is great enough to give her peace : Thou art not lovelier than lilacs no Nor honeysuckle ; thou art not more fair Than small white single poppies I can bear Thy beauty ; though I bend before thee , though From left to right , not knowing where to go , I turn my troubled eyes , nor here nor there Find any refuge from thee , yet I swear So has it been with mist with moonlight so .

		Elsewhere -LRB- as in `` The Suicide '' -RRB- the tone is more sophisticated .

		The results of reading begin to show .

		In `` Interim '' we see the intrusion of foreign accents ; echoes of other dramatic mono - logues disturb us as the poem wanders off into periods of reflection and rhetoric .

		And there are pages where all that was fresh and native to this young poet seems to have turned to mere prettiness and imitation .

		`` Ashes of Life '' might have been written by
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	in a weak moment ; `` The Little Ghost '' lisps sweetly after
Margaret Widdemer	PERSON	.

		After the preceding exhib - its such lapses are doubly distressing .

		The inclu - sion of these merely pleasant pieces is all the more surprising when one notes the inexplicable omis - sion of `` Journey '' from this volume a youthful poem , but sharpened and illuminated with a suc - cession of original touches .

		Here is a part of it : Cat-birds call Through the long afternoon , and creeks at dusk Are guttural .

		Whip-poor-wills wake and cry , Drawing the twilight close about their throats ; Only my heart makes answer .

		Eager vines Go up the rocks and wait ; flushed apple-trees Pause in their dance and break the ring for me ... Round-faced roses , pink and petulant , Look back and beckon ere they disappear .


Edwin Curran	PERSON	's work has no trace of `` lit - erary '' temper or tradition , no polite echoes of an echo .

		Nothing more than the most elementary schooling can be found in his unpretentious and almost ungrammatical pages .

		Published by him - self with the assurance that `` any help in dis - tribution will be appreciated '' and the tentative promise that `` if this volume meets expenses , another , possibly better , will be issued , '' the thin booklet is free of both poetic cant and critical selectiveness .

		Lines of startling beauty precede sentences of childish bombast ; exquisite and dar - ing conceptions rise from the most tawdry and sentimental of themes ; vivid images leap to the astonished eye and are followed by passages of the most mawkish emotionalism .

		Magic takes this poet and does with him whatever it wishes .

		He has little or no control over the music ; it controls him .

		See , for examples , the quietly ecstatic poem `` To Future Generations , '' the related love songs scattered without title through the booklet , the blend of flatness and magnifi - cence in `` Christ '' with its sudden climax : Sentinel , where is morning on the world ?

		Break the
night for night	TIME	has slept too long .

		Where is the dawn ?

		Is her rose still uncurled ?

		Unburst it !

		Let us have a harp and song !

		Turn to the sonnet `` Autumn , '' where even `` by the ruins of the painted hills '' this new singer can find none of the proverbial end-of-the-year melancholy , but only the `` earth stripped to grap - ple with the winter year ... her gnarled hills planned for victories . ''

		I love the earth who goes to battle now , To struggle with the wintry whipping storm And bring the glorious

		As a product of American democracy , Abra - ham Lincoln bids fair to be of perennial interest .

		We preserve every scrap of his writing , trivial or important , and perpetuate every tale or tradition that promises to add to our memorial of the man and his achievements .

		For many , his utterances on public questions have become as touchstones of political wisdom .

		Those who study his per - sonality discover in it much that is highly cheer - ing and spiritual .

		The historian , interpreting his service to the republic , has estimated him high in the conception of greatness .

		The feeling is general that his life contains a validity and charm worthy to be bequeathed to succeeding genera - tions of our people , native and foreign born .

		In the literature that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	has left us there is very little that directly bespeaks a philosophy of government , though much is implicit .

		Not often do we read his works in the spirit of polit - ical exegesis .

		The time may come when this will be their dominant interest .

		But we have found that he could bestow upon a political concept a powerful application of ideas provoked by the disposition of his time .

		The Declaration and the Constitution stimulated in his brain many pro- found observations of great consequence in form - ing public opinion upon the issues confronting his mature mind .

		There may be some basis for assent to the assertion of an able student of his legal history that
Lincoln	PERSON	was a great constitu - tional lawyer .

		He at least possessed a clear grasp of the leading principles governing the meaning of the Constitution .

		His ethics was personal rather than platonic .

		We revere him first of all as an exemplar , as `` a gentle , good , and great man . ''

		His character was such as the Greek dramatists found for praise in Pericles : ``
Persua	LOCATION	- sion sat upon his lips , such was his charm . ''

		The qualities Plutarch ascribes to the Athenian states - man fit our mental portrait of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's person - ality and power : `` He was indeed a character deserving our admiration not only for his equita - ble and mild temper , which ... in the many affairs of his life and the great animosities he incurred , he constantly maintained ; but also for his high spirit and feeling , '' whereby `` he never gratified an envy or passion , nor ever treated an enemy as irreconcilably opposed to him . ''

		Biographically ,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	has been scanned from many angles .

		Only the emergence of new facts or a more radiant exposition of his temperament and experience , his environment , and the spirit of the age which fashioned his fortunes , would appear to justify further attempts to explain him .

		During the last decade a sufficient body of such new matter has accumulated to sanction the new edition of Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's `` Life , '' first given to the public in
1900	DATE	.

		Her work at that time embodied the important results of an extended investigation of sources of information unappro - priated by
Nicolay	PERSON	and Hay .

		She took prac - tically the last opportunity to gather up a large body of facts and impressions , corroborative and new , held in solution among numerous survivors from
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's own generation .

		Much of what she so competently reported in her two volumes would have perished in a few years or survived in uncertain and confusing tradition .

		Among the spolia opima which she contributed was `` The Lost Speech , '' delivered at
Bloomington	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	, and regarded by
Herndon	PERSON	as `` the grand effort '' of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		This most notable of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's unreported speeches Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	recovered as we have it through
H. C. Whitney	PERSON	, who made notes on the address during its delivery and at Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's request expanded his notes me - moriter .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	presented also a better impres - sion of Lincoln 's father , the much disparaged
Thomas	PERSON	.

		With all his `` backwoodsiness , '' he was fairly representative of his community .

		He was a landowner at twenty-five , possessed credit at the village store , and
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	furnished documentary evidence that he enjoyed the local distinction of appointment as road-surveyor , or overseer .

		She was able also to clear up several contradictory traditions about his ancestry , edu - cation , and other matters , as well as to give fuller outline to the prevailing meagre impression of his professional life .

		This aspect of his career , however , has been in large measure restored to us by the researches of
F. T. Hill	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
John T. Richards	PERSON	.

		The latter 's important work , among others , was reviewed in THE DIAL , Octo -
ber 19 , 1916	DATE	.

		Although Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	exhibited the greater problems which Lincoln encountered in the presidency and his manner of meeting them , it was not her purpose to lead her readers into the plexus of events making up the history of his administration or the story of the Civil War .

		Instead , she pictured the personal aspects of his life and character in terms of the large amount of fresh testimony which she brought
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 149 together from so many sources to supplement the old .

		Her primary purpose was to exhibit `` Lin - coln the man , '' yet her researches enabled her to add nearly 200 pages of Lincoln letters and speeches not included in any preceding work .

		The new edition of Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's `` Life '' amends the old by means of a review of the most important of the materials bearing on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life made accessible since
1900	DATE	.

		These materials consist in the main of the `` Diary '' of
Gideon Welles	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	under Lincoln and
Johnson	PERSON	; the `` Reminiscences '' of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	; the `` Diary '' and letters of
John Hay	PERSON	; and the `` Personal Recollections of
Abraham Lin	PERSON	- coln , '' by
Henry B. Rankin	PERSON	, whose fortune it was to be associated with the firm of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	and
Herndon	PERSON	for the ten years preceding
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's election to the presidency .

		The new section , con - tributed as a second preface , makes reference to
Welles	LOCATION	's dislike of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's bumptious manner of impressing others with his primacy in the administration .

		By many of those , in and out of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, who shared
Welles	ORGANIZATION	's irritation ,
Lin	PERSON	- coln 's forbearance with his
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	was interpreted as weakness ; even Welles thought his chief was being managed by one inferior to him .

		At the time ,
Miss Tarbell	ORGANIZATION	shows , none appeared to know that Lincoln fully understood the pro- pensities of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	, and that with `` shrewd calculation '' he was suffering himself to be mis - judged in order to put through his great task .

		Both
Seward and Chase	ORGANIZATION	, through self-assertive and muddling ambition , were vexatious ; yet the President 's high aims and fine tact led him to esteem the abilities of the secretaries in spite of the discreditable annoyance they engendered .

		In evidence of the President 's attitude ,
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	reminds us of his refusal to publish his correspondence with
Greeley	PERSON	in connection with the peace fiasco at
Niagara Falls	ORGANIZATION	, in
July , 1864	DATE	.

		Greeley had emotionally urged a peace confer - ence between representatives of the two warring sections upon what he asserted was competent assurance that the South was ready for such a move .

		The President tactfully appointed
Gree	PERSON	- ley to exploit his own futile suggestion .

		The latter 's severe reproach of the President for the failure of the conference was left unheeded , even though the publication of the letters that passed between them `` would have shown that
Greeley	PERSON	had lied . ''

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	chose to bear the blame which the editor threw upon him in order that the cause he represented might continue to com - mand the powerful influence of the `` Tribune . ''

		The self-effacing temper of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	is further illustrated by his keeping `` so carefully from his colleagues the preposterous suggestions of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	in
April , 1861	DATE	, to invite a general
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean War and to take over the government . ''

		When
Seward	ORGANIZATION	learned that a caucus of Repub - lican congressmen had voted to ask the President to remove him , he resigned .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	regarded the action of the congressmen as an interference with executive authority .

		At this time , also , the self-conceit of Chase , whom Lord Charnwood regards as `` unhappily a sneak , '' con - tributed greatly to the cabinet ferment .

		Chase disingenuously intimated his desire to resign , expecting to be suppliantly begged to remain .

		To his chagrin , the President evinced great sat - isfaction that the `` Gordian knot '' was cut at last .

		After both
Seward and Chase	ORGANIZATION	had experienced some perplexity as to their fate , they were asked by the President to remain at their posts .

		From
1860	DATE	, when
William Dean Howells	PERSON	and
John L.	PERSON	-
Hayes	PERSON	published `` Lives and Speeches of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and
Hannibal Hamlin	PERSON	, '' to the present , the lives and special treatises inspired by the career of the great President have been legion .

		Nicolay and Hay wrote a history of his time , with a benevolent eye always upon their hero .

		Herndon 's book furnished a large store of personal , if sometimes unauthenticated , intel - ligence .

		Morse followed the academically trained paths of the biographic art .


Browne	PERSON	's readable volume is less critical than intimately sympa - thetic and personal .

		Of more recent lives of Lin - coln , that by Brand
Whitlock	PERSON	is the best example we have of successful condensation .

		The melange of biographical and historical matter in the vol - ume by Mr.
Ulrich	PERSON	divaricates between personal reminiscence and an array of documents avail - able and quite useful for the comparative study of modern constitutional history .

		The recent book by
Alonzo Rothschild	ORGANIZATION	under the name of `` Honest Abe '' has a purpose single and conjoint .

		This purpose is to complement the author 's well-known `` Lincoln , Master of Men , '' pub - lished a decade ago .

		In `` Honest Abe '' we have the reduction of a large amount of matter writ - ten about Lincoln , with an eye single to the portraiture of his fundamental characteristic of integrity .

		The former book was a study of the President 's personality on the side of its power to envisage and manage the diversity of men con - nected with the civil and military branches of the government .

		It was well written , and impressed the reader with the greatness of the President 's task in his relations to the personnel of his administration in a time of crisis .

		The 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	new book seeks to find the secret of Lincoln 's success in his `` fidelity to truth . ''

		Much testi - mony of a well-known character is collated for this purpose around the subjects of `` Pinching Times , '' `` Professional Ethics , '' `` Honesty in Pol - itics , '' and so on .

		Professionally , `` Lincoln in court was truth in action . ''

		Many causes in which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	participated as a lawyer are indi - cated to illustrate his acumen in discerning the `` kernel '' of a suit as well as his disposition to concede the point when it appeared that he was in the wrong .

		The volume closes with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's success in the congressional race against Cart - wright .

		The author 's death prevented his car - rying his study over the highly important period of the Lincoln-Douglas debates .

		He has written with sincere purpose , has winnowed his material skilfully , and enriched each chapter with ample bibliographical and historical notes .

		The style is clear and elevated .

		Yet it is difficult to say that the book adds appreciably to our impression of Lincoln on that side of his character which its pages are intended to establish .

		Its thesis is so well maintained by numerous biographies , so exactly parallels the common opinion of the Great Emancipator , that one could wish that the good style and conscientious endeavor of the author had been turned toward the writing of a life of one who has been none too often , nor yet with competent artistry , represented as a classic for the youth .

		But the most original and striking contribu - tion to Lincoln literature made during the pres - ent year is Mr.
Gilbert A. Tracy	PERSON	's `` Uncollected Letters of Abraham Lincoln . ''

		The volume con - tains about 350 letters not included in a previ - ously published collection .

		Only a small number of them have been printed in any form before .

		Mr.
Tracy	PERSON	, a clerk in the War Department dur - ing the Civil War and later a
Connecticut	LOCATION	farmer , gave many years to the collection of these letters , found singly and in number in the possession of individuals and historical societies , and among the treasures of professional collectors .

		After the publication in
1906	DATE	of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	edition of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's works , presumably inclusive of all he wrote , it is surprising that the editors should have been able to give us so large a com - pilation .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	, who writes an intro - duction to the volume , suggests that the stream of new Lincoln materials has not yet run dry .

		Indeed , Mr.
Tracy	PERSON	indicates the existence of certain other letters whose owners are as yet unwilling to make them public property .

		Many of the letters in the present collection are of little public interest , consisting as they do of brief notes on law cases , brief letters of acknowledg - ment , or on local political events .

		A number are executive orders of a routine nature .

		Some of them , however , are of biographical or historical rank , though they contain nothing that would modify our present impression .

		The letters to
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's confidential friend ,
Lyman Trumbull	PERSON	, are full of observations upon political matters and contain numerous references to
Douglas	PERSON	and the Kansas-Nebraska propaganda .

		One of these letters protests his firm opposition to any `` com - promise on the question of extending slavery . ''

		The same position is averred in a letter to
Owen Lovejoy	PERSON	, but in terms combining political caution with the courage of sincere conviction .

		After his defeat by
Douglas	PERSON	for the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	he writes to General
Eleazar Paine	PERSON	admitting his defeat and prophetically affirming that the contest must con - tinue .

		`` The question is not half settled .

		New splits will soon be upon our adversaries , and we will fuse again . ''

		A letter of
November 18 , 1862	DATE	, to General
Steele	PERSON	and Governor
Phelps	PERSON	of
Arkansas	LOCATION	contains one of his earliest expressions of the plan of reconstruction which was carefully maturing in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's mind .

		The letter to
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, replying to the latter 's complaint that the President in making appointments had given too great consideration to Democrats , confirms
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's political pru - dence , as
Schurz	ORGANIZATION	later appreciated .

		Those who recall the `` Lost Speech '' will identify in the letter to
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	,
January 1860	DATE	, certain of the ideas which became fixtures in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's thoughts about slavery and states rights ; for example , the declaration : `` We will not secede and you shall not . ''

		In some respects this letter reflects the body of ideas which made up the
Cooper Institute	ORGANIZATION	address delivered a month later .

		But the literary feature of this collection is the letter to the
King of Siam	ORGANIZATION	,
February 3 , 1862	DATE	, acknowledging the receipt of certain costly presents from his admiring majesty , including `` your Majesty 's tender of good offices in for - warding to this Government a stock from which a supply of elephants might be raised on our soil .

		This Government would not hesitate to avail itself of so generous an offer if the object were one which could be made practically useful in the present condition of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Our political jurisdiction , however , does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant , and steam on land as well as on water has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce . ''

		This
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151 letter is as delicately informed with the rare essence of humor as the well-known letter to Mrs.
Bixby	PERSON	is irradiant with the pure spirit of patriot - ism .

		It strengthens any preconception one may have had that
Lincoln	LOCATION	, under another set of circumstances in life , might have become as distinguished as a man of letters as he was em - inent in statesmanship .

		Quadrangles `` Paved with Good Intentions THE UNDERGRADUATE AND His COLLEGE .

		By
Frederick P. Keppel	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	is known to all
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	under - graduates of recent years as one of the kindest and most helpful of college deans .

		He has now given his impressions of college life in a book which has a kindliness that rather impairs the critical emphasis , and leaves still unanswered the question : What is the American college for ?

		The audience he imagines and for whom he writes is evidently the comfortable father of the better-bred boy `` y ur boy and mine '' and not that more critical public which desires an ideal of what the college should be , or an incisive analysis of the forces which block that ideal 's realization .

		Only in the very last pages does Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	suggest his ideal and , admirable as it is , it comes too late to aid him in correcting his observations of college life .

		`` A group of young men living and working and thinking and dreaming together , free to let their thoughts and dreams determine the future for them ; these young men , hourly learning much from one another , are brought into touch with the wis - dom of the past , the circumstances of the pres - ent , the visions of the future , by a group of older students , striving to provide them with ideas rather than beliefs , and guiding them in observing for themselves nature 's laws and human relationships '' how could this idea of a college be bettered ?

		But Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	pre - sents no very clear picture of how young men might live and work and think together .

		Nor does he explain why professors so emphatically do not look upon themselves as `` older students , '' and why the curriculum is not designed more intelligently and deliberately to effect that obser - vation of `` nature 's laws and human rela - tionships . ''

		He dismisses lightly the prevailing utterly mechanical and demoralizing system of measuring intellectual progress by `` points '' and `` credits , '' a system which cultivates the `` taking of courses '' and not the study of a subject .

		The gap between his ideal and his mild and indirect criticism and suggestion for improvement is too glaring to make the discussion very satisfactory .

		There is no more obvious fact about the
Ameri	PERSON	- can college than that its administrative and cur - ricular organization has not , in these last few years of standardizing , been in any way directed by the ideal of the `` intellectual community of youth . ''

		While floundering deans and quarrel - some faculties have debated , the registrar and the athletic coach have gone busily and invinc - ibly ahead setting the motives and the values for the social and intellectual life of the great majority of students in college .

		In the presence of an idealist like
Dean Keppel	PERSON	, who is also an executive officer and presumably has a rare oppor - tunity for leadership , the question insistently rises : How could the present flagrant divorce between ideal and actuality have arisen ?

		But if this book does not answer that ques - tion , it does present a very human and chatty picture of the boyish undergraduate as he passes before the dean .

		The author disarms a good deal of our criticism by showing us how very bad the colleges used to be , and how very good are the present good ones in comparison with the bad .

		In the light of that earlier institu - tion which was little more than a boys ' academy , where the students had a generous taint of the hoodlum and the professors were pedantic theo - logians , the present college appears an earnest and honorable place indeed .

		It is a clever touch of Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	's to trace the current organized athletics and fraternity life out of the ancient mischief and disorder .

		If the colleges today are being strangled in their own standardization , think of the degree scandals of twenty years ago , and of the salutary disappearance of charlatan institutions and the stiffening of the weak .

		If one bemoans the corruption of athletics , let him think of the rowdyism and low standards of the last generation .

		Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	presents an engag - ing picture of the fraternities sobering up from their historic debauches , and even engaging in competitive scholarship .

		And the old parental discipline of the college he sees to be broadening into a real concern about the student 's respon - sibility to society , as well as about his personal morality and habits .

		Reforms , however , will have to be presented with more fervor and with a greater sense of their integral place in the `` youthful commu - nity '' before they are likely to stir the college 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	mind .

		Actually there seems to be little halt in the process of complicating the machinery of manufacturing the degree , in getting rid of plain-speaking and idealistic teachers , and in turning more and more of the teaching over to mediocre young instructors .

		The quality of the undergraduate will depend on these influences , to which Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	gives all too little heed .

		No college has sinned more grievously than his own in these respects .

		Mildly to urge toler - ance and tact upon trustees and professors alike is scarcely enough , even though one admit that `` errors of tact are more likely to be expensive to the professor whose views on social and polit - ical relations are disturbing to those about him . ''

		These are sterner times , and youthful idealists who saw Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	himself pass from the direc - tion of a pacifist society to a post in the War Department , and Professor Beard resign because of the sinister menaces to intellectual freedom within the American college , will be a little skeptical of the power of the present system to produce in the average student a love for the clear intellectual conscience .

		It is not enough for Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	to have a good word for the student `` conscientious objector , '' for the student socialist agitator , and for the ostracized Jewish student .

		We should be assured that the college is tending toward a community where tolerance is not merely chivalrous but organic .

		Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	has the task , in this book , of play - ing the roles of both prophet and loyal tender of the machine .

		Few people could fuse them happily .

		He does not fuse them happily .

		He does deplore the lack of thoroughness in college learning , the sin of smattering , and the lack of adjustment of the college to the world .

		He desires a closer understanding between faculty and students , between college courses and stu - dent activities , between college life and mature activity .

		But he has too much sense of the immalleability of his raw material , too much sense of their being much to be said on both sides , to be a convincing prophet .

		And he is too uneasy about the idealists to be a mere loyal machine-driver .

		His mind is liberal and yet it serves reaction .

		It is good to have `` liberals '' as machine-tenders ; however , they should not complain if their interpretation disappoints .

		One becomes , in reading a book like this , a little too conscious of those qualities for which , as Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	says , the college graduate `` has a good reputation '' resourcefulness , social agreeable - ness , cheerfulness , adaptability .

		The liberal alumnus or the father who wants to know what he may expect for `` his boy '' from the college will find the book amusing and informing .

		He may even like the author 's generous use of aca - demic slang , such as `` the quituate and the bust - itute , '' and the tendency to `` pad and distract '' rather than to add and subtract .

		Nevertheless the more restless will long for a fiercer tone .

		After all , when one is strategically placed and sees evils and goods in a system , why be so tepid about it ?

		Labor , ` Right or TRADE UNIONISM IN THE UNITED STATES .

		By
Robert Franklin Hoxie	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		This volume is the last will and testament of a singularly clear and cogent thinker who looked out upon the world with sympathy and under - standing and sought to unravel , by patient col - lection of data and careful analysis , the tangled skein of that most protean of all democratic movements , trade unionism .

		The scholar who wrought these pages lay down to his rest before his work was done and we owe this book to labors of love on the part of those who knew and cared for him .

		It is not unjust to say , there - fore , that this is a group of essays not a finished work reminding one , in a way , of
Arnold Toynbee	PERSON	's `` Industrial Revolution . ''

		And yet it is a volume which will be valuable in the thought that it will stir in those widening circles now con - scious of the significance of industrial democ - racy .

		Professor
Hoxie	PERSON	's book is mainly analytical , but there are two chapters , all too brief , given to the history of the labor movement in the
United States	LOCATION	from the earliest days to the rise of revolutionary unionism .

		One chapter sets `` the problem '' of the student , warning him against hasty generalizations and class bias , and showing him how complicated and fugitive are the data of the labor movement .

		Some fifty pages are devoted to an analysis of the several types of unionism and their significance , with due reference to structure and function .

		The relation of labor to the law , collective bargain - ing , and the economic program of labor occupy nearly one hundred pages .

		Scientific manage - ment in relation to labor is given the emphasis which its importance warrants ; there is a sketchy chapter on employers ' associations , and some shrewd observations on the psychology of lead - ership which recall the exceedingly clever work of
Michels	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 153 It would be impossible within the limits of a review to enumerate the essential conclusions and capital suggestions of this volume , but some are so outstanding that they can not escape .

		The shortcomings and failures of the
American Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration of Labor are temperately set forth -LRB- page 133 -RRB- ; we are warned that we shall see more , rather than less , of industrial unionism -LRB- page 174 -RRB- ; much that concerns labor disputes and administration must be taken out of the field of contentious litigation -LRB- page 251 -RRB- ; the estab - lishment of labor standards and the education of the public offer more of promise for the future than does legislative wrangling -LRB- page 252 -RRB- ; we can not afford to give up the vast pos - sibilities of increased productiveness which scien - tific management offers -LRB- page 324 -RRB- , and yet scientific management falls afoul of craft union - ism and all its rigid rules -LRB- page 347 -RRB- ; the public is poorly equipped by knowledge and understand - ing for taking part in labor controversies , and yet it is continually compelled to render drastic judgments -LRB- Chapter xiv -RRB- .

		The upshot of it all is that rough and ready generalizations about the class conflict avail little and that the grand old slogan , `` Labor , right or wrong , '' is not much of a guide amid the bewildering technique of mod - ern industry .

		Patience , understanding , knowl - edge of the facts , flexibility of thought `` these are the seals of that most firm assurance which bars the pit over Destruction 's strength . ''

		CHARLES A. BEARD .

		A Novel with a Plot SECRET BREAD .

		By
F. Tennyson Jesse	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` There was silence in the room where
James Ruan	PERSON	lay in the great bed , awaiting his marriage and his death . ''

		When a novel makes such an arresting entry as this of `` Secret Bread , '' the temptation is to quote it , with the comment that the beginnings of their novels and their own dying words must be among authors ' heavy responsibil - ities .

		But the long and absorbing tale behind these strange words proves them to be no mere pomp of paradox .

		The first chapter gives a good measure of the whole book .

		In it
Ruan of Cloom	ORGANIZATION	, an estate in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, died on the
night	TIME	the story opens , after making a wife of
Annie	PERSON	, a servant and his mistress .

		Ruan had the marriage performed in order to bequeath his estate legally to a posthumous child , and for the peculiar pleasure of disinheriting
Annie	PERSON	and the other children of their misbegotten brood .

		Thus the apple of discord was planted before the hero himself came on the scene , as
Ishmael Ruan	PERSON	did only a few hours after his father 's death .

		The struggle of the youngest Ruan to assert his au - thority in the family and in turn to pass his inheritance on to his eldest son is , very roughly , the theme of the story .

		There are no legal com - plications , and but little play of personal risk .

		The author is too deft a hand for that .

		The struggle between
Ishmael	PERSON	and his eldest brother , Archelaus , is mainly psychological , but not for years has there been in fiction a plot so shocking .

		The shock at the end is the refreshing one of sheer cold water no common quality in psy - chological narrative .

		From the first the tale strikes an eerie tone reminiscent of `` Wuthering Heights , '' perhaps , or ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. ''

		To some extent the fancied resemblance is due to similarity of setting and the same dour aspect of the characters , as much as to the fact that the excellent plot emerges from the grim eccentricities of one or two of the persons .

		As the history of Ishmael progresses , however , from his boyhood among the
Cornish	PERSON	country lads through his school days at St.
Renny	PERSON	and his young manhood , the author 's very sure searching of the emotions and fancies of youth reminds one , on quite a different hand , of the realistic analyses of Lawrence 's `` Sons and Lov - ers . ''

		There is here more in common between the two writers than the same Cornish country .

		But such comparisons serve merely an impression - istic purpose .

		The distinct achievement of the author of `` Secret Bread '' is spinning a tale of over five hundred pages on the neatly tied thread of plot one customarily finds in a short story , playing incessantly on rather intimate sensations , and at the same time weaving the story round a clearly enunciated philosophy `` that we all have something , some secret bread of our own soul , by which we live , that nourishes and sustains us . ''

		Ishmael 's secret bread was his love of the land , the earth of his paternal Cloom .

		The three necessary ingredients for a substantial novel are here : vivid characters , a good plot , and an un - derlying purpose , philosophy , or unifying motive of the author 's -LRB- whatever term you will -RRB- which gives a novel its third dimension and keeps it from being a mere bas-relief frieze of more or less entertaining figures .

		To the influence of
Da Boase	PERSON	, a local priest , was largely due the wholesome character and disposition of the hero , born under such unlikely 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	auspices , the barely legitimate son of a boor and his wench .

		It was
Da Boase	PERSON	who , when
Ishmael	PERSON	was twelve years old , insisted that he take his place at the head of the table , on the occasion of `` crying the neck , '' a pagan festival celebrated at harvest time partly in the open fields at twilight and partly within doors shortly after .

		It was
Da Boase	PERSON	also who suggested the theory of secret bread .

		Undertaking
Ishmael	PERSON	's education until he should go away to boarding school ,
Da Boase	PERSON	tried not so much to make of him a Christian gentleman , in perhaps the English sense of the word , as to make him a respectable and self - respecting farmer , since that seemed the boy 's natural trend .

		With other characters
Da Boase	PERSON	behaved similarly , heartily relishing
Killigrew	PERSON	, a delightful lad who grew into an engagingly unmoral young man to whose soul the priest laid no siege .

		Set over against this priest is the dispossessed Archelaus , who returned to Cloom manor from wanderings in
Australia	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, to harass at irregular and significant intervals the legal proprietor .

		Ishmael 's peace of mind , thanks to his secret bread , remained proof against the revenge motif of Archelaus , which runs through the book like the disappearing thread in home - spun , observable but not at all obvious .

		The ultimate twist was the work of the elder broth - er 's most advanced proficiency in the diabolical .

		There is unquestioned reality in the figure of the final
Ishmael	PERSON	an old man bereft of friends and wife , all of whom he outlived , and finally losing his own son , yet remaining content to the end , consoled by some power within himself .

		That this is the amazing way of all flesh , we have only to seek the fellowship of grandparents to ascer - tain .

		Considerably fewer elders than certain novelists would have us believe , trade very extensively on kingdom come .

		It is avowedly only an exercise in literary marksmanship to call Miss
Jesse	PERSON	a twentieth century
Bronte	PERSON	, or a twentieth century anybody else .

		But in so aiming , whether the result be a hit or not , we are certain at least of the right direction of our aim .

		The greatest emphasis must be placed on the difference a hundred years has made in the growth and outlook of an Eng - lishwoman of letters .

		Nowadays , for example , it is no particular tribute to remark that the reader of `` Secret Bread '' would not readily as - sume the author to be a woman ; yet that was an incense especially grateful to the author of `` Wuthering Heights . ''

		Certainly this novel does not suffer from the neurotic sort of severity , the hard overdrawing characteristic of Mrs.
Hum	PERSON	- phry Ward and some other contemporary fem - inine writers .

		Miss
Jesse	PERSON	's sharp corners are gracefully beveled with a fine sense of humor .

		A chance description of
Killigrew	ORGANIZATION	's mother sug - gests the author 's cheery eye for foibles : `` I 'm sure that will be very nice , my dears , '' was her invariable comment on any programme suggested by the young men ; and there was a legend in the family that
Killigrew	PERSON	had once said to her : `` How would it be , Mother , if I were to murder the Guv ` nor and then take you round the world with me on the money ?

		We could settle in the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	, and I 'd marry a darky and you could look after the pickaninny grandchildren ? ''

		To which Mrs.
Killi	PERSON	- grew had responded : `` Yes , my dear , that will be very nice ; and on your way , if you 're passing the fish - monger 's , will you tell him to alter the salmon for this evening to cod , as your father wo n't be in to dinner ? ''

		The most interesting doubt concerning `` Se - cret Bread '' is the conjecture whether this novel , undeniably modern in tone and admirable in workmanship , is the product of an essentially Victorian mind striving toward the present , or of an iconoclastic modern mind harking back toward the days of
Unity	ORGANIZATION	,
Mass	LOCATION	, and Coherence that seemly trinity .

		Quite apart , of course , from Miss
Jesse	PERSON	's nieceship to the laureate , one must decide that she is one of the latest of the Victorians .

		Something in the firm grip which the immaculate
Da Boase	PERSON	has on the history of events contributes to that decision .

		In this un - grateful vein of criticism two or three other objections may be made .

		`` Secret Bread , '' like many another biographical novel , suffers from the author 's proportioning .

		If Miss
Jesse	PERSON	was not especially interested in the antepenultimate period of
Ishmael	PERSON	's career , and was eager to hasten on to the brilliant conclusion ahead of her , she would have done better to omit some resume chapters that report only the dotage and deaths of lesser characters .

		Ishmael himself made a stately old man .

		Moreover , with such a wealth of engaging men in the story , one 's sense of balance is a little offended at the almost un - exceptional unattractiveness of the women .

		Fi - nally , it is not sufficiently clear that the lack of resentment in
Ishmael	LOCATION	's nature was simply ab - sence of rancor and not absence of spirit .

		To this extent alone will we play the devil 's advo - cate .

		Whether or not `` Secret Bread '' is a great novel , there is a fair measure of greatness in it .

		Not the least of its distinctions is its being an intelligent novel of these times with an actual plot again .


MYRON R. WILLIAMS	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 155 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS TRIVIA .

		By
Logan Pearsall Smith	PERSON	.

		Double - day , Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It is not easy to be candid and charming in just this fragmentary way of `` Trivia . ''

		These thumbnail essays read much better in quantity than separately in the pages of a magazine .

		Most of them are delightful in the quaint turn of their wit or in the revealing glimpse of personal whim .

		Perhaps there is more playful irony than real wit .

		Some of the little sketches are rather too `` precious '' ; occasionally there is a veritable descent to flatness .

		The book shows a mild-man - nered English gentleman reflecting on the figure he cuts not only in the country village where he lives , but in town society and in the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The stars and the wheatfields , the Vicar of
Lynch	LOCATION	, the lady he is frozen to find himself bor - ing , insects and the solar system , destiny and ennui all start his reflections .

		Perhaps many readers will give the little book up as all too appropriately named , but others will enjoy the beauty of the rhythm in these prose sentences and the sudden denouement of a thought that is not quite so innocent as it looks .

		And there is to be found also a wisdom which almost spoils one 's pleasure , for it irritates one that the author should have whittled down his ideas to so microscopic a form and left them with , on the whole , so spinsterly a flavor .

		ROOKIE RHYMES .

		By The Men of the 1st and 2nd Provisional Training Regi - ments ,
Plattsburg	LOCATION	.


Harper	PERSON	; 75 cts .

		The spirit of camping , in its holiday rather than its military sense , shines cheerfully out of the songs and jingles in which the rookies cele - brate their labors .

		The little book of rookie rhymes is as smooth and jolly as its title , always facile , occasionally clever .

		These are such verses as a group of boys might make over the petty trials of a rough life , the lack of familiar creature comforts , their absurd misadventures , the rather engaging novelty of discipline .

		Seldom do they strike a solemn note .

		Their rhymes of hate might be heard on a football field , and except for a very few poems there is no reference to the work of war for which they are preparing , or to the agony they go to face .

		They have the schoolboy code of sportsmanship , and the reiter - ant word is here : Better to pack your troubles with your kit , To keep your shirt on , and to play the game .

		They have too , a lively sense of humor .

		With tender regret they lament the lack of the happy bowl : All , all are gone , the old familiar glasses , Where once they glistened on the fragrant bar .

		There is a sweet simplicity in
F. E. Harpel	PERSON	's song about the unequipped cavalry : The Cavalry , the Cavalry , they have n't any horse , They 're taking riding lessons by a correspondence course , You 'd think they were equestrians to hear the way they talk , But when it comes to riding , why !

		We always see them walk .

		The illustrations parallel the verses in pleas - ant , if commonplace , good humor .

		The one young rookie who writes verses with a distinct quality of their own is
Anch Kline	PERSON	, Co. 1 ,
1st P. T. R. His	PERSON	`` They Believe Us Back Home '' and ``
Sunday	DATE	in Barracks '' have that gentle irony which the other ready jingles do not achieve .

		They are written in free verse , and the author 's sense of cadence makes the form adequate .

		On the whole it is an agreeable , and by that very token , a tragic little book .

		RECLAIMING THE ARID WEST .

		By
George Wharton James	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		When history is written for the next genera - tion one of the bigger achievements for the good of mankind to be recorded will be the work of the
United States Reclamation Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
James	PERSON	, who has made the study of the West a life work and has popularized this vast region in numerous volumes , has described in this work the development of some thirty irrigation proj - ects scattered throughout the dry territory from
Canada	LOCATION	to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The data , collected largely from official documents , is dependable and pos - sesses a greater degree of human interest than might have been given it by a less skilful writer .

		The part of the book of most interest to the general reader is perhaps that setting forth the government administration of the projects , the methods of encouragement to settlers , and the economic problems of the irrigated communities .

		The illustrations are numerous and good .

		ADVENTURES AND LETTERS OF
RICHARD HARDING DAVIS	PERSON	.

		Edited by his brother ,
Charles Belmont Davis	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		These letters were almost all addressed to the members of
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's immediate family , and they give a veracious picture of the more intimate and personal life of the writer .

		They are tactfully edited , with a minimum of explanation and comment , and , except in the latter chapters , the selections have been wisely made .

		Here the long series addressed to the author 's wife , consisting of little but protesta - tions of love for her and their little daughter , become wearisome .

		Such expressions are not for the public , and these , coming from a man of
Davis	PERSON	's age and worldly experience , seem to have 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	something almost strange and hectic about them .

		The best letters of all are those to the author 's mother .

		It is impossible not to feel the genuine - ness and wholesomeness of these , and they reveal characteristics of the man never suggested by contemporary newspaper portrayals , which al - ways hinted at something of superciliousness and pose .

		Readers who , themselves young in the early nineties , remember how the first short stories of
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	seemed to them a promise of great , and fine literary achievement , will try to trace in this new book the causes that led to a journalistic rather than a truly literary career .

		Early letters from
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	for example , those printed on pages 33 and 55 express a mother 's fears of this result , and caution against haste , and against writing for money alone .

		Part of this advice he followed well .

		A friend who knew him best in his later years says -LRB- page 348 -RRB- : `` Every phrase in his fiction was , of all the myriad phrases he could think of , the fittest in his relentless judgment to survive .

		Phrases , paragraphs , pages , whole stories even , were written over and over again . ''

		It was probably the unbounded energy of the man , his fondness for life in all its aspects , and the possession of a rare gift for meeting , manag - ing , and observing men that directed the course of his activities , and that still leaves his admirers in doubt whether he could have been as great a novelist as special correspondent .

		At all events he was a picturesque character ; the well-chosen illustrations , equally with the text , of the book before us , are a reminder of how much of the history of the last generation he saw in the mak - ing , and how many men of world note he knew .

		MY STORY .

		Being the Memoirs of Bene - dict
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		By
F. J. Stimson	PERSON	.

		Scrib - ner ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The tendency to levy upon history for char - acters in fiction has led Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	to make a bold experiment .

		He gives us a narrative as pro- ceeding from the pen of the arch-traitor of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The more than six hun - dred pages of this historical novel , if we may term it that , purport to give a detailed account of
Arnold	LOCATION	and his career .

		They show a careful study of some sides of the Revolution and a still more exhaustive study of the life of the hero .

		For it is as a hero that
Arnold	LOCATION	is pictured .

		Not a satisfactory hero , however ; for while Mr.
Stim	PERSON	- son 's acquaintance with sources will not permit him to suppress facts , his conception of Arnold is fully as imaginative as it is historical .

		The result is , of course , inconsistency .

		Another diffi - culty under which Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	labors is that his method allows him none of the advantages of fiction .

		His book is not frankly a story , with the freedom and privileges of a story ; it masquerades as autobiography and discards none of the mate - rial which the mere fictionist would ignore ; it is therefore tedious and heavy at times .

		Finally , it is rather cynical .

		That Arnold was mistreated any student of the period will admit ; that other men prominent then and still well thought of do not deserve their reputations , will be conceded ; but there were splendid men in those times , a fact of which Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's readers may grow forgetful .

		In short , `` My Story '' is not good fiction on the one hand , or sound history on the other .

		It is a bold experiment but , taken by and large , it is not a success .

		THE CRUISE OF THE CORWIN .

		Journal of the Arctic Expedition of
1881	DATE	in search of
DeLong	ORGANIZATION	and the
Jeannette	LOCATION	.

		By
John Muir	PERSON	.

		Edited by
William Frederic Bade	PERSON	.


Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.75	MONEY	.

		The
Corwin	PERSON	cruised in search of the ill-fated Jeannette Expedition in
Behring Sea	LOCATION	and the Arctic Ocean , along the coasts of
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Alaska	LOCATION	, visiting
Herald Island	ORGANIZATION	, and made the first landing of white explorers on
Wrangell Land	ORGANIZATION	.


John Muir	PERSON	accompanied this searching party and his private journals , letters published at the time in the
San Francisco	LOCATION	`` Bulletin , '' and his contribu - tions to the government reports of the
Corwin	ORGANIZATION	's explorations have been skilfully woven by the editor into a connected narrative of the
summer	DATE	's cruise amidst the ice-floes , fogs , and storms of these little known seas .


John Muir	PERSON	was an inter - preter of nature and of men , an observer of rare acumen and marvelously sympathetic ap - proach .

		This rare quality , combined with his own zest in exploration , undaunted valor , and unreserved worship of the beautiful on land and sea , lift his writings above the commonplace nar - rative to the level of permanent distinction .

		The appendix contains valuable notes on glaciation and glaciers in these high latitudes , with illus - trations from
Muir	PERSON	's sketches and his notes on the Arctic flora .

		THE NATIONAL BUDGET SYSTEM AND
AMERICAN FINANCE	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles Wallace Collins	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The naive belief that providence takes care of children , drunken men , and the
United States	LOCATION	is singularly well illustrated by the strange fact that , among the great nations of the world , the
United States	LOCATION	is the only one without the ade - quate knowledge and necessary control of its public finances afforded by a budget .

		Any well - managed enterprise would have an annual budget with its consideration of income and expenditure
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 157 and the measures necessary to make these two items balance .

		The same should be true of a state , because an adequate revenue must be had in order to meet necessary expenditure .

		In most countries the executive is made responsible for the preparation , as well as for the execution , of the budget .

		Here in the
United States	LOCATION	nobody in particular is responsible for the annual finances .

		Responsibility is scattered over the entire range of governmental organization and divided among a number of detached sections .

		The departments are responsible to the treasury or to the presi - dent for their estimates , the committees of the two houses are not responsible to any central organization , and the two houses themselves are responsible to the people only by localities .

		There has been a shifting of the blame for our finances from the executive to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, from the house to the senate , from the committees to the floor of the two houses , from
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the execu - tive , and even from
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the people .

		Thus is the idea of responsibility reduced to an ab - surdity .

		Chaos , log-rolling , and either a surplus or a deficit in the national revenues are the result .

		Presidents Taft and
Wilson	PERSON	have both urged the adoption of some form of budget system .

		Fiscal reform will be one of the great needs after the present great war , and Mr.
Collins	PERSON	shows in a clear and interesting way why and how the
United States	LOCATION	should look after its finances in a better way than it has in the past .

		CHATHAM 'S COLONIAL POLICY .

		By
Kate Hotblack	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The twentieth-century student will misjudge the elder
Pitt	PERSON	unless he remembers that the eighteenth century was one marked by European contests for commerce and power ; for there ran through
Pitt	PERSON	's entire public career the motive of `` war for and on commerce '' for the benefit of
England	LOCATION	.

		In short chapters , richly annotated , sometimes based upon unpublished manuscripts and records ,
Miss Hotblack	LOCATION	has reviewed
Pitt	PERSON	's influence in all parts of the globe .

		She shows her hero as a man with lofty ideals , a statesman with infinite patience , careful of minute details , and with a strong sense of justice .

		Contrary to the opinion of many political leaders of the day ,
Pitt	PERSON	firmly maintained that colonies should be a source of commerce for the mother country , not of direct revenue .

		Some of his last efforts were made to prevent imposition of taxes upon Amer - ica ; but
Miss Hotblack	LOCATION	shows that the protest against `` taxation without representation '' did not mean then what modern writers understand by the term .


Pitt	PERSON	, in one of his last speeches , sup - ported the plea of American representatives that the colonies be permitted to govern themselves in the British Empire .

		COOPERATIVE MARKETING .

		By
W. W. Cumberland	PERSON	.


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The subject of cooperative marketing of farm products has been growing in public apprecia - tion for some years , and present food shortages and distribution problems have greatly accentu - ated this interest .

		This volume is a detailed study of the best-developed field of cooperative marketing in this country , the
California Fruit Growers ' Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, which in the last twenty years has grown from humble beginnings to a position from which it superintends the packing and marketing of three-fourths of the citrus products of the
Golden State	ORGANIZATION	.

		With its general manager , earning a salary of
$ 10,000	MONEY	a year , and its corps of experienced salesmen and traffic ex - perts , this is one of the best and most scientific - ally organized businesses in the world , bringing profits to the producer and economy to the con - sumer through its elimination of the superfluous middleman .

		The development of the enterprise , in the face of all sorts of unfriendly interests , constitutes a chapter from real modern romance .

		Its success may well serve as a stimulus , as its methods may afford a model , for cooperation in other fields of food-production and distribution .

		THE BOOK OF THE WEST INDIES .

		By
A. Hyatt Verrill	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Although it treats of practically every island of the West Indian archipelago , with the addition of
Bermuda	LOCATION	, this volume scarcely justifies its title ; it is a book , rather than the book .

		Pur - posing to be a combination guide , history , and general description , it fails to be adequate in any single attempt .

		To accomplish so much would be difficult even in a single , moderate sized vol - ume ; therefore Mr.
Verrill	PERSON	almost inevitably gives the impression of sketchiness .

		Further - more his style is hardly meticulous for example , he speaks of the `` healthy '' climate when he means , of course , a `` healthful '' ; and his too insis - tent habit of inverting subject and predicate in descriptive paragraphs deteriorates into a mere mannerism .

		But interest is not lacking .

		Many historical tidbits are served the plot wherein
George Washington	PERSON	secured a hundred barrels of gunpowder from the Bermudians ; the mar - riage of Lord
Nelson	PERSON	and the birth of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	in
Nevis	LOCATION	, of the
Leeward Islands	LOCATION	; in
Martinique	LOCATION	the birth of the child who was to become the Empress Josephine ; and the first pub - lic appearance of
Adelina Patti	LOCATION	in
Santiago	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		The intending tourist is told what he may see and a few hints are given as to the costs that are to be reckoned with .

		The book is copiously illustrated from photographs .

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 14	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT ANCIENT WISDOM SOMETIMES COMES to our aid in the attempt to understand the bewilder - ing chaos of events we call the world war .

		`` Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad '' seems a guiding aphorism for comprehen - sion of the antics of the Pangermans .

		We do n't know whether Hindenburg boasted that he would be in
Paris	LOCATION	by
April	DATE	, as reported in the press .

		But we hope so .

		Nor is there confirma - tion of the dispatch which told us that the Ger - man delegates at Brest-Litovsk threatened to capture
Petrograd	LOCATION	unless the Russians should at once conclude a separate peace satisfactory to
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		But again we hope they did .

		Our compassion goes out to the courageous German strikers who were imprisoned .

		Yet even in this case , can we honestly pretend that we are sorry ?

		History , if it teaches us anything , teaches us that an autocratic and unpopular clique , losing con - trol , displays certain stigmata of degeneration .

		It brags about the overwhelming love which unites it with its people , at the same time ruth - lessly suppressing any signs of discontent .

		It tries to disguise an inner weakness by an out - ward bluster that all is going well .

		Von
Hert	PERSON	- ling exhibited the typical sort of sickening hypoc - risy when he said , `` In the officers and the men lives unbroken the joy of battle . ''

		The old , old circle is closing in upon the German tyrants exactly as it has closed in upon the tyrants of history .

		Their boasts become more and more absurd , their performances more meagre , their threats more dire , their strangulation of their own people more shameless and severe .

		`` Wise men , '' the proverb tells us , `` learn by other men 's mistakes ; fools , by their own . ''

		From this point of view the men in control of
Germany	LOCATION	today , are lower in the scale of human intelligence than even fools .

		They can not learn by their own mistakes .

		.

		FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ITS FOUNDATION seventeen years ago the Nobel Prize for litera - ture goes to
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		The award for excel - lence has been divided between the two Danish authors
Henrik Pontoppidan	PERSON	and
Karl Gjellerup	PERSON	.

		Is it possible that politics were not left wholly out of consideration in making the choice for
1917	DATE	?

		Certain circumstances seem to justify a suspicion .

		Visible efforts for a rapprochement between
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	have recently been made by the royal families and diplomatic leaders of the two countries .

		No doubt it is a ticklish business to determine on a candidate in a time of world war .

		Obviously if
Sweden	LOCATION	, as a neutral state , were to select an author from the warring nations , criticism from the opposite side might easily become bitter .

		And to divide between both sides presents almost insuperable difficulties .

		Yet admitting gladly that the high standard of modern Danish literature justifies this year 's choice of nationality aside from any political aptness , why were these particular authors selected ?

		One feels abashed at quarrel - ing with the
Royal Academy of Sweden	ORGANIZATION	, that
august	DATE	body of eighteen men and one woman -LRB-
Selma Lagerlof	LOCATION	being the sole representative for womankind -RRB- .

		But there is one Danish name which , unsought , stands in the foreground , the name of
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		Nor should we have been other than pleased had
Martin Anderson Nexo	ORGANIZATION	been chosen .

		His `` Pelle the Conqueror , '' picturing the life and career of a modern labor leader , ranks as one of the great books of today , and critics have agreed that it possesses `` the lit - erary qualities that burst the bonds of nations . ''

		Perhaps the stipulation in
Alfred Nobel	ORGANIZATION	's will which makes it imperative that the winners should represent the `` idealistic tendency '' in lit - erature has been taken too literally .

		Nobel reacted strongly from the pessimistic naturalism which dominated Scandinavian literature in the later part of the nineteenth century .

		`` Ideal - istic , '' however , is a flexible adjective : it would be a pity to create a stable dogma .

		The currents and forces of literature change with the currents and forces of life , and any specific form our writers of today may choose demands tolerant interpretation .

		IDEALISM , IN THE OLDER SENSE , is certainly one quality which
Pontoppidan	PERSON	and Gjellerup , otherwise of diametrically different tempera - ments , have in common .

		Of the two ,
Pontop	PERSON	- pidan is the more individual .

		Born in a family of whom his father and several other members were clergymen , he is deeply interested in the many sectarian movements characteristic of the peasant class in his youth .

		Although he began as an aggressive realist , a religious feeling is present in his later books .

		In his many novels picturing Danish life its religion , politics , art , and home - sphere an all absorbing search for Truth is manifest .

		He does not look at his characters from a respectful distance ; their souls are analyzed .

		He exhibits sober mastery of a clear , sometimes biting or quietly humorous style .

		Among Pontoppidan 's foremost works stands the trilogy `` The Promised Land , '' and the great cycle appearing in the last seven years : ``
Torben	PERSON	and Jytte , '' `` Storeholt , '' `` Publicans and Sinners , '' `` Enslew 's Death , '' and `` Fav - singsholm . ''


Henrik Pontoppidan	PERSON	might be called
Denmark	LOCATION	's
Bjornstjerne Bjornson	PERSON	, his work often recalling the great Norwegian 's , though lacking its dominant grandeur of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 159 conception ...
Karl Gjellerup	PERSON	, who with
Pontoppidan	ORGANIZATION	divides the prize , has behind him an exceptionally versatile literary production , com - prising lyric poetry , novels , scientific works , dramas , even a tragedy in old verse .

		It is a wide step from the challenging novel of his youth , `` An Idealist , '' to his recent book , `` The Pilgrim Kam - anita , '' a beautiful work full of the mysticism of the
East	LOCATION	and the teaching of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here the fiery idealism of his earlier writing has been sobered by a life of philosophic research and sci - entific study .

		ANNUALLY OUR GREAT LIBRARY in Wash - ington reminds us afresh of its riches and an - nounces the year 's accretions .

		For
1917	DATE	, in spite of war and rumors of war , the Librarian of Con - gress has no occasion to apologize .

		The biog - raphers of
Whistler	LOCATION	, Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Pen	PERSON	- nell , have presented the library with their notable assemblage of
Whistleriana	LOCATION	, which adds to the most complete existing collection of prints , etch - ings , photographs , and other reproductions all the books by and about the painter , a compre - hensive representation of works in which his art is discussed , some 60 folio volumes of press and magazine clippings , catalogues of exhibits , and several hundred letters .

		Doubtless the next most important acquisitions are the numerous items of Americana , including
John Wesley	PERSON	's journal of his trip to
Georgia	LOCATION	, Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	's description of
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- `` auri abundantissimi '' -RCB- ,
Diedrich Knickerbocker	PERSON	's `` History of
New York	LOCATION	'' with unpublished corrections by the author , and in manuscript the personal papers of
Charles Thomson	PERSON	-LRB- Secretary of the
Conti	PERSON	- nental
Congress	ORGANIZATION	throughout its life -RRB- , as well as papers of
Robert Morris	PERSON	,
James Madison	PERSON	,
Andrew Jackson Donelson	PERSON	-LRB- nephew and secre - tary to
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	-RRB- , and of many other worthies who have enjoyed peculiar opportuni - ties to observe our history in the making .

		The
Music Division	ORGANIZATION	can now boast nearly 800,000 items ; manuscript scores by many important com - posers were added last year .

		Some 5000 addi - tions were made to the collection of prints .

		A striking part of the report discusses accessions from
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and their neighborhood even to
Tibet	LOCATION	, of which upwards of 6600 were secured .

		Altogether the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	is richer now by 120,769 items -LRB- exclusive of manuscripts , which are not counted -RRB- than it was a year ago .

		Of these some 86,000 items are printed books and pamphlets eight times the number of books published here last year .

		Minds not yet made numb by the iteration of the vast totals of war finance may feel a pardonable thrill in the fact that our national library now contains -LRB- still excepting manuscripts -RRB- nearly four million titles .

		ARE THE COURTS USURPING THE FUNCTIONS of criticism ?

		Some months ago Judge
Tuthill	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	ruled that
Bacon	PERSON	wrote Shakespeare .

		It now comes to light that a member of the
East	LOCATION	- ern bench had anticipated that precedent in lit - erary criticism .

		Apropos of a recent divorce , a newspaper quotes from an earlier decision pro- voked by the same couple 's matrimonial diffi - culties , a decision handed down by
Justice Borst of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		He said : `` After becoming acquainted , the defendant paid the plaintiff attention , and from his letters and conduct was evidently much enamored of her , writing her numerous letters , and even lapsing into poetry , which , from its composition , was evidently orig - inal with him '' -LRB- italics ours -RRB- .

		At this point somebody whether the learned judge or the reporter , indeed , does not clearly appear has kindly introduced `` a specimen of this poetry . ''

		Although entitled , originally enough , `` To Elea - nor from L. R. , '' the fifteen lines introduced are those of a favorite song which the merely liter - ary world has for nearly three centuries igno - rantly accepted as
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's the lines `` To a Rose , '' beginning : Go , happy rose , and , interwove With other flowers , bind my love ... and ending : Lest a handsome anger fly , Like a lightning , from her eye And burn thee up as well as I. To be sure , there are textual variations , `` from her eye '' becoming `` from the sky '' for instance ; but they are only such variations as seem inev - itable to newspaper quotation .

		For the decree that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays were written by
Bacon	PERSON	we were not altogether unprepared ; this decree that
Herrick	PERSON	's songs were written by an Ameri - can lover is , however , revolutionary .

		Is the critical fraternity too weakly divided against itself to present a solid front to the encroaching judiciary ?

		WRITING FROM
LONDON	LOCATION	Mr.
Edward Shanks	PERSON	discussed , in the preceding issue of THE DIAL ,
Robert Graves	PERSON	and his `` odd mongrel of a book called ` Fairies and
Fusiliers	ORGANIZATION	' ... the kind of book that calls for a personal recom - mendation . ''

		Of this poet the
New York	LOCATION	`` Even - ing Post '' quotes an anecdote by
John Masefield	PERSON	, who has lately returned to
America	LOCATION	: `` Graves was picked up for dead .

		He heard them say he was dead and he called out , ` I 'm not dead .

		I 'm damned if I 'll die . '

		And he did n't .

		And he wrote a poem about it . ''

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	cites Graves as one of the young men who are writing `` the best poetry written in
England	LOCATION	now ... These poems come out of experience hard , big , deep experience . ''

NEW YORK	LOCATION	COMMUNICATION A LITERARY MIDDLE ENGLISH READER -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I should like to say a word for a book that may easily escape your attention .

		The `` Literary Middle English Reader , '' by Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , bears a title suggestive of peda - gogy and pedestrianism ; yet a careful examination convinces me that it is , in its limits , an important service to literature .

		The English language from the Conquest to the Reformation is , indeed , a philo - logical paradise ; but to the seeker of literary satis - factions it presents a first appearance like the Plain of Shinar at the moment the building of the Tower of Babel came to an end .

		Those , however , who love our language and literature because , apart from their merits , they are our very own , can not but be strongly drawn to Professor
Cook	PERSON	's volume , the first representative anthology of Middle English that has aimed to make literary interest the sole criterion of selection .

		Middle English has but two classics some knowl - edge of which is necessary for all English-speaking persons who aspire to be well read .

		These classics are
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and
Malory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Cook , how - ever , who brings to his task a wide and close acquaintance with his subject , and an enthusiasm that has perhaps never been surpassed , has demon - strated that besides
Chaucer	PERSON	and
Malory	PERSON	there is in
Middle English	LOCATION	a large amount that is at least readable , much that is decidedly interesting , and a few things that even evoke enthusiasm .

		The book is excellent alike for what it includes and for what it omits .

		The `` Ormulum '' is where it belongs outside the volume .

		So is the `` Ayenbite of Inwit , '' that curiously prosaic composition which so distinguished an archaeologist as Mr.
Ridgeway	PERSON	once guessingly called `` a poem . ''

		A few only of the happy inclusions in Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's volume may be mentioned .

		The `` Secunda Pastorum '' is rapidly winning recognition as a work of genius .

		To my thinking `` Gawain and the Green Knight '' is of unequal merit .

		The ethics of the poem are mushy .

		Professor Cook has selected from those passages , fraught with adventure and a feeling for nature , which show real genius .

		He gives a liberal selec - tion from the better lyric poetry of the period .

		`` Sir Orfeo '' is a really pretty perversion of the story of Orpheus .

		The passages selected from `` Piers the Plowman '' really exhibit that poem at its best .

		`` The Fox and the Wolf '' is distinguished by a sly humor and a happy characterization that remind one not too distinctly of Chaucer .

		The format of the book is convenient , the print - ing is excellent .

		Professor Cook has supplied each selection with an introduction .

		A series of glosses at the foot of each page does much to make the book intelligible to the general reader .

		Whatever defects the specialist may spy in the execution , I would urge that a note of them be sent to the editor .

		If I were engaged in teaching Middle English , I should regard some use of the book as absolutely indispensable for those who wish to begin the study under favorable auspices .

$ 100	MONEY	each .

		Now we buy Olivers at
$ 49	MONEY	.

		This saving of half means a great deal to us because we use so many machines .

		If any typewriter is worth
$ 100	MONEY	, it is this
Oliver Nine	PERSON	, which we buy direct from the maker .

		After using Olivers we will never go back to
$ 100 machines	MONEY	.

		It is pure waste . ''

		Was
$ 100	MONEY	OLIVER TVpcWrifers Over 600,000 Sold The ' .


Oliver TypewriterjCompany	PERSON	`` now sells direct .

		It has discarded old ` and wasteful ways .

		Formerly we had 15,000 salesmen and agents .

		We maintained expensive offices in 50 cities .

		These , and other costly practices , amounted to
$ 51	MONEY	, which the purchaser had to pay .

		Our new way saves this
$ 51	MONEY	and so we sell brand new
Oliver Nines	PERSON	for
$ 49	MONEY	.

		This is the exact
$ 100	MONEY	machine not a change has been made .

		Such is our 2,000,000 guarantee .

		The entire facilities of the Oliver Typewriter Company are devoted ex - clusively to the manufacture and dis - tribution of Oliver Typewriters .

		It is ridiculous to pay any attention to the rumor that we offer second hand or rebuilt Olivers of an earlier model .

		This may be done by other concerns .

		So we _ warn people to answer only advertisements signed by The Oliver Typewriter Company itself .

		FREE TRIAL Merely mail us the coupon and we will send you an Oliver for five days ' free trial .

		Try it at your office or at home .

		If you decide to keep it .

		pay us at the rate of
$ 3	MONEY	per month .

		If you return it , we will gladly refund the transportation charges .

		Old ma - chines are accepted in exchange at fair valuation .

		We hope to be able to maintain the
$ 49	MONEY	price .

		But , if the cost of materials and labor continues to go up , we may be forced to increase this price .

		We do not wish to .

		We do not expect to .

		But we advise you to act now to be certain of getting your Oliver Nine at
$ 49	MONEY	.

		The
Oliver Nine	PERSON	has the universal standard keyboard .

		So any operator may turn to it without the slightest hesitation .

		And it has a dozen other features which attract .

		It is greatly simplified in construction , having
2000	DATE	fewer parts .

		It is noted for its free - dom from trouble , great durability and easy operation .

		WHY BE WASTEFUL ?

		Whether you use 1 typewriter or 100 , this new Oliver plan saves you half .

		No machine does better work .

		No typewriter is speedier .

		None are more satisfactory in the long run than the Oliver Nine .

		All this you can know for yourself very easily .

		You are your own sales - man and decide for yourself .

		Read the coupon .

		Note how simple our plan is .

		Then mail it today for either a free trial Oliver , or our amaz - ing book entitled `` The High Cost of Typewriters The Reason and the Rem - edy . ''

		With the latter we send an illustrated catalog describing the Oliver in detail .

		Which for you ?

		Check one or the other item on the coupon now .

February 14 , 1918	DATE	WHAT IS MAN 'S SUPREME INHERITANCE ?

		A Practical and
Comprehensive Answer	ORGANIZATION	to This Question Will Be Found in an Original Work Man 's Supreme Inheritance By
F. MATTHIAS ALEXANDER	PERSON	With an Introductory Word by Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	of
Columbia University What	ORGANIZATION	are particularly original and valuable in this work are the author 's analysis of the funda - mental conditions of human evolution and his demonstration that the time has now arrived for adapting man 's life to these conditions , not by a fatalistic surrender to blind atavism and retrograde instincts , but by the exercise of conscious intelligence , by a conscious guidance and control of the human organism and human conduct which will meet all the demands of an advancing civilization .

		Man 's
Supreme Inheritance	ORGANIZATION	constitutes a preventive and remedial measure to combat the ills of modern civilization A practical system of physical and mental guidance and control is offered , based not on a specific , but on a general reeducatibn , coordination , and readjustment of the organism which commands ade - quate activity of the vital processes with the minimum of effort , and complete adaptability to an ever-changing environment .

		Prof.
John Dewey	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	in his prefatory word says : `` No one , it seems to me , has grasped the meaning , dangers , and possibilities of this change more lucidly and completely than Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	.

		His account of the crises which have ensued upon this evolution IS A CONTRIBUTION TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EVERY PHASE OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE .

		The ingeniously inclined will have little difficulty in paralleling Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's criticism of Physical Culture Methods within any field of our economic and polit - ical life .

		In his criticism of return or relapse to the simpler conditions from which civilized man has departed Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's philosophy appears in its essential features .

		He does not stop with a pious recommendation of such conscious control ; HE POSSESSES AND OFFERS A DEFINITE METHOD FOR ITS REALIZATION , and even a layman can testify , as I am glad to do , to the efficiency of its working in concrete cases .

		IN THE LARGER SENSE OF EDUCATION , THIS WHOLE BOOK IS CONCERNED WITH EDUCATION .

		TRUE SPONTANEITY is henceforth not a birthright , but the last term , THE CONSUMMATE CONQUEST OF AN ART THE ART OF CONSCIOUS CONTROL to the mastery of which MR. ALEXANDER 'S BOOK SO CON - VINCINGLY INVITES US . ''

In a Russian peasant 's hut One of the boys waking at
midnight	TIME
Shall	ORGANIZATION	sit among his brothers and sisters And hear the forest whispering ... Here and there on the Earth Youth shall listen , Hearing the song I have lifted Out of the song of youth ... 2 .

		O the pride Of the young world ... These youngsters are aliens and exiles among their parents : Where they go Goes rebellion , It could not be otherwise ... They have left narrow rooms And darkened doorways , and gone To new spiritual hills ... Theirs is the salt sea that belts the planet , And the water they taste On the

		O the joy Of the young world ... They are lonely flames in far places , In wide-sown separated cities , In swamps of life But they are flame : They are the first winds of the morning that call the larks up , They are the rising of the sun and the turn of tides , They are the opening notes of a song Each is a note seeking the other notes .

		How far they reach !

		how slowly , surely !

		And what a dawn there shall be When they surprise each other 's faces And find they are a host , The notes blending together , The new song risen .

		They are hewn stones in scattered quarries And the architect shall bring them to his city For the new cathedral ... Each singing stone shall find his place .

		They are streets , gardens , workshops , They are temples and theatres , They are homes , And out of them shall the new city be built Shining on the hills With unspeakable grandeur ... 5 .

		Only they shall be saved Who have sting in them , The bitterness unbreakable By temptation ... Resisters of the false kindness and the crowd comfort , The ease of wealth , the power of place , The pride of medals ...

Yes , they are greatest Who are willing to be alone ... 6 .

		O what is the word Burning in the heart of youth ?

		Is it the word , God ?

		Is it the word , Fatherland ?

		Is it the word , Liberty ?

		It is none of these words : the word Has not been shaped , has not Pealed its bugle-challenge on Earth ... Not yet ... But it burns in hearts , It shapes almost to the lips , Each morning listens for it .

		7 .

		These are the spirits who have been alien from birth As if they had been born on the wrong planet .

		They have been brought up among miraculous machines , In a universe widened by astronomy But sudden gone lifeless ; That was the age of the
Earth	LOCATION	's loneliness ... The planet that had swung as a censer from the vault of heaven , Steaming with frankincense of prayer , And breathed on by angels and the inspirations of God , Now was a lonely atom , A wanderer in the universal void ... Now no more were the men and women about them Souls struggling up out of flesh into a burst of wings And flight into glory , But physico-chemical organisms made over in the image of the new God ,
Yea	LOCATION	, the Machine ... Well-being , comfort , tools , sanitation , power Their brothers strove for these ... Whose heart was set on the long visions of eternity , Whose eyes turned inward to the mysterious war Of Demon and God in the soul The war whose victory is wisdom and the con - quest of love And the radiance of life Whose heart needed song in the day And the marvelous adventures of intimacies , He was the fool and the failure Among the great owners .

		Not to a land alone is our allegiance , But beyond it to one another ... Scattered in our multitude of communities It is as if one hand had scattered the seed of the future In many hidden places of Earth ... There are no boundaries between us , Neither manners nor strange tongues nor per - sonal facts Can set up walls ... Have we not drunk the same wisdom ?

		Do we not follow the same poets ?

		Share the same Science ?

		Are we not children of the same Earth ?

		The day of democracy ?

		Yes ... And what is democracy ?

		It is allowance for each man 's wish , And so the mass-wish rules ... Not needs , not duties , not rights , But wishes , desires , wills ... But when shall men wish greatly ?

		How many will volunteer To create great lives and loves ?

		Look to the past : how many Are the volunteers on the scroll ?

		Surely democracy Will mean the end of greatness

		Let the great Artist teach you his secret , How he reaches his hands in his own dark breast , That rich jungle , And shapes from his sorrow , delight , From frustration , music , From lust , vision ... He becomes , not a precipice of authority , But a hill that invites climbing ... He tempts men to high places By the dazzling beauty of his own heights Which are but a transformation of his own depths ... He is a destroying storm turned into music , A hatred become love , an evil become good ... He is the beginning of democracy , For in place of imposing his passion upon others He turns his passion into a gift , And the gift works more miracles than a king 's command ... And in place of submitting his soul and mind to the will of others He turns his herd-lust into a work of self Personal and new , And so renders service as no slave could render .

		Are you artists , O spirits of the young world ?

		Are you those who seek to transform destroying things Into symbols of glory and works of f ruitf ulness ?

		Would you end war , clean out poverty , stop dis - ease ?

		Neither law nor science shall suffice , But only Art ... When men learn to sing together , When they passionately desire their cities To be songs in stone , musical to the eyes , The song of their gathered vision ; When they love drama that reveals their future heights , When festival and laughter are shared in rever - ence , When a life without great sexual love is shunned and abhorred , When children are brought to bloom as by per - fect gardeners , When work has in it the joy of the unexpected And is wrought as a gift , Then shall the abomination of desolation , Money-striving , and slaughter , and disease Flee like night before the irresistible sun ... Great is the task of the artist who works in stone or in flesh , In song or in values ... But his epoch opens before us ... 11 .

		It is not enough to love , O Voluntaries ... It is only enough when you turn hatred into love ... Man is a natural hater , hunter , slayer , destroyer ; He is a storm , a volcano ... This came to me : A dark mood out of the depths Like a storm rising out of the sea ... But I hate darkness , I can not spend it on myself except I slay myself .

		So I send it out upon others ... I say , `` They are the guilty ; they are oppressing me ; They have wronged me ... '' How then does this suffice ?

		I writhe in the coils of my hatred , I seek for a victim , yet have none -LRB- Am I not civilized ?

		How can I slay or torture another ? -RRB-

		But neither can I remain so encoiled , Confused , wasted , unable to sleep or toil ... What shall I do ?

		I look to the wisdom of the past : `` Forgive my trespasses Even as I forgive those who trespass against me ... '' Does this serve ?

		I try it : I try it as one who prays ... I put passion into a struggle to turn to mine enemies And in my heart embrace them and forgive them ... And behold , I am released ... For I have taken the storm of hatred And by passion made love of it ... Now I have all this energy to give unto others Or unto my tasks , And so go free ...

OPPENHEIM	PERSON	.

		The Structure of Lasting Peace x .

		THE FEDERALIZATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES : A PROGRAMME FOR A LEAGUE OF NATIONS To three causes is to be attributed the failure of the Articles of Confederation between the thirteen original and sov - ereign states in the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most important was the fact that the Con - federation 's central authority , its Con - gress , had no power ; and it had no power because it had no support in public opinion , the citizens of the states being inordinately jealous of the exclusive sovereignty of their respective states ; while the failure of public opinion to `` get behind '' the Con - gress was due to the fact that it had been created by an administrative fiat of the
State Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	, without any reference whatsoever to such opinion , and hence without contact with the immediate life and interests of the people from whose in - terest and consent power derives .

		The three causes were at bottom one : Con - gress could not enforce its rulings .

		How to secure for it this force was the one prob - lem before the Constitutional Convention , and the advance which the instrument framed by that body made over the Ar - ticles of Confederation is to be measured solely by the degree of power it put into the hands of the Federal agencies of gov - ernment .

		At the present writing the relationships of the democratic nations echo those of the American states between
1776	DATE	and
1787	DATE	.

		What unity they have is enforced by the presence of a common enemy .

		The hypertrophied passion for exclusive sov - ereignty which is the vicious side of patri - otism , and the drag of a diplomatic technique determined by the interests of such sovereignty have made genuinely fed - erated action on a single front unnecessar - ily difficult .

		Arrangements between the allied democracies are separate arrange - ments and their character is that of treaty , not of public law .

		When Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	, compelled by events to denounce the inexcusable impasse which this had led the Allies into , made his famous de - mand for unification , this jealousy in - stinctive , animal for the integrity of the herd , led to a vicious and unjustified as - sault upon him .

		Withal , the degree of co - operation between the democratic allies is tremendously greater than was that be - tween the American states .

		But here again , the moving cause is not the will of statesmen ; it is the character of warfare following from the nature of industrial society .

		The organization of industrial life has changed warfare from an affair of armies to an affair of nations : the logic of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 181 social circumstance and of industrial ma - chinery has compelled a federalization far beyond the present good will of rulers .

		Were the statesmen of the democratic alliance intelligent and courageous and free enough to follow out immediately what events will force them to concede ultimately as the inevitable implications of this logic , a constitutional convention would now be in public session for the federation of
Russia	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	, the South American repub - lics ,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It would be in session , war or no war , and it would gen - eralize the present practices of coopera - tion , integrate them , and enact them into law , with the doors open for the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	to come in or not , as they chose .

		Such far-seeing relevancy in interna - tional conduct is not however to be hoped for .

		Everything international will be postponed until the peace conference ; and if we may trust the tone of the ruling and possessing classes , it is a bold aspiration to hope that even then the compulsion of industrial interdependence and the im - pulsion of the very patent will of the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	to a league of nations and a democratic and lasting peace will find their realization and satis - faction .

		It is a bold aspiration .

		For the under - currents of industry and the streams of feeling run counter the conscious life , the established habits , and the avowed pur - poses of men .

		The popular will needs to be defined by discussion and articulated in a definite programme .

		And discussions are `` disloyal '' or `` unpatriotic , '' and pro- grammes are `` visionary . ''

		The Real - politiker of the public press and the interests it guards have had very little good to say of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's address of
January 8	DATE	; yet they have not said the worst thing that there is to be said about it .

		That worst thing is this .

		It puts the cart before the horse , and the cart is only the skeleton of a cart .

		The article re - quiring a league of nations should have come first , not last ; and it should have been a definite programme for the or - ganization of such a league , not a state - ment that a league is desirable .

		The will of the peoples to enduring peace needs such a programme to integrate it a pro- gramme that shall designate the personnel of the peace conference and the manner of their election , the organization of the conference into a congress , and the chief articles in an international agreement , such that they shall come home to the vital in - terests of the masses of men and women everywhere .

		Why the constitution of a league of nations ought to be the first proposition in the agenda of the peace conference should be obvious enough .

		Once certain prin - ciples of public law are established , the adjudication of all specific racial , terri - torial , economic , and military issues will follow easily and smoothly enough from them .

		The converse is not true .

		Let these issues be taken up severally and sep - arately , without regard to an international rule , and the peace conference will become a bargain counter between dickering diplo - mats representing military forces .

		The specific adjudications will preclude a gen - eral principle which must necessarily con - tradict them .

		At best we shall have restored a precarious balance of power ; at worst we shall resume fighting .

		If the peace conference be permitted to begin at the wrong end of the series of problems , there is little hope for a good end to the conference .

		Whether or not it begins at the right end will depend on two factors .

		These are the pressure of enlightened public opin - ion upon it and the personnel of the con - ference itself .

		The former must be awakened by free discussion ; the latter will be determined by the manner of their choice and the considerations leading to it .

		In this regard the experience of the `` sov - ereign and independent '' American states is illuminating .

		At the Constitutional Convention the only statesman who had also been a member of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	that had conducted the war against
England	LOCATION	, was
James Madison	PERSON	.

		The rest were the `` demigods '' who had won the confidence of the citizens of their states through very specific and signal serv - ice during the war or through intellectual leadership during and after it .

		So now .

		Diplomatists are by training , habit , and usage unfit for the particular service in hand .

		Servants of international conflict for exclusive national advantage , their 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	skill is only in the arts of innuendo and dickering which such service demands .

		They would be as unsuited to a task requir - ing frankness and mutual accommodation as a pork-magnate to settle a strike in his own packing plant .

		The men needed are the men of international mind , who have been studying these diplomatists in action , who are aware of the defects of the pres - ent state system , and who have thought out alterations and improvements .

		Such men are
Sidney Webb	PERSON	,
Brailsford	LOCATION	,
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- derson ,
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	,
Norman Angell	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	;
Thomas	PERSON	and his fellow Socialists in
France	LOCATION	; the members of the present Russian government and innumer - able others in
Russia	LOCATION	;
John Dewey	PERSON	,
Louis Brandeis	LOCATION	, Secretary
Baker	PERSON	,
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, and
Tharsten Veblen	PERSON	in Amer - ica .

		And so in every country .

		Represen - tatives should be chosen from the effective leadership of that great body of sentiment and opinion which has for the last quar - ter of a century kept the creation of a league of nations and the establishment of lasting peace constantly before the minds of men , which has so taught these ideals that the present war is unique in that the democratic urge to see it through to vic - tory is the community of sentiment and opinion against all war .

		In short , a league of nations can be most effectively estab - lished only by representatives who are for it by habit of mind as well as desire , who have given it prolonged study , and have made themselves expert in the programmes of its inauguration .

		But there is yet a further necessity in the delimitation of personnel .

		`` Self-de - termination '' for nationalities , sincerely applied , would give place and voice in the conference to representatives of all na - tionalities whose fate and status the con - ference is to decide .

		An autonomous
Poland	LOCATION	, for example , is undoubtedly de - sirable , but the unspeakable Polish over - lords maintain a vicious hegemony over Lithuanians ,
Letts	PERSON	, and Jews , no less than over Polish peasants .

		Lithuanians ,
Letts	PERSON	, and Jews as well as Poles should have voice and place at the peace conference .

		Serbo-Croats , Bohemians , Poles , Jews ,
Rumans	PERSON	should represent
Austria	LOCATION	no less than
Magyars	ORGANIZATION	and Germans .

		Arabs , Ar - menians , Kurds , to mention just a few , should have voice and place equally with the Osmanli Turks for the Ottoman em - pire .

		How the representatives of the minorities are to be elected , what their pro- portionate weight should be , are questions to be solved by free discussion and public opinion .

		That the cases for their peoples must be put by the chosen representatives of these peoples , that they must necessarily have a voice in deciding their own fate in the community of nations , is beyond argu - ment .

		So much so , indeed , that following the principle involved , Mr.
Norman An	PERSON	- gell suggests the representation not alone of nationalities but also of political parties within nations , according to their numerical strength .

		Thus
Germany	LOCATION	would be repre - sented by her Socialists as well as by the party in power ,
England	LOCATION	by her Laborites as well as by her Liberals and Conserva - tives , and so on .

		In this way fundamental differences in political principle would get representation , no less than differences in national character and interest .

		What the peace conference defining itself as such a congress would need to establish is the law of a minimum genuine international control .

		Now all political control consists in the exercise of two func - tions .

		One is limitation ; the other , libera - tion .

		Limitation and liberation are distinct but not different , since every just and rele - vant limitation is a liberation witness the traffic policeman .

		International limitation would apply to national armaments , to quarrels between states over the `` stakes of diplomacy , '' to quarrels within states over national hegemonies .

		The limitation of armament is of course basic .

		For no mat - ter what may be the provocation to a fight , the lack of weapons compels the substitu - tion of persuasion for blows and funda - mentally alters the locus of the `` national honor , '' a figment for the defense of which most blows are struck .

		Hence the Inter - national
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should determine for the nations of the world , as the Continen - tal
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was by the Articles of Con - federation empowered to determine for the original thirteen American States , the extent of the armament of each state .

		The simplest way to do this would be to fix annually the amount of money each state might spend on armament .

		Control of expenditure would require the complete
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 183 socialization of the manufacture of muni - tions , its subordination to the inspection and control of an international commis - sion on armaments , and absolute publicity of records and accounts .

		All uses of ar - mament should require license from the
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	, particularly such uses as go by the euphemism `` punitive expedition . ''

		Failure to carry out these provisions or to submit to the rule of the
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	should be regarded tantamount to a declaration of war .

		It should be so regarded with respect to the other causes of quarrel between and within states .

		Interstate disputes of whatever nature should be submitted to the Interna - tional
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which would be also the highest and final court .

		There has been a good deal of silly differentiation between `` justiciable '' and `` non-justiciable '' dis - putes , but there 's nothing that 's one or the other but thinking makes it so .

		All group disputes are justiciable if public opinion says they are .

		When
the International Congress	ORGANIZATION	has passed on them , they are settled .

		Failure to accept the decision of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should automatically consti - tute a challenge of international power and be dealt with accordingly .

		The devices for dealing with such fail - ure are not exclusively military .

		The mili - tary machine , indeed , should be the last resort .

		Initially , there is the tremendous force of public opinion , which the
Church	ORGANIZATION	wielded in the middle ages as the
Excom	LOCATION	- munication and the Interdict .

		These should be revived .

		The economic , social , cultural , or total ostracism of states or portions of states involves tremendously less hardship and suffering than actual military assault and in the long run is bound in an industrial society like ours to attain the same end , far more than in earlier , less interdependent ones .

		What degree of coercive power these provisions would have at the outset will de - pend of course on the will of the signa - tories to any international constitution not to turn it into a scrap of paper .

		The gov - ernmental organs of the public will can be regulated only by the public opinion of each state , and the public opinion of each state can be kept internationally-minded only by means of the completest publicity regarding all international relationships .

		Publicity and education are the cornerstone of any international system that shall be democratic .

		Hence the rule of publicity is a paramount limitative rule .

		The foregoing provisions would , I think , supply the coercive force the lack of which rendered the
American Confedera	ORGANIZATION	- tion so instructive a failure .

		That they will absolutely prevent war can not be claimed .

		Even the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	failed to do that , and the interstate unity it provided for became a permanent constituent of American polit - ical common-sense only with the Civil War .

		No doubt history on the terrestrial scale will repeat history on the continental .

		No doubt there will be , as in
America	LOCATION	, blocs and combinations within the combina - tion , nullification and attempts at dissolu - tion ; but there will be in operation also , as in
America	LOCATION	, a definitely formulated , agreed to principle of unity , insuring mankind against a great many wars almost certain to come without it .

		Yet the chief power of this insurance would reside in x the function of liberation that the instruments of internationality would perform .

		Those turn on the sat - isfaction of the basic wants of men , and the consequent release of their spontane - ous energies in the creative activities their natures crave .

		Such satisfaction and re - lease demand , as we have already seen , a free trade in material commodities at least equivalent to the free trade in things of the spirit in science , for example , or art , or music .

		It would be fundamental for the
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	to create international commissions concerning themselves with the coordination of efforts to increase and properly distribute the food supply , to maintain and improve in - ternational health , to maintain and keep internationally open the world 's highways , to secure the equality of all men before the law of any land , to expand and inten - sify the world 's sense of community by internationally coordinated education .

		Most of these functions have already been forced on the allied democracies by the exigencies of war ; they would need only to be made relevant to conditions of peace .

		Such are the food and fuel ad - ministrations , acting purely in view of in - ternational needs .

		Others existed long 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	before the war .

		Such are the postal union , and Mr.
David Lubin	PERSON	's indispensably serv - iceable agricultural institute , now living a starved life in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Still others have gone on as voluntary and private enter - prises .

		Such are the various learned so - cieties , particularly the medical and the chemical societies .

		These would need en - dowment , endorsement , establishment un - der international rule .

		In none of these enterprises , please note , is a novel ma - terial necessary .

		All the institutions exist .

		Attention needs only to be shifted to their cooperative integration , expansion , and perfection by the conscious joint effort of the nations of the world to turn them into a genuine machinery of liberating interna - tional government .

		The most important instrument of in - ternationality is , however , education .

		Take care of education ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	makes Soc - rates say in the `` Republic , '' and education will take care of everything else .

		Inter - nationally , education must rest on two principles : one , that it must be autono - mous ; the other , that it must be unpreju - diced .

		Regarding the first : We have already seen how , in the case of
Germany	LOCATION	, the state 's control of education laid the foundation for the present war .

		The school served the state 's vested interest in the school .

		From the dark ages to the present day the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has held a vested interest in the school , an interest from which events have more or less freed it , but which still makes itself felt .

		With the rise of private educational institutions or the secularization of theological ones such as
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	or
Yale	ORGANIZATION	or Princeton with the elaboration of the public school systems of the different states of this coun - try or any other , the powers of govern - ment , visible or invisible , have determined largely what should and what should not be taught , what is true and what is false , always from the point of view of the in - terests of these powers .

		Heresy has been consistently persecuted , with means vary - ing from the auto-da-fe of the Church to the more delicate tools of contemporary university trustees or school committees .

		Heresy consists of that which is not in accord with the interests or prejudices of the ruling power .

		Now the art of education involves three forces : First , its theme the growing child , whose creative spontaneities are to be encouraged , whose capacities for serv - ice and happiness are to be actualized , in - tensified , and perfected .

		Second , the investigator and inventor who discovers or makes the material and machinery which are the conditions of the child 's life and growth , which liberate or repress these .

		Third , the teacher who transmits to the child the knowledge of the nature and use of these things , drawing out its powers and enhancing its vitality by means of them .

		Obviously , to the last two , to the discoverers and creators of knowledge , and to its transmitters and distributors , to these and to no one else beside , belongs the control of education .

		It is as absurd that any but teachers and investigators should govern the art of education as that any but medical practitioners and investi - gators should govern the art of medicine .

		International law would best abolish this external control by making the communi - ties of educators everywhere autonomous bodies , vigorously cooperative in an inter - national union .

		Within this union the freest possible movement of teachers and pupils should be provided for , exchanges of both between all nationalities to the end of attaining the acme of free trade in habits and theories of life , in letters , and in methods .

		Regarding the second principle of in - ternationalized education that it must be unprejudiced : This requires the system - atic internationalization of certain subject - matters .

		In the end , of course , all subject - matters get internationalized .

		The proc - ess is , however , too slow and too dangerous with respect to some of these , history be - ing the most flagrant .

		Compare any col - lection of history textbooks with any similar collection in physics , for example , and you find the latter possessed of a unanimity never to be attained in the for - mer .

		Why ?

		Because every hypothesis in physics is immediately tested in a thousand laboratories and the final conclusion is the result of the collective enterprise of all sorts and conditions of physicists .

		In the writing of history such cooperative verifi - cation never occurs .

		Most histories , par - ticularly those put into the hands of children , utter vested interests , not scientifi -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 185 cally tested results ; they utter sectarian or national vanity , class privilege , class re - sentment , and so on .

		Compare any Eng - lish history of the American Revolution with any American history !

		Fancy the wide divergence of assertion between friends and enemies in the matter of Ger - man atrocities !

		Naturally , the interpre - tation of historic `` fact '' must and should vary with the interpreter , but the designa - tion of the same `` fact '' should clearly be identical for all interpreters .

		To keep education unprejudiced requires therefore the objective designation of historic fact `` historic '' to mean the recorded enterprise of all departments of human life .

		The `` facts '' of history should be attested by an international commission .

		So the sec - ond function of education is served .

		With this we have established the full pattern of the house of peace an inter - national democratic congress , limiting ar - maments , judging disputes , coordinating and harmonizing the great national insti - tutions by means of which men get food and clothing and shelter and health and happiness , making for a free exchange of all excellence , punishing default with in - terdict or excommunication or war , rest - ing its authority upon public opinion and strengthening it by internationalized edu - cation .

		XL EPILOGUE : HUMAN NATURE AND THE LIMITS OF INTERNATIONALISM Solemn warnings echo through the land .

		Prophets stalk uncensored , prophesying war and woe unless we arm forever .

		Sol - emn warnings flash across the editorial pages of the kept press ; and the weighty voices of Colonel Roosevelt and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	- man
Kahn	PERSON	, of the
National Security League	ORGANIZATION	and the munition manufacturers , of professors of international law out of
Laputa	LOCATION	, and of all the comfortable gentle - men who have passed middle age and are drawing upon a rich experience with life and light and leading , are crying to us , `` Arm , arm !

		or we are lost . ''

		What these sapiencies think of human nature is not fit to print .

		And the worst of it is , they are not without provocation .

		Who , looking over the history of human conduct , dare say they are ?

		According to the true tes - timony of history war is an institution of civilization and an invention of man .

		It is a blasphemy against Nature and a libel upon animals to say with the militarist philosophy made in
Germany	LOCATION	that these live by war .

		For war is organized mur - der for non-essential purposes .

		The struggle for survival is not organized , and it regards essentials only .

		Animals do not kill for the sake of killing ; they kill for food , nor do they kill their own kind .

		In the botanical world plants do not survive by destroying their rivals ; they do not re - gard their rivals .

		Plants survive by their own inward vigor , striking roots into the earth and shoots toward the sun .

		They simply crowd out their rivals by doing bet - ter the same things that the rivals are doing .

		War is common only to a small portion of mankind , for the masses of men are driven or persuaded into war and never have undertaken nor ever would of their own initiative undertake it .

		War is a class perversion of the universal enterprise of self-expression and self-realization .

		As an institution it rests upon the plasticity and inertia of human nature .

		Upon the plas - ticity because war must be carried on either by driven slaves or mercenaries or de - ceived free men , and the war-lust is gen - erated in free men by infection from their rulers .

		What moves their rulers when these are dynastic is the vanity or the greed of the personage commanding their alle - giance ; what moves their rulers when these are national states are the same mo - tives , going however by the names `` na - tional honor '' and `` the balance of trade . ''

		Both demand more than is needful or due for the actual free existence of either princes or states .

		These are able to infect men with the war-lust , even when they realize that war can do them no good whatsoever , because of the inertia of hu - man nature .

		Men live far more by habit and tradition than by initiative and thought .

		The habits of deference and obedience to the masters , the reverence for the idols the masters are and for the shib - boleths they delude men with , reenforce initial military infection and plastic re - 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	sponsiveness to the stirred-up herd feel - ing .

		Fear also plays a part , fear of rulers , fear of neighbors : German privates are fighting today because they fear their offi - cers more than the enemy ; Russian pri - vates are not fighting , because they have ceased to fear their officers .

		War thus rests on and reenforces the maxims `` Every - body 's doing it '' and `` What was good enough for father is good enough for me . ''

		That which originates war and spreads it is not , however , that which nourishes it in the mind of the common man .

		Though it derives from plasticity and in - ertia in human nature , it is justified by the soul 's initiative .

		The society we live in is basically a system of taboos taboos set by class for mass , by property for human - ity , by civilization for the animal as well as spiritual spontaneities within us .

		Hence war is to society what drink is to the in - dividual .

		It dulls the sense of repression , breaks up inhibitions , and liberates and satisfies energies and appetites normally starved .

		From the point of view of the possessing classes prohibition is suicidal .

		No doubt it enhances `` efficiency '' ; but the stored-up discontents of workingmen , cus - tomarily dissipated in the irrelevancies of drink , accumulate under prohibition , and sooner or later must be discharged rele - vantly .

		By prohibition capitalism is dig - ging its own grave .

		With regard to war , its instinct is less blinded by greed .

		Hence the jeremiads of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his ilk .

		In wartimes there is an exaltation in the land : even civilians are lifted out of themselves as by strong drink ; their ha - treds , prejudices , malices , and lusts need only to be decently cloaked by patriotism to flourish at the acme of propriety , while in the battlefields frightfulness , regard - less of race or state .

		Now it is to be observed that the pres - sure toward peace and internationalism has been a direct function of the spread of democracy , and the spread of democracy has consisted in the removal of political , economic , superstitious , and social taboos upon the panting energies , the creative spontaneities of the masses of men .

		They have most to gain from lasting peace and internationalism ; they have it most in their power to make them real .

		Will they do it ?

		Can they do it ?

		The portents are not unfavorable .

		Men are awake in
Russia	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	, and they need but to take thought in
France	LOCATION	, and with open minds and active wills `` get be - hind the President '' in
America	LOCATION	.

		What is called human nature by the elderly gen - tlemen who govern the world today and of whose interests and dogmas the
Roose	PERSON	- velts are the high priests , is not human na - ture but second nature .

		Civilization is a growth , not an eternal form .

		Customs , conventions , and habits are things that once were not and that ultimately will not be .

		Investment too easily identifies these changing manners and morals of society with everlasting law , makes of them idols and masters where they ought to be sym - bols and servants .

		The civilization of
Europe	LOCATION	has gone a long way since the days of the Holy Roman Empire , and what was eternal law then is only super - stitious survival now .

		Change , society does and will , no matter how our interests and wishes may in idea arrest it , holding fast to this or that form or institution .

		For the modern world the question has become : Shall we suffer or direct this change ?

		Shall we be its victims or its masters ?

		There is only one answer in a world so self-conscious as ours .

		Human institutions are but the mutual accommo - dations of separate human wills .

		Society is more and more what we choose to make it .

		In the forms of human organization belief is fact .

		`` If you will it , '' said Theo - dor
Herzl	ORGANIZATION	, urging his people toward the new Zion , `` it is no dream . ''

		Surely the record of new achievement and invention in this our world , a record as rich as that of the less conspicuously changing old order which so dominates our attention , is sufficient warrant for attempting a new or - der which needs no more to make it real than a shift of this same attention .

		Hu - man nature is not in conflict with lasting peace and a free international order .

		It sets no limits to internationalism .

		Only the perversion of human nature by the illusions of exclusive sovereignty , the harsh realities of class vanity and class greed , `` national honor '' and the `` rights of prop - erty '' limit and combat it .

		Regard a free league of free peoples : if you will it , it is no dream .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 187 A Happy Ending for the Little Theatre Understatement was the gravest of
Duse	PERSON	's errors when she told us that , to save the theatre , the theatre must be de - stroyed .

		We have been hopefully watch - ing the little theatre movement assisted by the movies deliver the coup de grace , only to discover that
Duse	PERSON	vastly under - stated the operation .

		She also missed a further epigram and a new demonstration of the truth of Christian dogma .

		To save the theatre , its savior must likewise be de - stroyed .

		The salvation of the American theatre by the birth , suffering , and death of innumerable theatres has been going on pretty steadily for the past ten years .

		It has reached the point in spite of the war or because of it , one can hardly say where our wholesale show-shop of Broad - way and The Road is thoroughly discred - ited artistically and scrapped financially , while the little theatre movement hovers between life and death , with four literary executors by the bedside .

		They are

Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	, author of `` The Art The - atre '' -LRB- Knopf ;

Constance D'Arcy Mackay	PERSON	, author of `` The Little Theatre in the
United States	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		The importance and vitality of the little theatre movement and the insecurity of the factors that compose it are amply dem - onstrated both by the fact of the almost simultaneous publication of these four vol - umes and by the contents of the books themselves .

		According to the computa - tions of the writers there are anywhere from 23 to 51 little theatres in our coun - try .

		Miss
Burleigh	PERSON	records 51 in the course of her argument .

		Miss
Mackay	ORGANIZATION	produces the same total by including 5 very questionable cases and at least 4 failures .

		Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	is content to tell us of 32 , with 9 of these now defunct .

		The goodly number included by even the most careful of these writers speaks for the re - ality of the revolt of artists , actors , and even audiences and authors against the gat - ling gun fodder of the regular theatre ; while the disagreement over the exact facts , the inability which any of the authors would find in arriving at the same total two months running , ought to demonstrate as all but one of these writers is willing to admit the insecurity of this makeshift effort to create for Ainerica a new sort of theatre , which was a very old sort on the Continent before the war .

		Unpleasant as the cant phrase has grown , the little theatre is a `` movement . ''

		It is going somewhere .

		Three of these four volumes the three that are really worth reading frankly admit it .

		Each of the three decides that the little theatre is a step in a different direction but a step , not a stop .

		Miss
Burleigh	PERSON	says that the organization of little theatres is a step towards the `` community theatre a house of play in which events offer to every member of a body politic active participation in a common interest , '' a theatre where audience and entertainers are intermittently one .


Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	sees the little theatre as an experiment in petto towards the `` higher ideal '' of the art theatre , whose products are distin - guished by `` spiritual unity , rhythm , style . ''

		Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	, who has written by far the most valuable book of the four , sees the little theatre as an insurgent against things as they are , and particu - larly a creator and trainer of a new audi - ence for a new theatre to come .

		Miss
Mackay	PERSON	, among a score of other inaccu - racies some of which , to be sure , the other writers do not wholly avoid de - clares that the little theatre `` can advance towards the goal it has set for itself un - hampered by the difficulties that beset the commercial playhouse .

		Indeed , all diffi - culties are promptly overridden . ''


Maurice Browne	PERSON	, whose
Chicago	LOCATION	Little Theatre -LRB- source of the most consistent and distin - guished work done in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- has been forced to the wall , would doubtless be heartened by
Miss Mackay	PERSON	's statement quite as much as the fellow-writers would be interested to learn that the little thea - tre `` is the theatre of the Future . ''

		If that be movement , make the most of it .

		The little theatre is a makeshift for 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	people who wish to create a fine , broad , democratic playhouse , and who find that they can no more begin by setting up a huge , expensive theatre in competition with the commercial houses , than a sculp - tor can begin his training by hewing away at heroic marble .

		The theatre seating three hundred is simply a way of getting round the problems or maintaining a cheap theatre for a limited audience .

		It is a laboratory out of which will come the evidences of new possibilities the possi - bility of creating finer art by integral or - ganization of actors , producers , and artists than by wholesale specialists , and the possibility of gathering together from the vast heterogeneous public of the reg - ular theatres an audience which wants that sort of art and needs a place where it is sure of getting it .

		The problem of creating the finer sort of art depends of course on individual and group ability , but the supposition is that it can be more easily created in a single , united theatre-laboratory than piecemeal all over the country .

		And it is safe to say that
Maurice Browne	PERSON	in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Sam Hume	PERSON	in
Detroit	LOCATION	, the Neighborhood Play - house in
New York	LOCATION	, and
Stuart Walker	PERSON	in his peripatetic Portmanteau Theatre have demonstrated this in varying degrees .

		Gathering the audience is another mat - ter .

		There even the
Washington	LOCATION	Square Players , with their less exacting standards , are not an indubitable evidence of success .


Maurice Browne	PERSON	has failed outright in the second city of the country .


Sam Hume	PERSON	and the
Neighborhood Playhouse	ORGANIZATION	have succeeded by combining the endowment of a rent-free theatre and a limited number of performances with the economy of am - ateur acting .

		There is no available evi - dence as to whether Mr.
Walker	PERSON	has really made money with his `` theatre that comes to you '' and brings a company of paid players but it seems safe to say that if he has been able to solve the problem of the limited audiences available in smaller cities , it is because he has lumped all these audiences together by playing only a few performances in each city .

		Summed up , the work of the little the - atres has demonstrated one truth above all others .

		They have proved the worth of something that they have avoided .

		They have established the efficacy and the neces - sity of the true repertory system .

		Not one of these theatres has been truly a reper - tory theatre making productions with a certain regularity and dividing a week of seven or eight performances among three or more different plays .

		Outside
New York City	LOCATION	it is doubtless safe to say that the day of the true reper - tory theatre must be postponed until grad - ual experiment has demonstrated the pres - ence of a large enough audience to support steadily a reasonable-sized theatre .

		In
New York	LOCATION	it is now possible , as
Grace George	ORGANIZATION	showed a few seasons ago , to make a better sort of theatre financially feasible if it will cut loose from compari - son with the rest of Broadway .

		It is phys - ically and spiritually possible to mount in one theatre , with one company of actors and stage artists , fifteen productions of a high level in a single season .

		It is no exaggeration to say that each of these pro- ductions averaging up the successes with the failures can be of sufficient interest to 15,000 people to keep the theatre com - fortably filled for a total of from fourteen to sixteen performances of each bill .

		Some would do less well , some phenomenally better .

		But each would have its chance to be seen by those interested , and none would be expected to draw the hundred thousand patrons of a Broadway run .

		As part of a repertory such as this , the season 's most interesting play and most precipitate fail - ure `` The Deluge , '' as presented by Ar - thur
Hopkins	PERSON	would have drawn back its cost of production very comfortably dur - ing sixteen scattered performances .

		It could have turned loss into profit if the ten or fifteen thousand who would really have enjoyed it and who doubtless in - tended to see it at sometime during its run had divined the brevity of its life and rushed into the Hudson Theatre dur - ing the two weeks through which its actors appeared before handfuls of people .

		It is the essential principle of repertory , dem - onstrated time after time abroad , that it can gather a play 's utmost audience eco - nomically and efficiently .

		Our theatre fails utterly in that important function .

		Our little theatres are making shift towards that vitally desirable end .


KENNETH MACGOWAN	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 189 Our
London	LOCATION	Letter -LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Christmas lull in literary production does not last long , but it gives one time to look round and see things which would otherwise escape the harried and bemused attention of the literary observer .

		And looking round me , I can see nothing more remarkable than the astonish - ing literary activity which is going on in Ire - land .

		It has long been a commonplace of critics that Anglo-Irish literature ought to be judged as a separate species , that Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	can only be compared with
Shelley	PERSON	as vaguely and as distantly as Villon can be compared with
Byron	PERSON	, and that not only the ideas but also the images and the rhythms of
Dublin	LOCATION	are differ - ent from those of
London	LOCATION	.

		Yet I am not at all sure that this commonplace has ever been true .

		Certainly Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has lived most of his time in
Ireland	LOCATION	and has used the figures of the Irish mythology in his verse ; but he was also a member of the
Rhymers ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, the asso - ciate of
Dowson	PERSON	and
Symons	PERSON	, and I have a suspicion that the affinities between him and the English poets of the nineties absurd and now mercifully fading age are stronger than either his affinities with the Irish race at large or those of his associates with the main stream of Eng - lish literature .

		The remarkable thing about him is not so much that he is a great Irish poet as that he is the one considerable new poet thrown up by the cosmopolitan and somewhat bloodless movement of the nineties .

		It is my impression that he found material in
Ireland	LOCATION	, whereas the others found it in
France	LOCATION	, the Roman decadence , Catholic theology ,
Jacobitism	PERSON	, and strange coun - tries the seeking and finding being in all cases very much on the same level , the difference appearing only in the use of that material .

		But here is some ground for believing that the case is now a little altered or is , at all events , in process of alteration .

		I doubt if the real Anglo-Irish literature can ever be properly sep - arated from pure English literature .

		Language , after all , is that which determines poetry ; and the English language is not a brand-new , en - tirely plastic material which can be handled precisely as the poet pleases .

		It has its tradi - tions and its habits ; though the Irish writer may wish to compose upon Cuchullain or
Diarmuid	PERSON	and
Grainne	PERSON	instead of upon , let us say , Rich - ard Cosur-de-Lion or the Black Prince or
Robin Hood	PERSON	, his only models are the English writers .

		It will take the Irish a good many generations to evolve a distinct form of literary English upon which they can impress their own tradi - tions and their own habits ; and meanwhile everything that they are doing in this way will react on English literature .

		Some of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's most characteristic rhythms and images and ways of thought are now the commonplaces of purely English writers .

		I have however already expressed my view that he is chiefly an English poet ; so perhaps this illustration of the argu - ment goes for nothing .

		On the other hand ,
John Millington Synge	PERSON	is as exclusively Irish a dramatist as one could expect to find .

		Even so , his plays have generated , not an Irish drama , but a type of peasant drama which has flour - ished much more rankly in
England	LOCATION	than in the place of its origin .

		His plays are not now Irish as opposed to English , but plays in the Wicklow dialect of English which stand side by side with other certainly much less important plays in the
Gloucestershire	LOCATION	,
Westmoreland	LOCATION	,
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	knows how many other dialects of English .

		Yet there is , for all this , a very definite and independent stirring of life in the literature which can be called , if no more than topograph - ically , the literature of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		It began , I think , with '' ^ E , '' principally because `` IE '' was not in his writing specifically a Celt , in the way in which other and more flamboyantly Irish writers had led us to interpret the word .

		He was more Irish than the rest because he was simply an Irishman whose fundamental habits of life were settled in his own country , while his intellectual and spiritual interests , like those of any intellectual and spiritual man , searched the world for their nourishment and brought it back , when found , to
Ireland	LOCATION	to consume .

		His was , on one side at least , a literary
Sinn Feinism	PERSON	, not by deliberate adoption but by nature .

		He exalted
Ireland	LOCATION	, 1 not by denouncing
England	LOCATION	but by taking no particular notice of her .

		He did not carry into literature the cheerful Sinn Fein pre - scription : `` Burn everything English , except coal . ''

		I have never heard that he organized bonfires of the works of the English mystical writers on
College Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he has never sought particularly to influence the English pub - lic or to capture English opinion .

		He is , one has always felt without being able to demon - strate the feeling very clearly , an Irish writer who would be just as much and as little affected if he were told that he was read and admired in
England	LOCATION	, as I should be if I happened to be told that I was read and admired in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		190 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	All this leads up to the remark that I have on my table at the moment some ten or fifteen books which have arrived there during the last two months or so and almost all of which clearly have their origin in a centre of literature and thought quite independent of the influence of
London	LOCATION	.

		There never has been , since the days of
Byron	PERSON	's `` Scotch Reviewers , '' any real decen - tralization in English literature , such as can be found in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The last word on every topic is said in
London	LOCATION	; and though the provin - cial repertory theatres have attempted some de - centralization in the drama , their effort flickers unsteadily and has not yet produced many results of enduring value .

		But
Dublin	LOCATION	does pour out a stream of books in an attitude which seems to proclaim indifference to the opinion of Lon - don ; and this is all to the good , even if it does no more than administer a healthy shock to English criticism .

		I have here now two vol - umes of the collected works of
Padraic H. Pearse	PERSON	, who was executed for his part in the Easter insurrection , three volumes of sketches and sto - ries , two volumes of literary studies , a narrative poem , two or three plays , a study of the career of Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	, and a number of miscel - laneous books , such as an account by
Pearse	PERSON	of the methods adopted in the Irish school , `` Sgoil Eanna , '' of which he was headmaster .

		These are signs of the times ; but , of course , the times bristle with signs .

		It is a curiously significant fact , for example , that the collected works of
Padraic Pearse	PERSON	, whom we shot as a rebel less than two years ago , have been reviewed in the English press generally with respect , gen - tleness , and even appreciation .

		I do not mean merely in the Liberal and advanced papers .

		This curious portent meaning whatever it may mean has been observed in columns of the `` Times . ''

		Yet
Pearse	PERSON	was a man who sincerely detested
England	LOCATION	, if any Irishman ever did .

		I do not pretend to offer any exact interpretation of this phenomenon , though I may be excused for believing that its significance is of something entirely creditable to us .

		One does not feel inclined to do more than call attention to it .


Pearse	PERSON	's works , of course , were mainly written in Irish and have been translated , some by his own and some by another hand , for the present edition .

		They are naturally somewhat foreign in flavor and , by reason of the ruling passion of
Pearse	ORGANIZATION	's life , markedly Irish in sentiment .

		Apart from this , his translations of his own poems are often beautiful and characteristic , as in `` A Woman of the Mountain Keens her Son '' : Grief on the death , it has blackened my heart : It has snatched my love and left me desolate , Without friend or companion under the roof of my house But this sorrow in the midst of me , and I keening .

		As I walked the mountain in the evening The birds spoke to me sorrowfully , The sweet snipe spoke and the voiceful curlew Relating to me that my darling was dead .

		I called to you and your voice I heard not , I called again and I got no answer , I kissed your mouth , and O God how cold it was !

		Ah , cold is your bed in the lonely churchyard .

		O green-sodded grave in which my child is , Little narrow grave , since you are his bed , My blessing on you , and thousands of blessings On the green sods that are over my treasure .

		Grief on the death , it can not be denied , It lays low green and withered together And O gentle little son , what tortures me is That your fair body should be making clay !

		This bears marks of a somewhat alien sentiment , which , in the hands of
Pearse	LOCATION	, almost takes on an anti-English tone .

		Yet , putting my hand into the heap at random , I can find nothing par - ticularly exotic or propagandist in Mr.
Seumas O'Sullivan	PERSON	's `` Mud and Purple , '' a volume of de - scriptions of
Dublin	LOCATION	scenes and persons , or in Mr.
E. A. Boyd	PERSON	's `` Appreciations and Depreciations , '' studies of modern Irish writers , or in Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	's `` Vengeance of Fionn , '' a beau - tiful narrative poem .

		I do find evidence of a new centre of thought and literature a pro- vincial centre , if you will , but still a centre .

		And I can not but think that we shall all profit `` y ** EDWARD SHANKS .

		Haven Under these moving tides that pass us by , Or snatch us into maelstroms of profound Oblivion where a thousand dreams have drowned , Forgotten of all ports beneath the sky ; Under these waters , throated with a cry Of old disaster , runs a deeper sound Music the slimed , uncrypted dead have found In hushed , moon-haunted chasms where they lie .

		Not in his own letters , altogether , but chiefly in the letters written to him by his greater con - temporaries ; and not the best letters that they wrote , but in casual , usually trivial notes whose only interest is in the signatures .

		Truly a sec - ond-hand manner of biography , that inevitably gives the effect of a pallid , second-hand existence .

		Yet one suspects that this is exactly what passed for life in the circles which
Woolner	PERSON	orna - mented , and among the contemporaries whose faces and figures he earnestly copied in marble and bronze .

		Woolner emerged from obscurity through the Pre-Raphaelite Movement .

		The best letters in the present volume were written to him by Ros - setti , and it may be inferred that the most vivid and imaginative experience of life came to him through his association with the Brotherhood inferred only , for his own testimony is lacking .

		A disappointment in a competition for a Words - worth monument led him to turn to gold seek - ing in
Australia	LOCATION	, and his own chief contribution to his `` Life '' is a rather dull chronicle of voy - aging , trekking , and digging .

		Emigration was represented as a cure for all forms of personal disappointment and discontent in the diluted post-Byronism of the fifties -LRB- vide ``
Locksley Hall	PERSON	, '' `` The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich , '' and ``
Alton Locke	PERSON	'' -RRB- .

		Woolner turned from unsuc - cessful gold digging to successful commercial work in
Sydney	LOCATION	and
Melbourne	LOCATION	.

		After his return we hear little of Pre-Raphael - itism and artistic revolt .

		He connected himself with his more eminent contemporaries and became the official sculptor of a generation whose standard of portrait art was a good like - ness .

		A grave in
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	almost cried out for a statue , bust , or medallion by
Woolner	PERSON	.

		It is the rather external or official relation to his age of Woolner the portraitist and mortuary artist , which the letters chiefly commemorate .

		Yet there is something curiously monumental about the book and , one might almost say , sig - nificant .

		There are the middle-aged Victorians all at play .

		A little wooden they are , like the figures in a child 's
Noah	PERSON	's Ark and one is reminded that the well-behaved animals went in two by two , for many of the letters are by wives of famous subjects who were too busy to write for themselves and make arrangements for `` sit - tings . ''

		Lady
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gladstone	PERSON	, Mrs.
Froude	PERSON	take pen in hand more often than their husbands .

		It is a very monoga - mous book ; and when
Woolner	PERSON	, after a really lovely bachelorhood , took to himself as wife the beautiful
Miss Waugh	PERSON	, the triumphant flutter among the matrons was considerable .

		The book brings out the essentially suburban quality of society among the Victorians .

		They are like people who live on the same street , and are good neighbors , thinking well of one another , cordial , jocular , sympathetic .

		Everybody liked to hear
Tennyson	PERSON	read his poetry , and we find
Woolner	PERSON	, from a safe distance , murmuring of `` Merlin '' : `` How I wish I could hear it ; I quite envy those fortunates who have . ''

		Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	is delighted to hear that
Kenyon	PERSON	left a good deal of money to the Brownings but , with regret for an emotional extravagance , confesses , `` I thought the Brownings had been poor , or I should not so much have rejoiced over their acquisition of money . ''

		Woolner stoutly approves of
Browning	PERSON	's scorn of those who would curry fa - vor with him by running down
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		There is a kindly bit of gossip about Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's bribing the butler in her old home to leave the blind up a little so that she might get a last glimpse of her unforgiving father .

		One readily divines which of the group were good neighbors .


Edward Lear	PERSON	, with his pattering drivel of baby talk , was a general favorite .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, one fears , was a trifle remote .

		Woolner writes Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	that Arnold `` made kind inquir - ies after you , who seem to have taken his fancy exceedingly .

		Yet even this overpowering distinction made someone happy , for `` he had a long talk with
Patmore	PERSON	, whose countenance the whole time beamed radi - ant joy with the satisfaction of holding inter - course with such a high Oxford don . ''


Ruskin	PERSON	was loathed .

		There is positive malice in
Wool	LOCATION	- ner 's note that ``
Ruskin	PERSON	praised some of the worst pictures in the place ; he has made such an obvious mess of it this year that his enemies are dancing for delight ... The little despot imagines himself the Pope of Art and would wear 3 crowns as a right , only they would make him look funny in

		There is very little about art in the book fortunately , for it would have been painful .

		192 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	Lady
Tennyson	PERSON	suggests a slight improvement ' in the medallion of her husband `` the scraping away of a little of the nose underneath the nos - tril all along to the point so as to shorten the nose a wee bit ; if this would not bother you and if you think it right . ''

		Woolner responds with equal suavity : `` I have always taken your hints but in one instance , and now find I was wrong in not doing so : I refer to making the right jaw of the bust a trifle thicker as you wished , and I did not see . ''

		Perhaps the , gem of art criticism is supplied by Lady
Hooker	PERSON	.

		The com - munity was justly incensed at the shocking acci - dent to
Woolner	PERSON	's bust of Sir
William Hooker	PERSON	, which had its nose knocked off on its arrival at the exhibition of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and disgusted when that
august	DATE	body showed no wil - lingness to pay for .

		the damaged masterpiece .

		Lady
Hooker	PERSON	suggested that
Woolner	PERSON	should exhibit the bust anyway , and adds the com - forting suggestion that `` the Elgin marbles have well accustomed spectators to this special deform - ity , so that the loss of a nose no longer looks grotesque , but a mark of the real antique . ''

		Darwin would indeed make art the handmaid \ of science .

		He turns to
Woolner	PERSON	, as one to whom certain matters are all in the day 's work , to inquire how low down an experienced model will blush .

		He notes the assertion that a `` cele - brated French painter once saw a new model blushing all over her body '' but , distrusting the Gallic verve of this observation , he demands the experience of `` cautious and careful English artists . ''

		We are sure that all
Woolner	PERSON	's artist friends were `` cautious and careful . ''

		There is but one touch of wholesome vulgar - ity in this chronicle of
Cranford	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	writes to
Woolner	PERSON	one day that they had two tickets for
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's reading , that she could not go , and would he take the vacant seat beside Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	?

		He would be most happy .

		Carlyle , to do the thing in style , took him in a cab .

		The reading was two hours , with a ten minute pause during which the two unregener - ate males went behind the scenes and had a drink with the entertainer brandy and water .

		`` Each poured out a portion for himself and Car - lyle took his glass and nodding to
Dickens	PERSON	said : ` Charley , you carry whole company of actors under your own hat . ' ''

		Just for a moment we are in a real world with human beings then back again among the frustrate but so courteous and gentle ghosts who owed their substance to
Woolner	ORGANIZATION	's marble .

		Perhaps that is why they adored him .

		God as Visible `` Personality GOD THE KNOWN AND GOD THE UNKNOWN .

		Whatever in the spiritual life of man has the highest potency for him , according to tem - perament or level of consciousness attained , what - ever aspect of experience is felt to open the portals to the loftiest flights of creative imag - ination , is very apt to be projected into his God .

		The essence of God is sought in those concepts that liberate the caged self and make it supreme in its own world of chosen goods .

		God is thus the impersonation or source of magic , of power , of immortality , of truth , of art , of morality , of ecstatic vision , of annihilation .

		All gods , at any rate all useful gods , are anthropo - morphic ; in so far as the gods of theological and philosophical speculation escape the human mould , they reduce to purely verbal formulae .

		The
Jesus of Christian	ORGANIZATION	myth has intense vitality as a symbol of human aspiration , of triumph in degradation ; the Holy Ghost can found no cult .

		The God of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	is no exception to the rule .

		He possesses the attributes of his cre - ator and incorporates his strongest aspirations .

		I had come to
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's essay fresh from `` The Note Books , '' that curious congeries of brilliant epigrams , dead-ridden hobbies , far-fetched analo - gies , and penetrating analyses ; hence I could not fail to observe the impress of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's person - ality , as revealed by himself in these notes , on his theological speculations .

		Butler was a man of a very definite , though not easily definable , cast of mind , possessed of very clear-cut likes and dislikes , and fond of hugging certain thoughts , attitudes , and modes of reasoning with a per - sistency that is occasionally trying to the reader , but indicative at the same time of their high emotional value for Butler .

		Some of the sug - gestive traits revealed in `` The Note Books '' are a pragmatic attitude towards truth that must have seemed paradoxical to his contemporaries -LRB- in one passage Butler directly states that that is true which it is most `` convenient '' to believe -RRB- ; a strong disinclination to take account of any factors not directly yielded by experience ; a dis - trust of all arguments pushed to their logical extreme ; a well-nigh amazing reliance on evi - dence from analogy -LRB- as
Butler	ORGANIZATION	characteristically puts it , analogy is poor ground for an argument but it is the best we have -RRB- ; and , probably most deep-rooted of all , a habit of bridging all sorts of opposites , which
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's ingrained love of antithesis of expression leads him to contemplate
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 193 with genuine interest , into a continuum , so that all life is seen to harbor death and no death to be altogether lifeless , all mind to be associated with matter and no form of matter to be alto - gether mindless in short , A to include some - thing of Z and Z something of A .

		One may , indeed , suspect the last two of these traits to have had over Butler something of the tyran - nical sway of compulsive thought-habits .

		Surely not a little in his theories and fancies is attrib - utable to them .

		Through
Butler	PERSON	's work runs , further , an ear - nest , quietly passionate , longing for eventual recognition , a longing now rising to calm assur - ance , now masking itself in a philosophic humor of indifference that was but half insincere .

		For the catchpenny recognition of the passing hour he had a genuine scorn , though the note of wist - ful regret is not absent from his contemplation of the relative failure to achieve literary fame - that was his lot .

		Few men have had such con - fidence in the morrow succeeding to the day of personal identity , few have had ^ such an abiding sense of the reality of the unity , biological and spiritual , which binds the generations inextrica - bly together .

		The sense of a personality of flesh and spirit transcending that of individual con - sciousness is , indeed , the keynote to much of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's thinking .

		It is at the heart of his evo - lutionary speculations , with his curious identifi - cation of memory and heredity , as it , in a meas - ure , also pervades his masterpiece , `` The Way of All Flesh , '' a novel of four generations .

		Per - manence of a something which , in the midst of endless dissolutions , unfolds towards an unknown goal the concept is rarely absent from
Butler	PERSON	's thoughts , it takes shape in innumerable forms .

		Between the personal fame for which he longed and the complete submergence of self in a spir - itual humus affording nourishment to those that follow , Butler found no true opposition .

		Life , organic and psychic , is merely the endlessly rami - fied career * of a single personality .

		This brings us face to face with
Butler	PERSON	's con - ception of God .

		His God will , above all things , be one that we can most `` conveniently '' believe in as doing least violence to our daily habits of thought and most readily following as a synthe - sis of actual experience .

		There will be noth - ing mystical about him , nothing that baffles the understanding .

		He will be a modest God , a God in man 's own image , and he will no more hold in his hands the key to the riddle of exist - ence than does the least of his creatures .

		Nor will he hold himself austerely aloof in a divine empyrean whence issue strange fulmina - tions and prescriptions ; he will be our veriest neighbor , squatting on our own domain .

		He will , like any phenomenon , be content to fit him - self into the analogical scheme of things .

		And he will be as everlasting as life itself , no more and no less .

		In short ,
Butler	PERSON	's God is identical with that ramified but single personality that evolution knows , whose being is the totality of life .

		He is the sum total and synthesis of all manifesta - tions of life , animal and vegetable .

		To be more exact , he is the personalized energy or principle that resides and has , for untold aeons , resided in living matter and mind for the two are insep - arable .

		The single cell of the animal organism is a perfect and self-sufficient life unit or per - sonality , unaware , or but dimly aware , of the larger wliole of which it forms a part , yet exist - ing only for the sake of that * whole .

		In pre - cisely the same manner , argues Butler , each indi - vidual in the great sum of animated nature , plant or animal orjiuman being , is a life unit or per - sonality that is unaware , or but dimly aware , of the vast personality or God of which it forms an infinitesimal fragment and which , we may believe , possesses a consciousness transcending ours as this transcends the consciousness of the single cell .

		Cell , organism , God these form `` three great concentric phases of life . ''

		The vast personality indwelling in life is the known God .

		Whether or not there Hs a fourth concentric phase , an unknown God , embracing a multitude of Gods analogous to the only one we have direct knowledge of , it is useless to speculate .

		As the cell knows not our God , so we can not be ex - pected to know a super-God .

		Butler 's theology leads to no metaphysical solutions of ultimate problems .

		This conception of God differs radically not only from that of orthodox theism but from the all-inclusive God of the pantheists .

		Both of these lack the fundamental essential of an intel - ligible God personality .

		Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that
Butler	PERSON	's conception lends itself to a readier approximation to the pantheistic God than to the sovereign God of religion .

		In the present work
Butler	ORGANIZATION	is at considerable pains to dismiss the pantheistic conception as unthinkable ; yet we learn from his editor 's note to the chap - ter on `` The Tree of Life '' that the separation of the organic from the inorganic , which is at the basis of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's thesis , was later abandoned 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	by him and that he felt impelled , in consequence , to reconstruct his essay .

		This work however he left undone .

		It is difficult to see how Butler could in the end have avoided the pantheism he had opposed .

		It would have had to be , need - less to say , a pantheism arrived at by a series of concentric phases of some sort of evolutionary process .

		In his critical study on
Samuel Butler	PERSON	Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	somewhat petulantly remarks : `` I can not believe in his God , simply because he does not write about his God with style .

		He writes not as one passionately believing , but as one desirous of accounting for a phenomenon , in this instance faith .

		Since there is faith there must be God , panpsychic . ''

		This is not alto - gether fair .

		There are not a few passages in
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's little book where the dialectic flames into imaginative diction .

		Moreover his God embodies , in the only way possible for
Butler	PERSON	, his desire for spiritual perpetuation .

		Yet , on the whole , there is small doubt that the quest of God had not the burning necessity for
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's ironical and eminently level-headed tempera - ment that it has for certain other natures .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	could hardly have expected him to write of God with the passionate conviction and the love that are due His especially favored mani - festation ,

		Background Jf ^ ithout Tradition A SON OF THE MIDDLE BORDER .

		By
Hamlin Gar	PERSON	- land .

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	, in this story of his own life , seems hardly to be writing a confession , unless it be a confession or rather avowal of faith .

		He does not read like a man who has anything to recant or even abate ; he lays down his cards very assuredly ; he gives the reader , without re - serve , not a finished and consequently more or less inscrutable product , but himself the artist , together with the material of his art .

		He pre - sents the Middle Border with both vivid par - ticularization and panoramic completeness of view ; he has a filially sensitive eye for the menace and rigor of the frontier as well as for its splen - dor and charm .

		He sets himself before the reader with detachment the actual detachment of time , for he stops his narrative at his thirty - first or thirty-second year .

		The picture is a large and broad one , occasionally too sardonic in its fidelity to fact .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	is inevitably , of course , the his - torian of his own consciousness , so far as he can call back the materials of it ; and he recovers even from the dimness of his fourth year the memory of a midsummer evening and the rescue by his mother of a `` poor , shrieking little tree toad '' from the jaws of a long and wicked snake .

		The finer , certainly the more pleasing , parts of this history are those devoted to childish and boyish impressions ; these memories are `` of the fibre of poetry , '' unshadowed by the preoccu - pation which clings too closely to the author 's mature consciousness the preoccupation of the `` man who has been there , '' the `` competent wit - ness , '' who is determined to set forth the `` en - forced misery of the pioneer . ''

		The prairie land - scapes , `` the radiant slopes of grass , '' `` the brant and geese pushing their arrowy lines straight into the north , '' `` the cloudless , glorious Maytime skies , '' `` transcendent sunsets , '' `` the fields that run to the world 's end , '' `` the fairy forest '' of the wheat all the fair things of nature are inimitably done .

		And there are numberless brief but adequate etchings of childhood : rich harvests of nuts and berries , bold explorations of the wil - derness , breathless climbing of tall trees for grapes , the soldier pride of standing sentinel over new sown grain to guard it from wild pigeons .

		Whenever he speaks of these things , Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land 's voice carries with the excellent timbre of romance .

		But the convictions of the `` man who has been there '' assert themselves apace .

		Even his mem - ories of `` the twelve year old son of a Western farmer '' frequently become memories of unre - mitting toil and desperate fatigue ; and he speaks emphatically of his seventeen year old bitterness when his family moved from town back into the country .

		The farm even then had become to him the synonym for loneliness , dirt , and drudg - ery .

		That note in his theme continually gathers burden as he proceeds ; avowedly it becomes his theme ; it is clearly the source of the emotionaliza - tion not only of this but of all his work .

		His friends apparently found it necessary to warn him against the violence of his truth-telling ; and the reader of this autobiography and of much of his other work will probably say that they advised him well , for while his art has become neither satire nor caricature , it smells of vengeance .

		In - deed from this admirable picture , both panoramic and detailed , which the author spreads out , the reader derives the contradictory impressions not only of the splendor and poetic suggestion of the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 195 frontier itself , but also of the wretchedness , the pain , the futile inadequacy of life on the frontier .

		One can not , however , infer from this wretched - ness and inadequacy any inferiority in the indi - viduals who lead such wretched lives ; these pioneers may be more or less unlettered , but there can be no dispute as to the rugged power of the men or the strength and beauty of the women .

		It is the corrosive monotony , the loneliness , the blank unending labor , the bleak conditions of life that so preoccupy the author 's mind .

		And perhaps the unsuspected element which , for the purposes of art , makes this wretchedness doubly tawdry , is the fact that it is raw and new ; it has no tradition ; it is unhistoric .

		In
England	LOCATION	it might have had the impressiveness of prescription might have been the material of such a mel - ancholy as
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's ; even in
New Eng	LOCATION	- land much might have been done in Puritan dark gray ; but in
Dakota	LOCATION	it seems to have been , to the artist whose inheritance it is , chiefly the material of exasperation .

		He explains its existence not by any splendid and gloomy conception of a Blind Power in whose grip humanity is helpless , but rather prosaically as the result of social injustice , of institutions not founded in accordance with the principle of the single tax .

		One may well wonder if this result is not unfortunate .

		Has it not partially impaired the artist 's perception of the dignity and antiquity of his material ?

		Human tribulation is an old and impressive story .

		Has his emotionalization of the frontier not been crowded down to a lower level than it might otherwise have attained ?

		Has not the determined actualism which Mr.
Garland	PERSON	here so sternly reasserts , really been the refuge in adversity of a strongly romantic talent , a talent thwarted by the barrenness of its material ?

		ANTHOLOGY OF MAGAZINE VERSE :
1917	DATE	.


William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		Small ,
Maynard	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		`` All the glamour about our present
Renais	PERSON	- sance of poetry , '' says Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	in the introduction to his latest anthology , `` carries with it a palpable danger , the danger of disintegrating criticism ... If the public heeds such criti - cism , audiences will diminish , and the consequent discouragement of the poets themselves will pro- duce a decline in creativeness ... Fame and fortune for the modern poet are the gifts of public recognition and appreciation , and if these do not come before youth advances to that vague borderland where it is lost , the modern poet gives the best of himself to other things ... '' At first glance this position assumed by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	as it has been assumed also , with differences , by
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, editor of `` Poetry '' appears reasonable enough .

		No one will for a moment question the desirability of a large audience for poetry , as for any art , nor the use - fulness , to that end , of extensive publicity .

		But if we examine the doctrine more deliberately , we see certain flaws of logic in it .

		We all agree with Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	that everything possible should be done to encourage the art of poetry in
America	LOCATION	we all desire to see it developed to the highest degree of excellence .

		But many of us , as Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	intimates in the paragraph quoted above , are beginning to doubt whether he has hit upon the best method for bringing this about .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's method , as is now well known , is a simple one .

		It consists in carry - ing individual recognition for the poet to such a universal degree trawling , so to speak , with so vast a net that no poet can conceivably be lost .

		For the poet whose work is not represented in the `` Anthology , '' and whose book is not en - thusiastically reviewed either there or in the ``
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript , '' one would have to go far indeed .

		To find such poets in any quantity , one would have to look among the very poorest of books published at the author 's own expense .

		Now if by practicing this method Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite aims at making fame and fortune for his poets -LRB- and incidentally , we may properly assume , at helping poetry to evolve to an always clearer excellence -RRB- we may at once question whether he does not in reality sharply defeat both of his purposes .

		Among all artists there has always been and always will be a merciless struggle , silent , unconscious , uncalculated , for the sur - vival of the fittest .

		In every generation there is a terrific and unremittent competition among them for recognition , and for the consequent re - wards of fame or money .

		Unfortunately , the judge who awards the prize in this struggle is that most capricious and indiscriminate of judges , the public ; the public , which , swayed too easily by considerations of the moment , carried away too easily by its common denominators of sen - timentalism and conventionality , from genera - tion to generation , with a divine inevitability , takes to its bosom the ephemeral , commonplace , and merely lusty ; the cheerful and unreflecting 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	public , which , left to itself , and many times even despite the desperate efforts of the intelli - gent few , ignores genius and permits it to die .

		The survival of the best in literature is there - fore forever dependent on the efforts of these heroic few .

		Without them genius would be ignored , or largely ignored , during its lifetime , lost in the blattering welter of the mediocre ; and after its death wholly forgotten .

		It is this band of aesthetic pioneers , relatively small in every generation this band of the fastidious , the aloof , the difficult which awes the public by degrees first into accepting its discoveries , later into un - derstanding them , and finally into loving them .

		Nor is the essential reality of this process vitiated by the fact that the public is itself the final and absolute arbiter of what is vital and what is not .

		In these circumstances , it should be obvious that if here and there in this colossal combat an individual desires to assist the best in its struggle for survival , then his task will be to do , con - sciously , what nature in her simpler world does unconsciously to discriminate .

		Since , in the world of ideas , the law of natural selection works imperfectly and tardily , and encounters the sullen hostility of indifference and ignorance and char - latanism , he must help to make it work more perfectly .

		If fortunate , he will occasionally find the beautiful and subtle , the worthy-of-praise , and for this he will do all in his power to secure honor and comprehension ; but far more often will he find himself in the role of the surgeon who must be cruel in order to be kind .

		Benign cancers are common in the body literary , and occupy valuable space ; and the malignant can - cer is not rare .

		The intelligent critic must , in other words , add his own power of destruction to the fracas and destroy ruthlessly , secure in the knowledge that only the worthless can be truly destroyed and that only the fine can long sur - vive .

		What mistakes he makes will be auto - matically undone .

		A
Jeffrey	PERSON	can not kill a Keats , nor even deflect him .

		Is anyone prepared to maintain that Foe was too severe a critic ?

		Yet there have been few severer .

		Potentially far more dangerous to the recurring
Keats	PERSON	of the literary world is the recurring
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, the sort of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, be it understood , who is more given to praise than to appraisal .

		He , truly , is the destroyer .

		It is to this category , unfortunately , that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	belongs , and it is to this tendency that American letters , and conspicuously Amer - ican poetry , seem to be at the present moment helplessly surrendered .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	comes among us preaching , in the aesthetic world , what is clearly a Christian ethic , a doctrine of live and let live , a doctrine which , purporting to aim at the betterment of the species , flies in the face of nature , since it encourages the weak to propagate as freely as the strong .

		And the re - sult is rapid and sure : in the consequent pullula - tion of mediocrity the excellent is lost or stifled .

		Conducted on this principle , the world of let - ters will suggest nothing so much as a forest in which the growth is so rank that few of the trees can attain their proper stature ; and if here and there individuals contrive by special endowment to out-top the rest , it will be literally true that we shall be unable to see the tree for the forest .

		In other words , to speak more precisely in terms of poetry , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	by awarding laurels to a hundred poets indifferently good , delays , if he does not prevent , the emergence of the poets who partake of genius .

		The genius must stand in line while
Tom	PERSON	,
Dick	PERSON	, and Harry get their doles ; and when his own turn comes , he too will get only the same dole .

		Where then are the fame and fortune which Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	hopes to guarantee him ?

		They have , alas , ceased to exist except in fractions .

		Of Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's actual performance in the present `` Anthology '' not much need be said .

		It is more copious than ever .

		Here and there in it are goodish poems , inevitably `` A Bather , '' by
Amy Lowell	PERSON	; `` To My Friend , '' by
Eunice Tietjens	PERSON	; `` The Interpreter , '' by
Orrick Johns	PERSON	; `` A Girl 's Songs , '' by
Mary Carolyn Davies	PERSON	; `` Tomorrow Is My Birthday , '' by
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	; `` Return , '' by
Willard Wattles	PERSON	; `` In Tall Grass , '' by
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	; `` The Sons of Metaneira , '' by
John Erskine	PERSON	; and perhaps a half dozen others but of the important figures in contemporary poetry what ones are not hope - lessly obscured here ?

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	, Mr.
Masters	PERSON	,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	, Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	are dwarfed , if not lost ; and among those who do not appear at all are
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	,
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	,
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	,
Maxwell Bodenheim	PERSON	, and
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	.

		In his critical summaries of the books of verse published during the year Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is less discriminating than ever .

		Forty-five are listed , and a few of them are worth reading ; but Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's enthusiasm is glibly uniform and affords no clue .

		`` This is all poetry ! ''

		says Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	in effect ... and escapes his duty as a critic .

		In the end , one wonders whether such methods will not frighten away the audience far more
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 197 surely than a carefully selective criticism and whether , moreover , it will not also cheapen the audience , and in consequence the art .

		Ideals would certainly be kept higher and would not the public interest be keener ?

		if Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite 's `` Anthology '' consisted annually of thirty instead of a hundred-odd poems , and of five instead of forty-five eulogies of books ... Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	would then be contributing towards the survival of the best .

		As it is , he merely insures the meteoric evanescence of all , and by encouraging the unimportant many , discourages the important few .

		It is melancholy to suspect that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's method is not so much a matter of will as of ability .

		Is it conceivable that in asking him to discriminate we are ask - ing him to do something of which he is incap - able ?

		Har - pers ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Professor
Ogg	PERSON	has endeavored to write a his - tory of the last decade of American history .

		That is , he has written the last installment of the now well-known series to which most of the scholars of repute in their respective fields in this country have contributed volumes .

		It is a valuable series , which needed to be brought down to date , and the work before us is worthy to stand beside the others .

		Of course there are scores of works on the great war and the part of the
United States	LOCATION	in that war , and in recent years we have had many books on our own life which have traversed most of the subjects touched upon in this volume ; but there is nothing that gives such an even distribu - tion of emphasis , such a just estimate of forces , and such full and satisfying references and bib - liographies .

		Every student of recent events will be grateful for the list of good documents , picked from the tons of
Government	ORGANIZATION	publications , of satisfactory articles from the thousands of studies in periodicals , and of the best books on various topics of interest .

		The mechanism of this work is , I think , beyond all praise .

		On the score of selection , of omissions and inclusions , hardly less can be said .

		No really important subject has been overlooked .

		And the space allowed to the dominating figures
Roose	PERSON	- velt ,
Taft	LOCATION	, and
Wilson	PERSON	;
Bryan	PERSON	, Root , and
Harri	PERSON	- man ; or
Gompers	PERSON	and his group is well appor - tioned .

		If Professor
Ogg	PERSON	plays favorites , it is only in the case of
Roosevelt	LOCATION	, whose picturesque figure and spectacular performances do , indeed , command attention .

		Of
Bryan	PERSON	and his vast farmer following the author is not especially fond , although he does not deny him and them their due , especially in the working of the miracle by which
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	was made the nominee of the
Baltimore	LOCATION	convention in
1912	DATE	and after - wards elected President .

		The election of
1908	DATE	, the corporations and the trusts , tariff controversies , injunctions , party unrest , and Taft reaction are the subjects which occupy the earlier chapters .

		The canal ,
Latin America	LOCATION	, the election of
1912	DATE	, and our growing colonial empire come next in the story .

		Wood - row
Wilson	PERSON	, the Democratic reforms , and the great war close the story .

		According to the author the large issues were the curbing of industrial overlordship , the rise of labor to a commanding position in
September , 1916	DATE	, and the entrance of the
United States	LOCATION	into international affairs .

		And these are the subjects in which most men will be interested , at least for the next half dozen years .

		Roosevelt came to office when
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	's name was a shibboleth and when exploitation of the country was the right and proper thing for business men .

		He had a delicate task , to make the great men of his party -LRB- to whom the historic role of the Re - publican party had become almost semi-sacred -RRB- see that there was a new role , that public leader - ship was a public trust , not a group trust .

		The vigorous young President did not wholly succeed .

		He divided the party , secured a sort of Demo - cratic support , and drove some things through
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for example , the
Elkins	ORGANIZATION	railroad bill .

		But the rift which was bound to come did not appear till Taft entered the
White House	ORGANIZATION	as
Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	's protege .

		Taft was helpless in the situation in which his friend had placed him .

		For
Roosevelt	PERSON	had made the President the inter - preter of public opinion and as the interpreter he focused his powers upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.


Congress	ORGANIZATION	, un - der the leadership of Cannon and
Aldrich	PERSON	, did not like interpretation ; they liked still less to be driven .

		Since
Taft	PERSON	did not know how to interpret the thoughts of ninety million people and had no mind to drive
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he tried to govern according to constitution .

		He failed .

		The failure became tragic in the Republican convention of
1912	DATE	, and
Roosevelt	PERSON	appeared as the angry opponent of his former friend .

		It was like
Douglas	PERSON	in
1857	DATE	fighting the President whom he had done almost as much to put 198 THE DIAL -LSB-

Roosevelt	PERSON	had done for
Taft	LOCATION	.

		But this must not be understood as disparaging the reputation of either the living or the dead President .

		Both sought to be guided by the con - stitution ; both failed , because the constitution failed .

		Neither of them should have been de - nounced for not doing what they were by law as good as forbidden to do .

		But it is generally the president who keeps his oath to the letter who violates the spirit of his oath most tragically .

		Nor must the
Roosevelt	PERSON	idolaters consider the comparison with
Douglas	PERSON	invidious .

		It is a just comparison .

		Roosevelt resembles
Douglas	PERSON	quite as much as
Taft	ORGANIZATION	resembles
Buchanan	PERSON	.

		And
Douglas	PERSON	had the same sort of qualities that
Roose	PERSON	- velt has political agility and remarkable insight .

		The work of each enters most creditably into the history of our country .

		Still , this is not strictly in point in a review of
Ogg	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		I only hope that neither of our distinguished ex-Presidents may see these lines .

		Not because the compari - sons are unjust ; but because a living man is not a good judge of himself in history .

		The
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine and the Latin American situation are burning questions ; or they would be burning questions if the present war would but come to an end .

		Professor
Ogg	PERSON	thinks in terms of a mild and benevolent imperialism , a moderate Monroeist , one might say .

		He sees that concessions and loans and public utilities are the forces behind our
Monroe	PERSON	professions .

		He thinks
Wilson	PERSON	made a poor spectacle in Mex - ico ; yet he sees that if he had done otherwise he must have made a poorer spectacle .

		To set the neighbor 's disorderly house in order would have been quite as bad a business as not to set it in order .

		So the President concluded to wait `` watchfully , '' which was about all that anyone who knew the facts and saw historically could have done .

		It may be doubted whether
Roose	PERSON	- velt , who had so much to say , would have done otherwise , for somehow or other that eminent man had a wonderfully shrewd way of waiting `` watchfully '' when difficult matters were afoot for example , his tariff silences in many lan - guages .

		When one can not do anything without doing worse , one is likely to do nothing ; only the Mexicans would not let
Wilson	PERSON	do nothing .

		Perhaps when ten more years have passed and historians review this period they will say that
Wilson	PERSON	kept still because he thought a European war would be precipitated if he did otherwise ; and that
Germany	LOCATION	did nothing in
Mexico	LOCATION	, be - cause she thought that to do something would throw the
United States	LOCATION	into the arms of
England	LOCATION	and the English-French entente .

		Open-minded people , if there are such in the world , read books about current issues and living statesmen in the hope of learning a bit about the future and their duty in the premises .

		This book makes it appear that
Labor	ORGANIZATION	has at last won its long battle with capital and that working men will , in the future , dictate national policies .

		Did not Labor compel the President of the whole people to jam through
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the
Adamson	PERSON	law ?

		And does not British Labor give orders to
Lloyd George	PERSON	?

		The world , thinks Professor
Ogg	PERSON	, is starting upon a new era with day-laborers in command .

		And Mr.
Charles M. Schwab	PERSON	of the
Bethlehem Steel Company	ORGANIZATION	, formerly a worker with his hands , confirms the view .

		The day of capital is done .

		Although the present status of
Labor	ORGANIZATION	is strongly set forth in this book and the appearance of the present-day world supports the same con - clusion , it may be well to ask ourselves a question before we fall into line .

		The farmers thought in
1801	DATE	that their day had come and that commerce and finance had been relegated to secondary places among the great forces which then drove this country toward the future .

		But seven years had not passed before the farmer 's president had been definitely checkmated .

		In
1829	DATE	the farm - ers came back again , but they did not long control affairs .

		And the case was not very different in
1860	DATE	; yet three years had not elapsed till finance and industry were in the saddle .

		Now it would seem that labor has won .

		The existence of a great war gives laboring men , especially skilled men , an advantage that no other class has ever had .

		They will keep this advantage till arms are stacked on the western front .

		On that day finance and industry and trade will return to their former position .

		A few hundred thousand men who run rail - road trains or make munitions of war may now stop a great battle .

		The rulers of great nations who are fighting these battles have to give heed ; under other circumstances they might let strikes come and railroad trains stop .

		No , it is not so bad as some think , nor half so good as others hope .

		The world is very much the same it has ever been .

		Can the man who has not a week 's sup - plies in his cupboard rule mankind ?

		Having noticed the high status which this book gives to Messrs.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and
Taft	PERSON	, the reader may wonder what the place of
Wilson	PERSON	is thought
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 199 to be .

		Professor
Ogg	PERSON	is not sure that
Wilson	PERSON	represents a new era .

		The reforms of 1913-6 were all on the road in
1901-8	DATE	and the then vigorous reform President is thought to have been the real author .

		In other words ,
Wilson	PERSON	is the heir of his brilliant critic .

		If one were to say that
Lincoln	PERSON	was the fore-worker of Wil - son , one would be quite as near the truth .

		Every - thing that
Wilson	PERSON	has carried into the realm of reality was fought for by
George Pendleton	PERSON	or
Samuel Tilden	PERSON	or Bryan in those days of emo - tionalism which the author rather condemns , or by
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		If comparisons were not odious , I should venture to say that
Wilson	PERSON	, although born of a line of gentle forbears , is more nearly like
Lincoln	PERSON	, the son and grandson of backwoodsmen , than is any living leader of our country .

		But being like
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	has got to be somewhat com - monplace , and I shall not press the point .

		This book helps one understand oneself and points the way , even if a little hesitatingly , to a better future .

		For this , as for the many other helps and suggestions , the reader must be duly grateful .


WILLIAM E. DODD	PERSON	.

		If This * Be Literature Give Me Death THE GREEN MIRROR .

		By
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Memories of Meredith are provokingly incon - venient when one comes upon the younger Eng - lish novelists of the stenographic school .

		`` The Ordeal of Richard Feverel '' dealt with the gulf between the generations , presented the hideous - ness of the smug family circle , and showed glo - riously young love breasting the barbed wire entanglements of old conventions .

		All this Mer - edith did brilliantly , with the penetration which only the greatest possess , and with that under - standing of human nature which endures as fame .

		To say that a thing has been done `` once and for all '' has always seemed an amusing utter - ance in a world where nothing is permanent except change .

		There is nothing irreverent in imagining a better novel than ``
Richard Fev	PERSON	- erel , '' nothing particularly daring in hoping that the `` parent problem '' will be presented in an even more universal manner .

		Yet so long as that masterpiece exists and is read , younger nov - elists , if they handle the same situation , will have to submit to a devastating comparison .

		And by the same situation can only be meant , of course , a similar situation .

		This is what
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	has done in `` The Green Mirror . ''

		He has written , at great length and with profuse wordiness , the story of a self - satisfied , smug English family , of their inherent inability to admit the intrusion of a `` stranger , '' of the actual intrusion of a genuinely undesirable stranger a stranger with a `` past '' and of the effects upon this family .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's most irritating fault is his adherence to the court reporter 's method of observing and recording .

		This is the fault of many of the contemporary novelists .

		It is their belief , apparently , that the mere writing down of lists of things , whether dishes of food , toilet articles on the heroine 's dressing-table , books and objets d'art on the drawing-room tables , or the furnishings of a room , constitutes vivid literature .

		Maybe they feel that this is reality .

		But the effect upon the reader of such cataloguing as this is possibly not always what the author intended : Further away in the middle of a clear space was a table with a muddle of things upon it a doll half - clothed , a writing-case , a silver inkstand , photographs of
Millie	LOCATION	,
Henry	PERSON	, and
Katherine	PERSON	, a little younger than they were now , a square silver clock , a pile of socks with a needle sticking sharply out of them , a little oak book-case with `` Keble 's Christian Year , ''
Charlotte Yonge	PERSON	's `` Pillars of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' two volumes of
Bishop Westcott	PERSON	's `` Sermons , '' and Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's `` Wives and Daughters . ''

		There was also a little brass tray with a silver thimble , tortoiseshell paper - knife , a little mat made of bright-colored beads , a reel of red silk , and a tiny pocket calendar .

		Beside the bed there was a small oaken table with a fine silver Crucifix and a
Bible	LOCATION	and a prayer book and a copy of `` Before the Throne '' in dark blue leather .

		In this one description there are still two more paragraphs of things listed in just the same way and there are perhaps hundreds of similar pas - sages .

		For example , after a statement which reminds one of the cook-book ``
Sunday	DATE	supper should be surely a meal very hot and very quickly over '' we are regaled with the following bill of fare : A tremendous piece of cold roast beef was in front of Mrs.
Trenchard	PERSON	; in front of
Henry	LOCATION	there were two cold chickens .

		There was a salad in a huge glass dish , it looked very cold indeed .

		There was a smaller glass dish with beetroot .

		There was a large apple-tart , a white blancmange , with little `` dobs '' of raspberry jam round the side of the dish .

		There was a plate of stiff and unfriendly celery item a gorgonzola cheese , item a family of little woolly biscuits , clustered to - gether for warmth , item a large `` bought '' cake that had not been cut yet and was grimly determined that it never should be , item what was known as `` Toasted Water '' -LRB- a grim family mixture of no colour and a faded , melancholy taste -RRB- in a vast jug , item , silver , white table-cloth , napkin-rings quite without end .

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	If this be literature give me death .

		And so it goes with the whole book , not only with things but with emotions , conversations , meals , the details of nature , everything .

		There is no abso - lute law that says things must not be listed , but there is a demand on the part of the reader that if things come in they must mean something in the mosaic the author is constructing .

		This is not the case with `` The Green Mirror . ''

		There are 416 pages , of which it is not bold or unkind to say that 100 might be eliminated by the wel - come reduction of mere lists .

		Psychological details , at best the most fasci - nating development in the modern novel , become under this method little more than mere statis - tics .

		If you chance upon a chapter headed `` Katherine , '' you may be sure that somewhere early in that chapter there will be pages of lists , giving all the emotions
Katherine	PERSON	has had since childhood , and in such flat continuity as to deaden the liveliest interest .

		This is mechan - ical writing , and the most vital human beings , composing a situation of intense interest , are slowly crushed in the machine .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's characters are the losers .

		Externally you know everything about them , spiritually almost noth - ing .

		It is not that he does not let them think and feel before you ; they are at it most of the time .

		But you never get really into them .

		You are always moving around and about them , watching them , observing and wondering , but caring not a whit what their fate may be .

		This is because their creator did no selecting , no con - centrating .

		With your friends in real life there are ways and means of ignoring or escaping those characteristics found annoying .

		With Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- pole 's people you must endure everything .

		The total result of this manner of writing is to produce a story without concentration , a story that wearies the reader in spite of his feeling that the author is earnest and interested in his people .

		When it is possible to skip whole pages without loss , there is something wrong ; when there is the desire to skip , even the good qualities are in danger .

		That desire is unquestionably provoked by
Walpole	LOCATION	's novel .

		After you have read five or half a dozen conversations that echo the dicta - phone , there is an impulse to shy at quotation marks .

		Later you openly balk .

		No amount of hoping or arguing that all this may be necessary atmosphere does any good ; the author himself convinces you that he is `` writing , '' and that he is going to write , come what may .

		B. I. KlNNE .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS ANNE PEDERSDOTTER .

		A drama in four acts .

		By
H. Wiers-Jenssen	PERSON	.

		English ver - sion by
John Masefield	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		In the theatre , familiarity breeds not contempt but interest , and old , popular dramatic themes , treated in quite the orthodox manner , have often won extravagant contemporary praise for medi - ocre playwrights .

		On the other hand , more than one great dramatist who has dared to handle traditional material in his own way has won harsh adverse criticism even from those who should be the first to welcome dramatic original - ity .

		For nothing demands of a dramatist such robust originality as a new treatment of old material ; yet his very strength is his handicap , since nothing is so disconcerting to an audience as to see from a new point of view a character , a plot , or a setting which it knows well .

		Even the intelligent audiences of Mr.
Ames	PERSON	's Little Theatre could not reconcile the tremendous originalities of ``
Anne Pedersdotter	PERSON	'' to their nat - ural expectations .

		The first production in Amer - ica was not a popular success ; but it is strange that publication in book form has not brought this remarkable play deserved recognition .

		Mr.
Wiers-Jenssen	PERSON	's conception of a sympa - thetic psychological study of the tragedy of witchcraft was a boldly original idea , but he has even more tellingly proved his powers by build - ing his play almost wholly out of old materials .

		His action-plot , the love of a young wife -LRB-
Anne Pedersdotter	PERSON	-RRB- for her step-son -LRB-
Martin	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , was a favorite story of the medieval chronicle plays long before
Racine	LOCATION	wrote `` Phedre . ''

		Several of his lesser characters notably the drunken cler - ical colleagues of
Anne	PERSON	's husband , his old mother , and her servants are perilously typical figures .

		The realistic dialogue and modern motivation in a play of the sixteenth century , which so baf - fled our newspaper critics , is no `` startling nov - elty '' in
Denmark	LOCATION	, where
Strindberg	LOCATION	's historical dramas are widely known .

		Even the psycholog - ical analysis of the strong , repeated suggestion that she has inherited the evil powers of witch - craft from her mother , by which
Anne	PERSON	is first thrown into the arms of her lover and finally becomes convinced that she is truly a witch , is not an original explanation .

		The Danish play - wright could hardly have known
Barrett Wen	PERSON	-
dell	ORGANIZATION	's illuminating essay on the witches of Salem , but the hypnotic power of public opinion , sup - ported by unlucky coincidences , has been a popu - lar dramatic theme since Ibsen a theme that Brieux ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and
Echegaray	PERSON	have all effectively employed .

		Mr.
Wiers-Jenssen	PERSON	has used all these familiar materials finely to his own purpose and ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 201 aided by a masterly technique , has given us a great character , his heroine .

		For centuries witches have appeared on the stage in comedy and in tragedy , surrounded always by an elaborate machinery of the super - natural especially designed to render them un-human .

		But
Anne Pedersdotter	PERSON	is a living human being .

		She is a woman first and a witch only incidentally in fact , even at the end , when she confesses herself a witch , she is supremely a woman , a woman cheated in love by her mar - riage , tricked to give herself to a love which did not stand the test , for it is
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's suspicion that she has seduced him by witchcraft that makes inevitable for her her self-conviction .

		In a plot so unsympathetic , to have won our sym - pathy for
Anne Pedersdotter	PERSON	with no appeal to sentimentality is a fine artistic accomplishment ; to have made her a very real human being and yet to make us feel the eerie powers of the medi - eval Satan is a rare triumph of dramatic skill .

		THE FOOD PROBLEM .

		By
Vernon Kellogg	PERSON	and
Alonzo E. Taylor	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Most of us have thus far felt the pressure of war chiefly through war 's interference with certain favorite habits of diet .

		Cooperating cheerfully with the
Food Administration	ORGANIZATION	, the average citizen is still somewhat mystified as to just why he is urged to eat more of this and less of that , and dubious as to what effect , if any , his individual sacrifice may have towards win - ning the war .

		Both authors of `` The Food Prob - lem '' are members of the
United States Food Administration	ORGANIZATION	and well equipped to answer his questions .

		Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	is a member of the
Commission for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in
Belgium	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Tay	PERSON	- lor has made a special study of the food situation in
Germany	LOCATION	and was attached to
Col. House	ORGANIZATION	's party at the recent
Paris Conference of the Allies	ORGANIZATION	.

		The record of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	's mistakes in attempting to control and save food ought to keep us from trying those methods which have already been proved unsuc - cessful .

		In the regulation of public eating places in
London	LOCATION	, for instance , there was tried out a plan for the limitation of courses , which permit - ted only two courses , or their equivalent , to be served at lunch , and three courses at dinner .

		With half courses one might assemble a menu which would be safely within the letter of the law and away outside its intention .

		Since the result of this order was a heavy increase in the consumption of meat and staples , instead of the hoped for reduction , it was shortly revoked .


Germany	LOCATION	's experience has elements of special interest , in view of the scientific care which be - forehand she devoted to preparing for the emer - gency .

		The defect in the prearranged plan , it appears , was the characteristic Prussian failure to allow for the human equation .

		The German peasant did not cooperate as wholeheartedly as had been expected in carrying out the govern - ment orders to reduce his herds to the number that could be kept on domestic feed , and to reserve all wheat and rye for human consump - tion .

		The government was not able to secure the `` equitable distribution of food stuff throughout all classes of society ... because the producer class consumed more than their pro rata ... diverted a portion of the food stuffs to the feed - ing of domesticated animals and sold to the well to do classes in disregard of the regulations ... That the restrictions in the diet ... have fallen almost entirely upon the industrial workers of the cities is fully realized by the industrial classes and represents a casus belli between them and the agrarians that will be the occasion of bitter political contests after the war . ''


Germany	LOCATION	has succeeded in keeping down the price of bread and sugar by the appropriation of state funds to cover the actual extra cost , and the milk supply has been reserved for the use of the children .

		The important part psychology plays in nutri - tion is revealed by a study of the dietary habits of different nations and classes .

		The German housewife , deprived of milk and cooking fats , can not make things `` taste good '' and the result is a diet which is unsatisfying even when it is scientifically balanced and adequate in calories and protein .

		In
France	LOCATION	practically all of the bread is purchased from the baker and must be such as to keep well , whereas in the
United States	LOCATION	more than half is baked at home ; it is conse - quently easier for us here to combine other grains with wheat in the making of quick breads which need not keep so long .

		The importance of table beverages and of a sufficient amount of fats in the diet of the working classes is emphasized as a means of avoiding those conditions of unrest which are certain to arise in our large cities if the diet is not satisfying .

		The technology of food use is discussed in relation to four factors : `` the psychology of nutrition , the psychology of alimentation , the supply of food stuffs , and the influence of trade . ''

		There is included a brief statement of the essentials of dietetics which will be appreciated by the unprofessional reader .

		It is made clear that the food problem is not a condition which will disappear with the ending of the war that the war has made it an inter - national problem which will demand our coop - eration for many years to come .

		The book 's only defect is in its tendency to overstate the difficul - ties of the food situation in order to emphasize the necessity for drastic reduction in certain types of consumption .

		But this is a forgivable propa - gandist accent at a time when we are witnessing an approach to something like a world famine .

		202 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	PORTRAITS AND BACKGROUNDS .

		By
Evan	PERSON	- geline
Wilbour Blashfield	PERSON	.


Scribners	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		For most readers the interest in Mrs.
Blash	PERSON	- field 's new book will centre in the initial study of
Hrotsvitha	LOCATION	, the playwriting Benedictine nun of Gandersheim in the tenth century and particularly in that part of it dealing with her play `` Paphnutius , '' which is the source of
Anatole France	LOCATION	's `` Thais . ''

		Curiously enough
M. France	PERSON	has never acknowledged his indebt - edness in this instance , though usually by no means averse to making a display of his erudi - tion .

		How great the indebtedness is may be judged from a comparison of the situations and characters in `` Thais '' with those of the original play , from which copious extracts are given by the author of this book .

		They reveal only one notable change ; namely , the transformation of the holy hermit ,
St. Paphnutius	LOCATION	, into an `` eroto - maniac . ''

		`` It seems curious , '' comments Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	, `` that a lover and writer of history like M.
France	LOCATION	should feel justified in smirch - ing the reputation of an irreproachable saint , to whom many churches and monasteries are dedi - cated , and whose intercession is daily sought by thousands of
Eastern Christians	ORGANIZATION	.

		M.
France	LOCATION	would have hesitated to take away the character of a French saint , or one nearer home .

		But
St. Paphnutius	ORGANIZATION	is an Egyptian ; like ` Punch 's ' collier
M. France	LOCATION	has no hesitation in `` caving ` arf a brick at a stranger . ' ''

		Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	who , in our opinion , makes too much of the matter apparently forgets the storm of protest aroused by the same author 's `` Jeanne d'Arc '' !

		More interesting is the question , renewed by her , whether the body of a holy woman named Thais , discovered by
M. Albert Gayet	PERSON	in the Christian necropolis of Antinoe in
Lower Egypt	LOCATION	, is actu - ally that of the Thais of history and of fiction .

		The archaeologist himself refuses either to affirm or to deny , and Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	offers a very complete resume of the evidence on both sides : Although the costume of Thais is not that of a recluse , yet the position of the tomb , which was found in the midst of the cemetery , surrounded by sepulchres of the fourth century ; the inscription on its wall , `` Here reposes the blessed Thais '' ; and the articles found with the body favor the hypothesis that in the
Musee Guimet	LOCATION	lies the blackened husk of the bewitching mime who inflamed the youth of
Alexandria	LOCATION	, listened to the preaching of Paphnutius , burned her treasures , and followed the hermit into the Thebaid to save her soul .

		Those who would play the devil 's advocate and unsaint this poor shell argue that the dress the coquettish wreath-like hood , borrowed from the roguish Tanagrian Loves , the rich-toned draperies that warm the eye like the tints of sun-soaked nectarines is that of a child of the world , provoking rather than repelling glances - To this objection
M. Gayet	PERSON	replies that saints who passed their lives in sordid rags were often buried in rich clothing and hoarded their festal garments to enter the Presence bravely ; quoting the words of
St. Macarius of Thebais	ORGANIZATION	, who when sum - moned before the governor of Antinoe was advised by his disciples to change his tattered tunic for a more decent habit and who answered : `` I am keeping my new robe to appear before my Saviour . ''

		In a remote Nitrian convent the adventurous traveller is shown today the body of tHe `` Holy Maximus , '' son of the Emperor Valentinian , clothed in purple and gold tis - sue , the costume of an imperial prince , though Maxi - mus , who fled the court and became a monk , wore during his lifetime the coarse brown garb of his fel - lows .

		The richness and beauty of a secular dress , there - fore , prove nothing against the asceticism or sanc - tity of the wearer : That of Thais may have been the `` glorious habit '' of pious legend , which every Christian tried to pro- vide for his triumph in death over the sorrows and snares of life ; it may have been the garments which the penitent wore when she received the favor of heaven through
St. Paphnutius	LOCATION	, and bade farewell to the theatre and her mourning lovers .

		There is no mundus muliebris buried with this Thais ; no mirror , no jars of nard or stibium , no lute or embroidery frame ; hers is the funeral baggage of the eremite .

		The chaplet , the cross still recalling in form the ankh of the Egyptians found by the side of the body ; the rose of
Jericho	LOCATION	, symbol of resurrection , held between the skeleton fingers ; the basket and goblet case of woven palm fibres to contain the Sacrament , which the Oriental Christians buried with the dead ; the palm branches , martyrs ' attributes , in which she lies as in a nest of verdure , all testify to the exceptional holi - ness of the `` blessed Thais '' of Antinoe and impart to her sepulchre a distinctly religious character , dif - ferentiating it from the other tombs of the same necropolis .

		In any case , without attaching undue importance to it , the `` find '' of
M. Gayet	PERSON	lends vitality to the legend of the courtesan-saint , and provides cos - tume and properties for the winning figure of the repentant actress .

		The three other studies in Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	's book deal respectively with
Aphra Behn	PERSON	, the nov - elist and playwright of the Restoration ; Ai ` sse , the Circassian girl who loved and suffered in
France	LOCATION	under the
Regency	LOCATION	; and Rosalba Car - riera , the Venetian miniaturist and pastellist of the eighteenth century .

		THE LAND WHERE THE SUNSETS Go .

		By
Orville H. Leonard	PERSON	.

		Sherman , French ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		`` Granted that they did not find the riches of which they had been told , they found a place in which to search for them . ''

		Such is
Castaneda	PERSON	's characterization of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	in his stately and spirited history of
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	's search for the
Seven Cities	ORGANIZATION	, written nearly four hundred years ago .

		For the reviewer the world is divided into two great classes : the class of those whose view of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	is like that of the traveler on the
Santa Fe	LOCATION	whom someone noticed looking rapidly from side to side of the observation platform and remarking in a dreary , bored tone , `` As far as the eye can see nothing nothing , '' and the class of those for whom the great plateaus , their mesas and cuestas and arroyos , their cave-cliffs and canons , painted
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 deserts and sand-blown trails , their wild Spanish - American and Indian history are , as for Coro - nado 's companions , a place in which to search for riches .

		To that enchanted place `` The Land Where the Sunsets Go '' will convey the interested reader .

		The book will be prized by lovers of the
South	LOCATION	- west for its power of evoking her wide-lined landscape , her brilliant , inexpressible , changing colors and storied human scene of failure and success especially her tale of successes of the spirit .

		The prose sketches of the collection excel in precision and originality the contributions in verse .

		Beautiful is the impression of the terrible Devil 's Gate , its narrow , steep , dangerous road , where wagon-hubs almost graze the sides of the sheer high rock-walls and `` for a little while at noon a sword flash drops down from the sun to cut the gloom , then all is purple-dark again . ''

		Yes , the book tells you of a place where riches may be sought , and gives you something better than a treasure trove , a treasure yet to find , some - thing lost behind the ranges .

		SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYHOUSES .

		By
Joseph Quincy Adams	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		It is rather surprising that nobody else has recently tried to do what Professor
Adams	PERSON	has here so well done ; probably scholars have not realized how rich the harvest could be .

		But since
Fleay	PERSON	's `` Chronicle History , ''
1890	DATE	, unsound and self-contradictory in so many of its particu - lars , and
Ordish	ORGANIZATION	's `` Early
London	LOCATION	Theatres in the Fields , ''
1894	DATE	, incomplete by intention , this field has been left almost unworked in any com - prehensive way .

		But in these twenty or more years , much new material has been discovered , especially by Professor
Charles W. Wallace	PERSON	, and it is of this material that Professor
Adams	PERSON	has made particularly good use .

		What he has sought to do is to give a chronological account of each of the playhouses of Pre-Restoration
London	LOCATION	, its erection , the principal events in its history , and its final disposition .

		So far as his material per - mits , Professor
Adams	PERSON	describes the structure of each theatre , its business management , the com - panies that occupied it , and its location , for the last point making effective use of the various contemporary views and maps of old
London	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	's principal original contribution is the identification of certain sketches of
Inigo Jones	PERSON	's as plans for the Cockpit-in-Court , built in
1632	DATE	or
1633	DATE	, at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, of the existence of which scholars have not previously known .

		But every chapter shows more or less important fresh conclusions based on a careful study of the sources .

		Scholars will find the book invaluable for its accuracy and comprehensiveness ; the reader whose interest in literary history is less professional , will enjoy its picture of a fascinating circle in
London	LOCATION	life .

		The book is richly supplied with well-chosen maps and views of
London	LOCATION	, and has an index and very complete bibliography .

		THE CLIMAX OF CIVILIZATION .

		SOCIALISM .

		FEMINISM .

		By
Correa Moylan Walsh	PERSON	.

		Sturgis and
Walton	PERSON	; the three ,
$ 4.50	MONEY	.

		An interesting and curious , though not con - sistently dependable , example of modern pessim - ism is this work in three connected volumes .

		The first develops a cyclical theory of civiliza - tion and decay , maintaining that we have reached a position near the climax and apparently that we are destined to inevitable decay .

		There are two great groups of causes of decay the mate - rial , and the moral or social .

		The material causes derive from the exhaustion of the natural resources from which we draw our wealth ; the moral causes , from the degeneration produced by an excess of wealth among the leaders of civili - zation and the struggle of the masses for equal - ity without merit to justify their pretensions .

		The masses are aroused by the evils which afflict them as the result of corruption at the top and by the growing restriction which the depletion of our resources imposes upon an over-expanded consumption .

		Their mistake is in aiming at a part in the spoils without making a compensating contribution .

		The most conspicuous signs of this present-day moral decay , so far as the struggle for specious equality is concerned , are to be found in the movements known as socialism and feminism .

		Each is , according to the author , individualistic and anti-social , struggling merely for the satis - faction of the parties concerned without an understanding of either the foundations of so - ciety or of the necessity for a cooperative con - tribution to social welfare .

		The author 's chief abomination is the tendency among many he would say most socialists and feminists to dis - pense with the family as an antiquated institu - tion enforced by superstition and repugnant to the modern desire for maximum enjoyment with - out social responsibility .

		The author 's reading has been very extensive , but his patent prejudices such as his assumption of the native mental inferiority of women have often prevented him from presenting a clear and well balanced inter - pretation of the two movements to which he devotes his attention .

		In spite of the fact that he hits tellingly upon some of their major weak - nesses , he signally fails to grasp the highly social and idealistic aims back of both socialism and feminism in their best expression .

		To ignore these disqualifies him as a competent critic .

		204 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	MEMORIES DISCREET AND INDISCREET .

		By a
Woman of No Importance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dutton ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		Someone has said that it is necessary to be indiscreet to be interesting , but the anonymous writer of `` Memories Discreet and Indiscreet '' manages to interest without fulfilling the prom - ise of the last word of her book 's title .

		In spite of the fact that she devotes a large part of her fat volume to dull and garrulous gossip about people whose names , to the average American at least , have no significance whatever , she offers what must be regarded as a distinct contribution to contemporary history .

		The book is rich in intimate glimpses of such personages as
Garibaldi	LOCATION	,
Parnell	PERSON	, De Lesseps ,
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	,
Lord Roberts	PERSON	,
Lord Kitchener	LOCATION	, Sir laan
Hamilton	PERSON	, and a dozen or so others royalties and smaller fry whose names are already historic .

		It affords , in addi - tion , `` inside '' gossip concerning certain famous British campaigns in the
East	LOCATION	.

		But its chief value lies , not so much in its `` close-ups '' of the great or its analysis of past events , as in a pano - rama , not altogether flattering but certainly faithful in detail , of the English haut monde .

		The manners revealed are probably already the manners of a past age -LRB- the war will have seen to that -RRB- but the revelation has a very present interest .

		The student of history , of society , of politics , and the dilettante in the curious ways of humanity as well , can find much that is sig - nificant in what the writer says of other people and , more or less unwittingly , of herself .

		WELFARE WORK .

		By
E. Dorothea Proud	PERSON	, with an introduction by
Lloyd George	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		An Australian by birth and nurture goes to
England	LOCATION	to study and makes her return con - tribution in the form of this volume .

		Evidently she takes the capitalistic state as a permanent fact , and her effort therefore is not toward re - placing it with a more ideal social order but toward making it as workable as possible for those who live in it .

		Welfare work is one of these means .

		Despite the workers ' distrust of welfare work , the author finds in its proper development the key to the promotion of the workers ' best interests .

		She frankly recognizes its paternalistic character possibly believing that the worker has not yet developed sufficient intellectual and political initiative to advance alone and seeks to direct this in the best pos - sible channels .

		Her study of welfare work in
England	LOCATION	shows many signs of reasonable thoroughness , so far as an analysis of the best examples is concerned .

		It certainly is to be doubted whether she sees equally clearly its un - favorable aspects under less ideal conditions .

		Nor can one help wondering whether she has not overrated the altruistic initiative of the manufacturer in promoting beneficent factory legislation in the past .

		To the manufacturer , rather than to the worker , she now turns for the development of normal working-conditions in the factory and in the factory-worker 's home .

		To her the welfare worker is what he should be the institution 's social secretary .

		But as inspector , disciplinarian , employing agent , timekeeper , res - taurant-manager , recreational director , and a score of other things which quite hopelessly combine service to master and servant , how can he be considered the friend of both in a capital - istic system of industry , when the system is a battle field ?

		Yet in the best-managed factories he is just that .

		The author believes that under proper conditions he may be such in all .

		The worker believes he can not , preferring the free - dom and errors of democracy in industry to efficiency with mistrust of industrial paternalism .

		We shall not attempt to settle the question at issue , preferring to leave it to the reader , but we commend the book both for its information and because it is so well written .

		PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY OF VITAL PHENOM -
ENA	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
J. F. McClendon	PERSON	.


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This is a compendium of biochemistry for the use of students and investigators in the biological and medical sciences .

		It is the outgrowth , pri - marily , of instruction of medical students in this relatively new and rapidly developing field on the frontier of biology .

		It deals with the efforts to interpret the processes of life in the terms of the physicist and chemist .

		From the study of the decomposition products of once living cells and from the analysis of the exchanges which such cells make with matter and energy of their en - vironment , the investigator seeks to determine the actual composition of the living cell and to describe the changes which go on within its sub - stance during its functional activity .

		Hence we find here discussions of ionic concentrations , os - motic pressure , electrolytic dissociation , surface tension , absorption , colloids , enzyme action , per - meability , polarization , anaesthesia , amoeboid motion , and many other topics which reflect the triumphs or propose the hypotheses of those who attack the problems of physiology with the weap - ons of the physical chemist .

		A terse , almost tele - graphic , style leaves the reader at times to supply his own transitions and detect relations of the disjunct items .

		The specialist , who needs none of these aids to comprehension , finds here a com - pact and suggestive array of fact and theory , annotated to indicate both the territories of ex - ception or debate and the fields for further in - quiry .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 205 NOTES ON NEW FICTION It is Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's purpose in `` The White Morning '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		to show that assistance to the Allies may come almost any day from the German women themselves , rising in rebellion against the government .

		For in the years before the war , when women 's personal liberty had been ignored by the autocratic heads of German households , a growing distaste for marriage had been aroused in the women of the empire .

		Now , according to Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	, as soon as the fun - damental truth that they have been waging neither a defensive nor a victorious war pene - trates to the German women , they will , `` driven to desperation by suffering and privation and disillusion , '' suddenly `` arise and overthrow the dynasty . ''

		The republic which they will then set up can be depended upon to put an instant end to the war and to conclude a fair peace .

		This is demonstrable perhaps as a thesis .

		It is regrettable , however , that `` The White Morn - ing '' resembles a thesis more than it does a novel , especially in its brevity , its rather gaunt , undis - tinguished style , and its logical impersonality .

		Whether the prophecy is sound or not and a cogent note appended to the novel by Mrs. Ath - erton makes it at least seem plausible the reader is not moved by the story itself .

		One can under - stand the author 's impatience to put into circu - lation an original and encouraging notion like this ; yet the fact remains that the growth of a great popular movement with the depth and breadth of the French Revolution is reported in a slender novel of 174 pages .

		To attempt within these limits to depict even a few chosen charac - ters and to imply their participation in such a revolution , almost dooms a writer to give his story that cursory hearsay accent of the twice told tale of colloquial narration .

		Evident marks of a too zealous haste mar the book .

		`` I have been asked , '' states the author , `` to set forth my authority for writing ` The White Morning ' ; in other words , for daring to believe that a revolution conceived and engineered by women is possible in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Mrs.
Ather	PERSON	- ton explains that her authority is based on what she had an opportunity for observing during a seven years ' residence in
Munich	LOCATION	.

		There she saw what seemed to be a pretty general dis - content with marriage on the part of women of the intellectual class .

		The idea of its growing into a definite rebellion was Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's own , although since the novel was begun con - firmation of the possibility has come in two arti - cles published in this country , one by Mr.
A. C. Roth	PERSON	, ex-consul in
Plauen	LOCATION	, and another by
Herr J. Koetiggen	PERSON	, a refugee from
Germany	LOCATION	whose article appeared in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Chronicle '' in
November	DATE	.

		No one can question the sincerity of Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's prophecy propaganda , for obvious reasons , it can not be .

		It is clearly one of several good guesses as to what is just now in
Pandora	LOCATION	's box
Germany	LOCATION	.

		More than one writer has also laid claim to a private peep .

		And our hope is father to the thought that Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	may be correct in her surmise .

		The angels of
Mons	LOCATION	might testify that in `` The Terror '' -LRB- McBride ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB-
Arthur Ma	PERSON	- chen knows how to play with states of mind , especially credulity .

		In this case he has added to credulity , horror .

		He mentions one dreadful event after another in an offhand manner mur - ders and sudden death in a war-swept and terror - ized
England	LOCATION	.

		Each one he orients with the matter-of-fact exactitude of newspaper narration .

		He reports suspicions and surmises about these horrors , even to the conversation of bores .

		He goes so far as to gag the British press on the subject , this being one of the most realistic touches in the book .

		He pretends himself to be humbly ignorant ; he can not account for the mys - terious horror that has descended on the land .

		All this is to sustain the mood .

		A few charac - ters are sketched in to enrich the picture .

		For those who love mystery and that titillation of the emotions that comes of something dreadful about to be explained , who have , too , some crav - ing for the lurid as it is to be found in good description of crime and sudden death , `` The Terror '' will have fascination .

		Its imaginative quality halfway between the exaggeration of gossip and the extravagance of tradition gives it its slight value .

		But it remains a sketch , an exercise in evoking horror , which is so well done as to leave nothing to be said in its favor .

		`` Four Days , '' by
Hetty Hemenway	PERSON	-LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	; 50 cts . -RRB-

		, is yet another record of the intensity which these years of war have brought a record of a snatched bit of honeymoon , a torn uniform , a few poignant days of sunshine , the bitter brevity of the parting .

		Originally published as a short story in the ``
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' it does not , in book form , wholly justify the striking impression that it first made .

		In other words , although clear and coherent and tragic , it is not the type of story that gains by re-reading .


Cecil Sommers	PERSON	's `` Temporary Heroes '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a series of letters from the front during a period of eighteen months , is notable for two things : the letters are readable ; and , though probably true , they are not horrible .

		One suspects the author of indulging a proclivity for amusing description , but at the expense merely of time .

		Surely in the rush of horrors there should be appreciation for this light-hearted chronicle of the trenches .

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 28	DATE	CASUAL COMMENT FOR PRINTING A POEM in place of a leading article there is no precedent in the history of THE DIAL , but in so doing the publisher feels that he is living up to his declared editorial pol - icy : `` to try to meet the challenge of the new time by reflecting and interpreting its spirit a spirit freely experimental , skeptical of inher - ited values , ready to examine old dogmas and to submit afresh its sanctions to the test of expe - rience . ''

		The publisher believes that `` The Young World '' is of the utmost significance at the present time in that it gives so vivid an expression to a spirit which many of us already see emerging from the war conflict , the spirit of internationalism .

		There are rumors on every side of spiritual awakening ... even we in
America	LOCATION	have not been unmoved .

		In such crises the poet is the truest prophet .

		In this connec - tion it is interesting to quote
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	, who says in his recently published `` The Sub - stance of Gothic '' : `` Unless there is behind him -LSB- the artist -RSB- a communal self-consciousness , unless the air is quick with the impulses and desires of a whole people eager for the expression of their own spiritual experiences and emotions ... then the art of the individual , however great he may be , is a fond thing , vainly imagined , and no part of any life save only his own . ''

		It is not too soon even now to anticipate this social self - consciousness which the war will bring to
America	LOCATION	.

		Once that consciousness has become articulate , it will be served only by those who move unflinchingly forward toward the future .

		A SANE WARTIME ECONOMY is urged by the `` Publishers ' Weekly '' in its recent summary of the
1917	DATE	book field .

		Now is the time , says the editor , to resist the fetish of the new book Sharper and sharper competition in the produc - tion of novelties has brought the bookseller to the point where `` he dares not order all that a new book might warrant for fear that a newer book will take the wind out of its sales before his counters are cleared . ''

		The publisher , too , can scarcely `` give each new title a push '' into the hazardous world before he must father its successor .

		And the reader , it should be added , is increasingly harassed by the fear that if for a moment he relax vigilance some deserving vol - ume , thus orphaned , may slip past him into obliv - ion .

		Such conditions , observes the `` Weekly , '' make the business of publishing -LRB- and of reading -RRB- one of `` continual speculation and waste . ''

		Now that production is somewhat reduced and fiction is selling less than non-fiction , so that time is less of the essence of the business , publishers have an opportunity to guide their children through the mischances of a life that need not be so brief .

		Let them `` carry on
1917	DATE	into
1918	DATE	'' and beyond ; let them distribute emphasis more impar - tially between the newer and the older members of their families ; in short , while they are making a market for today 's book let them remember to extend the market for the excellent book of yes - terday .

		The responsibility for this economy must rest upon the publishers ' advertising ; but its ben - efits would reach beyond the dealer and the publisher himself , in whom the `` Weekly '' is pro- fessionally interested , to every reader whose pleasure or profit interests him in the conserva - tion of good books .

		THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION has now prac - tically completed the first year of its erratic and thrilling progress .

		So speedily do we adapt our - selves today to new social conditions that already the autocratic
Russia	LOCATION	of romance and fiction seems something of the dim legendary past .

		For the historian and psychologist the sudden collapse of the older myths about
Russia	LOCATION	and the forma - tion of new ones must be a fascinating contem - porary record of how ideas and concepts about a nation are destroyed and remade .

		Very likely the immediate picture of
Russia	LOCATION	as a country torn to pieces by anarchy , violence , and fanatical ideas is as false to reality as the picture in the pop - ular melodramas of ten years ago .

		Even in peace-time it is not easy to get a cool , historical perspective ; in time of war , almost the attempt alone seems presumptuous .

		Yet it is an attempt worth making .

		For some sense of the movement of history would probably have checked us , at the beginning of the revolution , from indulging in too fantastic hopes for a speedy Russian Utopia , just as some sense of the movement of history would probably today check us from too great a despair at the current course of events .

		Let us remember that nations seldom die when they have the vitality for anarchy .

		THE REPORT ON RECONSTRUCTION after the war , prepared by the sub-committee of the British Labor party , is a document of remarkable elo - quence and vigor .

		Compared with this clear and courageous programme for a new social order , the tepid and rhetorical generalizations about the necessity for cooperation and burying the hatchet between capital and labor for the period of the war , which have emanated from
American Labor	ORGANIZATION	organizations , seem really pitiful .

		Is there no boldness , no intellectual back-bone , no social thinking in the leaders of
American Labor	ORGANIZATION	?

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 207 Could a passage like the following be found in any of their pronunciamentos ?

		It -LSB- the Labor party -RSB- calls for more warmth in poli - tics , for much less apathetic acquiesence in the miseries that exist , for none of the cynicism which saps the life of leisure .

		On the other hand , the Labor party has no beliefs in any of the problems of the world be - ing solved by good will alone .

		Good will without knowledge is warmth without light .

		Especially in all the complexities of politics , in the still undeveloped science of society , the Labor party stands for increased study , for the scientific investigation of each succeed - ing problem , for the deliberate organization of re - search , and for a much more rapid dissemination among the whole people of all the science that exists ... No labor party can hope to maintain its position un - less its proposals are , in fact , the outcome of the best political science of its time ; or to fulfil its pur - pose unless that science is continually wresting new fields from human ignorance .

		Obviously this passage was not written by a Welsh miner or a Liverpool dock-worker , and perhaps the clue to the discouraging feebleness and conventionality of the social vision of Amer - ican Labor lies ultimately in that simple fact .

		Between the British laborer and the intellectual man , the scientist , the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	or
Cambridge	LOCATION	rad - ical , the scholar like
Graham Wallas	PERSON	, the pub - licists like
Ramsey Macdonald	PERSON	and
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	, the patient investigator like
Sydney Webb	PERSON	, the mathematician and philosopher like
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, the artist and poet like
John Masefield	PERSON	, the popular novelist like
Wells	PERSON	, the satirist like
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	between men of this type and the British laborer there has always been a friendly rap - prochement .

		For example , the `` Home Univer - sity Library '' series , selling for a shilling a volume , brought art and science and history and religion to the humblest household .

		The men and women who wrote these books knew how to be popular without becoming patronizing ; they could be informative without also being dull .

		Since the nineties , too , it had been a kind of tra - dition for the young radical to join some wing of the Socialist party or the I. L. P .

		The lead - ers of the Labor party , although at first the mere business agents for selfish and snobbish crafts unions , came more and more to look to the lib - eral university men for guidance and help instead of regarding them suspiciously as the special pleaders for a privileged class .

		Socialism was a living theory then , not the doctrinaire rigidness of immigrants and the industrially exploited , as too often with us .

		British Labor leaders had less and less of our morbid fear of the `` high - brow . ''

		Even before the war there was the be - ginning of a genuine alliance between those who worked with their hands and those who worked with their brain .

		Since the war , accompanying the accelerating deliquescence of traditional Lib - eralism , the Labor party has grown not merely in political power and actual membership but in steadiness of purpose , in the power to think and plan constructively , in wise and temperedly rad - ical leadership .

		This programme for reconstruc - tion is the fine result of the growth and union of those enlightened and vital forces .

		It is the programme at last for a real democracy .

		NOW IF THIS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ALLIANCE between the intellectuals and the laborites in
England	LOCATION	has its obvious political and moral les - son for American trade-unionism , it has equally a lesson for the American professor .

		Not only must our own labor organizations `` go into poli - tics '' with a purpose and a programme and re - model their antiquated craft-unionism structure , but our own university men must make a more vigorous attempt to establish a real political and intellectual partnership with the leaders of or - ganized labor .

		The time is now ripe for the organization of some kind of non-exclusive La - bor party , with a touch of healthy opportunism in politics perhaps , yet with a definite , conscious programme .

		Such a party might utilize the brains of the Socialist party , the scientific help of the university men ; capitalize the discontent of the middle class ; get vitality and direction from the trade-unions .

		Already our professorial type tends more and more to the timid recluse , the jejune well-mannered and over-cultivated .

		Our Labor organizations still think mostly of the main chance for themselves , still regard politics as a game where clever bargainers know how to gain special legislative privileges .

		Our Socialists still shriek in impotent , dogmatic rage , garner - ing the votes of the miserable and the disinher - ited .

		Have we no leaders with the wisdom and ability to gather these forces together and focus them on a common democratic purpose ?

		THE INCORRIGIBLE ANTHOLOGIST , like the con - firmed toper , is never without plausible occasions for indulging his vice .

		Though the day of unblushing lists of `` the hundred best books '' now seems as remote as the day of the candid remark that passed between the governors of the

		How many of us escaped his lure ?

SL Jfortnigfttlp Journal of Criticism	ORGANIZATION	and SDi0cus0ion of Eitr taturr and tllfje fttt * Study of American Intolerance PART ONE : THE UNACKNOWLEDGED HISTORICAL BACKGROUND After we are through wringing our hands over our intolerance we shall still have to face the fact .

		We shall have to answer how it came about that a country which claims the highest development of democracy could at the same time be so crudely and often so savagely intolerant .

		We shall have to answer the unpleasant question of how mob rule , and the intel - lectual atmosphere that goes with it , should suddenly have become good form .

		For it is gravely doubtful if even the most optimistic of us can agree with
John Dew	PERSON	- ey 's amiable explanation .

		We can not , after all , be content with the idea that our democratic deterioration is merely part of that swift and widespread de-civiliza - tion which invariably accompanies all wars .

		Nor can we accept the barren con - solation which tells us that the evil is only apparent an excess of our youth and inexperience that somehow will make for our ultimate integration .

		First of all , too many invidious comparisons can be made with other belligerents , which , as Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	himself testifies , have shown con - siderably less bitterness and savagery than we .

		Furthermore , the historical evidence that intolerance is perhaps the most effec - tive agent of disintegration in a common - wealth is far too striking .

		We too easily recall that it was the disintegrative force of intolerance in European countries which helped to populate these shores .

		If our intolerance were merely an inci - dental unpleasantness of war-time , as too many of us like to imagine , the urgency for our understanding it would not be great .

		It is , however , a bad heritage and a menace for our future .

		We are dealing with something much more than the nor - mal intolerance to be expected in times of war .

		The problem is really a specific one to be treated in terms of the social and racial conditions that exist among us .

		Cer - tainly we shall miss an understanding of the situation if we regard it as merely a thing of today .

		The war has simply brought out what has long been latent .

		We are , of course , inclined to sentimen - talize .

		We like to look back romantically to the heyday of tolerance and free speech of the
New England	LOCATION	town meeting , con - veniently forgetting the social and reli - gious intolerance which tainted so much of our early history .

		Yet our past intol - erance never really mattered so much , because the issue could always be evaded .

		The ultimate test of tolerance does not come until people are compelled to live together in close and vital relations .

		The tolerance that is worth while is usu - ally found in mature and settled and fairly well populated communities where the geo - graphical evasion has become so difficult that it is no longer thought of except as a last resort .

		With us that was never the case .

		We were always free to move on if social conditions did not suit us ; or if we did not suit , we were told to move on .

		Just as the intolerance of
Europe	LOCATION	popu - lated our
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	seaboard in the first place , so our own intolerance progressively populated the country from the East to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		The history of our Westward movement is the history of people who moved on in order to be able to do what they pleased not only econom - ically but socially and in religion .

		Intol - erance is notoriously slow in teaching tolerance to the persecuted .

		In every new community the new schismatists moved on in turn .

		Tolerance did not become an issue with us until the country had filled up , until the wave turned east again .

		While this was taking place two social and racial factors entered into our national life which completely upset the natural development of tolerance .

		One was the aftermath of the Civil War and the other was the sudden large influx of diversely alien immigrants which began 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	during the seventies and the eighties of the last century .

		The first of these is the more fundamental , and to a great extent it explains the second .

		The Civil War gave us the negro problem , perhaps the great - est racial problem which any nation has ever had to face .

		Before the negro acquired a civic status he did not so much live with us as under us .

		But as soon as he entered our lives and made a bid for equality we began to develop the typical psychology of a superior race in intimate contact with an inferior one .

		This psy - chology is well known in every European settlement in the
Far East	LOCATION	and finds its most complete expression in the attitude towards the Eurasian on the part not only of the superior race but also of the inferior race which , of course , does not consider itself inferior .

		It is expressed in a general tightening up , a codification of the forms of social intercourse .

		Both races accept a number of social taboos to which they strictly adhere .

		There must not be too much intimacy or a too sympathetic ex - change of thoughts and emotions .

		The restraint falls most heavily upon all forms of social intercourse which might lead to an approach between the sexes .

		For this is , of course , the great danger point and represents the fear of absorption on the part of the superior race .

		That is why the Eurasian is treated as an outcast .

		It would be out of place here to discuss the ultimate sanction or necessity of such an attitude .

		Its effect upon tolerance , however , is unmistakable .

		The restraint imposed upon social and emotional rela - tions is bound to be extended to the intel - lectual sphere .

		Where men go about with a constant check-rein upon their spontane - ous social instincts the atmosphere can hardly be favorable to any intellectual exchange .

		New and vital thought upon religion , democracy , or philosophy is not likely to flourish in such a divided commu - nity .

		Religion and democracy will tend to exclude the inferior race , and philosophy will be perverted to justify the exclusion .

		Man will tend to become harsh and intol - erant because he is uneasy and unsure .

		It is not now difficult to see how these considerations apply to our negro prob - lem , reluctant as we may hitherto have been to admit the problem in this light .

		Indeed , we have been loath to see it at all and have put a taboo upon any discussion of it .

		Acute foreign observers have not failed to remark this reticence .

		They looked upon it as the blind spot in our social thinking .

		They accused us , if I may fall into the jargon of the new psychology , of having a negro complex .

		It was very difficult for us to see this because we were so hysterically unaware of it .

		Generally speaking , we do not think about the negro problem at all ; we merely relieve our feelings about it .

		Yet we can - not altogether fail to observe how it has tensed the whole South , imposed an incubus upon social progress there , and made for absolutism in morality .

		It is an attitude which has not failed to infect the North wherever similar conditions have arisen , and the South has much justification for its `` tu quoque . ''

		The emergence of the negro race problem thus marked the beginning of a new intolerance in this country just at the time when the fine spirit of forgive - ness which ended so disastrously with
Lin	PERSON	- coln 's death seemed about to inaugurate the development of a genuine tolerance in a community of united Americans .

		The second disturbing influence began almost before the first had been fully de - veloped .

		The influx of immigrants af - ter the Irish and the German tide , was at first scarcely noticed .

		A large part of them remained itinerant and roamed about the country in response to the call for labor , as in the case of the Italian railroad builders .

		Few of them were skilled laborers or commercially trained , so that they were not impelled to settle down at once in the cities , like the Ger - mans or the sociable Irish .

		It was only after they became part of the urban popu - lation and , either through raising their standard of living or becoming tools of the political machines , entered into the community life , that the situation grew more acute .

		A good many of these immi - grants maintained a lower standard of liv - ing than ours and presented differences of race , morals , and manners which a more intimate intercourse could not avoid bring - ing home to us .

		The alarm caused by our inability to assimilate the alien newcomer expressed itself in a movement to restrict immigration .

		We began to talk of `` the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 225 melting-pot , '' but contented ourselves with a metaphor whose aptness we never under - took to probe .

		And once more where we failed to face a problem our community feeling registered a change of attitude .

		We tensed ourselves again and moved more uneasily than before against a back - ground of explosive racial forces .

		For this attitude towards alien races may well be viewed as merely an extension of the psychology which the negro problem has bequeathed to us .

		Our hostility towards the foreigner was fostered by a comparison with the relations already existing towards a people in our midst , who were infinitely more alien to us than any immigrant , with the possible exception of the Oriental , could ever be .

		Our instinctively self-protective attitude towards the negro could thus be readily extended to any race differing from us .

		And the situation becomes infinitely more complicated in the case of the immi - grant .

		Our attitude towards the negro was largely instinctive and dealt with primitive racial fears .

		The difference between the two races was so great that there could never be anything approach - ing a direct comparison .

		It is otherwise with the immigrant .

		He often represents a different civilization , the inferiority of which is in many ways debatable .

		His coming represents a challenge .

		He finds himself in a country in which everything , formally at least , conforms to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	standard .

		With all his gift for adaptation he also exhibits a stubbornness which is not entirely to his discredit .

		This tendency to assert himself , or rather not to desert everything that is native in him , seeks out the weak spots in the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxon structure .

		The pressure he exerts is a criticism which , according to the per - fect melting-pot theory , ought to become a contribution .

		It does not always work out that way .

		Often it helps merely to increase the antagonism of the dominant classes , as one can easily ascertain by liv - ing in the atmosphere of a
New England	LOCATION	mill town where foreign immigration has replaced native labor .

		The attack which the immigrant was thus fated to make extends to law , to custom and manners , to the arts , to language from the most pro- saic to the most intangible things and expresses itself in constant modifications of unequal value .

		Sometimes , to take a special instance from law , our negro com - plex and the influence of alien races may combine to bring about a joint result .

		It is entirely plausible that the almost vested right of the South to kill negroes and the spread of crimes of passion among South Europeans have helped to establish our unwritten law , a development essentially foreign to Anglo-Saxon legal traditions .

		The whole process is one which the upholders of an entrenched tradition can - not view with equanimity , and their resist - ance must express itself in intolerance .

		Considerations such as these do not pre - tend to give a complete explanation of our intolerance .

		All wars breed intolerance and this one is no exception .

		A fuller treatment of the subject would require further discussion of those specific factors in the psychology of modern war which make for intolerance .

		But the point is that what I have called the normal intol - erance of war fell upon fertile ground .

		It could swell to such fanatical propor - tions only with the aid of a native intoler - ance already created by our complex social problems .

		A parallel puts the matter into simple terms .

		Just as the world war may be looked upon , from one psychological point of view , as a struggle for Anglo-Saxon prestige , so our domestic war of intoler - ance is really a struggle for prestige on the part of the dominant class in
America	LOCATION	which consciously and by inheritance is Anglo-Saxon .

		It is the integration issue in its most fundamental form , and the vehemence of its champions shows that they have instinctively recognized that fact .

		Their resentment and alarm look beyond the mere handful of disloyal Ger - man-Americans in our midst .

		Their feel - ing extends to all who in spirit or in race are alien to them .

		They crave a national identity which we have not yet attained and cry with an arrogance more divine than democratic that all who are not with them must be against them .

		We have thus a double war and a doubled intoler - ance .

		It is a task fit for the mettle of statesmen to prevent this war of intoler - ance from continuing among us long after the world war shall have ceased .

		ALFRED BOOTH KUTTNER .

		226 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	Letters to Unknown Women THE SLAVE IN CLEON ' To : `` One lyric woman , in her crocus vest . ''

		Helen the queen and Sappho the poet are `` unknown '' to us because their legends have been altered and overlaid by so many men of different personalities that we have difficulty in deciphering the true character from the additions .

		Like all very great people they have become what men wished them to be , and those who seek the truth about them must search for it among a thousand lies .

		But you are fresh , unal - tered by tradition , clear as on the day when the poet 's brain made you live for us .

		For all that , we know little about you ; save that you were beautiful , that you were white , that you were a slave sent by Protos the tyrant with a cup to Cleon the poet , that you were clothed in a crocus vest woven of sea-wools , and that for love you turned from the overwise poet to the young rower with `` the muscles all a ripple on his back . ''

		We know also that you lived some three and a half centuries after
Alexander	PERSON	.

		For the rest we must invent you .

		`` Protos in his tyranny '' can only have been some small potentate in
Lydia	LOCATION	or
Cappadocia	LOCATION	or some other inconsiderable semi-Asiatic state .

		We will make you a Lydian , half Greek , half Syrian , like the poet
Meleager	PERSON	, who lived during your lifetime .

		We can think of you as being half oriental , like Chryseis , but your name shall be pure
Greek Melitta	ORGANIZATION	.


Melitta	ORGANIZATION	, because you were beautiful men loved you .

		Protos , the king , sent you to the great poet as his choicest gift .

		Alas ,
Melitta	ORGANIZATION	, that kings no longer send such gifts to poets !

		You would be very un - happy in our world , more unhappy even than when
King Protos	PERSON	's ship carried you away from the lovers and friends you had in
Lydia	LOCATION	.

		But if we could recall you for a few hours from the grave , it would give us a pleasure unique and marvelous to hear from your lips what life was led in those days of the warm sunset of Hellas , to see in you what manner of loveliness it was that refined upon the beauty of
Cleon	ORGANIZATION	's youth .

		We do not pity you overmuch ,
Melitta	ORGANIZATION	, for being a slave ; we are all slaves in our day and unhappily we do not have philos - ophers as masters .

		We pardon Cleon the sin of owning you , being sure that a Greek would love beauty too much to do any - thing but honor it .

		We feel sure that you lived as happily as a woman may , with no extravagant desires or despairs , in that calm philosophy of hedonism we can not recapture , and that the gods loved you enough for you to die while you were still beautiful .

		We think of you as a child in
Lydia	LOCATION	, learning the art of beauty , being instructed in the modes of music , in the meaning of poetry , in the significance of form ; per - haps , even , you were not unacquainted with the sacred book of Elephantis .

		Me - litta , if you could but return to us and teach us something of what you knew , we would promise to distress you as little as possible by our uncouth ways and unre - fined manner of living !

		Then we think of you as a girl in the king 's palace , wearing your chiton and peplum folded like those we see in the little , painted figures from
Tanagra	LOCATION	, and with jewels `` heavy with weight of gold '' an Attic figure in the midst of eastern luxury .

		And as a young woman you cross the sea to the poet 's island , clothed in your crocus vest , and we see you most plainly at this moment standing wistfully upon the black and white pavement , gazing back at the sea , not heeding the fluttering of doves ' wings in the warm afternoon air .

		You can not conceive how vividly your beauty affects us , for in that world of beauty yours was not specially remarkable ; but we are so starved , so utterly alien to our time , that beside the memory of you the living women we know become as shadows .

		That is why we wish so yearn - ingly to bring you back from death to know if indeed the beauty we dream of did exist , to hear from you of your days and nights .

		We are curious about the life which Hellas lived in its wise autumn ; we have been told , it is true , by our stoics
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 227 to consider yours an age of decadence , but for all that we are anxious to know what manner of life it was in those days days which always seem to us golden with late afternoon sunlight , heavy with the scent of grapes and musical with slow fountains .

		Our wishes are unavailing ; we can not know whether you indeed realized our in - tense dream or whether you were merely a white courtesan with a trick of grace un - known to ours .

		Forgive us our scepticism ,
Melitta	ORGANIZATION	; like our own , yours was not an age of faith , but we will persuade our - selves that you were that loveliness we imagine , that you were that understanding we covet .

		The flowers of our land are alien to you , our rites for the dead maimed and full of promises which would terrify , not console , you but we strew wild roses and hill thyme upon your unknown grave , and may the dust of earth lie lightly upon your frail dust !

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.


John Barrymore	PERSON	' s
Ibbetson	PERSON	The vicissitudes of the young boy along the vague , precarious way , the longing to find the reality of the dream the heart that knew him best a study in sentimen - tality , the pathetic wanderings of a `` little boy lost '' in the dream of childhood , and the `` little boy found '' in the arms of his loved mother , with all those touches that are painful and all that are exquisite and poignant in their beauty such is the pic - ture presented by
John Barrymore	PERSON	, as nearly perfect as any artist can be , in ``
Peter Ibbetson	PERSON	. ''

		Certainly it is as fin - ished a creation in its sense of form , and of color , replete with a finesse of rare loveliness , as gratifying a performance , to my notion , as has been seen on our stage for many years .

		Perhaps if the author , recalling vain pasts , could realize the scum of saccharinity in which the play is utterly submerged , and that it struggles with great difficulty to survive the nesselrode - like sweetness with which it is surfeited , he would recognize the real distinction that Barrymore lends to a role so clogged by the honeyed sentimentality covering most of the scenes .

		Barrymore gives us that `` quickened sense '' of the life of the young man , a portrayal which takes the eye by `` its fine edge of light , '' a portrayal clear and cool , elevated to a fine loftiness in his rendering .

		The actor has accomplished this by means of a nice knowledge of what sym - bolic expression means to the art of the stage .

		He is certainly a painter of pic - tures and moods , the idea and his image perfectly commingled , endowing this medi - ocre play with true charm by the distinc - tion he lends it , by sheer discretion , and by a power of selection .

		All this he brings to a play which , if it had been written nowadays , would certainly have convicted its author , and justly too , of having writ - ten to stimulate the lachrymal effusions of the shop-girl , a play about which she might telephone her girl friend , at which she might eat bon bons , and powder her nose again for the street .

		No artist , no accepted artist , has given a more sugges - tive rendering than has Barrymore here .

		It would be difficult to say where he is at his best , except that the first half of the play counts for most in point of strength and opportunity .

		A tall frail young man , we find him , blanched with wonder and with awe at the perplexity of life , seeking a solution of things by means of the dream , as only the dreamer and the visionary can , lost from first to last , seemingly unloved in the ways boys think they want to be loved ; that is , the shy longing boy , afraid of all things , and mostly of himself , in the period just this side of sex revelation .

		He is the neo - phyte the homeless , pathetic
Peter	PERSON	, per - plexed with the strangeness of things real and temporal vision and memory count - ing for all there is of reality to him , with life itself a thing as yet untasted .

		Who shall forget -LRB- who has a love for real expression -RRB- the entrance of
Peter	PERSON	into the drawing-room of Mrs.
Deane	PERSON	, the pale flowery wisp of a boy walking as it were into a garden of pungent spices and herbs , and of actions so alien to his own ?

		We 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	are given at this moment the keynote of mastery in delicate suggestion , which never fails throughout the play , tedious as it is , overdrawn on the side of symbolism and mystical insinuation .

		One sits with difficulty through many of the moments , the literary quality of them is so wretched .

		They cloy the ear and the mind that has been made sensitive , desir - ing something of a finer type of stimula - tion .

		Barrymore has evoked , so we may call it , a cole method against a back - ground of what could have been over - heated acting or at least a superabundance of physical attack the warmth of the play 's tender sentimentalities ; yet he cov - ers them with a still spiritual ardor which is their very essence , extracting all the del - icate nuances and arranging them with a fine sense of proportion .

		It is as difficult an accomplishment for a man as one can imagine .

		For it is not given to many to act with this degree of whiteness , devoid of off colorings or alien tones .

		This per - formance of Barrymore in its spiritual richness , its elegance , finesse , and intelli - gence , has not been equaled for me since I saw the great geniuses
Paul Orleneff	PERSON	and
Eleonora Duse	PERSON	.

		It is to be at once observed that here is a keen pictorial mind , a mind which visu - alizes perfectly for itself the chiaroscuro aspects of the emotion , as well as the spir - itual , for Barrymore gives them with an almost unerring felicity , and rounds out the portrayal for the eye from point to point .

		It is a portrayal which in any other hands would suffer , but
Barrymore	PERSON	has the special power to feel the value of reticence in all good art , the need for complete sub - jection of personal enthusiasm to the force of ideas .

		His art is akin to the art of sil - ver-point , which , as is known , is an art of directness of touch , and final in the instant of execution , leaving no room whatever for accident or untoward excitement of nerve .

		We shall wait long for the silver sug - gestiveness such as Barrymore gives us when
Peter	PERSON	gets his first glimpse of
Mary	PERSON	,
Duchess of Towers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Who else could con - vey his realization of her beauty , and the quality of reminiscence that lingers about her , of the rapt amaze as he stands by the mantel-piece looking through the door into the space where he sees her in the midst of dancers under a crystal chande - lier somewhere not very distant ?

		Or the moment when he finds her bouquet neg - lected on the table in the drawing-room , with her lace shawl not far from his hands ?

		Or when he finds himself alone , pressing his lips into the depth of the flowers as the curtain gives the finale to the scene with the whispered `` 1 ` amour '' I These are moments of a real lyrist , and would match any line of
Banville	LOCATION	, of
Ron	PERSON	- sard , or of
Austin Dobson	PERSON	for delicacy of touch and feeling , for freshness , and for the precise spiritual gesture , the `` intona - tion '' of action requisite to relieve the moments from what might otherwise re - vert to commonplace sentimentality .

		Whatever the prejudice may be against all these emotions glace with sugary frost - ing , we feel that his art has brought them into being with an unmistakable gift or refinement coupled with superb style .

		How an artist like
Beardsley	PERSON	would have reveled in these moments is easy to con - jecture .

		For here is the quintessence of intellectualized aquarelle , and these touches would surely have brought into being another `` Pierrot of the Minute '' a new line drawing out of a period he knew and loved well .

		These touches would have been graced by the hand of that artist , or by another of equal deli - cacy of appreciation ,
Charles Conder	PERSON	unforgettable spaces replete with the es - sence of fancy , of dream , of those farther recesses of the imagination .

		Although technically and historically
Barrymore	PERSON	has the advantage of excellent traditions , he nevertheless rests entirely upon his own achievements , separate and individual in his understanding of what constitutes plastic power in art .

		He has a peculiar and most sensitive temper , which can arrange points of relation in juxta - position with a keen sense of form as well as of substance .

		He is , one might say , a masterly draftsman with a rich cool sense of color , whose work has something of the still force of a drawing of Ingres with , as well , the sensitive detail one finds
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 229 in a Redon , like a beautiful drawing on stone .

		An excellent knowledge of dra - matic contrasts is displayed by the broth - ers Barrymore ,
John and Lionel	PERSON	, in the murder scene , one of the finest we have seen for many years , technically even , splendid , and direct , concise in movement .

		Every superfluous gesture has been elim - inated .

		From the moment of
Peter	PERSON	's lock - ing the door upon his uncle the scene is wrapped in the very coils of catastrophe , almost Euripedean in its inevitability .

		All of this episode is kept strictly within the realm of the imagination .

		It is an episode of hatred , of which there is sure to be at least one in the life of every young sensi - tive , when every boy wants , at any rate somewhere in his mind , to destroy some influence or other which is alien or hate - ful to him .

		The scene emphasizes once again the beauty of technical power for its own sake , the thrill of discarding all that is not immediately essential to simple and direct realization .

		Little can be said of the play beyond this point , for it dwindles off into senti - mental mystification which can not be enjoyed by anyone under fifty , or appreci - ated by anyone under eighteen .

		It gives opportunity merely for settings and some rare moments of costuming , the lady with the battledore reminding one a deal of a good Manet .

		This and , of course , the splendid appearance of the Duchess of Towers in the first act all these touches furnish more than a satisfying background for the very shy and frail
Peter	PERSON	.

		This performance of Barrymore holds for me the first and last requisite of organ - ized conception in art poise , clarity , and perfect suggestibility .

		Its intellectual soundness rules the emotional extrava - gance , giving form to what for lack of form so often perishes under an excess of energy , which the ignorant actor sub - stitutes for the plastic element in all art .

		It has the attitude , this performance , almost of diffidence to one 's subject-mat - ter , except as the intellect judges clearly and coolly .

		Thus , in the sense of aesthetic reality , are all aspects clarified and made real .

		From the outward inward , or from the inward outward , surface to depth or depth to surface it is difficult to say which is the precise method of approach .


John Barrymore	PERSON	has mastered the evasive subtlety therein , which makes him one of our greatest artists .

		The future will surely wait for his riper contributions , and we may think of him as one of our fore - most artists , among the few , `` one of a small band , '' as the great novelist once said of the great poet .

		There is no glory gone from the air .

		Nothing is less .

		Nay , as it were , A keener and wilder radiance glows Along the blood , and a shouting grows Fiercer and louder , a far-flung roar Of throats and of guns ; and your island shore Is swift with smoke and savage with flame ; And a myriad lovers shout your name ,

BROWNE	PERSON	.

		230 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	Our *
Paris	LOCATION	Letter -LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Nearly four months ago in the letter pub - lished in THE DIAL of
November 8	DATE	I said that the war was almost forgotten here .

		That is still more true now .

		The papers contain hardly a word about the military operations except the official communiques which nobody reads , and one rarely hears them mentioned in conversation .

		There are so many other subjects to talk about .

		First of all there is the
Caillaux	PERSON	affair , which has been the chief subject of conversation since
M. Caillaux	PERSON	's arrest on
January 14	DATE	and has filled columns of the newspapers .

		Then there is the trial of
M. Malvy	PERSON	and all the other `` affairs '' of treason and espionage .

		These lead to new arrests every other day , some of them unexpected , like that of
M. Hanau	PERSON	, who had been correspondent here of a Genoese paper for twenty years and has been given a vote of confidence , since his arrest , by his Italian colleagues .

		Questions of internal politics thus hold the field , and political passions run very high .

		The acute tension in the country was reflected in the violent scene of
January 18	DATE	, when Socialists and Royalists fought on the floor of the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	and a Royalist deputy from the tribune aimed his revolver at the Socialists .

		Those whose knowledge of the Chamber goes farther back than mine say that nothing like it has been known since the stormiest days of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair some twenty years ago .

		There is serious unrest in the labor world and we hear of strikes and threatened strikes in different parts of the country .

		In these circumstances it will be understood that a war which has lasted three years and a half has ceased to be a topic of conversation .

		It is again that lively paper the `` CEuvre '' which sums up the situation in the daily side-note that it prints alongside its title : `` The war must have stopped without anybody 's noticing it ; for nobody talks about it any more . ''

		On the other hand , people find time to talk about peace .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's last speech , with its definite peace conditions , was more favor - ably received by the public than it appears to have been by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, for
M. Pichon	PERSON	's references to it during the debate in the Cham - ber on
January 11	DATE	were distinctly reserved and ambiguous , and
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	refused to open his mouth .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	has always been hostile to any idea of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	or international organization , which he ridiculed in his paper up to the moment that he took office , and it is unlikely that he has changed his mind .

		There can be no indiscretion in noting the fact , since the press of the Left has openly discussed , and regretted , the obvious difference of opinion between him and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	a difference shown , moreover , by the failure of the Allies to agree on a common declaration .

		The peace nego - tiations between
Russia	LOCATION	and the Central Empires likewise hold public attention .

		The surrender of the
Ukraine	LOCATION	is a severe blow to the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	, which had given the Ukrainians a loan of about
thirty million dollars	MONEY	and sent last week a military mission to carry its salutations to the Republic of the
Ukraine	LOCATION	and to accom - pany the Ukrainian army in its expected cam - paign under Generals Korniloff and
Kaledines	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fact that it is the Maximalists of Petro - grad , who have , after all , made some stand against the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	, while the more moderate Ukrainians have hastened to make a separate peace , seems to confirm
M. Marcel Sem	PERSON	- bat 's view that it was a mistake to refuse to enter into contact with
Lenine	PERSON	and Trotzky and to suggest that perhaps
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	and
M. Pichon	PERSON	put their money on the wrong horse .

		The various `` treason '' affairs should not be taken too seriously in
America	LOCATION	, at any rate those in which prominent politicians are concerned .

		Accusations of treason are very easily made in
France	LOCATION	, especially against political opponents , because the French public has a traditional ten - dency to scent treason in war-time -LRB- and some - times even in time of peace -RRB- when things are not going quite as well as they might .

		Few people have probably taken the trouble to read the account of the trial of
Marshal Bazaine	ORGANIZATION	.

		I went conscientiously through it some years ago and was convinced that although he was an income - tent general and had made grave blunders , he was unjustly convicted of treason .

		Public opin - ion demanded a scape-goat in
1871	DATE	.

		Nearly thirty years ago , at the time of the
Panama	LOCATION	and
Cornelius Hertz	PERSON	scandals , ninety-nine out of every hundred Frenchmen firmly believed that
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was a traitor to his country .

		For three years -LRB- 1889-92 -RRB- public opinion was just as hostile to him as it is now to
M. Cail	ORGANIZATION	- laux indeed , he had a much smaller number of defenders than has
M. Caillaux	PERSON	, on whose side are the whole Socialist party and
the Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	organizations .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was ac -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 231 cused of being bought by
England	LOCATION	, which was at that time the popular enemy .

		He was howled down in the Chamber and driven out of public life for some years .

		And
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	had in fact received money for his paper , the `` Aurore , '' from
Cornelius Hertz	PERSON	, who did not , like Bolo , see the inside of a prison , because he fled to
England	LOCATION	and died there .

		Undoubtedly
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was in good faith and did not know what
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	was doing , but the fact told against him .

		So strongly was he suspected even later by the Government that during his visits to
England Waldeck-Rousseau	PERSON	, who was prime minister from
1899	DATE	to
1902	DATE	, had him watched by French detectives , whose reports are among the papers found in the now famous safe at
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Yet
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	completely recov - ered his position and is now Prime Minister for the second time .

		It is , therefore , without sur - prise that on opening an evening paper , `` La Verite , '' I find the title of its leader to be `` If
M. Caillaux	PERSON	Again Became Prime Minister . ''

		Nobody who has closely followed French poli - tics for many years would be surprised ; it is never possible to say that a political reputation is ruined in
France	LOCATION	.

		As in all these cases , the feeling against
M. Caillaux	PERSON	is vague and its causes are complicated .

		The public is in a mood to find a really promi - nent traitor and
M. Caillaux	PERSON	is offered to it as
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was in
1889	DATE	.

		The
Bernstorff	PERSON	telegrams have had little effect ; the French are quick-witted and saw at once that if
M. Cail	ORGANIZATION	- laux had really been disposed to help
Germany	LOCATION	in
France	LOCATION	, Count
Bernstorff	PERSON	would never have urged that the Araguaya should be captured , for
M. Caillaux	PERSON	as a prisoner would have been useless to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		This second telegram dis - counts the secondhand information of the first , which merely reports statements alleged to have been made by
M. Caillaux	PERSON	to anonymous per - sons .

		Nobody is disposed to accept Count Lux - bourg 's word as gospel .

		The real reasons for
M. Caillaux	PERSON	's unpopular - ity are quite different .

		The principal ones are that he is supposed to be enormously rich -LRB- which seems unfounded -RRB- , that Mme.
Caillaux	PERSON	was ac - quitted in
1914	DATE	, and that
M. Caillaux	PERSON	is a little inclined to be a `` craneur '' ; that is , to put on side .

		The alleged contents of the safe at Flor - ence have attracted far more attention than the
Bernstorff	PERSON	telegrams , and the accounts of them in the papers have been worthy of Gaboriau .

		For the last couple of months one has had the impression of living in a roman feuilleton poli - cier , so incredible have been some of these `` trea - son '' affairs , in which it has been difficult to dis - tinguish the spy from the counter-spy , or either from the agent provocateur .

		During the last week `` The Mystery of the Florentine Safe '' has been published serially in the newspapers .


M. Caillaux	PERSON	appears in it as a masked conspirator of the operatic stage .

		We have been told of his scheme for a coup d'etat , with the list of emi - nent persons that he proposed to remove , which he committed to paper , no doubt , lest he should forget any of them .

		The worthy bourgeois , see - ing the guillotine already erected on the
Place de la Concorde	ORGANIZATION	, has shaken in his shoes .

		Then there was the untold wealth that
M. Caillaux	PERSON	had taken to
Italy	LOCATION	to escape his own income tax ; the amount was
$ 400,000	MONEY	according to some papers ,
$ 600,000	MONEY	according to others it must be remembered that in
France	LOCATION	a man who pos - sesses
$ 200,000	MONEY	is called a `` millionaire . ''

		This allegation , too , does not seem supported by the unromantic facts .

		The question of the money has had far more influence on public opinion than all the alleged conversations at
Buenos Aires	ORGANIZATION	or at
Rome	LOCATION	, although it has nothing at all to do with the charges against
M. Caillaux	PERSON	.

		The whole affair is an interesting study in popu - lar psychology .

		If the war is in the background , it may be imagined that literature and art are still more so .

		We are making the material for the litera - ture of the future not perhaps the near future , for I am afraid that neither literature nor art will flourish immediately after the war .

		A period of cataclysm is favorable to men of action rather than to writers , painters , or sculptors , and we are entering on a period of cataclysm in which most European governments and institutions seem likely to be swept away ; the Russian revo - lution is only a beginning .

		One has the sensa - tion of living at the end of a regime in
France	LOCATION	; all the symptoms that heralded the break-up of the ancien regime are recurring .

		The bourgeois Republic , like the old monarchy , is foundering in a whirlpool of scandals .

		But this time the change will be far more profound , for it is the whole economic system on which society has been based since the Revolution , that is threatened .

		And the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	is in the same case .

		M.
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	has revised `` L'Enfer , '' which made some stir when it was first pub - lished a few years ago , and a final edition of it has just appeared -LRB-
Albin Michel	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	a book of extraordinary originality and insight into human nature , which explains how M. Bar - busse came to write `` Le Feu , '' the book which shows a penetration into realities unique even among those who , like himself , have written about the war from personal experience .

		The idea of `` L'Enfer '' is itself original : it is the his - tory of a room in a hotel , written by a man who had the room next to it .

		A chance hole in the partition wall enables him to survey all the actions and hear all the conversations of his suc - cessive neighbors .

		The book is the record .

		It is the whole human tragedy that passes before us life , love , death , joy and sorrow , the hopes of youth and the regrets of old age .

		The new edition reached me one evening and , although I had read it before , it was three o'clock in the morning before I could put it down .

		From be - ginning to end it holds one with the grip of stern reality .

		It is not a `` pleasant '' book ; how could it be ?

		Life is not pleasant .

		Many read - ers will say of it what many of the audience said at the first performance of M.
Paul Geraldy	PERSON	's `` Noces d'Argent '' at the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	some months ago : `` C'est dur . ''

		Which means that the author leaves us no illusions , veils no nudities , however shameful .

		It is not a book for boys and girls , unless they are too young to understand it , and in that case they would not read it ; the first few pages would put them off .

		It is a psychological study , not a romance .

		The puritan should avoid it , for its frankness will shock him terribly .

		But the man or woman who will face life as life is will find it of poignant interest , not least because
M. Barbusse	PERSON	reveals his own point of view about the great problems of life .

		Inevitably it recalls Zola , who , if he be suffering a temporary eclipse , will again come into his own ; but it is in no sense an imitation or even a following of the great naturalist .


M. Barbusse	PERSON	is entirely himself .

		`` L'Enfer '' is beau - tifully written in a limpid French , whose de - ceptively easy flow covers no fatal facility .

		Like `` Le Feu , '' so different in many respects , it is a great book .

		In `` La Question Flamande et I ` Allemagne '' -LRB- Berger-Levrault ,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB-
M. Fernand Passelecq	PERSON	gives an interesting account of the way in which
Germany	LOCATION	had tried to apply in
Belgium	LOCATION	the maxim `` Divide and conquer . ''

		Before the war the Flemish question had been a subject of keen political strife in
Belgium	LOCATION	and there can be no doubt that the feeling between
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	and Walloons was a grave national problem .

		It was made more acute by a fact which
M. Passelecq	PERSON	does not mention , namely that the racial and linguistic division coincided to a great extent , although by no means exactly , with the religious and political division of the country .

		Although there were many Catholic and Conservative Walloons and many Socialist and Anti-clerical
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	,
Flanders	PERSON	was the stronghold of the Church and the Conservative party , and Wal - lonia of the forces of the Left .

		Moreover the
Catholic Flamingants	ORGANIZATION	made a vigorous campaign against French influence and French literature , which was manifested by such proposals as the unsuccessful attempt to put import duties on books imported from
France	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless M. Passelecq shows that the German thesis that there is no Belgian nation is false historically and actually .

		His historical chapters will be found particularly interesting by foreign readers , most of whom have not an exact knowledge of Belgian history .

		Artificial as modern
Belgium	LOCATION	seems , it is nevertheless the creation of the Belgians themselves , who in
1830	DATE	revolted against the really artificial arrangement of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	, which had annexed them to the kingdom of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		The Germans , during their occupation of
Belgium	LOCATION	, have naturally tried to exploit the racial and lin - guistic division -LRB- more linguistic than racial -RRB- by the administrative division of the country , by the `` flamandisation '' of
Ghent University	ORGANIZATION	, and other similar measures .

		M. Passelecq gives sound reasons for his opinion that the Belgian Flamingants who have supported this policy are only a small minority and that the policy itself has not taken root and has had very poor re - sults .

		He quotes protests from such leading Flamingants as
M. Camille Huysmans	PERSON	, Secre - tary of the
International Socialist Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, against the German policy and its Belgian supporters .

		Of the solution of the Flemish problem after the war
M. Passelecq	PERSON	takes a hopeful view .

		His book , although it does not perhaps meet all the difficulties of the case , gives an excellent and on the whole impartial account of the internal situation in
Belgium	LOCATION	and should be widely read .

		Things move so quickly that German war aims are probably not quite the same as when the book was written ; for it seems certain that Ger - many has abandoned all intention of retaining a `` sphere of influence '' in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

Paris	LOCATION	,
February 7 , 1918	DATE	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 233 Establishing the Established SOME MODERN NOVELISTS : Appreciations and Es - timates .

		By
Helen Thomas Follett	PERSON	and
Wilson Follett	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Recall to mind the forceful and absorbed youth who , at street fairs or in
summer	DATE	parks , buys a handful of balls and lets fly at the `` nigger babies . ''

		How completely he concentrates on the target provided !

		With what docility he accepts that row of puppets as a be-all and end - all as constituting the established and recog - nized mark at which he is to fire !

		He never looks about him to notice whether other puppets may be aspiring for recognition and for a place in the row aspirants who might even reach it if he would only give a little friendly help .

		Still less is he conscious of any near-by , inchoate striv - ings amongst rags , paint , and stuffing such as might evidence the struggle to achieve form and place which might be reached would he but deign to cast an encouraging eye .

		No , le jeu est fait , and he continues to blaze away at the con - ventional target : his record depends on his suc - cess with that , and just that .

		So with the Folletts as one may unceremo - niously call them , for brevity 's sake .

		Or , if the crude simile offends , another may be substituted for it .

		Let us figure an amiable and interested booklover , standing before tiers of well-filled shelves .

		The books are by `` established authors '' or at least by authors who , by now , have been sufficiently commented upon to be `` ranged . ''

		He takes down one here and there , ruffles its leaves , dusts it a bit , if required , and puts it back about in the same place .

		The glorious company of leaf-rufflers has now been enlarged , and the established authors are established more firmly than ever .

		This is about what the Folletts still speak - ing with unceremonious brevity do .

		To be per - fectly fair , they do rather more : they slightly shift their authors to bring them into new rela - tions , and they throw upon the general body of them a different and novel light .

		Their authors are put into pairs and the pairs are arranged into groups ; and the light thrown upon them all is the red light of war .

		They do one thing more .

		At the bottom of the rack , by way of appendix , they place a younger and somewhat inferior row of babies , selected save for one brief exception from among the recent fictionists of
England	LOCATION	.

		This tends to depress the native author .

		It seems to tell him one of two things : either that the
Ameri	PERSON	- can fiction of the day is slighter than the British which it may be in depth , density , perspective and background , and value of social intention ; or that our present critics are reluctant to waste good work -LRB- and their work is good -RRB- on people who may presently turn out not to have justi - fied it .

		Safer and more satisfactory to exercise oneself on standard subjects .

		The book includes a dozen reprinted essays which are reshifted and relighted by means of a table of contents and an introduction .

		The table of contents betrays a Gallic hankering after form , however come by , and a Gallic love of the label for the label 's own sake .

		It is natural enough to pair
Henry James	PERSON	and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	under the head `` Cosmopolitan and Provincial '' ; but it is less natural to bracket
George Meredith	PERSON	and
George Gissing	PERSON	under such a head as `` The Will to Believe and the Will to Doubt . ''

		On the other hand , some pairings that seem especially artificial at first view justify themselves on inspection .

		To bring together
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	and
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	under such a caption as `` The Five Counties and the Five Towns , '' seems like a mere tricksy piece of ver - balism ; yet it works out in a way to satisfy the sense of the reader , even if it ends by outraging the loyalty of
Phillpotts	ORGANIZATION	's followers .

		But to oppose
Hardy	PERSON	as `` the specialist in place '' to De
Morgan	PERSON	as `` the specialist in time '' comes rather close to running one 's system into the ground .

		The introduction is a sheet of red glass run in to give a `` timely '' new coloring to old mat - ter or , rather , to matter produced previously and in independence of its aid .

		On what ground it asks , can one justify the production and perusal of fiction in such days as these ?

		In other words , what is art 's place in the world ?

		Well , art goes abreast of war , as all history shows and outlasts it .

		Another point stressed by the introduction is the growing `` sense of community , the social conscience , human solidarity '' : a commonplace of present-day thought , in the air as a matter of course .

		New social forms and groupings may arise as the result of war and then internal struggles and oppressions return with the coming of peace .

		All this , however , is but grudging recogni - tion of a book which , essentially , is good and sound .

		In fact , one feels a little like starting all over again .

		`` Dear Sir and Madam : '' one would say , `` your twelve essays constitute one of the best books of literary criticism yet pro- duced in
America	LOCATION	.

		You might indeed have shown a slightly sharper awareness of the im - 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	mediate Here and Now , and you might well have dispensed with certain vestibules and facades ; but your house is a house of life , and save for these certain exceptions we are com - pletely with you .

		You enjoy the sound bene - fits of right feeling and right thinking .

		Your diction , even if more to be noted for a self - conscious trimness than for freedom and unc - tion , is really a pleasure , page by page ; your concern with form , though rather overdone in the compilation of your table of contents , often comes out very handsomely in the papers them - selves quite splendidly in your remarkable char - acterization of the four principal novels of
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		Your sense of a worthy and service - able relation between life and literature is im - manent everywhere a relation varying through the years and through your varying subjects and requires no supplementary demonstration .

		In short , you have stepped within that choice circle of criticism which contains no more than half-a - dozen significant writers , all told ; and the coun - try so far as it concerns itself with such matters at all should feel gratified with you and your work .

		Your wine is good ; you could do with less bush at your door . ''


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		A
Vanishing World of Gentility	ORGANIZATION	THESE MANY YEARS .

		By
Brander Matthews	PERSON	.


Scribners	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		What more cordial welcome could the re - viewer ask than this `` Que pensez-vous de cette comedie ? ''

		from the bookplate designed for Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	by
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, and reproduced on the cover of these `` recollections '' ?

		The bookplate , symbolizing Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	as `` an American in - terested in the drama , '' represents an Indian gaz - ing into the face of a Greek mask .

		Our author will scarcely realize how much better a joke this is than any contained within the cover of his book .

		For anything less Indian or less Greek than the particular comedy of his life can not well be imagined .

		Deliberately and expensively bred to follow the profession of millionaire , he was released , just as he came of age , by the wiping-out of his father 's fortune , for the profession that his heart craved that of writing plays and seeing them acted on the stage .

		His unexpected translation to the professorial sphere did not transform him from being about the most naively worldly soul who ever got himself recognized as a man of letters .

		He gazed at life with no Indian hau - teur , but with a never sated enjoyment in the pleasant comedy of clubs and theatres and liter - ary associations equally at home in
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	incorrigibly anecdotal , genial , and curious .

		And it was no Sophoclean tragedy upon which he gazed , but the second-rate imitations of Scribe and
Augier	PERSON	, and the cleverly turned short-story , and the wittiness of familiar verse .

		Sarcey ,
Coquelin	PERSON	, divided his worship with
Austin Dobson	PERSON	,
Bunner	PERSON	, and Locker-Lamp - son .

		How fortunate he was to live in the era of well-made plays , and of ballades and ron - deaux !

		He took to them all like a fish to water .

		And he recalls his own half-dozen acted plays with a justifiable pleasure that is undimmed by the realization that no one now remembers that at least two of them had long and popular suc - cesses .

		In his youth , he had a significant era of skill as an acrobat and gymnast , and he tells with glee of his being invited to go out on the road `` under canvas . ''

		It was always the acrobatics of literature that Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	responded to , and always the circus of the social and literary world which enthralled him .

		He achieved a wide acquaintance among the lions , and he prac - ticed all the tricks , in verse and play and story .

		But he is so completely objective that scarcely one of the writers whom he knew is characterized with any precision whatever , except perhaps
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, for whom he had a prodigious admiration , and
W. E. Henley	PERSON	, for whose at - tack on
Stevenson	PERSON	he has an unexpectedly sym - pathetic word .

		Otherwise the contacts and oc - casions pass before our eyes like dates in Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's diaries , carried along by his own pleasure in their abundance and their notability .

		There is plenty of mild gossip , and we are pres - ent at the founding of innumerable clubs , and at least one Academy .

		His anecdotes sound better in the classroom .

		The compulsion to autobi - ography sprang , in Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's case , less from a sense of personal flavor and distinctive quality in what he saw than from a boyish de - sire to get down a record of his passing life .

		Anyone so completely extroverted as Mr. Mat - thews could not be immodest .

		He is as little in - terested in the processes of his own soul as in those of the brilliant and complex peronalities whom he has known .

		He does not think of himself as an absorbing person , to be detachedly studied and analyzed as a type of man , nor as a person of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 235 romantic significance to be interpreted from the innermost core of his soul .

		His diary treatment of life is so pure as almost to make these `` recol - lections '' interesting .

		But there are too many passages such as this , where he reflects on his university life : So far as I have been able to form an opinion , there is no university in the
United States	LOCATION	where the position of the professor is pleasanter than it is at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The students , graduate and undergradu - ate , are satisfactory in quality ; and their spirit is excellent .

		The teaching staff is so large that it is generally possible for each of us to cover that part of his field in which he is most keenly interested .

		Our relations with each other and with the several deans and the president and the trustees are ever friendly .

		So long as we do our work faithfully we are left alone to do it in our own fashion .

		And we have all of us the Lernfreiheit and the Lehrfreiheit , the lib - erty of the soul and of the mind , which was once the boast of the German universities , but which has been lost of late under the rigidity of Prussian autoc - racy .

		`` God bless us every one ! ''

		said little Tim .

		Anyone who gets the full flavor of this pas - sage , recalling all there is to be said on these matters , will be near the secret of that American race of men of letters of whom Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	is one of the naiver specimens , a race to whom litera - ture was a gesture of gentility and not a compre - hension of life .

		There is a fascination about that brilliant literary world of the seventies and eighties when the `` Nation '' and the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune '' and `` World '' monopolized the younger generation of critical talent .

		But what on earth can a younger generation of today do with the remains of this gentility ?

		In his account of the atrocious college education that the best of money could buy in
America	LOCATION	in
1868	DATE	, Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	gave me a guess at the secret of the continuance of this genteel tradition .

		Was it because you could get no education at all unless you got it from foreign travel or from cultivated relatives ?

		Only the genteel , apparently , had these opportunities , so that the creation of a proletarian man of letters in
America	LOCATION	became automatically impossible , until universities and libraries improved and diffused the raw materials of the spirit .

		What do I think of this comedy ?

		I like the slight pugnacity with which Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	went into the contest for the copyright bill and for simplified spelling .

		I like the candor with which he confesses his relief at being freed from the dread possibilities of practicing the profes - sion of millionaire .

		But if there was ever a man of letters whose mind moved submerged far be - low the significant literary currents of the time , that is the man revealed in this book .

		He seems to have known everybody , and to have felt noth - ing .

		His genial youthfulness is infectious .

		But it is not the youth of idealism and aspiration , but of
Peter Pan	PERSON	, writing stories of treasure - trove for `` St.
Nicholas	PERSON	. ''

		I know there 's the `` Moliere , '' and the `` Shakespeare , '' and the critical essays .

		But that 's not the mind that writes `` These Many Years . ''

		Turned on itself , it creates a tell-tale commentary of a literary era that never grew up .

		The puzzle to us now is that these bons viveurs have not made life more exciting , that these dear old romancers and real - ists of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's generation have not made life more romantic and realistic .

		What on earth , I repeat , are we going to do with these people who blissfully never even knew what a world of horizons and audacities they lived in ?

		At first glance the four authors here grouped together would seem to have little enough in common : the litterateur who was for three years United States Minister to the
Netherlands	LOCATION	, the Rector of St.
Thomas	PERSON	's in
New York	LOCATION	, the Pro- fessor of English History in the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, and the Professor of German in the
University of Alberta	ORGANIZATION	at
Edmonton	LOCATION	.

		Yet it hap - pens that for the moment their points of resemblance are more striking than their wide differences in background .

		It is perhaps least important , though the reader will find it unsatisfactory enough , that all four books are of the nature of fugitive journalism .

		Three-quarters of Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's volume is a sketchy account of the origin and the earlier course of the war not vividly illuminated by the reminiscences of one who in
Antwerp	LOCATION	marveled over tennis-court emplace - ments for those big German guns which Pro- fessor
Pollard	ORGANIZATION	assures us were really fired from their own carriages ; another eighth is devoted to such interludes as `` A Dialogue on Peace between a
Householder	PERSON	and a Burglar '' ; and a 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	residual eighth has any vital bearing upon his subject .

		`` The High Call '' is a series of fourteen sermons concerning our entry into the war , of which two or three , winging the serene empyrean of the fashionable church , let fall feathery ideas calculated to tickle the drowsy layman .

		Pro- fessor
Pollard	ORGANIZATION	's nineteen reprinted papers -LRB- chiefly from the Thunderer 's `` Literary Supplement '' -RRB- are dated all the way from
January , 1915	DATE	to
August , 1917	DATE	and contain so many anachronisms and ungrateful flings at American neutrality that one wonders why they should have been reprinted at all , or being reprinted should have been im - ported .

		Finally , Professor
Coar	PERSON	says of his much more coherent book that it `` is based on addresses delivered in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	since the
fall of 1914	DATE	. ''

		Volumes thus assembled can scarcely develop consistent theses .

		More significant similarities are those of temper and opinion .

		A newspaper recently announced a new serial as follows : `` She married a German .

		Read it !

		It will make you mad ! ''

		All four of our authors , though in descending degrees , have been made `` mad '' by what they have read or have observed about the Germans .

		The first dilates upon `` the Werwolf at large '' ; the second tells us that God `` sees in the home of modern atheism ... the crucifixion of humanity '' ; the third discusses `` the moral insensibility of
Prussia	LOCATION	, '' finds not one vestige `` of moral scruple or enlightenment '' in the history of the Junkers , and adds that `` the problem before the civilized world , during and after this war , is how to deal with a parvenu who declines to observe any rules in the society into which he has thrust his unwelcome presence '' ; and the last would `` grasp by the throat and throttle to death the autocratic beast ... befouling the temple of human - ity . ''

		It is not so much an olive branch as an olive rod that is thus extended .

		For the authors are unanimous in their insistence upon the knock-out blow , even if they do not quite endorse the dictum of
Marse Henry Watterson	PERSON	, that perfect jusquauboutiste : `` If any power is left intact in
Germany	LOCATION	to make treaty with any other power , we are lost . ''

		With Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	the sine qua non is `` repentance '' `` to talk of any other course is treason , not only to our country but to the cause of true Peace . ''

		The Reverend Mr.
Stires	PERSON	insists that `` the beast ... must be conquered . ''

		`` When once the sword has been drawn , '' says Professor
Pollard	PERSON	, `` the day of persuasion is past ... It is a question of victory or defeat . ''

		Professor
Coar	PERSON	is explicit : the fall of the Hohenzollerns will not be enough ; he wants us to reject `` courageously '' all peace terms that may be proffered before the enemy have been `` converted to the faith of the democratic nations '' ; that time will come `` when , and only when , the German people realize that their national fate lies in the hands of the Allies '' ; before that time the Allied forces must break the last line of defense and `` penetrate the heart of
Germany	LOCATION	's industrial activity , the Rhen - ish province and
Westphalia	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet not one of these advocates of a war to the bitter end purposes at its close a `` crushed ''
Germany	LOCATION	!

		All are deeply , even passionately , concerned for a `` right conclusion '' to the war , a just and -LRB- according to their several lights -RRB- a democratic peace , and after peace some inter - national arrangement for the forestalling of war .

		What they do purpose at the close is a victorious democracy magnanimously bestowing the `` pax humana '' upon a people defeated but not em - bittered , powerless longer to do wrong and therefore `` free '' at last to do right a criminal punished , penitent , regenerate .

		To that con - summation they know only one course .

		Let our authors be granted the dubious pos - sibility of a peace dictated either in
Berlin	LOCATION	or in
Paris	LOCATION	a clear cut `` victory or defeat . ''

		Assum - ing that their course to a democratic peace is , if not the only course , at least one that is open , can we avoid seeing the impasse at which they arrive ?

		It is a dilemma each of them might have foreseen but for the devious meanderings of the journalistic method .

		For -LRB- pace Professor
Pollard	PERSON	-RRB- the question is not of `` victory or de - feat , '' but of victory and defeat .

		The proponents of the knock-out blow somehow forget that the shield of peace with victory has for reverse peace with defeat , and that defeat is not only bitter but as witness the unreconstructed South em - bittering .

		Has Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	reflected that the reverse of his shield of `` peace with righteousness and power '' may well be peace with ignominy and impotence ?

		A defeated
Germany	LOCATION	may not seem to us necessarily crushed and ignominiously facing annihilation , but she will seem so to herself .

		Do we desire for partners in that international democratic experiment to which we stand committed and for which , as Messrs.
Stires	PERSON	and
Coar	PERSON	recognize , we are ourselves none too fit a people broken , embittered , shamed , and consciously dependent upon their military masters for their economic existence ?

		-LRB- That would be anything but democracy ! -RRB-

		If
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 237 the German people are not now ready for a democratic peace a peace negotiated between equals upon clear programmes of social recon - struction will they be more ready when the Allied armies are in
Westphalia	LOCATION	, dictating democ - racy from the mouths of cannon ?

		These mili - tant gentlemen who have assured themselves that the German people are not ready ; who would prevent as useless , enervating , or downright treasonable all discussion -LRB- except , of course , this of theirs -RRB- that looks toward clarifying our pro- gramme ; who to that degree fail to get behind the President in his attempts to elicit our aims , the aims of our allies , and the aims of our enemies are they not retarding the very creation they desire ?

		A victorious peace they might get , but what is their guarantee that it will be the truly democratic peace `` that alone can validate victory '' ?

		Obviously the Junkers are not ready for a democratic peace .

		But whether there is in Ger - many any considerable body of opinion that is ready we can not discover , and these advocates of international understanding would prevent us from discovering .

		Suppose such a body of liberal opinion does exist what is their method of encouraging it ?

		First , to refuse recognition of its existence ; and , second , to bring it into existence by the sword .

		Theirs is the method of the parent who tells his child , `` Now that the rod has been drawn , the moment of persuasion is past ; it is now a question of your exhaustion or mine . ''

		They would retort that
Germany	LOCATION	has had ample opportunity to respond to persua - sion .

		Perhaps yet that is far less important than that the course they urge upon us would postpone any further persuasion until victory is secured and persuasion become coercion .

		With one hand they would close all the avenues to understanding , while with the other they would labor to increase the fear that now most prevents understanding .

		For the Germans know that a knock-out blow knocks out , and that a bitter end is bitter .

		If these , and these alone , be offered them they will inevitably concentrate their ener - gies upon resistance .

		But all this falls in a blind spot in the vision of these authors , whose gaze leaps from fighting for peace to the millennium of peace secured and democracy enthroned .

		As if democracy were a paradisal consummation instead of a method , an end instead of a means .

		In spite of Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's eulogy , of Mr.
Stires	PERSON	's pious hopes , of Professor
Pollard	PERSON	's learning and sound critical habits , and of Professor
Coar	PERSON	's constructive analy - sis , not one of these four really understands democracy ; otherwise he would understand that a democratic peace must be a peace by democracy if it is to be a peace for democracy .

		Failing to understand democracy in this essen - tial , the four naturally fail to agree in what they expect of it .

		The democracy that satisfies Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	is a childish thing beside that envisaged by Professor
Pollard	PERSON	in his view of a world where national wars are no more , but economic wars forever threaten .

		The democracy that the Reverend Mr.
Stires	PERSON	invokes to stay the greed of socialism and make the world safe for the bourgeoisie , his parishioners , is a quaint sister to the democracy that shall build Professor
Coar	PERSON	's towering edifice of state socialism .

		Such are the relatively unimportant differences between the authors .

		Relatively unimportant , that is , as against what is after all the common method , temper , and premise of their books .

		Nor would those common denominators be of much significance in our more considered literature on the subject if they were not pretty generally the common de - nominators of the man in the street .

		Like these authors the man in the street thinks in journal - istic patches , warms his thoughts with that tem - per of `` righteous indignation '' which for the purposes of war behaves exactly like hate , and accepts the premise that the war must be won .

		But by winning the war he does not yet mean all that his more cultivated advisers mean : where they emphasize a defeated
Germany	LOCATION	, he em - phasizes a democratized
Germany	LOCATION	, a democratized world , and the discrediting of war forever .

		Are the proponents of military victory , then , his only advisers ?

		Might he not listen also to a British soldier , talking in his dugout , as reported by a correspondent to the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' ?

		A victorious war -LRB- in the old-fashioned sense -RRB- still leaves war a reasonable thing , a thing by which ends can be achieved .

		A stalemate leaves war discredited .

		To win a war -LRB- in the old-fashioned sense -RRB- is to per - petuate war .

		The loser would say , `` Never mind !

		A war , it seems , can still be won .

		We will win the next . ''

		But let it be clear that a war can not be `` won '' nowadays in the way in which the old wars were won , and you really have ended war .

		Let it end , as all ugly things should end , in collapse and squalor , and the thing is dead .

		But let it end in triumphant marches through cities , in proud speeches , in the ring - ing of bells , and the challenging music of bands and war is still on its pedestal .

		238 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	Poetry vs. ` Politics in the
Ukraine	LOCATION	SONGS OF
UKRANIA	LOCATION	.

		Translated by
F. Randal Livesay	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The question of Russian solidarity has become increasingly vital .

		Ever since the most fertile and accessible section of
Russia	LOCATION	has signed a sep - arate peace with the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	, the atten - tion of a great part of the Western world has been centred in the
Ukraine	LOCATION	.

		Is the Rada really expressing the will of the people ?

		we ask .

		Or are the masses , under the threat of German domination , becoming more and more socialistic ?

		In the prevailing atmosphere of revolution has what was originally a nationalistic movement been turned into an attempt to solve a provin - cial land question ?

		No one can yet be sure that the
Ukraine	LOCATION	will , as the
New York	LOCATION	`` Trib - une '' puts it , continue to isolate itself against the contagion of restlessness and make `` a bold stand against the spread of anarchy . ''

		Who can say whether the Ukrainians will be slaves or masters in their own home ?

		Whether or not that home will be eventually incorporated in a federal Rus - sian republic ?

		Whether or not the Ukrainians ' desire for the `` self-determination of peoples '' will end in self-extermination as the dependent mili - tary ally of the Central Powers ?

		While we are waiting for time to answer these questions with something more definite than our desires , it might be informing as well as inter - esting to turn to some of the literature produced not by the politicians of the
Ukraine	LOCATION	but by the people .

		And , since the soul and aspirations of a nation are rooted in its folk-poetry , we may come somewhat nearer to the people of little
Russia	LOCATION	by a consideration of `` Songs of Ukra - nia , '' selected and translated by
Florence Randal Livesay	PERSON	and published when the phrase `` self - determination of peoples '' was nothing except the shibboleth of harmless hack-writers , presumably in the employ of the
Wilhelmstrasse	LOCATION	.

		The first impression is disappointing .

		There seems to be little that is deeply indigenous in this collection , little that is racially marked .

		There is much talk of pagan gods and goddesses ; of Haidamaky and
Oprishki	PERSON	, the Ukrainian
Robin Hoods	PERSON	; of the sighs of the married woman , once a free Cossachka , now the slave of her husband , with no rights of her own ; of the
Dunai	PERSON	listening to nuptial revelry or to a young girl confiding her loneliness to its ripples .

		And the first impression persists .

		There is no national revelation here .

		With the exception of a few kabatys , hutzuls , serdaks , widra , and other untranslated bits of the vernacular , these might be the folk-songs of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, or of
Bes	ORGANIZATION	- sarabia , or of
Baluchistan	LOCATION	.

		Such poems as `` Far and high the cranes give cry , '' `` Long ago when I was still free , '' `` Where the
Tisza	LOCATION	's torrents through the prairies swell , '' might well be true types of Ukrainian folk-literature were they not three of the most characteristic examples of Hungarian melodies translated by
J. S. of Dale	PERSON	and
Francis Korbay	PERSON	, the composer .

		Had some one done for the music of these Ukrainian songs what
Korbay	PERSON	has done for the Hungarian ones , we might have had a more valuable document .

		For it is in the emotional quality of the music , its mixture of rudeness and tenderness , its savage impulse singing through its sad and even senti - mental modulations , that is more expressive than the import of the words , which for the most part are the reflection of emotions common to all countries .

		The greatest of all Hungarian folk - songs -LRB- `` Mohac 's Field '' -RRB- is a feeble thing con - sidered as a piece of written literature .

		But nothing could be more stark and stirring , more revolutionary and somehow resigned , more full of national cry and color than this same song when it is given with the vigorous melody that is its natural accompaniment .

		True folk-songs are the perfect blend of two arts ; it is impossible to sep - arate words and melody .

		Whenever this separa - tion is attempted , as in the present volume , we get not only an inadequate half but a misrepre - sentative one .

		I have never heard the melodies that are played on the kobza and sung to these Cossack and robber songs , but I am certain that they create sterner feelings than are evoked by such colorless quatrains as : On the blue sea waves are roaring , Mountain high they tower .

		Crying in their Turkish dungeon Wretched Cossacks cower .

		`` Why , O gracious God , this torture ?

		Two years now we lie here ; With the chains are hands are heavy Wilt Thou let us die here ? ''

		or the `` Song of Victory
1648	DATE	, '' that begins : Hai , all ye good people !

		list what I tell ye , What 's done in
Ukraina	ORGANIZATION	's plain There under Dashiev , across the
Soroka	LOCATION	, What numbers of Poles now lie slain .

		Hai , Perebiynees !

		But seven hundred Cossacks he asked for that day .

		Then he with sabres smote the Poles ' heads off The rest swept the river away .

		The wordless dances from `` Prince
Igor	PERSON	, '' the chant of the Volga boatman , or the single `` Hopak '' of Moussorgsky say more and say it
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 239 far more clearly than a hundred such stanzas .

		National feeling is expressed by something less definite but deeper than a list of ancient victories , faithless lovers , and dreams of forgotten king - doms .

		These verses , with the exception of the hints of quaint rituals and superstitions found in the wedding songs and a few others , tell us little that is distinctively Ukrainian .

		Or rather , they tell us only of the Ukrainians of yesterday ; they reveal nothing of what has come between them and their old visions .

		As historical memories , they contain many points for the statistician but , lacking their original impelling magic , they are only occasionally informing and rarely interpre - tative .

		After all , if we want an authoritative answer to the Ukrainian puzzle we shall not get it through
Miss Livesay	LOCATION	.

		We are far more likely to get it through the Soviets .

		No city seems to provoke epigrams from its observers so readily as
New York	LOCATION	.


Henry James	PERSON	caught its many physical aspects in the net of his sensitive undulating prose , summarizing its external quality in his description of the long , shrill city , the `` jagged city , '' with its skyscrapers like the teeth of a colossal hair-comb .

		Who for - gets
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's paean : `` When million - footed
Manhattan	LOCATION	unpent descends to her pavement '' ?

		Dickens 's mordant caricatures are forgotten , yet it is comforting to remember that although the
Harlem	LOCATION	goats have long since given up their feeding-grounds to duplex apartment houses , one can still see an occasional survivor cavorting on the slopes of
Bolton Road	LOCATION	at In - wood .

		More recently the epigrams have taken on a sociological flavor .

		Julian Street tells us that an American in
New York	LOCATION	is nowadays at the mercy of the Greeks , Italians ,
Irish	LOCATION	, Rus - sians , French , Germans , and Swiss with no American consul to appeal to !

		And a less amia - ble observer hit off the economic and social geography of the city when he wrote of
New York	LOCATION	, `` An island of sin and misery divided by an avenue of wealth . ''

		Perhaps the impulse to write a single succinct phrase about
New York	LOCATION	and chance on it one 's reputation for perspicacity comes from a dim recognition that details will confuse the im - pression .

		The city almost invites to briskness .

		There is a possibility for characterization , one feels , in a quick glance over the vast jungle of its multiple life .

		But a long acquaintance will produce a kind of bewildered literary humility .

		The voice of the city , which even so fond a lover as
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	could not help making seem archaic today , will speak not only in siren-whistle tones and softer accents , but in many strange tongues and alien whisperings .

		The most careful explorer can never be sure there are not some clusters of life and custom and speech that he has missed .

		Turn East from the Avenue above the Plaza and you might for a moment believe yourself in
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		Home-sick travelers in the most bizarre cities of the Near East may comfort them - selves with the reflection , `` I have seen nothing so much like Mulberry Street on a
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	. ''

		Around
Washington Square	LOCATION	there are moments when it is easy to fancy onself in
Boston	LOCATION	or
Paris	LOCATION	or
London	LOCATION	.

		Morningside and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and the Drive who dares to say this is as dis - tinctively
New York	LOCATION	as the Avenue between Thirty-Third and Fifty-Ninth on a sunny
October	DATE	day ?

		Weakly we accept the cliche `` a city of contrasts , '' and evade the difficulty of characterization .

		For hardly any hundred know identically the same
New York	LOCATION	, as hundreds of thousands must know the same glamorous Lon - don of autumn haze and the same gray vistas and wet , shining boulevards of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		There are coils upon coils of life in the city that sends its ships out so proudly to the old world from the new .

		Huddled upon the lower island is the new
America	LOCATION	of triumphant finance , arrogant in its stone and steel and towering massiveness , and the pathetic remnants of an older , more gracious colonialism little refuges in the teeming swamps of the new immigrants , who cling together for protection against the un - known and build their churches , their theatres , their market places , crowding down into them from the vast wilderness of tenements and cluttering the streets .

		There are here , as well , the architectural hints of other cities , the inter - secting avenues of middle-class commercial Amer - ica , with its steam-heated , bath-room apartmented clientele , the dreary wastes of factory and ter - minals , an occasional shame-faced park and aggressive settlement house .

		Further up the island are the Broadway of lights-of-love , and 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	lights of fiction , the Drive and the Avenue , both the latter distinctively
New York	LOCATION	.

		Yet if you care to go down the short gridiron streets on either side to the two rivers you can find
Detroit	LOCATION	or
Cleveland	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	even , in little .

		There are microcosms of all our industrial centres scattered along these water-fronts .

		And due north are infinite replications of all our homes , with their aura of families , from even the front - door shade tree to the box-like `` flat , '' and from the panoply of new and splendid apartment houses to the more seemly brown-stone .

		Thread - ing this strange motley the
New Yorker	LOCATION	, tolerant yet provincial , unmoved by the flux of heaving new subways and the perpetual tearing-down and building-up , yet curiously conventional in his pleasures and rigid in his beliefs , finds his way to the fringe of real American suburbia which en - velops the almost denationalized cluster of lives and buildings called
New York	LOCATION	.

		It smiles down in friendly protection from the
Jersey	LOCATION	shores ; stretches through the wastes of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	and
Queens	LOCATION	to the further
Long Island	LOCATION	of medieval country estates of the uncomfortably rich .

		It reaches down from the lovely rolling landscape of `` up-State '' through the
Bronx	LOCATION	and
Harlem	LOCATION	to the island itself , where the rivers ceaselessly wash this greatest of experiments in community life .

		What author , except the casual visitor , would have the presumption to attempt to harness the kaleidoscope of all this in a few phrases , even in a single book ?

		Who , except as the intuition from a brief trip , could make so bold , yet so profoundly wise , a comparison between our two largest cities as , ``
Chicago	LOCATION	is self-conscious and
New York	LOCATION	is not '' ?

		Miss
Chapin	PERSON	, for instance , in her attractively illustrated volume , `` Green - wich Village , '' avoids the problem by confining her attention to one of the many little com - munities of
New York	LOCATION	.

		She writes of the district with great affection and a rather re - freshing naivete , with something of the embar - rassed exhilaration the conventional man feels on his first introduction to an actress .

		Yet on the whole it is a friendly accent after the over - featured and over-adjectival publicity of indus - trious `` special story '' bandits , who do their best to rob our cities of what bloom is left them , by calling too shrill attention to the happier sur - vivals .

		Miss
Chapin	PERSON	calls her book `` the chequered history of a city square , '' and dwells on the gallant days of `` The Green Village , '' the career of old Sir
Peter Warren	PERSON	, who was a true villager of those times in spite of achieving the too classic distinction of being buried in
West	LOCATION	- minster Abbey and having his epitaph written by none other than Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	.

		There is the romantic story of
Richmond Hill	LOCATION	and
Aaron Burr	PERSON	and , in later times , of ``
Tom Paine	PERSON	, Infidel , '' whose shade perhaps hovers hospitably over the merry young atheists of nowadays .

		The last part of her book
Miss Chapin	PERSON	devotes to the villagers of
today	DATE	and to their many restaurants , for heavy eating and light talk are still the favorite in-door amusements .

		In spite of Miss
Chapin	PERSON	's earnest desire to be friendly and to picture the villagers as impetuous , but youthful and ambitious , Arcadians in a sort of play-world of camaraderie , I think she has really missed the point of the modern village .

		It is true that there is a kind of youthful eagerness to make a personal try at life instead of accepting anyone 's say-so .

		It is true that there is a tolerance -LRB- at least in speech and action -RRB- , an easy willingness to forgive mistakes , a sense that there is always another day coming , a kind of perennial
Micaw	PERSON	- ber optimism .

		But there is little real intellectual life , although much pretense at it and a fierce dogmatic passion of approval for any idea which has the pure-food certificate of novelty .

		And although there are a few disorganized creative forces emerging out of the liberating leaven of the Square , they quickly transfer their centres of gravity to other sections of
New York	LOCATION	when they gain momentum and discipline .

		For
Miss Chapin	PERSON	seems to forget that although all
Bohemia	LOCATION	is parochial enough , it is hardly the parochialism of people who have roots and a natural history .

		In
Bohemia	LOCATION	one 's origins are one 's disabilities ; they are the points from which one has `` reacted '' or rebelled .

		It is the creed that one 's future shall be tremulous and uncertain .

		To act as if moulded by any end greater than six days ahead is rank apostasy .

		It is the mood of adventurous - ness , of expectancy , of the fun of repudiating tomorrow what one cherishes today , the thrill of really assuming that it is a pluralistic world , ecstasy before the flux .

		It is hardly a mood for gray-beards or a programme for the ambitious .

		The most pathetic people in
Bohemia	LOCATION	are the `` real '' Bohemians those who have been there a long time .

		They have confused a mood with a career ; they are as absurd as middle-aged men with the chicken pox or a father with the whoop - ing cough .

		Nor does
Miss Henderson	PERSON	in her larger and in appearance only , not in intention more pre - tentious volume , with its slightly ironical title , `` A Loiterer in
New York	LOCATION	, '' attempt to `` do ''
New York	LOCATION	.

		She attempts merely to chronicle
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 241 the more conventional art and architecture of the city , with just enough of friendly gossip and historical anecdote and background to clothe the narrative engagingly .

		It would be a disconcert - ing lesson in appreciation for the traditionally indifferent and unobserving New Yorker to read Miss
Henderson	PERSON	's estimates -LRB- and the estimates of others , for the author is generous in quotation -RRB- of the statuary of
Macmonnies	ORGANIZATION	, French ,
Karl Bitter	PERSON	, and
Augustus Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	; the archi - tecture of McKim ,
White	ORGANIZATION	,
Nash	PERSON	,
Carrere	PERSON	, La Farge , and
Hastings	PERSON	; the many treasures of the Museum ; the paintings of
Blashfield	LOCATION	, Par - rish ,
Redfield	PERSON	, and
John La Farge	ORGANIZATION	.

		One can easily fancy the younger men sniffing a bit at these academic names ; yet after all it is from these men that the greater number of
New York	LOCATION	's citizens get their fleeting glimpses of art and their conceptions , so far as they may be said to have any , of formal beauty .

		Such a study has real social value as a presentation of the aesthetic background of the majority .

		Miss
Henderson	PERSON	's volume gives us a successful and entertaining performance in a task which perhaps few others would care to undertake .

		It may be many years now that the war has made art , except as it ties itself to the chariot wheels of belligerency , a kind of capricious irrelevance before
New York	LOCATION	will break through what we may call the external shell of imported excellence , and will develop enough of its own particular and indi - vidual aesthetic expression to justify a book .

		Even Mr.
Shackleton	PERSON	in his businesslike and informative volume , `` The Book of
New York	LOCATION	, '' does not attempt himself to give an interpretation of the `` soul '' of
New York	LOCATION	.

		To be sure , in the course of his narrative , which he keeps really interesting throughout by a shrewd blend of description and drama and history , he quotes many summaries of the essence of the city from men of literary fame , many brilliant insights .

		However , he makes no pretense to express a coherent and highly individualized reaction to
New York	LOCATION	as a whole , the kind of articulation which comes from long seeping in of the city and from loving acquaintance with its cross - currents of life -LRB- as in some of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's essays , for instance ,
London	LOCATION	itself seems to be exhaled from the pages -RRB- .

		That kind of book about modern
New York	LOCATION	has yet to be written .

		Mean - while any one of these highly creditable per - formances will furnish agreeable hours to the many of us who never tire of hearing sung the glories of our beloved

		POTTERAT AND THE WAR .

		By
Benjamin Valla	PERSON	- ton .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In the past month an American publishing house has brought to our shores two works of fic - tion which merit a cordial welcome .

		The first of these , a collection of stories by a young Eng - lish writer , introduces a company of characters wholly eligible to meet , let us say , those in
Henry James	PERSON	's `` The Better Sort . ''

		`` Potterat , '' on the other hand , serving as a French Mr.
Britling	PERSON	or a Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	, introduces us to the point of view of the Swiss bourgeoisie , and exhibits the type of middle-class philosophy by which they explain the causes and interpret the events of the war .

		Of the two books ,
Hugh de Selincourt	PERSON	's `` Nine Tales '' is the finer piece of work .

		The year , indeed , will be an exceptionally lucky one if for charm and subtlety it sees these stories surpassed .

		The work of Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	, so far edi - torially unrecognized , for the most part , in this country , is of the type and format customarily attributed to a `` young Englishman . ''

		By this one is led to expect stirring stories of contem - poraries , told with a kind of satiric realism which suggests an Oxford fluency in Greek and Latin , the languages and the literatures .

		The expectancy is gratified , and the book reads like brilliant , offhand table talk by the old gods , who yet have their fingers in the latest pie .

		That
America	LOCATION	's contribution to literature is the short-story is a lesson not likely to be for - gotten .

		The proof begins with
Irving , Poe	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and ends with
O. Henry	PERSON	four in - ventors of four types .

		It seems probable that Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's name will be added , both be - cause of her distinguished work and because fol - lowers have made her special method into an invention .

		Candidly , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is now al - most the only presentable member of the family to send to the front door .

		We are so busy with our own concerns , reading and collating maga - zine stories , that like
Mark Twain	PERSON	's islanders we are eking out a precarious livelihood by tak - ing in one another 's washing .

		On our opening `` Nine Tales , '' any resentment toward a possible usurper turns to admiration for a friend .

		For these stories are what may be termed `` pleasant , '' and most soundly so .

		One exception , `` The Sacrifice , '' because its powerful theme makes it the most striking in the collec - tion , deserves to be retold .

		Of Mr.
Wellfield	PERSON	, 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	the first character , the author says that his all - absorbing love for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was based on two motives gratitude and patriotism .

		`` Other things , however , undoubtedly told ; such as the suste - nance of the reputation which he had gained for apt quotation , and the size of the volumes , which happened to fit perfectly into the book - rest of his armchair . ''

		On this morning the squire , sustained by a patriotic quotation from
Richard II	PERSON	.

		and pleased by good news from his son at the front , allowed Rosa , carrying her child in her arms , to pass on up the road after a perfunctory offer of alms , which she refused .

		Rosa had left her husband , and her lover had been killed a few days before .

		Next , the vicar , thrilled by a regiment of recruits and then by the sight of Rosa and her baby , preached her a sermon on patriotic sacrifice .

		This he terminated by calling her `` blessed among women , '' but made only another offer of assist - ance .

		Eventually Rosa , physically wearied and mentally unstrung by fatigue and the vicar 's rather heady eloquence , determined to sacrifice her baby by strangling him with her bootlace .

		That scene of mad renunciation stands out , with a similar one from `` Jude the Obscure , '' as among the most genuinely pathetic in English .

		The story ends but not at this point with `` a sense of rhythm and inevitableness which is al - ways indicative of genius , '' as Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	defines a short-story .

		The distinguishing qualities of Mr.
de Selin	PERSON	- court 's style are his unforgettable characteriza - tions and his restraint in permitting the reader to preach his own sermons .

		`` Here is a char - acter ; this happened '' is enough .

		This ecce homily method gives the tales an extraordinary sense of finish and finality .

		For brief characteri - zation , none is better than this from `` The Sense of Sin . ''

		`` He had lately bought a complete edi - tion of the works of
William Morris	PERSON	, the pages of which it gave him great pleasure musingly to cut with an immense ivory paper-knife , very smooth and cool to the cheek . ''

		The change now to
M. Vallaton	PERSON	's book is like the change from chess to checkers .

		Quite as good a game in its way , but the lay-out of the board is not the same and the rules differ .

		Here an ample personality dominates the book , after the manner of nineteenth century novelists .

		It is the author 's purpose to summarize the popular feeling of the Swiss at the outbreak of the war in the persons of Potterat , retired superintendent of police , and his friends .

		It would be an enter - prising subject for investigation , by the way , to trace the influence of De Cassagnac 's historical exploit in the middle of the
last century	DATE	, along through his imitators , down to our own Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	.

		But `` Potterat '' also is fiction .

		The novel consists of a series of chapters in which the genial old optimist is seen tending his bees , working in his garden , fishing with his cronies on the lake , and gossiping with his neighbors in the lake-side country to which he had retired after
thirty years	DATE	of service .

		The encroachments of a real estate boom eventually sent him back in - to the town of
Lausanne	LOCATION	and an apartment house there .

		The old man 's comic misery in the taw - dry luxury of
Madame Potterat	ORGANIZATION	's new drawing - room is no less human than his very genuine sorrow at leaving
Eglantine Cottage	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was in their town quarters that the outbreak of the war and the orders for mobilization overtook the family , sending them in company with hordes of fellow townsmen scurrying for stores of food in the face of the impending famine .

		From the first the cry was , `` The Germans , '' and in the three official letters which Potterat wrote just before his death the same note of alarm and patriotic resistance is repeated .

		Little master - pieces of common sense are these letters : one to General
Joffre	PERSON	, one to
King Albert	ORGANIZATION	, and one to the supreme federal council of
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		`` Neutrality , '' as
Potterat	PERSON	said to his little son , `` is a sort of Labyrinth ; you go in , but you ca n't come out again .

		A month ago you were neu - tral , but you did n't know it . ''

		The value of this novel , the last in a series of three in which Potterat is the central figure , lies in its description of the thoughts and emotions of a people threatened with invasion .

		It em - phatically can not be considered as embodying un - officially the sentiments of the Swiss nation as a whole .

		It must be remembered that this is the point of view of a French Swiss , for both Potterat and
M. Vallaton	ORGANIZATION	are
Vaudois	ORGANIZATION	.

		Re - peated and melancholy evidences imply the domi - nation in
Switzerland	LOCATION	of the German Swiss .

		Chiding the supreme council for inaction at the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	, it is Potterat himself who writes : `` It is
William Tell	PERSON	's country , and no other , which ought to take the lead in doing the right thing ; for no one will ever convince me that our neutrality absolves us from the claims of humanity ... There are thousands of people who think as I do , especially amongst the mass of the people , who are the backbone of the nation . ''

		The diction of this anonymous translation is most agreeably fluent English .

Scribners	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 4.50	MONEY	.

		Readers who followed the Archbishop of the Yukon across the white wastes of wintry
Alaska	LOCATION	in his `` Ten Thousand Miles in a Dog Sled '' will be eager to ship with him on his `` Voyages on the Yukon . ''

		They will recognize old friends of the snowy trails , and meet anew the ever - present and never-solved problem of the corrod - ing and disintegrating influence of our vaunted civilization upon the simple and sturdy savages so-called of
Alaska	LOCATION	's forests and steppes .

		The lure of gold brings the adventurer whose mush - room cities linger on the map long after the weight of the winter 's snows has crushed to the earth vacated saloon and flimsy dance hall , and
summer	DATE	's floods have washed away the litter with which the birds of passage have fouled the wilderness .

		But changing seasons bring no re - lief to the native peoples from the ills which the white man has left in the village , nor will the lapse of centuries redeem the now mongrel stock .

		Bishop Stuck portrays
Alaska	LOCATION	as it is , a land where nature and man alike are elemental and at times catastrophic .

		The sordid and the heroic mingle here and crowd one another , for not all men have gone to Iditarod and
Circle City	ORGANIZATION	for gold alone .

		The book is well illus - trated , and full of interest from cover to cover .

		It is revealing for one who plans a
summer	DATE	in
Alaska	LOCATION	for business or pleasure and should be read by every one who concerns himself with our national obligations to the people of this much neglected country .

		THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF
ROBERT COLL	PERSON	- YER .

		By
John Haynes Holmes	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		On first opening these inviting volumes , so full of interests and ideals calculated to induce a blessed if momentary forgetfulness of our present subjection to the tyranny of war , one found this passage : `` We are full of the war .

		The whole country is a great camp and drill ground .

		The spirit that has been called out ... is the grandest thing ever seen in the country , per - haps in the world . ''

		And more in similar strain .

		Of course it is the Civil War that is re - ferred to , and most heartily did the `` blacksmith preacher '' throw himself into the cause of free - dom , as he doubtless would to-day , were he alive , into that of a vastly larger emancipation .

		Hero - ism and romance were not wanting to that full and varied life , with its successive experience of the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	moors and unlovely manufacturing villages , of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	farms and their tillers , of strenuous
Chicago	LOCATION	in its marvelous growth , and of the great and bewildering metropolis with its cosmopolitan population .

		This heroism and this romance are set forth with literary skill , and also with the charm of homely reality , in the biography faithfully compiled from abundant autobiographical and other authoritative sources by the famous preacher 's colleague in the closing years of his long ministry .

		Fortunate is the biographer to whom is assigned , as to Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	was assigned by the
Collyer	PERSON	family , so worthy and inspiring a theme ; and fortunate is he whose life-story is told with so warm a sym - pathy and so true an understanding as have been brought to the present task .

		THE ODES AND SECULAR HYMN OF
HORACE	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Warren H. Cud	PERSON	- worth .

		Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		To most readers
Horace	PERSON	means two things .

		He is the amiable prophet of a genial philosophy ; and he is the writer of verse never surpassed in grace , dignity , and point .

		An English translation of
Horace	ORGANIZATION	is successful so far as it preserves at once his formal perfection and the spirit of his philosophy .

		Mr.
Cudworth	PERSON	has set himself a high standard of formal execution , to which he adheres to a remarkable degree .

		Though he does not keep the metres of the original poems , he systematically substitutes for them strophes which usually approximate in effect the Latin forms , and he wisely makes use of rhyme with unvarying accuracy .

		He demonstrates , what many would not have believed , that English verse is capable of as great compactness and brevity of phrasing as is Latin verse .

		In some cases however Mr.
Cudworth	PERSON	has been unfortunate in his choice of metres ; his unrelieved iambic lines are too heavy to carry the effect of the Sapphic and the Alcaic strophes ; one waits in suspense for the tripping dactyls which one asso - ciates with the originals .

		Perhaps , indeed , it is Mr.
Cudworth	PERSON	's faith - fulness to his principles that has at times pre - vented him from conveying the tone of
Horace	PERSON	.

		`` There are occasions , as every scholar knows , '' writes
Martin	PERSON	, `` where to be faithful to the let - ter is to be most unfaithful to the spirit of an author . ''

		Mr.
Cudworth	PERSON	has by no means been unfaithful to
Horace	LOCATION	; but he might with advan - tage have allowed himself a little more elasticity of treatment .

		His rendering of the first strophe of `` Integer Vitae '' is as near the words of
Horace	PERSON	as is that of
Martin	LOCATION	; it is perhaps more fluent English : The man of upright life and conduct clean Needs neither Moorish javelin nor bow , Nor quiver ,
Fuscus	PERSON	, stuffed with arrows keen Whose tips with venom flow .

		244 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	Yet its movement does not suggest so well that of the original as does
Martin	PERSON	's version :
Fuscus	PERSON	, the man of life upright and pure Needeth nor javelin , nor bow of
Moor	ORGANIZATION	, Nor arrows tipped with venom deadly-sure , Loading his quiver .

		It is of course unfair to judge either translation by a quotation of four lines ; but Mr.
Cudworth	PERSON	's work sustains such an even level that one may turn almost at random for examples that illus - trate both his merits and his short-comings .

		In a field where success can at best be only rela - tive , he has in large measure attained success ; where he has fallen short , the defect has been in part inevitable , and has been the result of his rigid adherence to a preconceived notion .

		The prefatory sonnet `` To Horace '' shows sympathy with the poet .

		It is a pity that it con - tains the noun `` uplifts '' that word of unhappy memory .

		Horace , though in his way a moralist , would not have relished the word with its pres - ent associations .

		A SHORT HISTORY OF
ROME	LOCATION	.

		By
Gugli	PERSON	- elmo
Ferrero	PERSON	and
Corrado Barbagallo	PERSON	.

		Vol .

		I : The Monarchy and the Republic .

		Put - nams ;
$ 1.90	MONEY	.

		In this first volume
Ferrero	PERSON	and
Barbagallo	PERSON	present us with a brilliant and coherent account of the history of
Rome	LOCATION	from the foundation of the city to the death of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	.

		Many readers who are familiar with
Ferrero	PERSON	's larger work will be interested by the attitude which he now adopts towards the traditional records .

		With few exceptions , he defends the tradition against the conjectural emendations which have been so popular with the Germans and with
Ferrero	PERSON	's own compatriot
Ettore Pais	PERSON	; and per - haps the only startling novelty for which he is partly responsible is his suggestion that
Rome	LOCATION	under the later kings `` ardently pursued a com - mercial career . ''

		If this expansion of
Schweg	LOCATION	- ler 's theory is sound , and if it is true that the establishment of the republic was caused by a reaction of the Latin aristocracy against the com - mercial policy of Etruscan kings , we should indeed have a partial explanation of the slight amount of Greek influence discernible in the first centuries of the republic .

		Ferrero devotes some of his best pages to the discussion of the reasons which at the beginning of the second century
B.C.	LOCATION	made
Rome	LOCATION	averse to the further extension of her empire .

		Such a policy is , as
Ferrero	PERSON	says , almost incomprehen - sible to those who are accustomed to the `` insa - tiable lust of territory which for two hundred years has possessed the states of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' ; and his account of the relation between corruption and progress proceeds with great dramatic power down to the time when there was no longer a commonwealth sustained by a body of citizens , but instead a chaos out of which emerged an autocrat supported by an army .

		One wishes that more space might have been given to the peculiarly subversive effects of Greek thought upon the traditions of
Rome	LOCATION	, both political and religious ; but the limitations imposed upon a single volume are severe , and the composition as a whole is admirable .

		Mr.
George Chrystal	PERSON	, the translator , has done his work well .

		PROFESSIONALISM AND ORIGINALITY : With an Appendix of Suggestions on Professional , Administrative , and
Educational Topics	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
F. H. Hayward	PERSON	, D.Lit. , B.Sc .

		Open Court ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		Life , Dr.
Hayward	PERSON	argues , is a series of im - pulsions and compulsions .

		Some spark of genius is in each of us , while even the greatest genius can not entirely escape the commonplace .

		The antinomy is most evident in those pursuits which have become most highly specialized and in which society is wont to repose most faith .

		The professions law , medicine , teaching are exam - ples of such departmentalized compulsions .

		The professional ethics is designed to protect the member of the profession against those blunders for which the public should hold him responsible .

		Worse still , by its insistence on the common - place in its `` Specialists '' it tends to strangle orig - inality and hamper progress .

		The original man is one who responds most alertly to those impul - sions not shared by his fellows and , because he is different and apart from them , is frowned upon as an innovator and an enemy to the common cause .

		So true is this that his merited recog - nition comes only with posthumous fame ; the present generation can not recognize the stigmata of genius possessed by its contemporaries .

		By way of reform let the various professions formu - late their respective programmes and express defi - nitely the tenets of their faith , the goals of their efforts .

		This will at once sweep away the cob - webs of mysticism that now conceal their real missions and will admit an understanding criti - cism from which they , as well as a larger society , will reap a benefit .

		Mr.
Hayward	PERSON	shows his own originality in his incisive and sometimes caustic arraignment of his own as well as other professions , but his uniform way of pigeon-holing his data is a det - riment to the presentation .

		The elfishness of a genius of a
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, for example would have shattered these formal classifications and offered a more varied and enticing argument .

		But the criticism is usually solid , the thought is original at many angles , and the arraignment of profes - sionalism contains many practical suggestions for
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 245 reform .

		Though its tone may not make it popu - lar with professional men , the professions , should they heed its counsels , would certainly gain in popularity with the uninitiated .

		THE ART OF
GEORGE FREDERICK MUNN	PERSON	.

		Edited by
Margaret Crosby Munn	PERSON	and
Mary R. Cabot	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by
Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Button ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		It seems odd to read the biography of an American artist of the present generation , who received his art education or the greater part of it in
London	LOCATION	instead of in
Munich	LOCATION	or
Paris	LOCATION	, and whose earliest formative influences were those of
Ruskin	PERSON	and the
South Kensington	LOCATION	Art Schools rather than of the boulevard and the atelier .

		It is true that , as Sir
Johnston Forbes	PERSON	-
Robertson	PERSON	tells us in his brief but sympathetic introduction ,
Munn	PERSON	, a fellow-student of
Frank Dicksee	ORGANIZATION	and
Percy Macquoid	PERSON	among others , be - came dissatisfied with the opportunities offered by the Academy Schools and went to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		There he pursued his studies for a time at
Julien	ORGANIZATION	's and
Munkacsy	ORGANIZATION	's studios ; but he soon returned to
London	LOCATION	, where he attracted the attention of
G. F. Watts	PERSON	-LRB- as he had previously of Leighton -RRB- , who gave him work , and his associations remained , on the whole , with English art and artists , as long as his health , permanently broken by an attack of typhus in
Venice	LOCATION	in
1883	DATE	, per - mitted him to live abroad .

		Yet he never entered wholly into the English tradition .

		His strong admiration for
Velasquez	PERSON	and
Whistler	LOCATION	saved him from that .

		There is a literary flavor to much of his work it was the poetic sentiment of his `` In Chancery '' that appealed to Hon.
Stephen Coleridge	PERSON	, one of his principal patrons but he consciously eschewed the anecdote ; and in land - scape he early came under the spell of the great Barbizon painters , the spirit of whose work he interpreted in his own naive , naturalistic ,
Ameri	LOCATION	- can manner .

		Yet his paintings often have also a fine decorative feeling .

		Most of his pictures are owned in
England	LOCATION	; so that , in spite of one memorial exhibition in
New York	LOCATION	, shortly after his premature death in
1907	DATE	at the age of fifty - six he had , however , long ceased to produce there has been little opportunity for his powers to be recognized in his own country .

		But the late
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	contributed a warm appre - ciation of him to `` Scribner 's Magazine '' in
1908	DATE	; and this , reprinted in its entirety , with a brief memoir giving the essential facts of his brilliant promise and his broken career , might have served
Munn	PERSON	's posthumous fame better than the present book , with its rather miscellaneous and turgid tribute to his art , character , con - versation , and personal charm .

		BRAHMADARSANAM OR INTUITION OF THE ABSOLUTE .

		By
Sri Ananda Acharya	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Western culture has shown a singular lack of interest in the philosophy of ancient
India	LOCATION	.

		This has been due partly no doubt to linguistic ob - stacles , but partly also to Western provincialism .

		Aside from books by missionaries who were ob - viously special pleaders for the occidental plan of salvation , Hindu philosophy was , until re - cently , practically inaccessible to all but a few linguistic experts and those who could read the language of the commentators .

		Of late , however , books dealing with the characteristically Hindu view of life , written by native scholars and in - tended for laymen in the western world , have been making their appearance in gratifying num - bers .

		Sri
Ananda Acharya	PERSON	's `` Brahmadarsanam '' belongs to this class .

		In spite of one 's more or less vague appre - ciation of the age of the civilization of the far East , one is surprised to find well-developed Hindu systems of thought many centuries before the rise of philosophy in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		And one is pleased to come upon the germs of doctrines with which one has been long familiar in their devel - oped form .

		The author of the present volume thus does the reader a genuine service by pre - disposing him to examine further .

		He also succeeds in showing that underneath external differences of approach , terminology , and style of argument , Hindu philosophy concerns itself with one problem , employs one method , and comes to one conclusion .

		The central problem is the escape from the prison of finitude ; its method is concentrated introspection ; the solu - tion is the vision of the self as one with the soul of the infinite .

		In spite of its excellencies , however , the book fails to arouse enthusiasm .

		Like our own his - torians of philosophy the author feels it necessary to say something about so many things that he can say only a little about anything .

		Then , too , his words often lack flesh and blood meanings .

		The introduction of numerous Hindu terms , to - gether with their definitions , adds to the diffi - culty of reading intelligently , for one can hardly digest the ordinary philosophic terminology , and consequently one leaves the book with one 's mind in a confused state .

		The author is , moreover , in - clined to mistake vigorous assertion for logical demonstration , and his assertions regarding West - ern philosophies and philosophers often rest upon nothing more solid than a string of ambiguities .

		Nevertheless , the reader of the book carries away a distinct feeling of the age of Hindu specula - tion and of the significance of soul in Hindu philosophy perhaps just what the author in - tended to accomplish .

		246 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT WAR OFFERS SMALL OPPORTUNITY FOR laughter , but the zeal with which certain gen - tlemen have undertaken their self-appointed task of censorship has reached a pitch which brings their activities almost into the realm of opera bouffe .

		One of the most amusing recent in - stances is that of Mr.
Henry A. Wise Wood	PERSON	, chairman of the
Conference Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Na - tional Preparedness , who exhibited a bad attack of hysteria in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune . ''

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	sent the `` Tribune '' a statement denounc - ing `` The Nature of Peace , '' by
Thorstein Veb	PERSON	- len , as `` the most damnable piece of pro-German propaganda that the Federal authorities have overlooked '' !

		This misrepresentation he fortified with a series of quotations so clearly divorced from the context that one can only marvel at the spectacle of his intellectual blindness .

		It is no secret that Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's book is an extremely ingenious and powerful argument for the theory that until the menace of German militarism has been utterly destroyed it is not possible to think of world peace .

		A similar spectacle is furnished by one Dr.
William H. Hobbs	PERSON	, of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, whose highly strung nerves caused him to publish in the
Detroit	LOCATION	`` Free Press '' equally unwarranted and perverse conclusions concerning `` The Nature of Peace . ''

		A few days after publishing Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's letter the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' in retracting , sadly observed that the incident had caused them to lose faith in the intuitive habit of thought .

		It is to be hoped that this and similar incidents will cause a long patient public also to lose faith in these `` in - tuitive '' zealots , who seem to have determined that nobody except themselves shall say anything .

		The country ought soon to be thoroughly weary of these half-baked alarmists .

		IN
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW	PERSON	'S RECENT RE - view of `` The Free Press , '' by
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	, he concludes with the following characteristically provoking paragraph : My own most polemical writings are to be found in the files of the `` Times , '' the `` Morning Post , '' the `` Daily Express , '' the `` World , '' and the ``
Saturday	DATE	Review . ''

		I found out early in my career that a Con - servative paper may steal a horse when a Radical paper dare not look over a hedge , and that the rich , though very determined that the poor shall read noth - ing unconventional , are equally determined not to be preached at themselves .

		In short , I found that only for the classes would I be allowed , and indeed tacitly required , to write on revolutionary assumptions .

		I filled their columns with sedition ; and they filled my pockets -LRB- not very deep ones then -RRB- with money .

		In the press , as in other departments , the greatest free - dom may be found where there is least talk about it .

		Why provoking ?

		Because although this may be quite true of
Shaw	PERSON	and his experiences , it can hardly be so easy for the smaller fry .

		If you are brilliant and amusing you may talk atheism in a theological seminary , write in the most conserva - tive and patriotic magazine something that would land a less clever author in jail for disloyalty , or discuss the social value of sabotage in the `` Wall Street Journal . ''

		Give us
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's wit and dramatic sense and intellect , and we guarantee that we could advocate polygamy in a staid relig - ious weekly or non-resistance in the report of the
National Security League	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be unham - pered in what you say , it is only necessary to be as clever as
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		But for most of us , who are duller and probably less serious , the number of magazines that will welcome our polemic writ - ings will never seem so large as to furnish an embarrassment of journalistic riches .

		WlLL THE PEDAGOGUES LEAVE US NO COZy corners in the house of letters , neither closet nor attic to explore and lounge in unoppressed by some prim guide to the world 's best literature ?

		Is there to come a time when no good old book can be reprinted without the editorial meddling of a diplomaed mentor , long on culture but short on `` juice de vivre , '' whose foreword , hindword , notes , and bibliography quaintly paginated in lower-case Roman must needs obscure the text they pretend to illumine ?

		These queries are prompted by a recent pedagogical invasion of that last intimate retreat where children might forget the impertinence of school `` Alice in Wonder - land . ''


William J. Long	PERSON	conducts this drive , munitioned by
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and reluctantly con - voyed by
Oliver Herford	PERSON	, who -LRB- to do him jus - tice -RRB- has no stomach for the sorry business .

		The illustrator 's heart , one conjectures from his prefa - tory `` Apology '' in verse , is in
Tenniel	PERSON	's boots along with his feet .

		But the editor is shameless in spoliation of
Carroll	ORGANIZATION	's province .

		There he turns things topsy-turvy , installing on page iii a `` Finale '' and on page 205 a `` Foreword . ''

		Then he violates the good don 's Oxford privacy and pulls from its decent niche the skeleton of Car - roll 's double life .

		Meanwhile , inevitably , there have been `` notes '' `` Notes and Harmonies , '' an - nounces the editor .

		Listen to a few of the sweet harmonics with which Mr.
Long	PERSON	accompanies
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	: A hookah is a kind of machine or thingumajig which the Turks use for smoking ... Like most wild sea birds , the dodo was quite tame .

		Still , he was never , as you might say , a dodomestic bird ... They call one creature a tortoise because he has crooked feet , and another creature they call a porpoise be - cause he looks something like a porcus or hog .

		And sailors twist the twisted tortoise till he becomes turtle , but they ca n't twist the untwisted porpoise till he becomes purple .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 247 This is not nonsense ; nonsense is always serenely unconscious that it is not the whole sense .

		Any child will at once recognize this for a stilted , patronizing imitation by a self-conscious `` Olym - pian '' and will politely draw away from it , at the same time -LRB- more 's the pity ! -RRB-

		drawing away from
Wonderland	LOCATION	.

		Nor is it education , of which our editor spreads a hopeful report : Language is queer ; there 's no telling what some words really mean ... It 's just a fashion of speak - ing , with no sense to it ... If a child ate too many -LSB- comfits -RSB- , there might come fits .

		Hence the name , to scare you properly .

		But you will not find any such reasonable explanation in the dictionary .

		If you bother with such books , you may have to learn -LSB- our italics -RSB- that `` to comfit '' means to pre - serve ... Nowadays , in proper schools , he -LSB- the Mouse -RSB- would read five or six history books , all different , and not learn anything in particular ; which is , you see , the great advantage of modern education .

		Yet , after all , the heinous crime of `` Alice 's '' editor is to spoil transparent nonsense with silly explanations and to rub the bloom off words of glamor which children love because they only half understand them .

		Criticizing
Carroll	PERSON	for parodying `` Star of the Evening , '' Mr.
Long	PERSON	quotes a stanza of the mawkish original and adds , `` Some things should be let alone , especially things that have the two virtues of being old and being good . ''

		They should indeed !

		THE DIAL be - speaks for this outrage the attention of the So - ciety for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children	ORGANIZATION	.

		If , while yet in school , its officers had ``
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' `` The Pilgrim 's Progress , '' `` The Child 's Garden , '' and alas !

		how many other golden books thus tarnished for them , they will find a way to deal with these insatiable pedagogues .

		THB `` BELLMAN '' RECENTLY LAUNCHED A tirade against the selfish publishers who want to have repealed the War Revenue Act of
October 3 , 1917	DATE	the so-called `` Zone System '' measure solely because the new postal rates rob them of profits .

		Of course , in so far as publishers as a class are trying to evade their just contributions to the cost of the war , they merit all the invec - tive which can be hurled at them .

		No one wants , any more than the `` Bellman , '' to see poor maga - zines `` subsidized '' by the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it is a singularly ungracious remark of the editor 's that it would be a good thing if half the magazines in the country were put out of business .

		Perhaps they should be ; we should be the last to sing their literary or intellectual merits .

		Yet undesirable as it may be that certain publishers should get what might be called strategic profits , or that trivial magazines should flourish in the land , it is far more important that
America	LOCATION	should not see introduced the principle of discrimination .

		For once magazines come to be discriminated against on the ground of their intrinsic merit , who is going to be the judge ?

		The literary man who dislikes trade journals ?

		The business man , who thinks that the `` movies '' already take up enough of his employees ' time without devising for them further distractions from their job in magazines with pictures and `` stories '' of their favorite heroines ?

		The conservative who dis - likes all radicalism ?

		or the radical who would cheat us from the pleasure of seeing the `` North American Review '' ?

		Really , none of us would be safe in such a capricious world , and who can say whether or not the `` Bellman '' itself might not be excommunicated ?

		Perhaps the censor , if exceptionally intelligent , would rule that a maga - zine could attack anything it wished so long as it was just to its opponents .

		Under that test the `` Bellman '' would not fare any too well .

		For it does not even touch the real objection to the `` Zone System , '' which is simply the ancient one of freedom of communication , guaranteed by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is it necessary in this day of en - lightenment to point out that the true function of the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	is not to ape a corporation , in - terested primarily in dividends , but to provide a cheap and easy means for the interchange of ideas and the free circulation of opinion ?

		Democracy grows on its foolishness almost as much as on its wisdom .

		Until people have been interested in reading soap advertisements and sentimental stories , they can hardly be expected to be inter - ested in the kind of literature the `` Bellman '' would wish to see them reading .

		It is through this kind of progress that we gradually emerge from petty localism into a broader tolerance , a better taste , and a more general spread of ideas .

		The `` Zone System '' would tend to keep us pro- vincial .

		* `` IT IS WELL TO BE CAUTIOUS IN STATEMENT about any contemporary book . ''

		`` A half-truth is often of extreme simplicity ; but the whole truth is usually of such complication that the utmost effort is necessary in order merely to state it . ''

		THE DIAL might safely offer a large prize to the first reader to guess the author of these sentiments .

		Some backward looking doctor of deliberation ?

		Some hesitant meticulous assem - bler of metaphysical gear ?

		Dear reader , not at all .

		Those words were written by none other than our national apostle of the contemporary and practitioner of the snap - judgment , the Hon.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		They may be found in a recent `` Outlook '' in a `` notice '' which some - how escaped being a preface of Henry Fair - field
Osborn	PERSON	's `` Origin and Evolution of Life . ''

		248 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 14	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION A unique little volume of its kind is an `` In - troduction to Political Philosophy , '' by
H. P. Farrell	PERSON	-LRB- Longmans , Green ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , outlining the mas - terpieces of political thinking from the days of Plato through the historical and ethical schools of the past generation .

		Aside from a brief introduc - tory chapter , there is little comment by the author , the greater part of the text being taken up with a remarkably lucid outline of the theories of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Locke	PERSON	,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and the analyti - cal and historical jurists .

		At one point the author de - parts somewhat from this method in criticizing rather sharply the `` great error in political phil - osophy '' perpetrated by the contract theorists .

		As a handbook and guide the volume is valuable , but the diligent student will wish to go much farther afield , especially into modern theories of society and the state .


Greenwich Village	LOCATION	runs true to form in `` The Lady of Kingdoms '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , the newest novel by
Inez Haynes Irwin	PERSON	.

		Disguising a zeal - ous dose of feminism under a veil of modern romance , Mrs.
Irwin	PERSON	guides the reader through 500 pages of alternate thrills and heart-searching conversations to a triumphant conclusion .

		There seems to be a subtle conviction in the mind of every Village Dweller , no matter how kindly , that he or she is divinely appointed to open the eyes of the plodding conservative ; and to this end we are bidden to watch the antics of their almost plaus - ible puppets .

		These , in the present instance , are happily provided with money , clothes , looks , edu - cation , and docile relatives , and they dance very gracefully into each other 's arms , or out of them , without mishap .

		Two young ladies in a Cape Cod hamlet , each with a sex problem , are the principal actors .

		To them are added , during a summer holiday , the Real Villagers ; the problems are brought forward , discussed , and solved by the un - fettered
City Dwellers	ORGANIZATION	, and at the end of the book everybody has developed into superman be - hind the gloriously falling curtain .

		The effort of sustaining two stories of almost equal interest proves here , as often , too great .

		The effect is patchy , and each career loses verisimilitude .

		De - scriptions of scenes and occasions are varied and striking , though the recurrence of `` butter-colored lace '' and taxis `` boiling up to the curb '' palls upon the reader .


James Lane Allen	PERSON	's `` Kentucky Warbler '' -LRB- Doubleday Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- is a pallid attempt at a reproduction of the crystallizing point of ado - lescence .

		This delicate feat is reserved for the very few to accomplish with anything like perfection ; Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's sun-parlor methods leave the reader convinced that no serious encroachments have been made on hallowed ground .

		The book contains a very interesting biography of
Alexander Wilson	PERSON	, the naturalist , around which the story itself is built , and there is effective vocational material there for those who can use it .

		Private
Dubb	PERSON	, whose exploits at camp have been delighting the devotees of newspaper comics , now shows his insouciant baby stare between boards in `` That Rookie from the 13th Squad , '' by Lieut.
P. L. Crosby	PERSON	-LRB- Harpers ; 75 cts . -RRB-

		.

		These cartoons would make a Rookie 's Progress from initial re - veille to appointment as private of the first class -LRB- with increased pay -RRB- , but for one fact Mr.
Dubb	PERSON	does not progress .

		It was in
October	DATE	that he hung two bright stars on either shoulder because he thought they looked `` awfully snappy '' on an officer he had seen ; in
January	DATE	he was found in possession of a full line of officers ' insignia `` I heard there was going to be some promotions and I want to be ready for such emergencies . ''

		Sentry - go he can not master .

		In
October	DATE	he offered to shake hands with a colonel he had halted ; in
December	DATE	he halted and unhorsed a mounted colonel , though nobody had posted him in the road he was `` just practicing '' ; and only the other night he kept the officer of the post waiting in the rain while he vainly tried to remember what fol - lows `` Advance and be recognized ! ''

		in the sentry 's ritual .

		Not that
Dubb	PERSON	's life is monotonous .

		On parade , in barracks , at mess , under the pup tent , at the hospital , on the rifle range , in bayonet or grenade or gas mask drill , encountering the fair sex while on duty or on leave , and trotting to head - quarters to `` be measured for a horse , ''
Dubb	PERSON	suf - fers every mischance that simplicity can invite , enduring all with a fetching good-nature not un - mixed with wonder .

		American financial administration has been like that of a spendthrift with superabundant resources .

		A necessary war economy will , however , popularize a demand , hitherto confined to observant individ - uals , for a complete reform in our system of governmental estimates , appropriations , and expen - ditures .

		While we can not blindly adopt a foreign system of financial administration , an understand - ing of the excellencies in English methods will afford a proper basis for the reconstruction of our own methods .


William F.	PERSON	and
Westel	ORGANIZATION	W. Wil - loughby and
S. M. Lindsay	PERSON	, the authors of `` The
System of Financial Administration	ORGANIZATION	of Great Brit - ain '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 2.75	MONEY	-RRB- , are thoroughly conversant with American governmental methods and are con - sequently well fitted to conduct an investigation of the English system .

		They have succeeded in stating their results in non-technical language and in a form intelligible to the general reader .

		They discuss the fundamental principles which underlie public finance .

		They then trace the financial pro- cedure of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, beginning with depart - mental preparation of estimates , describe the subsequent incorporation of these in a general par - liamentary budget , the action of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	upon the same , the functions performed by the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	, and finally the methods of expenditure and accounting .

		In a concluding chap - ter of the book the results of the investigation are summarized with direct reference and application to American conditions .

		Another important finan - cial book is `` Foreign Exchange Explained , '' by
Franklin Escher	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		A practical and at the same time a sound economic , and not too academic , discussion of foreign exchange has long been needed , and this book by one acquainted both with actual business and with university
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 249 teaching must prove of value to the economic stu - dent and to the business man as well .

		Its value lies in the fact that it elucidates the underlying principles of foreign exchange as well as the actual conditions existing today .

		The most valuable chap - ters in the book are perhaps those on international banking , pars of exchange , principal rates of ex - change , the foreign exchange market , gold and its movement , and bankers ' long bills .

		The question is discussed whether or no the dollar is to replace the pound sterling as the dominant factor in world exchange .

		Not the least valuable part of the book is an appendix in which is given in outline the monetary systems of the world .

		A book of this kind is a sign of the times and shows that the trade of the
United States	LOCATION	is rapidly becoming international in scope .

		`` State Sanitation , '' by
George Chandler Whipple	PERSON	-LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is a chrono - logical series of reprints and abstracts of papers selected by the editor from the annual and special reports of the
Massachusetts State Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	.

		Owing to the fact that this board was a pioneer in this country in undertaking thorough - going and scientific work in public health and sani - tation , the papers constitute a series of classics on the subject .

		The volume contains articles on water supplies , sewage disposal , stream pollution , filtration , microorganisms of water and air , typhoid fever , diphtheria , and infantile paralysis .

		Addresses on the relation of the state to public health ; on the liquor problem ; on milk , food , and drug in - spection ; and on preventive medicine and kindred topics in the social relations of medicine are to be found here from men eminent as authorities and contributors to medicine and sanitation .

		Municipal and sanitary engineers , physicians , public health of - ficials , and others having responsibilities in these fields will find both information and incentive in these carefully selected and informing treatises .

		The lines in `` Verses of Idle Hours , '' by
O. Ches	PERSON	- ter
Brodhay	PERSON	-LRB-
Frederick C. Browne	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, are said to have been written in the `` idle hours '' which the author has snatched `` from his active duties in the business world . ''

		They are not , it is true , the effusions of the well-known T. B. M. ; but the platitudinous thoughts expressed in stere - otyped phrases , the cloying sentimentality , and the poor workmanship support the view that the man in the street has never been able to tame
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.

		The technique is slip-shod : rhymes like `` born '' and `` storm '' abound ; and a scheme as loose as the following is not rare : a , B , c , D , e , d , f , d , g , D , h , B the capitals signifying the use of the same word .

		Here is a couplet typical in form and content : What happy , happy days , gentle Mary dear !

		Memory has not failed me through many a. year .

		A reader opening the book at random might be tempted to consider it satirical , but careful perusal of its pages discloses a solemn puritanism and such cloudy metaphysics as no keen ironist could imagine .

		In one long ode , an ambitious `` transposition '' of `` Thanatopsis , '' the author declares that `` Life is God , the One Intelligence , the only Power . ''

		Sub - sequently he remarks that `` our greatest thoughts are seldom known , '' and concludes that these me - teorites are `` God 's presence . ''

		This curious and , it would almost seem , unconscious denial of the intellect is repeated less rhetorically in the various sentimental jingles of which the book is full .

		It is probably at the root of the author 's belief that poetry can be the work of idle hours , that it can do with anything less than the complete fusion of emotion and intellectual passion .

		COMMUNICATION WHY CRITICS SHOULD BE EDUCATED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		For the information of those of your readers who may have read Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's article in your issue of
February 14	DATE	, permit me to state that most of the verses in my `` First Offering '' were written before I had any connections with a uni - versity .

		I do n't know where your critic obtained his information that I have been `` brought up at a university '' ; however , he should be congratulated upon having picked out for quotation as a speci - men of my art the worst eight lines I have ever written .

		He could not possibly have done better .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	argues that a poet should not be educated .

		Certainly he has not permitted an education to spoil his own work , and his method of criticism is an eloquent argument on `` Why Critics Should Be Educated . ''

		It is really unnec - essary to offer a defense of scholarship in Poetry : it would be as superfluous to emphasize that as to emphasize the need of a knowledge of the sea in the training of a sailor .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	belongs to a curious group of writers who possess what one might call a talent for self assertion , which , in the absence of a vigorous art , has been accepted as literary genius .

		This group has even attained a certain yellow-press distinction .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	writes vigorously in defense of his group ; but no amount of such argument will make their temporary prestige tenable in the presence of the development of a real poetic art in this country .

		SAMUEL
ROTH	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- EDITORS ' NOTE : Mr.
Roth	PERSON	may properly feel aggrieved that his book of verse , `` First Offering , '' should have been judged by Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	as a post-University product instead of as an ante -
University	ORGANIZATION	product , which it really was , although the intrinsic merit of the volume is not in any way lowered or raised by this irrelevant fact .

		And , as Mr.
Roth	PERSON	himself tacitly admits , Mr. Un - termeyer 's judgment was not wholly incorrect ; he does , indeed , congratulate his critic on selecting for quotation `` the worst eight lines I have ever written . ''

		In other words , what Mr.
Roth	PERSON	dis - closes in his letter may be somewhat damaging for Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's paradoxical theory , but it hardly makes out a case against Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's taste .

		As for the amiable weakness of blowing one 's own horn , which has been commonly supposed to be a characteristic of poets in general , would Mr.
Roth	PERSON	contend that he departs from the normal in this particular ? -RSB-

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 271 Forward Movements In Education NEW EXPERIMENTS AND METHODS IN VARIOUS FIELDS WORK SUCCESSFULLY IN THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION `` WAR FRENCH When war was declared by the
United States	LOCATION	, certain professors of French realized that in the months to come thousands of American men and women would go to
France	LOCATION	to serve on or behind the battle line .

		Very few of these could under - stand or speak French .

		The teachers of French realized that ignorance or knowledge of the French language might in many instances make the dif - ference between delay and speed , between blunder - ing and efficiency , between suffering and relief , be - tween death and life .

		The faculty of the
Romance Department of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	saw that an opportunity was presented for rendering signal service to their country .

		Under the leadership of
Ernest H. Wil	PERSON	- kins and
Algernon Coleman	PERSON	, instruction in French was given to classes at
Fort Sheridan	LOCATION	, to various groups and organizations in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and to students at
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lessons were developed to meet the special needs of soldiers , doctors , and nurses .

		After the lessons had been used in mimeograph form in these and subsequent classes , they were published in convenient text - book form for future use .

		After almost a year 's experience a new text - book for soldiers , `` Army French , '' has been pre - pared and recently published , which instructors in various camps report as being better adapted to their needs than any other book they have seen .

		This text , the text for doctors and nurses , and the supplementary reader or conversation book are all widely and successfully used .

		MATHEMATICS Criticism has been made for years regarding the inefficiency of the work in the field of secondary - school mathematics .

		It has been pointed out that only a small percentage of the students who begin the subject complete the course ; it has been felt that the work is not vitalized ; that interest is lack - ing on the part of the students .

		Experiments con - ducted in the
University High School of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	demonstrated that the obstacles could largely be overcome by teaching arithmetic , algebra , geometry , and trigonometry as one subject in the form of general mathematics .

		Thus the abstractions have been made concrete , and the material of each topic has aided in the understanding of the others .

		The result is a successful series of textbooks by
Ernst R. Breslich	PERSON	, Head of the
Department of Mathematics	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Chicago High School	ORGANIZATION	, which is being successfully used in public and private schools throughout the country .

		ECONOMICS There was a time when classes finished the prescribed textbook and stopped .

		The opinions of one man on the many important questions were a law and gospel to the student .

		Today in most colleges , classes use books of readings selected from all sources and written by experts in each particular field .

		The series is known as Materials for
the Study of Economics	ORGANIZATION	.

		This series of source books and outlines , at present seven in number and rapidly growing , has been developed in the
Department of Political Economy	ORGANIZATION	of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The student is afforded an un - biased view because the books present both sides of a question .

		A new series , Material for the
Study of Business	ORGANIZATION	, under the editorship of
Leon C. Marshall	PERSON	, Dean of the
School of Commerce and Administration of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has recently been initiated with the publication of a textbook on `` Quarter - master and Ordnance Supply '' prepared by instruct - ors in the
Ordnance Course	ORGANIZATION	at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second volume , `` Readings in Indus - trial Society , '' compiled by the editor of the series , is scheduled for
spring	DATE	publication .

		Other volumes are in preparation .

		LITERATURE We learn to appreciate literature not so much by reading about literature as by reading the literature itself .


Walter C. Bronson	PERSON	, of Brown Uni - Name versity , was one to appreciate this fact and he set to work to assemble the best of English poetry .

		Position American poetry , and American prose in handy volumes .

		Illustrative and explanatory notes fur - Address nish a variety of interesting side-lights and information about the authors and the selections .

		When writing to advertisers please mention TJIK DIAL .

		Further aids to the study and interpretation of literature are available , and include a work by
Percy H. Boynton	PERSON	on
London	LOCATION	in the various liter - ary periods , an introduction to literary theory and interpretation by
Richard G. Moulton	PERSON	, and a special method of conducting classes in Shakespeare by
Albert H. Tolman	PERSON	.

		RELIGIOUS EDUCATION The present awakening in religious education dates back more than twenty years , and counts as one of its sources the energy of
William Rainey Harper	PERSON	, first President of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		To him and to his colleague ,
Ernest D. Burton	PERSON	of the
New Testament Department of the University	ORGANIZATION	, we owe the plans for the production of a series of textbooks , The Constructive Studies .

		which gives to religious education in the
Sunday	DATE	School and elsewhere the same serious and digni - fied character that has so long been a recognized standard of the day school .

		This series now numbers thirty volumes ranging from the kindergarten to adult classes .

		They are well bound , clearly printed , and handsomely illus - trated , and are used in
Sunday	DATE	Schools representing many Protestant denominations , as the basis of a complete curriculum or as individual texts in cer - tain classes .

		Principles and
Methods of Religious Education	ORGANIZATION	is a series of handbooks recording practical and successful experiments by men familiar with the scientific principles of religious education .

		Outline Bible-Study Courses constitute a con - tinually increasing series of extension courses in religious subjects for personal study or for classes .

		All these courses are prepared on the basis of modern scholarship , using only the
Bible	LOCATION	as a text - book , yet they are free from disputations or theological questions .

		Handbooks of
Ethics and Religion	ORGANIZATION	is a series of text and reference books for the use of college classes and for general reading .

		The subjects have been selected and arranged in logical and progressive order , providing work for the four college years , and the best college teachers have been secured to prepare the volumes , of which there are now five .

		In view of the increasing responsibilities of editorship in connection with these different series three men in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	now share the work :
Ernest D. Burton	PERSON	, Head of the Depart - ment of New Testament and Early Christian Literature ,
Shailer Mathews	PERSON	, Dean of the

		THE
DIAL jFortniff & tlP	ORGANIZATION	Journal of Criticism and ^ Discussion of literature and for the Unwary What place is there to be for the younger American writers who have broken the `` genteel '' tradition with a sudden violence that elicits angry cries of pain from the critics , so long regarded by the significant classes as guardians of our cultural faith ?

		Read Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	on standards and see with what a be - wildered contempt one of the most vigor - ous and gentlemanly survivals from the genteel tradition regards the efforts of the would-be literary artists of today .

		Read
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	on contemporary litera - ture , and see with what a hurt panic a young gentleman , perhaps the very last brave offshoot of the genteel tradition , re - gards those bold modern writers from whom his contemporaries derive .

		One can admire the intellectual acuteness and sound moral sense of both these critics , and yet feel how quaintly irrelevant for our purposes is an idea of the good , the true , and the beautiful , which culminates in a rapture for
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- vide Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	-RRB- , or is a literary aesthetic -LRB- vide Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	-RRB- which gives Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	first place as an artist because of his wholesome theories of human conduct .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	has done us the service of showing us how very dead is the genteel tradition in our hearts , how thoroughly the sense of what is desirable and absorbing has shifted in our younger American life .

		But he has also shown us how gentil - ity in literary attitude lingers on .

		Pro- fessors of literature still like it , and those pioneer rebels who hate it have tended to hate it not wisely but too well .

		Crusaders like Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	and Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	have dealt loud enough blows , but they beat at a straw man of puritanism which , for the younger generation , has not even the vital - ity to be interesting .

		Art always has to struggle with the mob , and Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	's discovery that it has to struggle in
America	LOCATION	is a little naive .

		The philistine and the puritan are troublesome , though never decisive , and in
America	LOCATION	today they seem less decisive than ever .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, an arrant philistine , in that he defends the life lived through the conventions , is dan - gerous because he makes philistinism sound like belles-lettres .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	, on the other hand , deserves everything Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	says about him , because in his rather self-conscious bluster he makes literary art sound like vulgarity .

		The best thing that can be done to these contending critics is to persuade them to kill each other off .

		Both are moralists before they are critics of literary art .

		Both have an exaggerated respect for Demos , which one expresses by means of a phobia , the other by a remarkable process of idealization .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	is as much a product of the genteel tradition as is Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, for he represents a moralism imperfectly trans - cended .

		Let us look for the enemy of the literary artist in
America	LOCATION	today not among the philistines or the puritans , among the ani - mal-obsessed novelists or the dainty pro- fessors who make Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	profane .

		The real enemy is still the genteel tradi - tion which tends to smother the timid experiments of a younger generation that is not satisfied with husks .

		For the deadly virus of gentility is carried along by an up-to-date cultivated public small per - haps , but growing who are all the more dangerous because they are so hospitable .

		The would-be literary artist needs to be protected not so much from his enemies as from his friends .

		Puritan and profes - sor may agree in their disgust at the creative imagination at work in
America	LOCATION	, but it is not their hostility which keeps it from being freer and more expressive .

		The confusing force is rather an undis - criminating approval on the part of a public who want the new without the un - settling .

		The current popularity of verse , the vogue of the little theatres and the little magazines reveal a public that is 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	almost pathetically receptive to anything which has the flavor or the pretension of literary art .

		The striving literary artist is faced by no stony and uncomprehending world .

		Almost anyone can win recogni - tion and admiration .

		But where is the criticism that will discriminate between what is fresh , sincere , and creative and what is merely stagy and blatantly rebel - lious ?

		The Brownells profess to find no nuances in this mob of young literary anarchists .

		The Shermans can not degrade themselves to the level of treating seriously a crowd of naughty children .

		A new criticism has to be created to meet not only the work of the new artists but also the uncritical hospitality of current taste .

		If anything more than ephemeral is to come out of this younger school , outlawed by the older criticism , the new critic must intervene between public and writer with an insistence on clearer and sharper out - lines of appreciation by the one , and the attainment of a richer artistry by the other .

		That is why a study such as Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	's on recent tendencies in American verse is so significant .

		The intelligent re - viewers who saw in the book only a puff for Imagism disclosed how very novel is an intelligent attempt to place our current literary art not merely against the spirit - ual background of tradition , but in the terms and in the spirit of the contemporary imagination itself .

		Her very tone is revo - lutionary .

		She is neither sentimental nor apologetic .

		Poetry appears for the first time on our critical horizon as neither a refined dessert to be consumed when the day 's work is done , nor as a private hobby which the business man will deride if he hears about it , but as a sound and im - portant activity of contemporary Ameri - can life .

		Some people who habitually patronize Miss
Lowell	PERSON	complain that in her book she patronizes
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	.

		Actually she makes him a powerful figure , with his brave novelty of the
America	LOCATION	that is in the making .

		Her sound intuition gets the better of her class-feeling even in her attitude towards the war .

		For , having orthodoxly registered her sense of the complete bouleversement which it is mak - ing in the spiritual life of the world , she calmly proceeds as if it were not .

		Neither in her criticism nor in her verse is the slightest evidence that into the domain of literary art has the war penetrated , or will it penetrate .

		Nothing shows better than her attitude how very far the younger generation is beyond those older counsel - ors who hope that the war will `` get under our skins '' perhaps to make a few bad poets write worse poems , and to give many mediocre writers a momentary patriotic and social glamor , but not to touch a `` young world '' which has its treasures for other heavens !

		The problem of the literary artist is how to obtain more of this intel - ligent , pertinent , absolutely contempora - neous criticism , which shall be both severe and encouraging .

		It will be obtained when the artist himself has turned critic and set to work to discover and interpret in others the motives and values and efforts he feels in himself .

		The `` high seriousness '' of Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's own critical attitude towards the artistic problems of the six poets sug - gests , I think , that there is a promise of a rich and vibrant literary era before us .

		No one pretends to be satisfied with the novels and plays and interpretations now being turned out by the younger intel - lectuals .

		Least of all must they them - selves be satisfied .

		After all , very little of their work really gives voice to the ambi - tions , desires , discontents , and spiritual adventures of the all too self-conscious young American world .

		Moreover , there is for this healthy dissatisfaction an insidious trap the terrible glamor of social patron - age which so easily blunts idealism in the young prophet .

		The other day , reading `` My Literary Friends and Acquaintances , '' I shuddered at
Howells	ORGANIZATION	's glee over the impeccable social tone of
Boston	LOCATION	and Cam - bridge literary life .

		He was playful enough about it , but not too playful to conceal the enormity of his innocence .

		He does not see how dreadful it is to contrast
Cambridge	LOCATION	with ragged vagabonds and unpresentable authors of other ages .

		To a younger generation which feels that the writer ought to be at least a spiritual vagabond , a de-classed mind , this gentility of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and his friends has come to seem more alien than
Sologub	PERSON	.

		We are acquiring an almost Stendhalian horror for those correctnesses and tacts which wield such hypnotic influence over our middle-class
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 279 life .

		`` Society , '' we say , whether it be in the form of the mob or the cultivated dinner-circle , is the deadly enemy of the literary artist .

		Literary promises can be seen visibly fading out in the warm beams of association with the refined and the important .

		And social glamor was never so dangerous as it is today when it is anxious to be enlightened and liberal .

		Timidity is still the reigning vice of the American intellect , and the terrorism of `` good taste '' is yet more deadly to the creation of literary art than is sheer bar - barism .

		The literary artist needs protec - tion from the liberal audience that will accept him though he shock them , but that subtly tame him even while they appreciate .

		If this literary promise does not fulfill itself , it will be because our younger writers have pleased a public too easy to please .

		As we look around at those who have ideas , our proper mood is not pleasure that their work is so good , but discontent that it is not better .

		It will not be better unless certain values are felt more intensely .

		Those Americans who are fortunate enough to see
Copeau	ORGANIZATION	's theatre seem to remark there a fusion of fervor and simplicity with finished work - manship , a sort of sensuous austerity of tone an effort of creative novelty work - ing with all that is vital in a tradition .

		Do we not want these values in our
Ameri	LOCATION	- can effort ?

		Should we not like to see from this younger generation a literary art which will combine a classical and puritan tradition with the most modern ideas ?

		Do we not want minds with a touch of the apostolic about them and a certain edge a little surly , but not embittered with an intellectual as well as an artistic conscience , with a certain tentative superciliousness towards Demos and an appalling hatred for everything which savors of the bour - geois or the sentimental ?

		Now while everything that is respectable in
America	LOCATION	seems to be putting its effort , with a sort of joyful perversity , into the technique of destruction , are there no desperate spirit - ual outlaws with a lust to create ?

		RANDOLPH
BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rimsky-Korsakov The music of Rimsky-Korsakov is like one of the books , full of gay pictures , which are given to children .

		It is perhaps the most brilliant of them all , a picture - book illuminated in crude and joyous colors bright reds , apple greens , golden oranges and yellows and executed with genuine verve and fantasy .

		The Slavonic and Oriental legends and fairy tales are illustrated astonishingly , with a certain humor in the matter-of-fact notation of grotesque and miraculous events .

		The per - sonages in the pictures are arrayed in bizarre and shimmering costumes , de - lightfully inaccurate , and if they represent kings and queens , are set in the midst of a fabulous pomp and glitter , and wear crowns incrustated with large and impos - sible stones .

		Framing the illustrations are border-fancies of sunflowers and golden cocks and wondrous springtime birds , fashioned boisterously and humorously in the manner of Russian peasant art .

		In - deed , the book is executed so charmingly that the parents find it as amusing as the children .

		But though the music is the loveliest of picture-books , it is nothing more .

		It is as if
Rimsky-Korsakov	ORGANIZATION	had ignored the other and larger functions of his art , and been content to have his music only picturesque and colorful ; as if the childish Czar in `` Le Coq d'Or , '' who desires only to lie abed all day , eat delicate food , and listen to the fairy tales of his nurse , had been something of a portrait of the composer .

		There is a curious coldness and objectivity in the music , for all its gay and opulent exterior , as if the need that brought it forth had been very small , very easily satisfied .

		There is no page of
Rimsky	PERSON	's many scores that reveal him heavy with a great experience , straining to formulate it .

		The music is never more than a grace - ful arrangement of surfaces , the competent presentation of matter chosen for its exotic rhythms and shape , its Oriental and peasant tang .

		The form is ever a thing of two dimensions .

		The musical ideas 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	are passed through the colors of various timbres and tonalities , made to undergo a series of dexterous deformations , and are contrasted , superficially , with other ideas when the possibilities of technical varia - tion have been exhausted .

		There is no actual development in the sense of volumnear increase .

		The form extends only in time ; in `` Scheherazade , '' for in - stance , the climaxes are purely voluntary and physical .

		And it is only the virtue of the component elements , the spiciness of the thematic material , the nimbleness and suavity of the compositional arrangements , and chiefly , the sensuous quality of the orchestral speech that save the music of Rimsky-Korsakov from banality and give it a certain limited value .

		It is just this superficiality which makes the place of the music in the history of Russian art so ambiguous .

		Intentionally , to a certain extent ,
Rimsky	PERSON	's work is autochthonous .

		He was one of those com - posers who , in the middle of the last cen - tury , felt descend upon them the need of speaking their own tongue and gave them - selves entirely to the labor of discovering a music essentially Russian .

		His material , at its best , approximates the idiom of the Russian folk song , or communicates cer - tain qualities an Oriental sweetness , a barbaric lassitude and abandon admit - tedly racial .

		His music is full of elements wild and headlong rhythms , exotic modes abstracted from the popular and liturgical chants or deftly moulded upon them .

		For there was always within him the idea of creating an art , particularly an operatic art , that would be as Russian as
Wagner	PERSON	's , for instance , is German ; the texts of his operas are adopted from Rus - sian history and folklore , and he con - tinually attempted to find a musical idiom with the accent of the old Slavic chroni - cles and fairy tales .

		Certain of his works , particularly `` Le Coq d'Or , '' are deliberately an imitation of the childish and fabulous inventions of the peasant artists .

		And certainly none of the other members of the nationalist group associated with Rimsky-Korsakov not
Moussorgsky	PERSON	, for all his emotional profundity ; nor
Borodin	PERSON	, for all his sumptuous imagination had so firm an intellectual grasp of the common problem , nor was technically so well equipped to solve it .

		None of them , for instance , had so wide an acquaintance with the folk song , the touchstone of their labors .

		For Rimsky-Korsakov was some - thing of a philosophical authority on the music of the many peoples of the Empire , made collections of chants , and could draw on this fund for his work .

		Nor did any of them possess his technical facility .

		Moussorgsky , for instance , had to dis - cover the art of music painfully with each step of composition , and orchestrated faultily all his life , while Rimsky-Korsakov had a natural sense of the orchestra , wrote treatises on the science of instrumentation and on the science of harmony , and de - veloped into something of a doctor of music .

		Indeed , when finally there de - volved upon him , as general legatee of the nationalist school , the task of correct - ing and editing the works of Borodin and Dargomijsky and
Moussorgsky	ORGANIZATION	, he brought to his labor an eruditeness that bordered dangerously on pedantry .

		Nor was his learning only musical .

		He had a great knowledge of the art and customs that had existed in
Russia	LOCATION	before the in - fluences of western
Europe	LOCATION	repressed them , of the dances and rites and sun worship that survived , despite Christianity , as popular and rustic games , and he could press them into service in his search for a national expression .

		Like the Sultana in his symphonic poem , he `` drew on the poets for their verses , on the folk songs for their words , and intermingled tales and adventures one with another . ''

		Yet there is no score of Rimsky-Kor - sakov 's , no one of his fifteen operas and dozen symphonic works , which has , in all its mass , the living virtue that informs a single page of `` Boris Goudonow , '' the virtue of a thing that satisfies the very needs of life and brings to a race release and formulation of its speech .

		There is no score of his , for all the tang and luxuriousness of his orchestration , for all the incrustation of bright strange stones on the matter of his operas , that has the deep glowing color of certain passages of
Borodin	ORGANIZATION	's work , with their magical evoca - tions of terrestrial
Asia	LOCATION	and feudal Mus - covy , their Timbres d'or des mongoles orfevreries Et vieil or des vieilles nations !

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 281 For he was in no sense as nobly human of stature , as deeply aware of the life about him , as
Moussorgsky	ORGANIZATION	, nor did he feel with - in himself
Borodin	PERSON	's rich and vivid sense of the past .

		`` The people are the creat - ors , ''
Glinka	PERSON	had told the young national - ist composers , `` you are but the arrangers . ''

		It was precisely the vital and direct con - tact with the source of all creative work that Rimsky-Korsakov lacked .

		There is a fault of instinct in men like him , who can feel their race and their environment only through the conscious mind .

		Just what in
Rimsky	PERSON	's education produced his intellectualism , we do not know .

		Cer - tainly it was nothing extraordinary , for society produces innumerable artists like him , who are fundamentally incapable of becoming the instrument every cre - ative being is , and of discovering through themselves the consciousness of their fel - lows .

		Whatever its cause , there is in such men a fear of the unsealing of the unconscious mind , the depository of all actual and vital sensations , which no effort of their own can overcome .

		It is for that reason that they have so gigantic and un - shakable a confidence in all purely con - scious processes of creation , particularly in the incorporation of a priori theories .

		So it was with
Rimsky	PERSON	.

		There is patent in all his work a vast love of erudition and a vast faith in its efficacy .

		He is always attempting to incarnate in the flesh of his music , laws abstracted from classical works .

		Even Tchaikowsky , who was a good deal of an intellectualist himself and found `` perfect '' each one of the thirty practice-fugues that
Rimsky	PERSON	composed in the course of a single month , complained that the latter `` worshipped technique '' and that his work was `` full of contrapun - tal tricks and all the signs of a sterile pedantry . ''

		It was not that
Rimsky	PERSON	was pedantic from choice , out of a wilful per - versity .

		As in all inhibited artists , his em - ployment of intellectual formulas is only his fear of opening the dark sluices through which the rhythms of life surge .

		If Rimsky-Korsakov was not absolutely sterile , it was because his intellectual qual - ity itself was vivacious and brilliant .

		Though he remained ever a stranger to
Russia	LOCATION	and to his fellows , as he did to himself , he became the most observant of travelers .

		Though as the foreigner he perceived only the superficial and pictur - esque elements of the life of the land its Orientalism , its barbaric coloring and found his happiest expression in a fantasy after the `` Thousand Nights and a Night , '' he noted his impressions skilfully and vividly , with an almost virtuosic sense of his ^ material .

		If he could not paint the
spring	DATE	in music , he could at least embroider the score of `` Sniegourochka '' delightfully with birdcalls and all manner of vernal fancies .

		If he could not recreate the spirit of peasant art , he could at least , as in `` Le Coq d'Or , '' imitate it so tastefully that , listening to the music , we seem to have before us one of the pictures beloved by the Russian folk a picture with bright and joyous dabs of color , with clumsy but gleeful depictions of battles and caval - cades and festivities and banqueting tables loaded with fruits , meats , and flagons .

		It is indeed curious , and not a little pathetic , to observe how keen Rimsky-Korsakov 's intelligence ever was .

		It is within the limits marked by his work that Russian music developed .

		There is no work of
Strawinsky	ORGANIZATION	's , for instance , that is not simply the successful handling of a material
Rimsky	PERSON	attempted to employ .

		The opera based on a fairy tale and composed with the naivete of a child , the burlesque scenes from popular life , with their utilization of vulgar tunes and dance rhythms , and the reconstruction of ethnological dances and rites are all foreshadowed in
Rimsky	LOCATION	's work .

		And when finally `` Les Noces Vil - lageoises , ''
Strawinsky	PERSON	's new ballet , is pro- duced it may well appear the complete realization of the matter the older man employed only picturesquely in `` Le Coq d'Or . ''

		Even in his science of orchestra - tion the sense of the instruments that makes him seem to defer to them , to let them have their will rather than to impose a music from without upon them
Straw	ORGANIZATION	- insky has simply materialized
Rimsky	PERSON	's in - tention .

		It is not only because he was for a while
Rimsky	PERSON	's pupil .

		It is because fortune has given him the power to take possession of a chamber outside of which the other stood all his life , and could not enter , and saw only by peering furtively through the chinks of the door .

		282 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	A Study of American Intolerance HOW THE WAR HAS SHARPENED OUR DIFFERENCES AND PUT OUR DEMOCRACY UPON ITS METTLE PART TWO : The study of our domestic intolerance is so fascinating that I am tempted to pur - sue it a little further in one or two direc - tions before examining the contributive intolerance which the atmosphere of war has inevitably created in this as well as in all other warring countries .

		This will at the same time put us in a better position to understand the combined effect of these two currents of intolerance now so widely manifest in our public life .

		In times of peace we should answer the charge of intolerance by referring to our constitution , to our state charters and su - preme court decisions , to all the splendid declarations of our political literature where our sense of liberty and the rights of free speech have been so frequently ex - pressed .

		We should make naught of the accusation by reviewing the guarantees which , as we conceive it , put our tolerance beyond debate .

		But it might well impress an acute observer that we were citing all our formulations on the subject and very few of our practices .

		And yet that is the vital point of the discussion .

		For toler - ance is at bottom a spiritual and intellect - ual matter which can never be wholly expressed in fixed forms .

		Its presence or absence is always most clearly registered in the intellectual atmosphere and social sanctions of the community .

		If we apply this more searching , internal standard instead of making a purely formal defence , we may bring ourselves to realize that we have been curiously intol - erant of many of the things which toler - ance ought to breed .

		The tolerance of criticism , for instance , is not as native to us as we like to imagine .

		We resent crit - icism with a passion that makes any real criticism impossible because it breaks off all communication between the critic and the person criticized .

		Nobody is so cor - dially hated among us as the `` knocker , '' a term which of itself shows that the func - tion of criticism is not understood .

		It was this almost instinctive resentment which was so skilfully played upon by powerful interests against the `` muckraker , '' just when muckraking had outgrown its sensa - tionalism and was about to begin con - structive criticism .

		Our magazines soon resumed the more congenial task of chant - ing our achievements and ignoring our de - fects .

		The almost complete absence of sarcasm and irony in our more permanent literature is certainly significant in this con - nection ; most of our writers dispense with these forms of criticism altogether , and those who cling to them soon find them - selves exiled from the general reading public .

		Intellectual exchange among us is constantly impeded by this amazing hos - tility to criticism .

		We act like people who are afraid to sit down and discuss things lest the discussion bring out deep and ir - reconcilable differences .

		This same feeling about criticism is re - flected in many of our most current say - ings .

		Our greatest national slogan , `` mind your own business , '' undoubtedly echoed an earlier defiance of the inquisition of state and church authorities which the American pioneer had discarded .

		But the hostile note in it also helped to solidify the antisocial isolation which became typical of American life until it grew to be an anachronism and an impediment at a time when vast economic changes called for a degree of social interaction hitherto un - dreamed of .

		For it is well to remember that we have been isolationists not only in external policy but in our internal life as well .

		A less classic saying from the
Far West	LOCATION	, which enjoins to be able to `` look the other fellow in the eye and tell him to go to Hell , '' betrays a similar attitude .

		One can not help imagining that anyone who urged his fellowship so defiantly must have had something to conceal .

		Here again we must consider the social background .

		These Western communities were composed of the most extraordinarily heterogeneous groups of men , with some - times a criminal record to live down or a failure not altogether of their own doing to make up for .

		The tolerance they craved
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 283 was entirely of a negative sort ; they wished to be left alone .

		They could not help emphasizing their own positive in - tolerance , because they had to guard not only against inquiry from without but also against any inner impulses from their past which might threaten assertion .

		The scarcity of women among them was an - other fertile source of intolerant codifi - cations .

		For the hard and fast division of women into the infinitely good and the eternally bad , with its peculiar combina - tion of sentimental reverence and cruel sexual exploitation , is one of the uncon - scious sources from which intolerance spreads to the social and intellectual life .

		So primitive a society is never tolerant ; it is built up on rigorous taboos and can - not admit any sophistications .

		An interest - ing parallel to colonial conditions here suggests itself .

		These Western mushroom communities were by no means so unlike our earliest European settlements on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast as tradition would prefer us to believe .

		After all , did not these first immigrants number among them , aside from the religious and political exiles , many `` undesirable citizens '' ?

		and did not this state of affairs cause much uneasiness among the righteous majority ?

		If we may credit the scant social records of those early days , the answer is surely in the affirmative .

		Here too conditions made for a negative tolerance , an avoidance of any issues that might reveal deep-seated differ - ences .

		Thus our immigrant psychology was , in one sense , with us from the be - ginning .

		But the uneasy sense of anarchic dif - ferences to which I have referred in all these connections and the resulting atmos - phere of tension , so hostile to the flexible requirements of any true tolerance , are nowhere so subtly reflected as in our atti - tude towards the law .

		We are renowned for the number of laws and statutes which our legislatures grind out every year .

		In fact this excessive legalism is really in the nature of a symptom .

		In the sphere of neurotic afflictions , we often encounter a man who is so afraid of his impulses that he finds it necessary to protect himself by means of all sorts of self-imposed restric - tions .

		Such a sufferer , the compulsion neurotic par excellence , is not free or capable of being tolerant towards himself ; he can not trust his spontaneity and must therefore fortify an inner psychic fear by external formulations , which may take the shape of wall mottoes , or of a series of commandments which he constantly repeats to himself , or of any other artificial con - trivance ; and , conversely , he can not per - form any positive action without reference to a series of precedents and justifications .

		A free man gets along with a minimum of regulations .

		A free nation does the same .

		A nation which is inwardly constrained , on the other ' hand , takes refuge in legalism , and displays a naive and superstitious faith in legal devices .

		Both in the individual and in the nation this excess breeds its own reaction .

		With all our great reverence for law we also show a dangerous contempt for it .

		The magic of law has become parlor magic .

		We are all for doing things legally rather than justly .

		Where a law forbids we quickly pass another one which will permit , and thus destroy the sanctity of the law by using it to cloak a social violation .

		From being an instrument , law has become for us merely instrumental , something trivially conceived and without the deeper social sanctions which alone give weight and per - manence to law .

		But these are again con - ditions which allow a dominant class to indulge its intolerance towards inferior classes of lesser prestige .

		That this form of intolerance ending in sheer injustice is in danger of spreading can hardly be doubted .

		We may put ourselves above the startling accusations of Russian immi - grants , recently returned to
Russia	LOCATION	, about legal and other oppressions suffered here , but we can not ignore that astonishing docu - ment of Governor
McCall	PERSON	's to the Gov - ernor of
South Carolina	LOCATION	in which it is stated as a notorious fact that at least three immigrant races beside the negro do not receive justice in some of our states .

		If I have been somewhat over elaborate in painting the background of a native in - tolerance in this country from indications that are perhaps novel to the reader , I may now count upon a swifter under - standing of what the psychology of war adds to these conditions .

		Little as we know in this comparatively unexplored field , we may at least record a tendency 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	which for want of a better name I have called the principle of degradation .

		Be - fore man can become a killer he must first degrade his opponent to the point of utter worthlessness .

		Where the issue is of life or death we reduce the value of our enemy 's life to zero and raise our own value to infinity .

		In the most naked form of strife , when we slay for the sake of food or for sexual rivalry , the process is transparent .

		We destroy our rival , reduce him to nothingness , in order that we may live on , either in ourselves or in our prog - eny , live forever , in that infinite expansion of ourselves for which we all instinctively strive .

		In such a case the comparison is direct : we compare our enemy to our - selves and condemn him to death in prefer - ence to ourselves .

		Where the cause of strife is more abstract , the comparison becomes indirect : we then measure our enemy against an idea compared to which his value ceases to exist , as when we slew the
Saracen	PERSON	for the greater glory of the Lord .

		The well known tendency to re - duce our enemy to an automaton to think of him in mechanical terms as an object whose plans , movements , and ulti - mate defeat can be predicted is merely a different aspect of this same process .

		For there is , of course , nothing more degrading to a personality than to reduce it to the status of a thing .

		We need only to visualize the collapse of the body when a person has been shot .

		This process of degradation , with its allied automaton theory , is an essential psychological step in every form of killing , however sordid or exalted .

		We should find it inconceivable to kill anybody whom we valued as we do our own person , for this would be equivalent to killing our - selves .

		The sense of human identity must first be destroyed .

		The process then develops somewhat as follows .

		When a wave of national hostility arises over some specific issue , and the possibility of aggres - sion moves into the foreground , the ten - dency to degrade the opponent immediately sets in .

		The aim is to divorce him from human fellowship , to render him utterly alien , so that we can slay him with a good conscience .

		It is essential that the danger - ous sense of having killed somebody like ourselves , which it is the very object of internal state morality to revive in the murderer when it condemns him to death , should by no chance be aroused .

		Every possible form of difference , beginning with differences of race , color , religion , or morality , is exaggerated to the greatest possible extreme .

		The process extends by imperceptible degrees to such subtle mat - ters as philosophy or manners or even diet , as when cockney mobs threatened the `` frog eaters '' across the Channel over the Fash - oda affair .

		In the end these differences may become sheer fictions unless it be assumed that they express instincts so elusive that they can not be put into words , as in the proverbial case of the two Irish - men who began to fight as soon as they had been introduced to each other .

		The neu - tral spectator , himself removed from the workings of this tendency , here helplessly witnesses that most abominable camou - flage of war which obscures man 's common humanity .

		In a comparatively homogeneous na - tion such as
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	this process runs off smoothly .

		The `` enemy '' is entirely without , so that the whole psychological mechanism of alienation works outward beyond the boundaries of the country .

		Lack of actual contact with one 's enemy is an advantage under these circumstances : the chasm which must open between two nations be - fore they can bring themselves to fly at each other 's throats can be created in the shortest possible time .

		This projection of aggressive emotions upon the enemy be - yond the boundary line tends to reduce the aggressive tendencies within the country to a minimum .

		All the clashes between castes and classes , the normal domestic group hostility , are temporarily suspended .

		A fictitious sense of alienation from the enemy without is echoed by a fictitious sense of likeness and identity within the nation .

		The `` solid front '' towards the enemy accompanies an internal solidarity .

		It is the failure of that process in this country which we are now witnessing .

		The most primitive incentive to a solid front , an attack at close quarters , was absent .

		We did not go into the war for the prosaic motive of self-preservation as the term would be understood by the average sen - sual man , but for the sake of an inter -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 285 national idea complicated in its nature and slow to penetrate through large masses of the people .

		There was therefore a natural retardation of the movement towards in - ternal solidarity , quite aside from the obstacles which I have outlined .

		But in the absence of incentives to a solid front the result was not internal apathy , such as would be certain to settle upon a compara - tively homogeneous country , but a violent increase in every form of internal hostility and intolerance .

		Our certified Americans , educated in the theory that the world war was a struggle for Anglo-Saxon prestige and bitterly concerned to preserve their own domestic prestige , were quick to see the issue .

		Their sure instinct discovered the `` enemy within , '' a phrase which in itself shows an intuitional genius of no mean order .

		Balked in their desire to get at the foreign enemy , they turned upon those whom they had long sensed as hos - tile forces in their very midst .

		To take one example from hundreds : at a recent meeting of the teachers of
New York City	LOCATION	to consider the question of loyalty , a speaker declared it to be an easy matter to discover disloyalists by inspecting the names of the teaching staff .

		After point - ing out some of the names he remarked , `` Do these sound as if they came of
New England	LOCATION	stock ? ''

		This is the issue of Anglo-Saxon prestige in its most naked form .

		To raise it is to inaugurate a system of private warfare within the state .

		It is the culmination of an intolerance long latent and now privileged to break forth with the excuse that war inevitably breeds such a condition .

		Yet it has not bred it to a similar degree in other countries .

		An English mob may sometimes , as recently in the case of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, attempt to burn a church over a philosopher 's head as if to show its con - tempt for the two things which it has never understood ; but it is still to be recorded that any considerable part of the British Empire applauded the act .

		In al - most all the warring countries on the Entente side large bodies of reputable people have stood out against the govern - ment on platforms varying all the way from out and out pacifism to definite schemes for immediate negotiations without utterly losing caste or drawing upon themselves anything more than a resentment which , though fierce and scath - ing , still retains a predominantly political character .

		With us that has not been the case .

		Our `` best people '' have approved some of our worst excesses , or else excused them as being inevitable .

		These countries , if I may again be permitted to use a medical figure , had a sounder psychological constitution to stand such differences of opinion .

		People could differ without utterly forfeiting their sense of identity or being classed as `` alien '' or `` enemies with - in '' on the easy analogy drawn from the presence of large groups of psychologi - cally `` alien '' groups .

		Differences could thus be discussed at a more intellectual level with a much greater degree of toler - ance , for tolerance consists in the recog - nition that people like ourselves may after all have different points of view .

		To excommunicate for difference of opinion is the easiest , and in a way the most natural , thing to do .

		But it reveals a primitiveness of intellectual processes which is directly inimical to any civilized order .

		One of the most mischievous results of such a condition is that it effectually pre - vents the expressions of any moderate point of view .

		The real alien enemy among us is rightly prevented from voic - ing his opposition to the war by the penalty of his liberty and his life .

		But all over the country there are large blocks of public opinion which for the present are con - strained to remain inarticulate for fear of being automatically classified with groups which they themselves most patriotically detest .

		Our bitter-enders have temporarily acquired a tremendous leverage .

		Yet this is , after all , a condition which can not last .

		As soon as our moderates can again contribute to a sane public opinion about our war aims , it will become apparent that the war has opened many large questions .

		It will then be seen that the `` enemy within '' is really a class opposi - tion to a true cosmopolitan democracy .

		Our internal racial differences are really a part of the human situation .

		The `` enemy within '' is our enemy only because we make him so .

		He is part of the problem of liv - ing together , of democracy put upon its mettle .

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	Our
London	LOCATION	Letter The English literary public has learned by ex - perience to feel some distrust of new great foreign authors and , in particular , of new great foreign dramatists .

		These articles of export have come to us , in the past , mainly by way of
Germany	LOCATION	; and the German critics , who are to be commended for their omnivorousness , are hardly to be com - mended for their judgment .

		If I may use a vig - orous phrase , they have , at one time and another , sold us a great many pups .

		Nevertheless the English literary public is just preparing to take an interest in a great foreign dramatist , whose reputation up till now has been principally gained in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Josip Kosor	PERSON	, whose four plays have just been translated into English under the title `` People of the Universe , '' is a Serbo-Croat who fled from the Austrian province of
Dalma	PERSON	- tia , in which he was born .

		This , no doubt , will help to efface the Teutonic associations of his fame .

		What we shall make of him in the end I can not tell ; nor can I very clearly express what I think of him at the moment .

		One thing at least is obvious : he is a writer of extraor - dinary power in the rendering of unrestrained passion .

		His characters are both terrible and painful to behold , for they fling themselves about in their world as a bird does when it has got itself unawares into a room .

		Whether mere demo - niac energy of this sort is enough , or whether in Mr.
Kosor	PERSON	it is supported by deeper intuitions of life these are questions which as yet it is dif - ficult to answer .

		Only very timid criticism refrains from approaching new work until it is ready with a settled judgment ; yet only very shallow criticism judges before it is ready .

		The plays do at least demand notice and examination .

		A few days ago I met Mr.
Kosor	PERSON	, who is now in
London	LOCATION	; but I must confess that I got little enlightenment from him .

		It may have been the feebleness of my apprehension , although I pre - ferred to believe that it was the uncertainty of his English .

		I had hoped to find some bridge over the gulf which still divided me from a thorough understanding of his work .

		I found none however ; nor could I foist upon him any literary affiliations such as one naturally clutches at when one is thoroughly puzzled .

		He rejected the suggestion of any influence from
Strindberg	LOCATION	, saying that he had never read
Strindberg	LOCATION	; and he affirmed that the sole influence of which he was conscious came from the Gospels .

		He also maintained that the real essence and worth of his work lay in its symbolism .

		Yet for me the second of his plays , `` Passion 's Furnace , '' and the first act of the third , `` Reconciliation , '' are the clearest and most enjoyable , because they can be taken simply as immensely vigorous pictures of peasant life , extraordinarily alive with the peasant 's love of land .

		The end of `` Reconcili - ation '' is highly mystical in character , and the first play , `` The Woman , '' and the last , `` The Invincible Ship , '' are almost wholly symbolical .

		`` The Invincible Ship '' seems to be Mr.
Kosor	PERSON	's favorite .

		It is , he says , more lyrical than the rest ; and it does at least give me some sort of total impression , which I can not analyze or describe .

		The real trouble , I suppose , springs from the gulf which divides Slav from European .

		After all , the
Slav	ORGANIZATION	is the link between
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	; and our difficulty in apprehending Slav poetry , though not so great as our difficulty in apprehending Asiatic literature , is at least analo - gous to it .

		At the same time that I met Mr.
Kosor	PERSON	I met also a compatriot of his with whom I discussed certain Russian authors who have recently made a stir in
London	LOCATION	.

		In par - ticular I asked him what he thought of
Sologub	PERSON	; and he told me that
Sologub	PERSON	had poetry , could create beauty , and was in fact an aesthete , but had no depth of thought .

		Now to me those of
Sologub	ORGANIZATION	's books which I have read are simply inexplicable nightmares , to which this criticism gave me no key at all .

		It seemed like judgment moving on another plane of thought than mine .

		On the other hand , both Mr.
Kosor	PERSON	and his com - patriot found it amusing and characteristically English when I confessed that to me Turgenev and Chekhov were ultimately the most satisfying of Russian writers .

		I find that I must embark on yet another con - fession of inability to deliver judgment .

		Not long since in these pages I had to apologize for confusing Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's new volume of verses with another book by him which was announced at the same time under the title `` Per Arnica Silentia Lunae . ''

		This second book , rather long delayed after its announcement , is now pub - lished ; and it has raised again my question as to what Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	really is .

		I am certain that he is a fine , perhaps a great poet surely a very clever one .

		He himself claims to be a mystic , and I wish I could make up my mind as to whether he is not also something of a charlatan .

		The study of charlatanry is a fascinating busi - ness , though the meaning of the word is not very clearly understood .

		A charlatan is not a
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 287 plain humbug ; if he were , I should not have thought of the word in connection with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	.

		A charlatan is a man whose success in deceiving others flows from the fact that he has first deceived himself .

		And I sometimes won - der whether Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is not mistaken in sup - posing that he is mystical by nature , and whether the mystical element in his writings is not merely a magnificent pretense to which he has fallen the first and most complete victim .

		Mr.
E. A. Boyd	PERSON	in his book on ``
Ireland	LOCATION	's Literary Renaissance '' leaves no doubt as to his own judgment in the matter : Vision conies only as the reward of severe mental discipline , after study as vigorous as that demanded by any of the so-called exact sciences .

		But there is no trace of this in
Yeats	PERSON	, who can not properly be described as an intellectual poet .

		His appeal is primarily sensuous ... Mysticism to
Yeats	PERSON	is not an intellectual belief , but an emotional or artistic refuge .

		His visions do not convince us , because they are obviously literary rather than spiritual .

		The concepts which are realities to
Blake	PERSON	, or to
Yeats	PERSON	's contemporary , `` JE , '' are to him symbols , nor do they strike the reader as being anything more .

		And after some misgivings and hesitations , I come to the same conclusion .

		Mysticism and magic , with all the apparatus of dreams , and divination , trances , automatic writing , materiali - zation , and what not are to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, in the end , just so many poetical `` properties . ''

		His real greatness lies , as Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	says , in his sensu - ous appeal , in the images he creates , and in the extraordinary beauty and exactness of his phrases and rhythms .

		I am fortified in this opinion by a careful perusal of his new book .

		I do not believe he would give his life for any of these ideas , although he might well give his life to persuade himself and others that he really held them .

		The book consists of two essays .

		One is enti - tled `` Anima Hominis , '' the other `` Anima Mundi . ''

		The first expounds the theory that the poet , and the man of genius generally , expresses in his work not his own self but his anti- self , the antithesis of his real personality .

		Thus
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, says Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, `` celebrated the most pure lady poet ever sung and the
Divine Justice	ORGANIZATION	, not merely because death took that lady and
Florence	LOCATION	banished her singer , but because he had to strug - gle in his own heart with his unjust anger and his lust . ''

		This is at least an attractive theory ; and it is newer than that of the second essay , which deals with the `` great memory passing on from generation to generation '' and
Henry More	PERSON	's `` soul of the world , '' which receives the spirits of the dead and from which knowledge comes inexplicably to living men .

		Although the subjects of these essays are interesting in them - selves , I am nearly sure that they are to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	only `` subjects '' on which he can string phrases and images .

		It seems probable , in my judgment , that they have to him no more intel - lectual significance than the ballad-themes had to the balladists or the story of `` The Eve of St. Agnes '' to
Keats	PERSON	.

		Yet he has made out of them two beautiful pieces of prose and a mysterious but moving poem which acts as a sort of preface to the volume .

		In Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's prose I always find sentences and incidents related by way of illustration over which I linger with peculiar pleasure .

		He han - dles words as a dancer manages and varies his steps in an intricate figure ; and one is fascinated by the unconcerned precision with which he expresses his meaning , as when he says that he closes a book because his thought has over - brimmed the page , or that `` even the most wise dead can but arrange their memories as we arrange pieces upon a chessboard , and obey remembered words alone , '' or that : The dead living in their memories are , I am per - suaded , the source of all that we call instinct , and it is their love and their desire , all unknowing , that make us drive beyond our reason , or in defiance of our interest it may be ; and it is the dream martens that , all unknowing , are master-masons to the living martens building about church windows their elab - orate nests ; and in their turn the phantoms are stung to a keener delight from a concord between their luminous pure vehicle and our strong senses .

		But the pleasure one finds in such passages is purely literary and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is here a fine poet , not a mystic .

		However , so long as the belief produces such passages from him there is no reason for us to quarrel with him for think - ing himself a mystic .

		These two books are on the whole the most interesting of recent publications .

		One or two more , however , may be briefly mentioned .

		Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	has just brought himself to allow a pre-war novel to be printed , with an apology to the effect that all this will seem very old-fash - ioned and long out of date .

		Mr.
Gerald Gould	PERSON	, the most indefatigable , wrong-headed , and read - able critic of novelists ever known , has protested that whatever was fit subject for artistic treat - ment before the war must necessarily remain fit even now .

		Here he is , of course , right for once ; and I should find it hard to believe , what I was assured the other day , that our promised post - bellum revival of literature will take the form of our poets ' , novelists ' , and dramatists ' writing exclusively for that abominable and formless 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	myth or phantasm , the Business Man .

		But I must protest that the theme of `` The Green Mir - ror , '' which is the conflict between a long - founded family and new disruptive ideas , has been treated too often lately for any except a man of great genius to avoid the cliches of thought , phrase , and situation which the subject has gathered round it .

		I am sick of the conflict between the old and the new generations ; and here , at any rate , I am all for peace by nego - tiation .

		Verse has been very quiet , as they say in the financial columns .

		Mr.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson	PERSON	has published a collection called `` Whin , '' in which the use of proper names for poetical pur - poses has been pushed , I suppose , further than ever before in the history of literature .

		There is little else that is remarkable about it .

		Two more interesting volumes are promised to us : Mr.
J. C. Squire	PERSON	's `` Poems : First Series '' are in the press and will appear sometime during the
summer	DATE	; Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare 's new book , `` Motley ; and other Poems , '' may come at any moment .

		It is eagerly awaited -LRB- this is neither a cliche nor an over-statement -RRB- by many who have waited , with varying degrees of impatience , on Mr. de la Mare 's pleasure for some two years , during which the book has been promised .

		Hav - ing read his latest pieces scattered in periodicals , I believe that from being a fine poet he has become a great poet ; but we shall know within a month or so .

		No certain report exists as to how Mr. de la Mare was induced to allow the book to go to the printer .

		Some of his follow - ers had given up all hope ; but it is credibly stated that a committee of admirers burglariously entered his house and removed the manuscript from his custody .

		A Hint to Essay-Lovers THERE 'S PIPPINS AND CHEESE TO COME .

		By
Charles S. Brooks	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The essay-reader does not have to explain to another of his kind why he enjoys essays .

		There is an understanding between them , and while they do not constitute a secret brotherhood , a closed corporation , there is that aspect about their communion .

		Lamb has an exquisite philo - sophical outlook , he has a quizzical sense of humor , he is lovable and he is kindly .

		But the essay-phile enjoys and likes
Hazlitt	PERSON	!

		He is cer - tainly not lovable in the way
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	is ; in fact it might be said that if
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	is lovable
Hazlitt	PERSON	is not .

		One loves
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	in a personal manner , as though one had known him through the many years of devotion to `` Bridget '' ; one would have found
Hazlitt	PERSON	difficult , intensely interesting but demanding a great bit of intellectual and spir - itual endurance .

		One might have loved him , but not for his faults .

		And so it goes .

		There is
Stevenson	PERSON	, and there is
Macaulay	LOCATION	;
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Montaigne	LOCATION	, and
Bacon	PERSON	all have their person - alities , as different in their essays as they were in the flesh .

		It is their essays that endear them all to the devotee ; under that banner they march side by side , congenial and attractive .

		We will have no invidious distinctions .

		Either you are an essay-phile or you are not .

		While it might be possible and conventional , therefore , to say that `` There 's Pippins and Cheese to Come '' names a book of essays by the man who wrote `` Journeys to
Bagdad	LOCATION	, ''
Charles S. Brooks	PERSON	, and to rest assured that the sales of the one will at least equal those of the other , there remains the desire of the discoverer to pass along the good news : `` There is another essay - ist ! ''

		It can not satisfy the heart of the real essay - lover to hope that a man 's first book will guar - antee the success of the second .

		One must do something to help .

		There is Lamb in these essays , not imitation , not even subconscious aping of style .

		But in charm of spirit , quiet humor , whimsical phrase - ology in these characteristics one feels Lamb .

		In `` A Plague of All Cowards '' one comes on this : And yet really I hesitate .

		I blush .

		My attack will be too intimate ; for I have confessed that I am not the very button on the cap of bravery .

		I have indeed stiffened myself to ride a horse , a mightier feat than driving him , because of the tallness of the monster and his uneasy movement , as though his legs were not well-socketed and might fall out on a change of gaits .

		THE DIAL 289 Even the seasoned rider will not have forgotten this feeling .

		And though you must wade back through memory to childhood you will respond when you read this : But if your companion is one of valor 's minions ... a dizzy plank is a pleasant belvedere from which to view the world .

		The bravery of this kind of person is not confined to these few matters .

		If you happen to go driving with him , he will if the horse is of the kind that distends his nostrils on a sudden toss you the reins and leave you to guard him while he dispatches an errand .

		If it were a motor car there would be a brake to hold it .

		If it were a boat you might throw out an anchor .

		A butcher 's cart would have a metal drag .

		But here you sit defenceless tied to the whim of a horse greased for a runaway .

		The beast Dobbin turns his head and holds you with his hard eye .

		There is a con - vulsive movement along his back , a preface , it may be , to a sudden seizure .

		A real friend would have loosened the straps that run along the horse 's flanks .

		Then if any deviltry take him , he might go off alone and have it out .

		One of the charms , if not the charm , of the essay is that the essayist may talk about anything he please , and the reader may expect anything , no matter what the ostensible subject was at starting .

		Therefore in Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's essay `` The Man of Grub Street Comes from His Garret '' a splendid , yea a brilliant , resume of Fifth Ave - nue is quite in place .

		Is there a scene like it in the world ?

		The boule - vards of
Paris	LOCATION	in times of peace are hardly so gay .

		Fifth Avenue is blocked with motor cars .

		Fashion has gone forth to select a feather .

		A ringlet has gone awry and must be mended .

		The Pomeranian 's health is served by sunlight .

		The
Spitz	PERSON	must have an air - ing .

		Fashion has wagged its head upon a Chinese vase has indeed squinted at it through a lorgnette against a fleck and now lolls home to dinner .

		Or style has veared an inch and it has been a day of fitting .

		At restaurant windows one may see the feed - ing of the overfed .

		Men sit in club windows and still wear their silk hats as though there was no glass between them and the windy world .

		Footmen in boots and breeches sit as stiffly as though they were toys grown large and had metal spikes below to hold them to their boxes .

		They look like the iron firemen that ride on nursery fire-engines .

		Moreover , to honeycomb this review with quotations is only to follow the best essay tra - dition .

		Thus is the victim often treated in the kindest manner .

		Montaigne , certainly , set a record that , though it may not be desirable to attempt beating it , gives dignified justification .

		Therefore another : Had I been the artist I would have run from either F 's praise or disapproval .

		As an instance , I saw a friend on a late occasion coming from a bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath his arm .

		I had been avoiding that particular bookstore for a week because my work lay for sale on a forward table .

		And now when my friend appeared , a sud - den panic seized me , and I plunged into the first doorway to escape .

		I found myself facing a soda fountain .

		For a moment , in my blur , I could not ac - count for the soda fountain , or know quite how it had come into my life .

		Presently an interne ... asked me what I 'd have .

		Still somewhat dazed in my dis - composure , having no answer ready , my startled fancy ran among the signs and labels of the counter until I recalled that a bearded man once , unblushing in my presence , had ordered a banana flip .

		I got the fel - low 's ear and named it softly .

		Whereupon he placed a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice cream , poured on colored juices as though to mark the fatal wound , and offered it to me .

		I ate a few bites of the sickish mixture until the streets were safe .

		There you are .

		If , after that , you have no desire to own the book , my aim has been frus - trated and you are the loser .

		For I shall be quite frank about it it has been my conscious intent to write that sort of review which would make the reader want the book .

		It is the kind of volume you keep handy to read to your friends ; somebody says something which reminds you of
Brooks	ORGANIZATION	, and away you rush to get the book to read `` just this paragraph . ''

		Superstition Become Respectable THE QUESTION : '' !

		F A MAN DIE SHALL HE LIVE AGAIN ? ''

		By
Edward Clodd	PERSON	.

		Clode ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Edward Clodd	PERSON	presents in the impresa - rio sense a review of the follies of
1917	DATE	in the revival of the ancient miracle-play of spiritual - ism .

		The year is pertinent only in that it marks the appearance of `` Raymond , '' the tragic vol - ume in which Sir Oliver Lodge records the inconsequential evidence of the communications of his son killed in battle , received through medi - umistic harlequins and their vaudeville `` con - trols '' ; also the evidence of his own pitiable cre - dulity .

		In spite of a high regard for Sir
Oliver	PERSON	's well merited reputation , for his sincerity and noble qualities , and in spite of a keen sympathy with his loss , Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	does not permit himself to mitigate his duty to speak plainly as a defender of science and reason : You ,
Sir Oliver	PERSON	, knowing , as you must have known , the taint which permeates the early history of spiritual - ism , its inception in fraud and the detection of a suc - cession of tricksters from the Fox girls onwards , and thereby cautioned to be on your guard , have proved yourself , on your own admission , incompetent to detect the frauds of
Eusapia Palladino	LOCATION	... Your faith in the integrity of Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	, despite her failure , crowned by her confession , withdrawn , it is true , but none the less a fact , remains unshaken .

		You lose a dear son in the holiest of causes for which a man can die ; you forthwith repair to a modern Witch of Endor to seek , at second hand , consolations which assuredly he whom you mourn would , in preference , pour direct into your attuned and sympathetic ear ; you one of the most prominent and best known of men are simple enough to believe that your anonym - 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	ity and that of your wife and family was secure at the early seances which Mrs.
Leonard	PERSON	and Mr.
Vout Peters	PERSON	gave you .

		And with what dire result the publication of a series of spurious communica - tions , a large portion of which is mischievous drivel , dragging with it into the mire whatever lofty con - ceptions of a spiritual world have been framed by mortals .

		What is more serious , your maleficent influence gives impetus to the recrudescence of superstition which is so deplorable a feature of these days .

		The difference between the mediums whom you consult and the lower grade of fortune-tellers who are had up and fined or imprisoned as rogues and vagabonds is one of degree , not of kind .

		The sellers of the thousands of mascots credulity in which as life - preservers and luck-bringers is genuine the palmists , and all other professors of the occult , have in you their acknowledged patron .

		Thus you , who have achieved high rank as a phy - sicist , descend to the plane of the savage animist , surrendering the substance for the shadow .

		Introductory to this climax of application , Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	brings within the covers of a readable sur - vey a brief account of the several factors and personalities that have contributed directly to modern spiritualism , and of the kindred influ - ences hovering congenially in the hazy penumbra of occult notions and befuddled verbiage .

		The historical prelude is spoken in these words : `` Pic - ture to yourself a little chamber in which no very brilliant light was admitted , with a crowd of people from all quarters , excited , carefully worked-up , all a flutter with expectation . ''

		The reader will assume that this account of the psy - chological atmosphere of the seance refers to some `` evidential '' sittings with the entranced Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	revealing private affairs of her sit - ters among the elite of
Boston	LOCATION	; or to the crude but much headlined and conspicuously sponsored Eusapia in
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, or
New York	LOCATION	; or if not so recent , to the slate-writing performances of Slade or the `` cabinet '' pranks of the
Daven	PERSON	- ports ; or at the earliest to the raps and table - tippings of the original -LRB- ? -RRB-

		Fox sisters .

		Not at all ; they were written eighteen hundred years ago by that rare modern ,
Lucian	PERSON	, whose accounts of such impostures are as good reading and as good sense
today	DATE	as when they were written for the benefit of any
Greco-Roman Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	that may have flourished in his day .

		The strange unoriginality of the tricks of the spiritualist trade prove that the longings of men have always led to the same modes of seeking and finding satisfaction : mysterious raps and voices and forms , rocking of tables , miracles in transporting objects , handling live coals , float - ing through space , seeing at a distance , reading sealed messages , foreseeing the future , holding converse with the dead .

		But even
Lucian	PERSON	and his intellectual ancestry are recent compared with the racial antiquity of all this longing inquiry , and of the beliefs and legends that surround it .

		It goes back to the early history of mankind and is found in its spontaneous expression wherever the primitive mind survives : in the angekok of Labrador , the shaman of
Siberia	LOCATION	, the mediums of unenlightened lands from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	, the mahatmas of Adyar or the voodoos of the
Congo	LOCATION	.

		Here is its authentic root and its true service ; it is anthro - pology and not psychical research .

		The interest is not in the evidence but in the beliefs and the ways of satisfying them precisely the same interest that attaches to primitive medicine-magic and the crude ritual of the medicine man .

		That such ways of thinking survive , and must in the nature of things survive , brings them within the equally legitimate study of folklore .

		And if our inter - est lies in the manner of their appeal , and in the understanding of the processes by which such evidence continues to impose on modern and schooled minds , psychology is ready to furnish an answer to the logical minded .

		The difficulty is that cold logic is less satisfying than hot -LRB- or warmed over -RRB- dramatic superstition ; that the otherwise open-minded are also open to the lure of the obscure and the soothing siren tones of prepossession .

		Logic does well enough for the workaday world , where reason is at a premium , or at least at par , but is not welcome at the pri - vate hearth of desire and the reserved sanctum of the will to believe .

		Even a mild indulgence in this toxic atmosphere closes the door of reason .

		`` When men have once acquiesced in untrue opin - ions and registered them as authentic records in their minds , it is no less impossible to speak intel - ligently to such men as to write legibly on a paper already scribbled over . ''

		That remains as true today as when Hobbes wrote it .

		Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	's antidote consists of select doses of anthropology , reenforced by plain tales of exposures of mediums , who at the worst are ras - cals and scoundrels and at the best `` are an unwholesome lot '' `` a mad world , my masters . ''

		The anthropology is not all of the primitive type ; much of it is in the nature of survival , and naturally takes on the color of a sophisticated mysticism , and an intellectual speculation .

		But wherever spiritualism seeks the evidence of phys - ical manifestations and deserts the spiritual field for `` materializations , '' it is bound to come in contact with fraud and hysteria , to which it usually succumbs .

		The byways of the pursuit
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 291 are many and devious , some of them rescued from the mire of pseudo-science and made intel - ligible and respectable as authentic psychological facts with a proper and scientific explanation .

		At that point the psychical researcher loses interest in them .

		Such are `` crystal-gazing '' and `` telep - athy '' and hypnosis and hallucinations .

		But the difficulty remains that while all this is fairly convincing to the normal stable mind , the aver - age degree of stability is still compatible with a belief in the existence of black swans that are not biological variants of white ones , but intrin - sically of a different color , taking their appear - ance and behavior from a different set of laws than those that rule in a commonplace universe .

		To these may be repeated the dictum of Wil - liam
James	PERSON	whose psychological hospitality was wide that the interpretation of events for their personal significance is an abomination .

		Once the personal element in such beliefs is reduced to proper proportions , their restriction to the middle ground of sanity is assured .

		Such is the question that Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	pro- pounds , and such his firm matter-of-fact answer .

		-LRB- Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	, an anthropologist and writer by avocation , is a banker by profession . -RRB-

		Out of the same rank growth he garners a very differ - ent harvest .

		The task is likely to prove an ungrateful one , but must constantly be repeated if the world is to be made safe and held safe for rationality .

		It must be done in modern terms and by way of modern instances .

		The follies of
1817	DATE	or 1857 seem indeed old-fash - ioned follies ; but not so those of
1917	DATE	, with their reputable sponsors whom we know and respect .

		Prestige remains a dangerous influence , and yet an indispensable one .

		The right dispo - sition of our confidence is one of the pragmatic tests not of learning but of wisdom in the higher reaches of thought , and of common sense in the lowlier ones .

		It is not pleasant to con - template the lapses of noble minds , nor is the self-approval of our superior shrewdness an envi - able trait .

		The true lesson of the review is a subjective modesty , and an objective firmness ; it is of the same order as that moral stability that holds to the might of right , though the wrong celebrate its triumphs .

		Anthropology is the proper study of mankind , its legitimate drama ; though the annals of psychical research make an interesting motion-picture of the va - garies of all sorts and conditions of men .

		The Poetry of
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	NOCTURNE OF REMEMBERED SPRING , and Other Poems .

		By
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	.

		Four Seas ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It is a difficult business to be a poet .

		It is not only difficult ; it is highly dangerous .

		For the poet must constantly employ not only his mind , but his feelings .

		He must see the world not only as objective phenomena for meditation , but as sub - jective influence for emotion .

		Now it is perfectly true that the majority of mankind , the `` average sensual '' man and woman , only maintain their mental equilibrium through the rigorous suppres - sion or the progressive atrophy of their feelings .

		From this state of emotional prohibition the poet alone , the man of imagination , is free ; and his is a dangerous freedom , for himself and for oth - ers , since in it the rules of social conduct , the regulations of the average , do not exist .

		Therefore it is difficult to be a poet .

		I do not mean by this that it is at all difficult to be the prevailing fashion of the day in poetry , or even the fashion of the year before last .

		For that , one needs only a certain crude vigor of the pen , and a voice loud enough to dominate the market place .

		But the true poets do not dominate the market place .

		They may think themselves lucky if they find a hundred serious readers , and among them , two or three friends .

		They may consider themselves fortunate to find a publisher .

		They may hold themselves highly favored if they retain some measure of health and can wrest a suffi - ciency of food from the world .


Conrad Aiken	PERSON	is a poet in the sense that his work displays a certain harmonious development upon a given groundwork .

		His first volume , `` Earth Triumphant , '' proved that he was the possessor of an instrument .

		It is true that he played on this instrument with a dangerous facil - ity .

		For in him the sense of metrical rhythm and the answering recall of rhyme was given from the very first .

		Other poets have to en - ter the great vague world of thought that beckons them , by hacking and hewing their way through a forest of experimental forms a proc - ess which is calculated to kill off all but the stoutest .

		There was nothing of this in
Aiken	LOCATION	.

		He was master of a smooth limpid flow of verse narrative from the beginning .

		He did not have to learn and unlearn his technique .

		It was an authentic gift .

		Such a poet is rare enough even in
England	LOCATION	, still rarer in
America	LOCATION	.

		But it was not until the appearance of his 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	second volume , `` Turns and Movies , '' that
Aiken	PERSON	began to use his powers for the deliberate expres - sion of any new idea .

		Since that volume he has published two others , `` The Jig of Forslin '' and now the `` Nocturne of Remembered Spring , '' which this morning 's post has brought to my desk in
London	LOCATION	.

		Throughout these three works there runs a sole essential idea .

		Aiken is the poet of sexual illusion and disillusion .

		It will be remembered that
Aiken	PERSON	admits being a Freudian .

		Indeed , his most remarkable work , `` The Jig of Forslin , '' was constructed as a delib - erate Freudian synthesis of civilized man 's mind to quote its author , `` Forslin is not a man , but man . ''

		Now the substance of the Freudian psy - chology is this ; that the major part of the higher psychical reactions of mankind may be traced to sexual impulse , suppressed , transformed , and sub - limated .

		It is true that
Freud	ORGANIZATION	himself has never pushed this theory to the point which it occupies in the minds of many of his more fanatical fol - lowers , such as Jung .

		For
Freud	PERSON	, what part of any human imaginative effort could be traced to sublimated libido would probably vary with every given case .

		But the theory that man does normally discharge along lines of imaginative art and phantasy the superfluity of his sexual reactions , remains to
Freud	LOCATION	, as to
Aiken	LOCATION	, un - questionable .

		Now the difficulty with any psychological the - ory of this sort is that it tends to stereotype minds , to make all the activities of the human brain seem alike .

		If it be true , as I believe it is , that the transformation of species has been brought about by adaptation to changed sur - roundings , rather than by natural selection of any particular species , then it follows that of all species man is the most a ` daptable to all given circumstances and , further , that the mental and psychical reactions of man vary according to the circumstances in which he is placed .

		The theory of
Freud	LOCATION	and Jung would fasten upon mankind a certain fixed type of thought that all imag - inative activity is reducible to a transformation of primitive sex-impulse .

		This theory fails com - pletely to take into account the claims of evolu - tion .

		If the sex-impulse can thus transform itself , what is to hinder it from becoming another kind of impulse altogether ?

		And having become that , what is to hinder it from again reacting upon the untransformed remainder , and again transforming it ?

		We must keep our minds away from these hard and fast compartments .

		Freud 's theory , even if true , is merely a limitation of our activities ; it clears up old ground , but it does not point the way to any new sphere of thought - activity .

		I have been led to this digression by the neces - sity of examining critically the basis of
Aiken	ORGANIZATION	's thought before proceeding to the study of his poetry as illustrative of that basis .

		Now it seems to me that , apart from his incontestable gifts as a prosodist and word - controller ,
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	's mind has up to the present worked on somewhat too narrow a basis .

		His poems , in short , are variations of but one idea the idea of sexual disillusionment .

		It is true that this method as employed in the case of `` The Jig of Forslin , '' produced a poem of very remarkable range and beauty .

		But `` Forslin '' in a sense exhausted the range of variations possible to its theme .

		And in his more recent work
Aiken	PERSON	contents himself with repeating a little more wearily and subtly his familiar cry .

		There is an atmosphere of bore - dom about it all , a hint of yawns , a trail of dust .

		This should not be .

		Any poet with one half the powers
Aiken	PERSON	has should mentally rouse him - self to tackle other themes .

		There is nothing which wearies the mind more quickly than to be chained down to one particular type of work .

		Shakespeare , and not only
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, found that the way of the utmost range was the way of the fullest development .

		The best poem in
Aiken	LOCATION	's present volume is the one called ``
1915	DATE	: The Trenches . ''

		It is a very fine picture of the weariness of waiting , with the poignant cry at the end `` Will the word come today ? ''

		It proves that the war is legitimate matter for poetry in so far as it enlarges one 's mental horizon as a great spectacle to be looked upon impersonally , without partisan spirit , in the way in which the veteran soldier now looks upon it .

		Next to this poem I like best the one called `` Episode in
Grey	LOCATION	. ''

		This too is a study in disillusionment , but it has a harsher , more poignant , more mascu - line accent than the others .

		It carries disillusion - ment far beyond mere boredom , to the point where disillusionment begins to live a new pas - sionate life of its own .


Conrad Aiken	PERSON	is devel - oping , after all , and when he arrives in the new country whither he is tending , I caution the dry - rotting celebrities of yesteryear in
America	LOCATION	to look out !

		They will find a poet .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 293 A Year of Mistakes APPROACHES TO THE GREAT SETTLEMENT .

		By
Emily Greene Balch	PERSON	.

		Introduction by
Norman Angell	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		IN OUR FIRST YEAR OF WAR : Messages and Addresses to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the People ,
March 5 , 1917	DATE	to
January 8 , 1918	DATE	, by
Woodrow Wil	PERSON	- son .

		Harpers ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		We have recently been told that until a cen - tury or two has elapsed we can not expect to dis - cover the deeper significance of the Russian Revolution .

		Perhaps but unfortunately it will then be too late to draw lessons from the mis - takes of the conventional diplomacy of
1917	DATE	.

		That is , it will be too late for the present war .

		Doubtless there would be a certain intellectual pleasure in assessing the year with so secure a detachment and assurance , yet like a great many intellectual pleasures it would be bought only at the price of practical impotence .

		We shall have to risk our interpretations in a world of perversity and change , just as we have to risk our actions .

		The intelligence which explicates only accomplished facts somehow cuts a pitiable figure in our immediate world , where thousands of men are every day blown to bits because we seem unable to control events beyond expressing a mild surprise when the `` inevitable '' -LRB- always called that afterwards -RRB- takes place .

		Indeed , it is a kind of duty to attempt our interpretation , even perhaps a false interpretation , when the great body of American public opinion still seems blissfully unaware that any blunders were made .

		Mistakes are forgivable ; but the ostrich habit of refusing to recognize them after they have occurred , a habit so beloved by our newspaper editors and too many of our public spokesmen , is a sure way to lose the war .

		As far as the casual observer can discern , President
Wilson	PERSON	is about the only person of influence who has shown any clear perception of what the big dip - plomatic blunders of
1917	DATE	were .

		Of course he has n't advertised these blunders from the house - tops to do so was hardly necessary , nor would it be exactly tactful towards certain of our co - belligerents .

		But in his speech to
Russia	LOCATION	of Jan - uary 8 ,
1918	DATE	, and in his answer to
Von Hert	LOCATION	- ling , President
Wilson	PERSON	revealed a democratic vision and an understanding which not only put our case admirably before the world and before history , but by implication exposed the more glaring errors of Allied diplomatic policy in the previous year .

		In these two books the first doc - umentary , the second merely a collection of speeches the record stands out with terrifying clearness .

		Yet curiously enough it has been the last two speeches to
Russia	LOCATION	and
Von Hertling	ORGANIZATION	which have given most concern to our unofficial but strident moulders of public opinion , who somehow have got the idea into their heads that the
United States	LOCATION	is composed entirely of fools and cowards who can not hear the word `` peace '' uttered with - out going into a collapse .

		These swivel-chair diplomats have been fearfully whispering the word `` morale '' ever since we entered the war , and have successfully persuaded themselves that the larger part of our population must be treated tenderly , like babies .

		Any discussion of war aims except , naturally , those that they engage in will certainly break our spirit , and put us under the heel of
Potsdam	LOCATION	.

		That is why the first two speeches of President
Wilson	PERSON	in
1918	DATE	embarrassed them so .

		Here was the acknowl - edged leader of the nation saying just the sort of thing which , if the private citizen had uttered it , would certainly merit the reproach of faint - heartedness , pacifism .

		Why not be honest ?

		Many editors and speakers secretly thought that our President was guilty of this weakness in `` morale '' -LRB- oh , magic word ! -RRB-

		, although they had n't the courage to more than hint as much .

		It is a hard thing to say , yet it is perfectly true that many regarded the pitiable plight of
Russia	LOCATION	less with democratic sympathy than with some - thing of gratification that here was proof posi - tive that President
Wilson	PERSON	's `` peace offensive '' was untimely .

		`` Now , '' they are all bleating again in joyous unison , `` is no time for peace talk . ''

		In other words , as long as President
Wilson	PERSON	's diplomacy did not appear to work , had no striking effect in
Germany	LOCATION	, they were all for it .

		The moment it began to stride , to become a genuine force , they grew uneasy and anxious .

		Beating
Germany	LOCATION	by the sword they understood ; beating
Germany	LOCATION	by the power of ideas was , of course , a chimera .

		But to combine , to beat
Germany	LOCATION	both by the sword and the power of ideas , which is President
Wilson	PERSON	's method , they completely failed to comprehend .

		However ,
Germany	LOCATION	did not disappoint them ; it did not become liberalized .

		After that dubious
January	DATE	, they are again living in a world they understand , a world of victory and defeat by arms alone , a world of international crime and punishment , a world in which President
Wilson	PERSON	's diplomacy has no legitimate place .

		At a time when most of all we need to voice and perform a great 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	act of faith towards
Russia	LOCATION	, they are only half - heartedly supporting the President in his obvi - ous desire to check the hand of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Once more they are urging him to abandon all his originality , his force , his moral distinction and to become the shouter for a stale and flaccid shibboleth .

		Seemingly
America	LOCATION	is to contribute nothing more than men , money , and munitions .

		But these alone will not win the war .

		A superiority of material forces will not break the spell of the German autocracy over the suffer - ing German people , any more than those pos - sessing an inferiority of material forces will be compelled to bow to that autocracy .

		The whole history of
1917	DATE	shows that .

		The obvious les - son from
1917	DATE	is not that we need
Wilson	PERSON	diplomacy less , but more .

		After all , President
Wilson	PERSON	's chief error in
1917	DATE	was not an error of intention but of emphasis , a mistake arising from lack of self-assertion of his diplomacy and delay in winning our co-belligerents to an accep - tance of that diplomacy .

		He has made notable efforts to retrieve the harm of this error in the first two speeches of
1918	DATE	and in the message to the Russian Soviets at
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		Likewise , his seemingly steadfast disapproval of
Japan	LOCATION	's assertion of her right to preserve `` law and order '' in
Siberia	LOCATION	will some day be one of the events of this war that we shall look back upon with the most pride .

		Our political aims and objects in this war to a great extent stand or fall as the Russian Revolution stands or falls .

		Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	has been quick to see and empha - size this .

		Others may abandon
Russia	LOCATION	, but he will not .

		What , then , were the chief mistakes in Allied diplomacy during
1917	DATE	?

		There were three major mistakes : first , the misunderstanding , partly malicious and deliberate and partly through innocent lack of information -LRB- as in our own case -RRB- , of the Russian Revolution and its purposes ; second , the failure to emphasize the importance of the Reichstag resolution of
July 19	DATE	and to give it moral encouragement ; third , the refusal by the Allied governments of per - mission to attend the
Stockholm	LOCATION	conference of Socialists .

		All three mistakes were the results of a suspicious and embittered temper , and sprang from a lack of faith in that democ - racy which it is the object of this war to pro- mote .

		They were blunders applauded , if not engineered , by the reactionary and purblind pow - erful minorities that still exercise too great a control over the destinies of the Allied nations .

		Consider what the first mistake achieved .

		Misunderstanding of the Russian Revolution resulted in a failure to revise war aims until that revision came too late to allay
Russia	LOCATION	's suspicion of the Allies ' disinterestedness and democratic intentions .

		It resulted in the fall of the
Keren	PERSON	- sky government and the rise of the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		It resulted in foolish and untimely attempts to foster counter revolutionary sentiment and in false charges of a desire to make a separate peace -LRB- on
June 15	DATE	, for example , the Council of Work - men and Soldiers ' Deputies expelled
Grimm	PERSON	for suggesting a separate peace -RRB- .

		It resulted in complete failure to take advantage of the great strategic opportunity offered by the Russian invi - tation to attend the Brest-Litovsk conference .

		And finally it has resulted in the practical loss of
Russia	LOCATION	to the Allies .

		If anyone can study the record and remain satisfied , he must be singularly lacking in imagination .


Russia	LOCATION	is not even yet irremediably lost , but if we continue the fatuous policy of
1917	DATE	, if we do not firmly support Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	in his obvious attempt to render aid and comfort to a stricken nation , we shall lose
Russia	LOCATION	beyond all hope of recovery in this or the next generation .

		The second blunder , the failure to give encour - agement to the liberal elements in
Germany	LOCATION	which had put through the Reichstag resolution by a vote of 212 to 126 , was less obvious , although almost as pernicious in its effects .

		In moving the resolution Deputy
Fehrenbach	PERSON	, of the Cen - ter , said : `` One must despair of humanity , if the people in enemy countries do not recognize the note of honesty in this Resolution .

		If the enemy should scorn again this manifestation for peace , then , of course , the slaughter must con - tinue until the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	group tire of sacrificing their nations . ''

		Yet what was the reception accorded this resolution ?

		On
July 26	DATE	, one week after its passage , even so fair and liberal a man as
Asquith	PERSON	himself made the blunder of refer - ring contemptuously to the resolution in a speech in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		And his attitude was but a reflection of the conventional attitude of the Entente countries .

		The Reichstag itself was jeered at as a `` hall of echoes '' ; the German Socialists were called `` Kaiser Socialists . ''

		In a word ,
Germany	LOCATION	was mocked for her absence of democracy , yet when the more decent men in the government made their first rather feeble and timid step towards democracy , they were reproached for not having gone the whole way .

		It was precisely like condemning a man for giv - ing up whiskey because all his life he had been a drunkard .

		This error , too , President
Wilson	PERSON	1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 295 has tried to rectify in his explicit appeal to the makers of that resolution in his first two addresses of
1918	DATE	.

		The third mistake , not allowing the Stock - holm conference to meet , is already costing us almost as much as the other two .

		`` Ninety-nine per cent of all the peoples looked with longing and hope to
Stockholm	LOCATION	.

		If
France	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	renounce annexation and
Germany	LOCATION	insists thereon , we shall have a revolution in the coun - try . ''

		So said
Scheideman	PERSON	in the German
Reichs	PERSON	- tag on
May 15 , 1917	DATE	.

		On
May 28	DATE	, the organ - ized Socialists of
France	LOCATION	accepted the invitation to the
Stockholm	LOCATION	conference .

		On
June 1 , 1917	DATE	the
Council of Workmen	ORGANIZATION	and Soldiers ' Deputies issued a new appeal to the Socialists and workers of the world to go to
Stockholm	LOCATION	.

		On
June 6 , 1917	DATE	the organized Socialists of
Italy	LOCATION	accepted the invitation .

		On
August 10 , 1917	DATE	the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, on the advice of
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	, voted to attend the conference .

		Yet early in
August Samuel Gompers	PERSON	, presuming to speak for American labor , refused to send delegates to the conference ; and on
August 13 , 1917	DATE	the British government , following the American govern - ment 's lead , denied passports to the delegates , and a day later
France	LOCATION	followed suit .

		Whether such a conference would today be similarly flouted is perhaps doubtful .

		It is clearer now than it was in
1917	DATE	that if the labor and peoples of the world want to acquaint the German peo - ple with the opinion held of them outside their own country , we stand a better chance to do it by talking to them directly than by addressing them through the intermediary of their lying gov - ernment .

		Such is the record of
1917	DATE	, a tragic year indeed for democracy .

		It must be plain by now that we can not win this war by force of arms alone .

		If it is not a war of ideas , it is a war without meaning and purpose .

		But if it is a war between two conflicting attitudes of viewing the world , what is our ultimate goal ?

		Eventually we shall have to capture the hearts and minds of the German people .

		Even though we hoist our standards in
Berlin	LOCATION	and march triumphantly through
Potsdam	LOCATION	, we shall have lost the war unless we have achieved that moral capture .

		Even though millions more wade through blood and suffering , unless at the end
Germany	LOCATION	has become liberalized and has acquired a govern - ment that can be trusted in a community of nations , those that have laid down their lives so generously and fearlessly will have laid them down in vain .

		The very ghosts of our dead will mock us for our failure if no cleaner and more decent system of international relations is cre - ated as a result of this war .

		Already they demand of us a nobler record than that of
1917	DATE	.

		It is not enough to punish
Germany	LOCATION	for her sins ; we must win her people in spirit and purpose .

		We can not begin the plans for that campaign too soon .

		We can not examine our own democ - racies too critically or too severely .

		We can not forget that it will be impossible to confer on a people by the sword an idealism of which we ourselves are only the half-hearted champions .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The fisher for dramatic ideas who has cast his net by publishers ' coasts finds little to hearten him this season .

		There is
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	's `` Problem of the Playwright '' it is a sizable , but not a flavory fish ;
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	's `` Sacrifice '' has the flavor of remote seas , but one finds that one 's appetite for it does not persist ;
Granville Barker	PERSON	's `` Three Plays '' is long in the head , bony in the middle , but has a nice bit near the tail also there is some sport in landing it ; then
Gustave Vanzype	PERSON	's `` Two Belgian Plays , '' while not a very important catch , has flesh and flavor that make it better than medi - ocre .

		On the whole the haul is not at all ex - citing .

		And now to particularize .

		`` Problems of the Playwright '' is a reporter 's note-book .

		It is in - telligent and conscientious , but of the kind of criticism that one finds in every page of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's dramatic essays the kind of criticism that immediately puts you into possession of dramatic standards there is not a gleam .

		Clay - ton
Hamilton	PERSON	simply gives us his reports on the American Theatre for the past two years .

		Ar - resting things in connection with dramatic the - ory are sometimes given , but one invariably finds them enclosed between quotation marks .

		`` A play is a more or less rapidly-developing crisis in destiny or circumstance , and a dramatic scene is a crisis within a crisis , clearly furthering the 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	ultimate event .

		The drama may be called the art of crisis , as fiction is the art of gradual de - velopment . ''

		This saying is interesting and really instructive .

		But it is
William Archer	PERSON	being quoted by
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	.

		He is combat - ing Brunetiere 's generally accepted assertion that the essential element of drama is a struggle between human wills .

		Not rinding this theory always applicable , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	puts forward the theory of `` more or less rapidly-developing crisis . ''


Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	does not find Arch - er 's theory invariably applicable either .

		This leads him to put forward his own theory of con - trasts : `` A play , '' he says , `` becomes more and more dramatic in proportion to the multiplicity of contrasts it contains within itself . ''

		This idea too is interesting and instructive .

		But it is not really a defining idea as
William Archer	PERSON	's is .


Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	's theory of con - trasts would cover any interesting piece of lit - erature .

		One could say only of a play , `` It is a more or less rapidly-developing crisis . ''

		But one could say of an epic or a novel or an ode , `` The one indispensable element of success ... is the element of contrast . ''

		Then one could point out the very marked contrast between Achilles and Hector , between
Dante	PERSON	and the blessed souls , between
Sancho Panza	PERSON	and
Don Quixote	PERSON	, and in the `` Ode to the Skylark '' or the `` Ode to the Nightingale '' the poets ' con - trast between their own joyless state and the happiness of the bird that seems destined to sing for all time .

		There is a comment of
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	's re - peated in `` Problems of the Playwright '' that is valuable and that gives us a standard .

		Pinero makes a distinction between `` strategy '' and `` tac - tics '' in playmaking .

		Strategy is the general laying-out of the play , and tactics is the craft of getting the characters on and off the stage , and so forth .

		Such a distinction opens our eyes to what is a real plan and what is merely a de - vice .

		It is a pity that
Pinero	PERSON	has not written a book of dramatic criticism .

		One feels inclined to say that one would give several of his plays for such a book .

		One very intriguing thing about `` Problems of the Playwright '' comes out of the way in which
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	contrives to admire the most sharply contrasted types of playwright .

		He is devoted to
Pinero	PERSON	yes , devoted : he takes to him as one takes to a religious belief .

		But he also admires
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Now how can a man who appreciates the internal drama of `` Agla - vaine and Selysette '' accept the mechanics of `` The Second Mrs. Tanqueray '' ?

		If there was ever a play that was an insult to the imaginative and spiritually informed mind it is that bad play of
Pinero	PERSON	's .

		And yet one beholds
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	rising off his knees in the conventicle of Pinero to give a benediction in
Maeterlinck	LOCATION	's grove .

		One is left to wonder how it can be done .

		If we had been told that the five plays in the volume called `` Sacrifice '' had been written by the pupils in
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	's seminary we could easily accept the statement .

		Not one of the plays given in the volume is at all on a level with `` The Post Office , '' or `` The King of the Dark Chamber , '' or `` Chitra . ''

		The persons in these five plays have the indistinctness of character that is in romances composed by chil - dren .

		And the dooms meted out to these per - sons are just such dooms as imaginative children would be touched by .

		For each of the plays there is a philosophic setting , but then the chil - dren of a philosophic people might lisp in such terms .

		There is a suggestion that the play called `` Sacrifice '' is a pronouncement upon the pres - ent disaster to civilization .

		One can hardly accept it as such .

		Indeed it is the child 's detach - ment that is on each one of them that makes these plays cherishable .

		Many plays published in book form are dramatic without being theatrical , but it might be said of the three plays that
Granville Barker	PERSON	presents us with that they are theatrical without being dramatic .

		They are not , of course , the - atrical in the sense of being meretriciously ap - pealing ; they are theatrical in the sense that they are written with the two eyes of the author fixed on the stage and that they actually demand a looker-on .

		Take , for instance , the scene in `` Rococo '' where the vicar is on the carpet with
Reginald	PERSON	's knee holding him down while the vicar 's sister makes interventions .

		What is dramatic in this scene does not come into the written word .

		The breaking of the rococo vase , too , is only half dramatic in the text ; it would be a sensation on the stage , but it is a sensation at a remove in the book .

		`` Vote by Ballot '' like `` Rococo '' is mordant , and like `` Rococo '' the best that is in it does not come out through the dialogue .

		The truth is that these two plays have the matter of the unusual , but not the fine , short story , and that we look for something more filled with life and experience in plays presented to us in a volume .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 297 `` Farewell to the Theatre , '' however , does hold more than the experience that is in the unusual short story .

		But one is left wondering if all
Granville Barker	PERSON	's adroitness could make it effective on the stage .

		For `` Farewell to the The - atre '' is a dialogue only indeed one might de - scribe it as an Imaginary Conversation between a Celebrated Actress and her Constant Lover .

		A poetry that , as it would seem , should have been very hard to disengage , comes out of this dia - logue : ... I found that the number of my looking - glasses grew .

		Till one day I counted them ... and big and small there were forty-nine .

		That day I 'd bought the forty-ninth an old Venetian mirror .

		.

		so popular I was in those days and felt so rich .

		Yes ... and then I used to work out my parts in front of every mirror in turn .

		One would make me prettier and one more dignified .

		One could give me pathos and one gave me power .

		Now there was a woman used to come and sew for me .

		You know !

		I charitably gave her jobs ... took an interest in her `` case '' ... encouraged her to talk her troubles out for comfort 's sake .

		I was n't inter - ested ... I didn . '

		t care a bit ... It did n't com - fort her .

		She talked to me because she thought I liked it .

		But oddly , it was just sewing she liked and she sewed well and sewing did her good ... sewing for me .

		You remember my Lily Prince in `` The Backwater '' ?

		Yes .

		My first real failure .

		I liked it .

		My first dead failure ... dear Public .

		Do you know why ?

		I had n't found her in the mirrors .

		I 'd found her in that woman as she sewed .

		I did n't think it a failure .

		Well ... the dear Public would n't pay to see it ... and we 've found no other word .

		But I knew if that was failure now I meant to fail ... and I never looked into a mirror again .

		Except , of course , to do my hair and paint my poor face and comically comfort myself sometimes ... to say ... ``
Dorothy	PERSON	, as mugs go it 's not such an ugly mug . ''

		I took the looking-glasses down ... I turned their faces to the wall .

		For 1 had won free from the shadowed emptiness of self .

		But nobody understood .

		Do you ?

		There is no struggle of human wills in this conversation between
Dorothy Taverner	PERSON	and Ed - ward McLenegan ; there is a crisis , however , although it is hardly marked .

		And because there is a crisis there `` Farewell to the Theatre '' exists as a piece of drama .


Gustave Vanzype	PERSON	, the Belgian dramatist , has obviously been influenced by the French play - wright
Curel	ORGANIZATION	, whose `` La Nouvelle Idole '' has been produced in
New York	LOCATION	by the French The - atre .

		But the Belgian has a distinctive accent .

		Indeed in the two plays presented in this volume , in `` Mother Nature '' and in `` Progress , '' he sug - gests a richer human life than does
Curel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both wrote thesis plays , but in the Belgian plays the thesis is imposed upon humanity .

		In the case of `` La Nouvelle Idole '' humanity is straitened into a thesis .

		In `` Mother Nature '' an intellectual -LRB-
Olivier	PERSON	-RRB- degrades his wife Renee : he will not share his life with her and he will not permit her to have children .

		In the end
Renee	PERSON	goes to a lover -LRB- Meryac -RRB- , but not before she assures her - self that her escape is willed not from weakness but from strength .

		She obeys
Mother Nature	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- La Souveraine -RRB- in her choice .

		In `` Progress '' there is a conflict between the two generations represented by the physicians Dr.
Therat	PERSON	and his son-in-law Dr.
Leglay	PERSON	.

		The younger finds out that the elder 's methods are not advancing and that they are becoming destructive to life .

		He breaks with him and in doing so breaks with his wife , who is devoted to her father 's reputation .

		The generation that succeeds Dr.
Leglay	PERSON	recon - ciles the methods of each .

		The distinctive element that
Vanzype	ORGANIZATION	brings into the thesis play is a strong sense of home and of family life .

		The action of both plays takes place within a family circle .

		Vanzype evidently belongs to that race of artists who loved to paint ordinary groups and homely interiors .

		His people are types rather than characters , but the strong sense that he has of their solid surround - ings makes it possible for the dramatist to give them an accent and a complexion .

COLUM	PERSON	.

		`` A Queer Fellow '' BOOTH TARKINGTON .

		By
Robert Cortes Holliday	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Remy de Gourmont called the critic a `` crea - teur des valeurs '' and contended that
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve had no small share in `` making '' the poets of the French romantic movement by imposing them upon the public at his own valuation of their talents and genius .

		Usually , however , it is the public that creates its own values .

		Criticism , as we have it today in the absence of a
Sainte	LOCATION	- Beuve , does little more in the long run than echo popular approval , confirming or substantiat - ing it .

		Now and then a critic essays some ra - tionale of this taste seeks to explain why , in his opinion , such and such a novelist has achieved success .

		Even this is something , and one wishes it were attempted oftener in
America	LOCATION	on the scale of Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	's clever and candid study of
Booth Tarkington	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
England	LOCATION	-LSB- he writes in his `` Foreword '' -RSB- it seems to be quite the fashion to get up all the while very 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	respectable little biographical and critical affairs about Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		And we do have knocking about over here admirable little books about foreign writers such as
Conrad	LOCATION	,
Anatole France	LOCATION	, and the one-time
Ameri	PERSON	- can Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		But certainly we have rather neg - lected to pry into living home talent .

		Now that Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	has made the start , perhaps others will follow and we shall have similar studies of
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	,
Robert Chambers	PERSON	,
Edith Wharton	PERSON	,
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	, and
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	.

		After all , it is just as well to make the most of what we possess ; and even if the material at times seems somewhat thin , and the writer a little ill at ease in his effort to thicken it , something will no doubt be gained if only in the useful practice of the critical genre which , as M. de Gourmont implied , is as im - portant in its way as the creative .

		Indeed , it may itself become entirely creative in the hands of a critic who , like Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	, is also something of a literary artist in his own right , and who can combine sound analysis with the ability to construct out of the qualities and characteristics thus disengaged a complete and well proportioned portrait of the man and his work .

		In the present instance it is a portrait some - what fantastic and by no means altogether flat - tering .

		For Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	has accepted seri - ously , though with a light heart , his task of interpretation ; and if he has made the most of Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's good points as he was bound to / do if he was to justify the job at all he has by no means failed to stress the weak points of this popular favorite among contemporary Amer - ican novelists .

		As such , Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	con - stitutes a somewhat peculiar case .

		We may take with what qualification we will his indignant denial that he has ever deliberately courted pub - lic favor ; he has , nevertheless , clearly and to an unusual degree tried to please himself as well as his readers .

		Even when most superficial in mat - ter and most artificial in manner , perhaps most of all at such times , he has shown an uncommon concern for at least certain aspects of his art as a writer .

		This is the more remarkable in that among the many conventions which he im - plicitly accepts and which , as Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	points out , make him so markedly a man an American man of his time , none is more pro- nounced than his ostentatious aversion to any - thing in the least savoring of the `` artistic . ''

		His little short of violent reaction to the whole idea of the `` literary '' atmosphere is a subject for ... the literary alienist .

		His friends know that at public dinners he always `` winches , '' as he puts it , at every oratorical reference to `` literature . ''

		Yet this is the man who on leaving college made his debut in a fin-de-siecle little magazine called `` John-a-Dreams '' and who still in his conver - sation refers more frequently to the `` artist '' than .

		anyone , `` except a painter or two , '' whom Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	has ever heard !

		The modern painter himself is not above this particular form of insincerity and affectation .

		I know one who makes a boast that he would rather be taken for a professional baseball player than anything else .

		Of course his is a more or less inevitable recoil from the velvet jacket and long hair pose of the preceding generation .

		But may we not express the hope that the time will come and soon !

		when both painter and writer will be content to be simply themselves and nobody else ?

		Certainly Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's personality , as Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	presents it to us , would be far more engaging without this taint of morbidity and self-consciousness , which seeks expression also in a pretentious disclaimer of `` highbrow '' interests .

		It is difficult to find any - thing either amusing or edifying in the anec - dote of his encounter with a friend whom he had not seen for some time and who , in the interim , had become a professor at an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	college .

		After their first greetings
Tarkington	ORGANIZATION	remarked musingly , `` Let me see , what is it you are doing now ? ''

		then added quickly , `` Oh yes , I remem - ber now .

		You are doing the serious . ''

		Something of the undergraduate 's supercilious - ness towards the faculty survives in this jejune flippancy , which is therefore not without a cer - tain significance .

		For all his days Mr.
Tarking	PERSON	- ton , like the late
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, has remained an undergraduate in his outlook on life .

		The world as he views it is an essentially unreal world , and his realism is no less romantic than his romance itself .

		Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	professes to trace a development in his work as a novelist , a growth in seriousness and human interest , but we are unable to follow .

		The mere abandon - ment of a complicated plot at one point in his career proves nothing except that he is as ready to accept one convention as another , and that without being imitative in any strict or slavish sense , he is yet responsive to the current changes in literary fashions .

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's lack of any real grip upon life is perhaps even more ap - parent in `` The Turmoil '' than in his earlier works , just because the stark simplicity of its plan throws into still higher relief his complete inability to create characters of a sufficient depth or complexity to make them either credible or
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 interesting .

		It , no less than `` The Gentleman from
Indiana	LOCATION	'' and ``
Monsieur Beaucaire	PERSON	, '' strikes one as the sort of book that might per - fectly well have been written by a clever college boy who knew nothing of life save by divination , and for whom literary art consisted exclusively in the cultivation of a sometimes heightened and colored style .

		It is noticeable that the melodrama which forms an important element in so much of Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's earlier work is by no means eliminated from `` The Turmoil . ''

		It has merely been transferred from the plot itself to the de - scriptive passages , and to the idea of modern industrialism which supplies the emotional at - mosphere .

		Compared with `` The Turmoil , '' `` Seventeen , '' which I believe appeared the same year , is a masterpiece and certainly marks the height of Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's accomplishment to the present .

		The one type of character into which he has thus far shown any real insight is that of the small boy and adolescent youth and there , perhaps , be - cause he has had to depend less upon imagination than memory .

		The one being of whom each of us is certain to know a little something is him - self , at the different stages of his development , while at the same time there are no experiences which men and women share so completely and universally as those of youth and childhood , be - fore lives and souls alike draw apart and become `` specialized . ''

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	, of course , by no means invented this boy genre , which has been one of the most popular in recent litera - ture .

		But I can think of no one else who has exploited it at once so seriously and so systemat - ically .

		`` Seventeen '' is a good deal more than a mere funny book , which is the aspect under which Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	principally views it .

		It is a study of adolescence that is searching almost to the point of cruelty cruelty such as Flaubert and Maupassant have been accused of in their wield - ing of the scalpel upon adult subjects .

		The style , too , in this particular department of Mr.
Tark	PERSON	- ington 's work is admirable .

		Indeed , one is tempted to say that whereas in other depart - ments he has displayed styles , here he has achieved Style .

		The question of Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's fu - ture career as a novelist is largely a question of his ability to carry over this singularly simple , nervous , and forceful manner into his other work , as a result of increasing insight into other , and more mature , types of character .

		Rebecca IFest Novelist THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIER .

		By
Rebecca West	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		What first interests me in this story is its length , or rather its brevity : all is done within one hundred and eighty-five pages .

		We have here an acute compressed exemplar of the form lately advocated by the Folletts that mode of novel-writing which has produced
James	PERSON	's `` The Spoils of Poynton '' and Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	. ''

		Say they : `` The novel as it is best written today has the sharp focus , the unity in purpose and point of view , of the short story .

		The change came about through the invention of an intermediate form , the kind of two-hun - dred-page narrative which results , not from fore - shortening the novel into the novelette , but from expanding the short story into the ` novella . ' ''

		Miss West 's `` novella '' is an episode , a situation involving but a few days or would be , were it not for a chronological backthrow which provides perspective , complications , and the road to a highly effective climax .

		We think , at the start , that we have to deal with
Rebecca West	PERSON	as still the brisk and brusque young radical of `` The Freewoman '' and `` The New Republic , '' walking through life in a trim tailor-made , with her feet setting themselves down firmly and her elbows in vigorous action .

		Well , she is all of that in certain phases of her social criticism ; but she is much more .

		Later on we incline to image Miss West as a spirited young filly , speeding it over her race track .

		For two-thirds of her course she trots , true to form , on the old well-known course , though she covers it with a quickened stride ; then comes a moment of tangled hoofs and a threat to bolt the regular track and to finish up before the judges ' stand anyhow .

		It is this that makes the fifth of her six chapters , which is crowded with unskilled transitions , both the worst and the best ; surely it is the most novel and moving .

		`` The Return of the Soldier '' is of course a war-story a story of shell-shock , amnesia , and the suppressed wish .

		The author is of the new day , and the new nomenclature shall not fail .

		But she throws out a decisive arm and tames science to art all with a tense economy of means that helps open a fresh era for the novel .

		Shall the returned soldier be left in his happy penum - bra of uncertainty by the one woman out of his past who understood and satisfied him , or shall he be cured and restored to the slight-natured wife who never satisfied him at all ?

		Shall the worthy 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	woman make the sacrifice for the unworthy one , condemning the rescued hero to face the future with a `` dreadful , decent smile '' ?

		One 's sense at the beginning is that the book may be a contraption ad hoc : it indeed derives from the war , and it rests on a combination of circumstances impossible before our own day ; but one presently perceives that it is animated by a higher and better spirit , and one willingly meets the applied psychology which , exercised near the end on the basis of homely domestic detail , brings the clouded mind safely through the labyrinth and throws a last grateful light on a memorable and essentially lovable heroine .

		It is in the social setting of her scene that Miss West seems most her radical self .

		Though she loves the changing aspects of nature and is lav - ish with vignettes portraying them , she is severe upon the landscape-gardening of the country - house and upon all its implications .

		A border of snowdrops and crocuses has no aesthetic rea - son : `` its use is purely philosophic ; it proclaims that here we esteem only controlled beauty , that the wild will not have its way within our gates , that it must be made delicate and decorated into felicity . ''

		Yes , most of the people in this story live in `` the impregnable fort of a gracious life , '' and have but scorn for the sordid dowdiness of the low-born heroine when she must be intro - duced into its choice precincts .

		Opposed to her stands the mistress of the place ; she is of those who are `` aware that it is their civilizing mission to flash the jewel of their beauty before all men , so that they shall desire it and work to get the wealth to buy it , and thus be seduced by a pres - ent appetite to a tilling of the earth that serves the future . ''

		And the curse of life under such general conditions is quietly but memorably expressed by the lady -LRB- under process of reforma - tion -RRB- who tells the tale : `` People like me , who are not artists , are never sure about people they do n't know . ''

		Miss West 's diction -LRB- I may even call it style -RRB- is of a richness a tempestuous , tangled richness that keeps one interested and excited .

		She lav - ishes it alike on her landscape and on the psy - chology of her people .

		Truth to tell , as regards this last , she is her own brusque , peremptory self , and sometimes does rather cursorily what , with due regard to the mysterious temple of the human mind , might justly enlist a little more leisure and finesse .

		But she has set her own limits and done her best a pretty good best within them .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS
COLORADO	LOCATION	, THE QUEEN JEWEL OF THE ROCKIES .

Mae Lucy Baggs	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.


FLORIDA	LOCATION	, THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT .

		By
Nevin O. Winter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Page ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Give the imagination the task of constructing an unexperienced whole out of the bits of evi - dence at hand , and it is likely to play strange tricks .

		A certain writer confesses that he was bitterly disappointed at his first sight of a swan it was so different from the bird he had recon - structed on the basis of the china cygnet that served as a match safe in the farmhouse where he had spent his boyhood .

		There are probably not a few people to whom , similarly ,
Colorado	LOCATION	appears in the mind 's eye as a wilderness of highly colored post-card mountains , with cog - ways running to the summits ; or to whom
Flor	PERSON	- ida , if not the paradise depicted on land-agents ' pamphlets , is a vivified woodcut of the Ever - glades , with a lambrequin of Spanish moss and reptiles .

		Perhaps in no respect is the average American more deficient than in the geography of his own land .

		As an aid to his imagination , accordingly , the `` See America First '' series , of which these two books are the latest volumes , must prove invaluable .

		If the books themselves hardly justify their sub-titles any more than a chamber of commerce bulletin ever paints a con - vincing `` Wonder City , '' they yet furnish abun - dant material from which the active imagination of the reader can reconstruct the true wonder - lands in which to go aroaming .

		The prospective tourist or the rocking-chair traveler will find ``
Florida	LOCATION	'' and ``
Colorado	LOCATION	'' complete guides .

		Both books follow practically the same plan , showing the rich historic back - grounds against which the modern life of the states is lived , and depicting that modern life in its most interesting phases .

		The chief emphasis -LRB- not unnaturally , since one of the chief indus - tries of both states is the tourist -RRB- is placed on playgrounds .

		``
Florida	LOCATION	, '' while not neglecting
Palm Beach	LOCATION	, will be found especially interesting and valuable for its descriptions of wild life ; and the account of
Colorado	LOCATION	's mountain sports is enough to awaken a long-stifled wanderlust .

		The fact that the books have small literary merit is not greatly in their disfavor .

		One could wish that the writer had not used `` glimpse '' as a verb , or had been a little more careful with their rela - tive pronouns ; but one can recommend the books , in spite of crudities of style , as bits of honest workmanship , brimming over with facts , attrac - tively printed and bound , well illustrated , and presenting each a businesslike bibliography for the reader who wishes to travel further .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 301 A DIARY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION .

		By
James L. Houghteling	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		From
January 20	DATE	to Easter ,
1917	DATE	Mr.
Houghteling	PERSON	was either in
Petrograd	LOCATION	or Mos - cow or on the train between the two cities .

		Although this is only the start of the Revolution indeed , the really dangerous revolution to pro- letarian control did not come until last fall it is the most dramatic period , the period one would give most to have seen .

		But it is not an especially dramatic period in Mr.
Houghteling	PERSON	's narrative , which is just what it says it is , a diary .

		He sees some of the street fighting ; he witnesses the perverse and imperturbable manner in which the ordinary activities of everyday life insisted on continuing ; he talks with people on the train , in the hotel , at street corners .

		Perhaps if Mr.
Houghteling	PERSON	had made pretenses to a subtle lit - erary style instead of writing straightforward description his story would have lost most of its present genuine effectiveness and interest .

		For that effectiveness comes largely from the nat - uralness and matter-of-factness of Mr.
Hough	PERSON	- teling 's tone , its very lack , as it were , of the theatrical and melodramatic .

		A revolution loses most of its terrors under such a treatment ; it becomes almost temptingly easy and conven - tional .

		On
March 13	DATE	the author writes : `` It was growing dark and we could not make out who were skirmishing , but the thought surged in upon us that we might be taken for police - men .

		We were near home and by unanimous consent adjourned for the day .

		The streets of the city are no place for an innocent bystander tonight . ''

		Fortunately Mr.
Houghteling	PERSON	was content to be an innocent bystander with respect to interpretation of events .

		He wisely remains a reporter .

		Yet one report we can not read but with pride the eagerness of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	' to be recognized by the
United States	LOCATION	, and the historic fact that we were the first nation to accord that recognition .

		CREATORS OF DECORATIVE STYLES .

		By
Walter A. Dyer	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	's book reminds one of
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's accusation that we love art but do not sufficiently honor our craftsman .

		In fact it has chiefly been the epigrams in
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's `` Decorative Arts in
America	LOCATION	'' which have been remembered , with the result that the book 's effectiveness in the drawing - room has largely robbed it of its value as inspira - tion in the workshop .

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	, however , wisely does not attempt to draw morals from his clear and concise history of our decorative styles and their leaders .

		Yet he has avoided the pitfall of describing all styles or all decorators an attempt which has cast so many interpreta - tive efforts on the statistical junk-heap and he has at the same time resolutely refused to take a short cut to taste .

		The evolution of the styles in
England	LOCATION
from 1603	DATE	to
1800	DATE	, which have given a distinctive stamp to English and American social life , is developed so that it is impossible to read his twelve chapters without drawing an inference .

		English style is our heritage , and others are but exoticisms .

		When Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	chooses eleven decorators from
Inigo Jones	PERSON	to
Sheraton	LOCATION	, we can question only his choice of
Chambers	LOCATION	, and this is effaced in the joy of escap - ing
Isaac Ware	PERSON	and
William Kent	PERSON	.

		It is not a book telling the component parts of all style , * how to recognize them in polite society , and how to imitate them on a small income : hints as to the adaptability to the present are left , as they should be , to the personality of the reader .

		It is a book not only for those Americans whose social position forces them to take an interest in style , but also for those who honestly wish we could boast a national decorative style of our own .

		ORGANIC EVOLUTION .

		By
Richard Swan Lull	ORGANIZATION	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		By far the larger number of books dealing with the subject of organic evolution have been written from the standpoint of interpretation of the exist - ing organic world .

		Inductions from observations on structure , development , distribution , and activities of animals and plants as we find them to-day have been made the basis for the analysis of the factors of evolution .

		In the last decade experimentalists have been busy putting to the test the inductions of the Darwinian and post - Darwinian period , not always with confirmatory results .

		Professor Lull 's book is written from the standpoint of the actual record of evolution as read by the paleontologist in the fossils from the past .

		Of necessity , this record deals mainly with the diversifications and successions of types already established , for all the great groups of animals were in existence in Lower Cambrian times or shortly thereafter .

		The investigator of fossils is constantly called upon to reconstruct the whole animal in his imagination from a single organ system , the hard parts or skeleton , and to conjure up its environment and habits of life from the slightest of clues and by analogies from living relatives .

		His attention is also repeatedly called to changes in structure , with lapse of time , in changing environmental conditions .

		Function and environment thus come in his view of the evolutionary process to be the fashioning ham - mers which incessantly shape the evolving life of sea , forest , desert , and plain .

		It is this historical dynamics of life , richly illustrated from the records of the ancient faunas , which is presented in this latest effort to 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	trace the course of evolution and evaluate its factors .

		Here the author is on familiar ground and his contributions are illuminating and authoritative .

		When he enters other fields , how - ever , he relies quite freely on previous summaries .

		Hence his uncritical acceptance of the mimicry hypothesis and his unqualified ascription of the biogenetic law to
Haeckel	LOCATION	.

		Even the germ plasm dogma of
Weismann	LOCATION	, which he incorporates with - out qualms , does not seem to disturb his later applications of Lamarckian principles .

		From the standpoint of the cytologist , the geneticist , the mutationist , and the experimentalist , the work leaves much to be said , but they must look else - where for a critical , up-to-date presentation of their conflicting contributions to this ever - widening field of investigation .

		THE NOTE BOOK OF AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER .

		By
Eric Fisher Wood	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cen - tury ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		There are many good things in Major Wood 's book .

		It is the gossip of a man who has met in the impact of work the personalities which direct the operations of the British Empire .

		He has had an eye to their revealing ways as well as to the humorous wayside incidents of war .

		He has an interesting study of the workings of the stu - pendous British censorship .

		In his account of the Battle of
Arras	LOCATION	, in which he marched forward into machine-gun fire and was wounded , there is the simplicity of strong feeling .

		There is the simplicity , too , of good form , which makes the volume the talk of a gentleman rather than the revelation of an artist .

		For although what Major Wood writes is carefully observed and under favorable conditions , he betrays the anaes - thesia of class .

		He is a fierce admirer of Lord Northcliffe .

		He talks of the `` progressive ele - ments in British public life under the leadership of such men as
Lloyd George	PERSON	,
Carson	PERSON	,
Milner	PERSON	, and Derby . ''

		He can not even resist his impulse of enthusiasm , quite natural to the man who fights , for war and war 's galvanic effect on the emotions of a people .

		`` There are moments of exaltation , '' he writes , `` when one finds oneself agreeing with the detestable
Nietzsche	PERSON	that war is a great moral rejuvenator , both for the nation and for the individual . ''

		He has become con - vinced that `` war psychology lies very near to fundamental truths . ''

		Major Wood is an exam - ple of the upper class man at his best convinced of the rightness of his cause , ready to sacrifice himself and be a gentleman in the act , humor - ous , charming , not too impressed with the power of his own emotions .

		And yet if Major Wood were not an American , one might call him insu - lar .

		For those rumblings that may some time out - sound the clamor of war itself , he has no ear .

$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		While other critics are engaged in appraising and placing the authors of `` today '' and of `` yes - terday '' Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	in this little volume concerns herself with the authors of day before yesterday .

		Time has moved on ; yet
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, after the pendulum-swing of appreciation and depreci - ation , are not even yet in the places where they precisely belong .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, in her delicate , none too conclusive fashion , holds up her little taper , throwing a new light and producing some delayed nuances .

		She occupies herself largely with the culling of verbal felicities , securing many even from
Dickens	PERSON	, and not a few of a stark , direct kind from
Emily Bronte	PERSON	's `` Wuth - ering Heights . ''

		She also follows
Charlotte	LOCATION	from her early days of `` unscholarly Latin-English '' to the later period of the better , more vital Eng - lish in which she describes her sister Emily 's death .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	praises
Tennyson	PERSON	for his independence of French influences , and taxes
Swinburne	PERSON	for having so often merely applied his own verbal dexterity to other men 's passions .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	is always and everywhere very obviously concerned with diction ; and diction , in most of the present essays , is her dominant preoccupation .

		A LITERARY PILGRIM IN

		By
Edward Thomas	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		For the chimney corner and slippered ease this series of twenty-nine topographical biogra - phies is good company .

		The author is not in - terested , for the moment at least , in the tragedy of
Keats	PERSON	's life , the sternness of
Arnold	LOCATION	's , or the boisterousness of
Burns 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		His intent is merely to show how certain districts of

Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, the Lake District the poetry of

		The principal question always is : What is Her - rick 's country ?

		Fitzgerald 's ?


Stevenson	PERSON	's ?

		And to what degree and in what manner did this country , with its hills , flowers , birds , streams , and trees , find its way into the author 's mind and thence into his work ?

		Although Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	tells us little that is new , it is a pleas - ure to have half-forgotten landscapes brought thus deftly before our eyes again .

		Liberal , though skilful , quotation from letters and poems , and the reproduction in color of several paint - ings after
Walter Decker	PERSON	, R.B.A. , and others , help materially to make the volume what it is a leisurely and unruffled journey through the garden that is all

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 303 MEDICAL RESEARCH AND HUMAN WEL - FARE .

		By
W. W. Keen	PERSON	.

		Houghton Mif - flin ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		America is fortunate in the medical tradition that has set in high regard the practitioner with broad human interests .

		The tradition begins early in the career of Benjamin Rush .

		It received a popular sanction in the writings of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, and again in those of
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		It is to this group that one may add the services of Dr. Keen the fact that three of the names belong to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	is worthy of mention .

		Dr.
Keen	PERSON	's volume tells the deeply significant story of the conquest of dis - ease by human endeavor ; it tells it convincingly , with adequate reenforcement of data , with tell - ing evidence , with a human charm in the pride of triumph of a professional devotion .

		The vol - ume contains a photograph of Dr. Keen as he served in the Civil War , and another that shows him in the dignity and vigor of his present age .

		The contrast serves to illustrate the tremendous advance in methods of surgery and medicine which a single life , consecrated to the allevia - tion of ills , has witnessed and aided .

		We accept all too thoughtlessly the gifts of the physician , rising no higher ordinarily than the personal tribute of the `` G. P. , '' the grateful patient .

		It is well to have passed in review the achievements of the army of medical science , an account of its many campaigns , its sore trials , its still imper - fect control of many of the ills that flesh is heir to but through it all a persistent and consistent advance and a series of battles won .

		Dr.
Keen	PERSON	's story belongs in every library in the country .

		With the country at war , the service of the medical fraternity is again conspicuously recog - nized .

		The laboratory and the hospital sustain the men at the front , and sustain them with the international humanity of a common service .

		One discordant note has appeared , the protest of sentimental extremists against the use of animal life to save the precious lives of the defenders of our country .

		The lesson of the contribution of medical research to human wel - fare still needs to be vigorously enforced .

		THE SPELL OF
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Archie Bell	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		There is a good deal of agreeable chit-chat about some of the better known parts of
China	LOCATION	in this book of tourist travel , and a flowing journalistic style makes it easy and occasionally diverting reading .

		The so-called `` spell '' is exerted by little more than the regulation sights
Hongkong	ORGANIZATION	,
Canton	LOCATION	,
Macao	LOCATION	,
Shanghai	LOCATION	, Hang - chow reached via houseboat ,
Hankow	LOCATION	, Peking , Tientsin cities which , although they spread over a large part of the eastern coast of
China	LOCATION	, com - prise only a small part of the whole country .

		But if Mr.
Bell	PERSON	saw only what may be seen by other tourists , he seasoned what he has written with a few nearly original investigations that go far toward justifying his effort .

		His experi - ences in a native theatre in
Shanghai	LOCATION	give rise to some interesting comments about what the new art in our theatrical world owes to the very ancient Chinese drama , especially in the matter of stage technique .

		A short excursion into Nip - ponized
Korea	LOCATION	, with observations on
Japan	LOCATION	's methods of efficiency , completes a volume which , were it as valuable as readable , would take a dignified position in the literature of travel .

		THE HISTORY OF MEDIEVAL
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		By
Lynn Thorndike	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.75	MONEY	.

		Thorndike 's history belongs to the new school .

		The dominant interest here developed is in great movements cutting across nationalities and polit - ical geography .

		Artificial boundary lines tend to disappear in the writer 's mind and interna - tional tendencies in the development of
Europe	LOCATION	are seen as wholes .

		The book is primarily a his - tory of culture .

		It develops the economic and social , the literary and artistic , the religious and moral life of the people quite as much as , or even more than , the course of political intrigue and military exploits .

		However , dynastic and other class ambitions are not without their role in the medieval drama as here described , and the observable kinship to present tendencies in this regard is sometimes striking .

		Through all the book one gains a sense of continuity , of orderly progression .

		This effect is especially helped by the chart at the end of the volume which por - trays graphically by use of maps the major move - ments in medieval times .

		AN INTRODUCTION TO POLITICAL PARTIES AND PRACTICAL POLITICS .

		By
P. Orman	PERSON	' Ray .


Scribners	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		Politics has been somewhat obscured , if not placed in abeyance , by the war , but the present revision of this popular handbook , reviewing the latest legislation and usage in the field , is wel - come .

		Professor Ray , who teaches at
North	LOCATION	- western
University	ORGANIZATION	, has produced the most prac - tical and incisive work that has yet appeared in this division of social science .

		There is scarcely a phase of the subject from an analysis of cur - rent party policies and methods to the practical nominating and campaigning machinery of the parties in action which is not illumined by his wide investigations .

		The extended bibliographies at the end of each chapter are probably the most complete of the sort anywhere to be found and will be of particular interest to students of prac - tical politics .

		304 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 28	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT FROM
FRANCE	LOCATION	COMES THE BLACKEST NEWS of the war , as THE DIAL goes to press , and for the present everything else will shrivel into insignificance beside the issue being decided in that long roar of guns whose steady throbbing can be heard on the house-tops even in
London	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps when these words are read the final direction of the tide of battle will be known .

		For ourselves , we can not lose faith .

		We remem - ber the Marne , and take courage .

		We remember
Ypres	LOCATION	.

		We remember
Verdun	LOCATION	and the
Somme	LOCATION	.

		And one thing now is clear .

		German autocracy must win this battle or lose the war the mili - tarists dare not stand upon the defensive and appeal to the judgment of mankind .

		Their record in
Russia	LOCATION	shows that they know no other way to win peace than the way of force .

		That way , we firmly believe , is forever barred to them .

		It is no longer a question whether militarism and autocracy will or will not be defeated ; they are already defeated .

		AN ARTISTS ' COMMITTEE HAS NOMINATED TO the War Department eight American artists to accompany our armies and make a pictorial rec - ord of the war .

		The list is something of a com - mentary on the status of painting in this country .

		It includes only one representative of the salon tradition of vested `` Art '' only one of secure reputation
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	, pupil of
Benjamin	LOCATION	- Constant ,
Doucet	PERSON	, and
Lefebvre	PERSON	.

		It includes only one etcher ,
J. Andre Smith	PERSON	.

		There are two others who are primarily painters , neither of whom is very widely known
Harvey Dunn	PERSON	and
Harry Townsend	PERSON	.

		But there are four illustra - tors :
Wallace Morgan	PERSON	,
Walter Enright	PERSON	, Wil -
liam Aylward	PERSON	, and
George Wright	PERSON	.

		A few of these eight have done , or bid fair to do , good work ; yet at least half of them are unknown quantities so far as the public is concerned .


Britain	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	-LRB- as
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	said in THE DIAL for
January 31	DATE	-RRB- have commis - sioned for the same purpose such men as
Muir	PERSON	- head Bone ,
William Orpen	PERSON	, and
Augustus John	PERSON	brilliant painters , `` living forces . ''

		We have nominated four representatives of our craft of illustrating , than which nothing could be more stagnantly conventional , and some young men of whom we have hopes .

		It is quite possible that among them the opportunity might discover a man of brilliance and force ; all of us trust that it would .

		Meanwhile , however , shall we not recognize that when there arises an opportunity for distinguished talent and originality in art , we have to meet it with practitioners of a popu - lar craft , with a graceful acknowledgment to the academic , and then with blank checks drawn on our hopes ?

		WHAT DO OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES COST us ?

		The following figures of appropriations per capita in certain cities have been roughly com - piled from data on library taxation in
1916	DATE	, drawn from the current report of the
Pratt Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and from the populations reported in the
1910	DATE	census .

		Probably they are far from accurate , since some of these cities grew very rapidly between
1910	DATE	and
1916	DATE	; but if a similar study were to be based on the
1920	DATE	cen - sus it would doubtless discover much the same general conditions .

		There are given figures for three cities of more than one million inhabitants :
New York	LOCATION	is taxed about
29 cents	MONEY	per inhabitant ,
Chicago	LOCATION	about 25 , and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	about 18 .

		The next group includes cities of less than a mil - lion and more than half a million : Cleveland
73 cents	MONEY	,
Pittsburg	LOCATION	60 , and
St. Louis	LOCATION	42 .

		Com - parison of these groups suggests that there is something like a maximum cost for the first-class library and that it mounts much less rapidly than does the population the library serves .

		Baltimore would fall in the second group ; but whereas the three cities named in that group average an ap - propriation of
58 cents	MONEY	per capita ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	en - joys only
9 cents	MONEY	per capita , to which must be added from its endowment
9 cents	MONEY	more .

		The fact that this total of 1
8 cents	MONEY	is
40 cents	MONEY	less than the average for his group certainly supports the
Pratt Librarian	ORGANIZATION	's plea for more funds .

		The re - maining groups divide at the quarter-million mark : OVER 250,000 UNDER 250,000
Los Angeles	LOCATION	70
Oakland	LOCATION	79
Detroit	LOCATION	59
Seattle	LOCATION	74
Minneapolis	LOCATION	56
Springfield	LOCATION	71
Newark	LOCATION	43 Grand Rapids 51
Milwaukee	LOCATION	38
Worcester	LOCATION	44
Cincinnati	LOCATION	33
St. Paul 33 Buffalo 29	ORGANIZATION
Louisville	LOCATION
27 Denver 26 Omaha 24 Rochester 24 Atlanta 21	DATE	The discrepancy between the upper cities in each group and their group averages is doubtless ac - counted for by their greatly augmented popula - tion since
1910	DATE	.

		Fair averages might omit
Los Angeles	LOCATION	and
Detroit	LOCATION	from the first column and
Oakland	LOCATION	,
Seattle	LOCATION	, and
Springfield	LOCATION	from the sec - ond .

		That would yield an average appropriation of
35 cents	MONEY	for cities of between a quarter and a half million population , and of
33 cents	MONEY	for cities of less than a quarter million .

		Compare these averages with those of the million and half-million groups : GROUP AVERAGES Under 250,000 33 250,000500,000 35 500,0001,000,000 58 Over 1,000,000 24 It would appear that libraries in cities approach - ing the million mark cost per capita about
25 cents	MONEY	more than those in cities of a quarter mil -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 lion , and about
34 cents	MONEY	more than those of cities that have passed the million mark .

		Accurate statistics would doubtless alter the relations be - tween particular cities in the groups tabulated , but they would scarcely affect the expensive situ - ation of those in the half-million group .

		Appar - ently the American city requires a metropolitan library long before it is able to finance one on a metropolitan appropriation per capita .

		* How WILL
AMERICA	LOCATION	'S DEMAND FOR BOOKS during the war differ from the demands of the other nations ?

		Publishers and booksellers have long since noted the shift in interest from the light sentimental novel to the political and his - torical study , and the list of war books an - nounced for publication this
spring	DATE	is staggering .

		Yet the implications of our peculiar geographical and psychological position have not been fully realized .

		Curiosity about the war is more in - satiable with us than with other belligerents , who live too close to it .

		There is a whole `` liter - ature of release '' in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, the avowed object of which is to `` take one 's mind off the war . ''

		With us , who do not live in fear of air raids , any emotional strain is quickly snapped by a visit to a `` movie '' house or a musical comedy , perhaps by a detective story .

		Generally speaking , however , we can endure much more realistic and depressing descriptions of the battle line than those peoples to whom the trenches are only a few hours ' railroad journey distant .


Robert Dell	ORGANIZATION	has told how little the war itself is mentioned in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In
Holland	LOCATION	the one sure way to make yourself unpopular is to start a discussion about the war .

		Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	has told of the great throngs at the races in
Berlin	LOCATION	, and recent accounts from neutral cities give the picture of the German people as in - terested in almost everything except politics and belligerency .

		The theatrical season in
London	LOCATION	is admittedly banal , mere revivals or musical re - views .

		One aspect of
Europe	LOCATION	's war-weariness which has escaped attention is the disinclination to buy just those kinds of books which today crowd our own shops .

		We have an eagerness to learn the political and historical background of the war , as well as to read the more intimate , personal descriptions , which would be regarded with astonishment in any of the European capi - tals .

		To us it is all still an intellectual novelty and an emotional novelty .

		We are only begin - ning to participate , and until the autumn at least it is not likely that the first wave of interest will subside .

		We shall probably end by being better informed about the war than those who live next door to it .

		Who was the peasant who was born in
1785	DATE	and lived until
1840	DATE	in a sub - urb of
Paris	LOCATION	, yet had never heard of Napoleon ?

		THE DEBUTS OF THREE MORE MONTHLY MAG - azines have taken place in the last few weeks : In
January	DATE	appeared the first number of `` The New World , '' a liberal `` medium for the free discussion of questions relative to the interpre - tation of Christianity to our age and its appli - cation for the reconstruction of society . ''

		It is published in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The editors are
Norman N. Thomas	PERSON	-LRB- Managing -RRB- ,
Edward W. Evans	PERSON	,
Harold Hatch	PERSON	,
John Haynes Holmes	PERSON	, Ru - fus Jones ,
Richard Roberts	PERSON	,
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	,
Harry F. Ward	PERSON	, and
Walter G. Fuller	PERSON	-LRB- Secretary -RRB- .

		`` The Liberator , '' of which the first issue appeared in
February	DATE	, has no relation to the late `` Masses '' ; but , curiously enough ,
Max Eastman	PERSON	is Editor ,
Floyd Dell	ORGANIZATION	is Associate Ed - itor , and the list of Contributing Editors which includes
Cornelia Barnes	PERSON	,
Howard Brubaker	PERSON	,
John Reed	PERSON	,
Boardman Robinson	PERSON	,
Charles W. Wood	PERSON	, and Art Young no less than the format , suggests once more that in real life coincidence is often more perfect than it is on the stage .

		And `` Bruno 's
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' makes its bow .

		`` De - voted to Life , Love , and Letters , '' it is published from
1476 Broadway	DATE	,
New York	LOCATION	, by
Guido Bruno	PERSON	, sometime editor and publisher of `` Bru - no 's Weekly . ''

		These periodicals , together with ``
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	's '' and other arrivals that THE DIAL has welcomed to the lists since the first of the year , should reassure all pessimists .

		The rising mortality among magazines need no longer alarm ; the birth-rate is rising as rapidly .

		ONE HAPPY SCHEME .

		FOR RAISING MONEY for the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	we might well copy from
England	LOCATION	.

		For three years the funds from the gifts of rare books and autographs have all been used for the benefit of the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		This year Sir
James M. Barrie	PERSON	and Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	have control of the collection , and Sir
James	PERSON	has written a characteristic letter to the papers with the felicitous title `` The Hundred Best Gaps . ''

		He pleads that in a time of sacrifice all of us may well take from our bookshelves our one val - uable treasure , either a first edition or a manu - script .

		Sir
James	PERSON	has himself given the original manuscript of `` The Little Minister . ''

		Mrs.
Reginald Smith	PERSON	has given the original manu - scripts of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's `` Far From the Mad - ding Crowd '' and of
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Virginibus Puerisque . ''

		But one of the most interesting gifts is that of Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	the actual copy of `` Vanity Fair '' which
Thackeray	PERSON	sent to Currer Bell when he first read her novel ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. ''

		He did not then , of course , know who the author was , but the book is autographed with ``
W. M. Thackeray	PERSON	's kind regards . ''

		Surely our own collectors and bibliophiles will not be outdone in generosity by their English brethren ?

		THE
DIAL Si JFortniff &	ORGANIZATION	tlj ?

		Journal of Critfctem and SDtecuwton of Eitetatute and Education and Social Direction It is not surprising that many persons in the
United States	LOCATION	who are accustomed to think of themselves as belonging to the `` upper '' and therefore rightfully rul - ing class , and who are impressed by the endurance and resistance of
Germany	LOCATION	in the war , should look with envious admira - tion upon the Prussian system of authori - tarian education .

		To suppose however that they desire a direct importation of the German system of autocratic power and willing submissiveness in order to se - cure the discipline and massive order of
Germany	LOCATION	, is to make a blunder .

		They see
America	LOCATION	retaining its familiar traditions ; for the most part they would be sincerely shocked at a suggestion of surrender of democratic habits .

		What they see in their fancy is an
America	LOCATION	essentially devoted to democratic ideals and rising to the service of these ideals with a thorough - ness , a unanimity , an efficiency and ordered discipline which they imagine would be secured by a judicious adoption of German methods .

		Since they do not perceive the interdependence of ends and means , or of purposes and methods , their error is intel - lectual rather than perversely immoral .

		They are stupid rather than deliberately disloyal .

		It is one of the many merits of
Veblen	PERSON	's most enlightening book on Imperial Ger - many that he makes clear the high human cost of the envied German habit .

		Under modern conditions social automatism is not automatically self-sustaining .

		It repre - sents a delicate and complicated piece of machinery which can be kept in proper working order only by immense pains .

		The obedient mind is not a thing which can be achieved by the segregated means of school discipline alone .

		All the re - sources of all social institutions have to be centred upon it without let-up .

		`` It can be maintained only by unremitting habit - uation , discipline sagaciously and relent - lessly directed to this end . ''

		Successful warfare , the effects of warlike prepara - tion , and indoctrination with warlike arro - gance are more necessary than the technique of the class room .

		Only `` bureau - cratic surveillance and unremitting inter - ference in the private life '' of subjects can , in the face of the disintegrating tendencies of contemporary industry and trade , de - velop that `` passionate aspiration for sub - servience '' which is a marked feature of the Prussian diathesis .

		If we look these facts in the face , we shall quickly see the romanticism of any proposal to secure the German type of disciplined efficiency and of patient and persistent `` industry '' by borrowing a few features of the personal relation of teacher and pupil and install - ing them in the school .

		Only an occasional 1 pedagogical Dogberry can rise to the level of a
New York	LOCATION	school administrator who would secure permanent good loyal citizen - ship by `` teaching -LSB- sic -RSB- instinctive obedi - ence '' in the schools .

		Taken in this crude form , the desire to Prussianize the disciplinary methods of American schools is too incoherent and spasmodic to constitute a serious danger .

		A serious danger there is , however , and it lies in the confused thinking which such efforts stimulate and strengthen .

		The dan - ger lies not in any likelihood of success .

		Save here and there and for a brief period , the attempts run hopelessly counter to the trend of countless social forces .

		The dan - ger is that the vague desire and confused thought embodied in them will cover up the real problems involved in securing an effectively loyal democratic citizenship , and distract attention from the construc - tive measures required to develop the kind of social unity and social control required in a democracy .

		For the whole tendency of current lamentations over the failure of American education to secure social inte - gration and effective cohesion , is to put emphasis upon the futile and irritating relations of personal authority and per - 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	sonal subjection , or else upon the regu - lative power of blind engrained habits , whose currency presupposes an authori - tative deus ex machina behind the scenes to supply the ends for which the habits are to work .

		And anybody who has n't put his soul to sleep with the apologetics of soporific `` idealism '' knows that at the present time the power which would fix the ends to which the masses would be habituated is the economic class which has a selfish interest in the exercise of control .

		To cater to this class by much talk of the importance of discipline , obedience , habit - uation , and by depreciation of initiative and creative thought as socially dangerous , may be a quick path to favor .

		But it rep - resents an ignobility of spirit which is peculiarly out of place in an educator , who above all others is called upon to keep his supreme interest sensitively human .

		Unfortunately there is much in the tradi - tion of what is regarded as scientific sociology which lends itself , unwittingly , ^ to such base uses .

		Sociological science in - herited a basic error from the older political science , and has too often devoted itself to a pompous dressing-out of solu - tions of a problem resting upon a `` fact '' which is n't a fact .

		It has taken as its chief problem how individuals who are -LRB- supposedly -RRB- non-social become social - ized , how social control becomes effective among individuals who are naturally hos - tile to it .

		The basic supposition is , of course , mythological .

		Docility , desire for direction , love for protective control are stronger original traits of human nature than is insubordination or originality .

		The scales are always weighted in favor of habituation and against reflective thought .

		Routine is so easy as to be `` natural , '' and initiative is so difficult as to require the severe discipline of art .

		But the socio - logical antithesis of the individual and the social has invaded educational thought and is employed by the pedagogue to defend unintelligent convention , unexamined tra - dition , and to feed the irritable vanity of that petty tyrant , the educational adminis - trator , who learns by study of the new sociological pedagogy that the exercise of his personal authority is in reality an exemplar of the great problem of soci - ology the `` social control '' of the unre - generate , unsocialized individual .

		This thoughtless sociology does some - thing , however , even more harmful than the rationalization of mere personal authority .

		It serves to justify the laziness , the intellectual inertia , of the educational routineer .

		The latter finds it easier , say , to rely upon books than to make himself a well informed man at first hand .

		He is solemnly told that textbooks socialize the pupil , for they embody the intellectual heritage of the race .

		He then puts to one side the onerous task of achieving any per - sonal originality in the subjects he teaches , lest he might fire his students with `` indi - vidualism '' having socially disastrous con - sequences .

		An uneasy intellectual con - science tells a teacher that in his methods he is following the lines of least resistance furnished by school customs which he has unreflectively picked up .

		But he is con - soled by being told that thinking merely develops individualism , that custom is the great social balance wheel .

		And far be it from him to undermine the sanctities of institutionalized habit by a little adven - ture in personal reflection .

		He has a sense that his ways of dealing with pupils are external and perfunctory .

		He feels that if he took pains to acquaint himself with the scientific methods of gaining insight into human nature and applied himself with sympathy to understanding it in its immense diversity , he might be able to work from the inside to release potentiali - ties instead of from the outside to impose conventionalities .

		But then the solemn guardian of `` social control '' comes along and warns him of the `` social '' value of respect for authority as such , and the dan - gers of `` catering '' to individuality .

		A scientific excuse for natural laziness and ignorance can go a long way .

		The worst of all this , I repeat , is that it leaves problems which are pressing un - touched and ignores the urgent need for the particular kind of social direction fitted to a democratic society the direction which comes from heightened emotional appreciation of common interests and from an understanding of social responsi - bilities , an understanding to be secured only by experimental and personal partici -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 335 pation in the conduct of common affairs .

		At this point the antithesis between indi - vidual and social ceases to be merely silly .

		It becomes dangerous .

		For the unsolved problem of democracy is the construction of an education which will develop that kind of individuality which is intelligently alive to the .

		common life and sensitively loyal to its common maintenance .

		It is not an antithesis of social control and indi - vidual development which our education requires .

		We want that type of education which will discover and form the kind of individual who is the intelligent carrier of a social democracy social indeed , but still a democracy .

		J QHN DEWEY .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	and Democracy Though personalities and institutional jealousies thrust themselves into the field of academic controversy , those who really care most about the future of the university in
America	LOCATION	must ignore them .

		They must keep for guidance one ideal the orderly and progressive development of democ - racy in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Whether this college professor is unworthy of his call - ing , or that college president is clearly lacking in courage and understanding , is of slight moment .

		Solemn before us is the future of our country war against the German menace to civilization ; the im - pending , nay existing , struggles between capital and labor ; grave problems of effi - cient government ; the abolition of unde - served poverty ; the call for science and service , for the counsel and advice of the wisest and best , of the unafraid and the unbought .

		At bottom and forever , the question of academic freedom is the ques - tion of intellectual and spiritual leadership in American democracy .

		Those who lead and teach , are they free , fearless , and worthy of trust ?

		If they fain would lead the people , do they lead under the eye of eternity or under the eye of the trustees ' committee on salaries , pensions , and pro- motions ?

		If they find through research and mature thought that a popular move - ment is full of peril can they say so and command , as known freemen , the respect of the masses ?

		When they face the ques - tioning multitude , whose whimsies and fallacies they would overbear , do they encounter distrust and contempt or high esteem and confidence ?

		Everywhere the tide of democracy comes in .

		Ancient
China	LOCATION	struggles for a republic .

		The crown of the
Romanoffs	ORGANIZATION	is in the dust .

		Labor rises higher and higher in the scale of power .

		The agrarians are astir once more .

		Great hopes shine in at the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	door , but who knows what trials or what disasters await ?

		The wrath of man may praise God , but it can not man - age an industry or conduct a government .

		It may pull down such pillars of order and justice as we have now erected , and leave dust and ashes .

		Every student of democracy , every enlightened socialist familiar with history , knows that popular uprisings may lead to ruin as well as to higher things .

		The fate of republics , democracies , and empires teaches us this .

		The wise Aristotle learned it centuries ago .

		When the fierce light of popular inquiry beats upon our institutions of government and property after the great war is over , where is to be found the trusted leader - ship that can guide and mould the forces that may upbuild or destroy civiliza - tion ?

		What can wisdom accomplish if it is regarded with suspicion and distrust ?

		How can the calm voice of reason prevail if it is known to be modulated to suit the whims of paymasters who come once a month to see that their servants have obeyed orders ?

		And if our universities are to be distrusted by the people whose labor of hand and brain supports them , whether they be public or private , why should educational incomes and endow - ments be maintained ?

		A democracy that suspects will disestablish and disendow .

		The smug security afforded by the
Dart	PERSON	- mouth College case will avail little against a people demanding services from those who have privileges .

		Loud professions of self-approved righteousness will become merely amusing .

		Those who behold as well as those who perform the auguries will laugh , and the day of undoing will come .

		336 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	Intimately related to this greater ques - tion of spiritual leadership is the effect of trustee guardianship upon the class of men who will seek academic positions .

		President
Lowell	PERSON	has called our attention sharply to this point .

		Men who love the smooth and easy will turn to teaching .

		As long as they keep silent on living issues , their salaries will be secure .

		It will not be important that they should arouse and inspire students in the class room .

		They need not be teachers .

		They are asked to be only purveyors of the safe and insignifi - cant .

		Afraid of taking risks , they will shrink into timid pusillanimity .

		Risking nothing , they will make no mistakes ; risk - ing nothing , they will accomplish nothing .

		Perfunctory performance of statutory duties will bring the pay check .

		They may sit in the chimney corner and curse the trustees and president and even laugh at capitalists , providing they laugh softly .

		Men of will , initiative , and inventiveness , not afraid of falling into error in search for truth , will shun such a life of futile lubricity , as the free woman avoids the harem .

		Undoubtedly it will be possible to fill all vacant chairs and keep the num - ber of `` learned '' publications up-to-date ; but to what purpose ?

		That the belly may be full , the mind slothful with paid and pensioned ease ?

		Those who have the great passion to create , to mould , to lead , to find new paths will look upon the uni - versity professorship as an unclean thing , or at best no thing to challenge their hope and courage .

		We have before us two ideals .

		Accord - ing to one of them , a board of trustees , who meet for an hour or two once a month or once every three months , will assume full and undivided responsibility `` as to whether the influence of a given teacher is injurious to private morals or dangerous to public order and security . ''

		They will guarantee the intellectual output of their factory to be 100 per cent pure .

		Any member of their institution who teaches or writes , either as a professor or as a citizen , will have their stamp as to the correctness of his views .

		The professors ' commodities will bear the trade-mark of the firm .

		The teachers are to be relieved of moral responsibility .

		As long as they are retained , they are pure .

		The trustees get what they pay for , and the teacher delivers standardized goods .

		To many a simple mind this seems sound enough .

		But let us examine the working of this doctrine .

		A great uni - versity has several hundred professors in all the known sciences and arts , from anthropologists , biologists , and chemists down through historians and political economists to zymotic disease experts .

		They speak a various language which only the adept understands .

		It is a matter of common knowledge that an expert can teach the most violent and subversive doc - trines in technical terminology , which the students of the subject understand , but which would be as Greek to the average lawyer or business man .

		By spending a few hours a week or a month on censor - ship , however , the trustees are to guaran - tee that all the teachings of all the experts are pure , 100 per cent pure !

		Obviously , the advocates of the trade-marked aca - demic article are amusing as well as
Prus	PERSON	- sian .

		They can silence the coward and transform the frightened professor into a master of ingenious evasiveness .

		Having done this , they may be as smug as they like .

		It is significant that this factory brand of learning , guaranteed pure , has been utterly rejected by the three leading jour - nals that appeal to the intellectual classes of America THE DIAL , `` The Nation , '' and `` The New Republic . ''

		The youth and the faith of
America	LOCATION	reject it .

		The
American Association of University	ORGANIZATION	Pro- fessors rejects it , demanding that proceed - ings against any professor should be `` in accord with the principle of faculty responsibility , '' and that the accused should have `` a fair trial on those charges before either the judicial committee of the faculty or a joint committee composed of an equal number of professors and trustees . ''

		One college president , among the first in the land , President
Lowell	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, has utterly rejected the childish philosophy of standardized learning .

		In fine and restrained language , revealing a clear vision and a firm grasp of the problem and its solution , President
Lowell	PERSON	, in his report of
December 12 , 1917	DATE	, enunciates the ideal which will command the hearty approval of the American people .

		It is to be re -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 337 gretted that his classic statement can not be reprinted here in full , but the two main points deserve repetition : The teaching by the professor in his class room on the subjects within the scope of his chair ought to be absolutely free .

		He must teach the truth as he has found it and sees it .

		This is the primary condition of academic freedom , and any violation of it endangers intellectual progress .

		On other questions and outside his class room the professor speaks as a citizen .

		Of the professor 's rights as a citizen Presi - dent
Lowell	PERSON	says : In spite , however , of the risk of injury to the institution , the objections to restraint upon what professors may say as citizens seem to me far greater than the harm done by leaving them free .

		In the first place , to impose upon the teacher in a university restrictions to which members of other professions ... are not subjected , would produce a sense of irritation and humiliation .

		In accepting a chair under such conditions a man would surrender a part of his liberty ; what he might say would be submitted to the censorship of a board of trustees , and he would cease to be a free citizen ... Such a policy would tend seriously to discourage some of the best men from taking up the scholar 's life .

		It is not a question of academic freedom , but of per - sonal liberty from constraint , yet it touches the dignity of the academic career ... If a university or college censors what its professors may say , if it restrains them from uttering something which it does not approve , it thereby assumes responsibility for that which it permits them to say .

		This is logical and inevitable , but it is a responsibility which an institution of learning would be unwise in assuming .

		There is no more to be said .

		A scholar and a gentleman , commanding the confi - dence of the best men and women in
America	LOCATION	, secure in his own position as an intellectual leader , secure in his social posi - tion , secure in the splendid traditions of his university , has spoken in language that can not be misunderstood .

		His report for
1917	DATE	will be the
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	to which universities in all times and in all countries may turn for guidance in sound principles .

		No nobler word has been spoken in the present crisis ; no greater promise of the future in
America	LOCATION	has been given .

		CHARLES A. BEARD .

		On Creating a Usable Past There is a kind of anarchy that fosters growth and there is another anarchy that prevents growth , because it lays too great a strain upon the individual and all our contemporary literature in
America	LOCATION	cries out of this latter kind of anarchy .

		Now , anarchy is never the sheer wantonness of mind that academic people so often think it ; it results from the sudden unbottling of elements that have had no opportunity to develop freely in the open ; it signifies , among other things , the lack of any sense of inherited resources .

		English and French writers , European writers in gen - eral , never quite separate themselves from the family tree that nourishes and sustains them and assures their growth .

		Would American writers have done so , plainly against their best interests , if they had had any choice in the matter ?

		I doubt it , and that is why it seems to me significant that our professors continue to pour out a stream of historical works repeating the same points of view to such an astonishing degree that they have placed a sort of Tal - mudic seal upon the American tradition .

		I suspect that the past experience of our people is not so much without elements that might be made to contribute to some common understanding in the present , as that the interpreters of that past experi - ence have put a gloss upon it which renders it sterile for the living mind .

		I am aware , of course , that we have had no cumulative culture , and that conse - quently the professors who guard the past and the writers who voice the present inevitably have less in common in this country than anywhere in the Old World .

		The professors of American literature can , after all , offer very little to the creators of it .

		But there is a vendetta between the two generations , and the older generation seems to delight in cutting off the supplies of the younger .

		What actuates the old guard in our criticism and their energetic following in the university world is appar - ently no sort of desire to fertilize the present , but rather to shame the present with the example of the past .

		There is in their note an almost pathological vin - dictiveness when they compare the `` poet - asters of today '' with certain
august	DATE	figures of the age of pioneering who have 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	long since fallen into oblivion in the minds of men and women of the world .

		Almost pathological , I say , their vindictiveness appears to be ; but why not actually so ?

		I think it is ; and therefore it seems to me important , as a preliminary step to the reinterpretation of our literature , that we should have the reinterpretation of our professors that now goes merrily forward .

		For the spiritual past has no objective reality ; it yields only what we are able to look for in it .

		And what people find in literature corresponds precisely with what they find in life .

		Now it is obvious that professors who accommodate themselves without effort to an academic world based like ours upon the exigencies of the com - mercial mind can not see anything in the past that conflicts with a commercial philosophy .

		Thanks to his training and environment and the typically non-creative habit of his mind , the American professor by instinct interprets his whole field of learning with reference to the ideal not of the creative , but of the practical life .

		He does this very often by default , but not less conclusively for that .

		The teach - ing of literature stimulates the creative faculty but it also and far more effectually thwarts it , so that the professor turns against himself .

		He passively plays into the hands that underfeed his own imagi - native life and permits the whole weight of his meticulous knowledge of the past to tip the beam against the living present .

		He gradually comes to fulfill himself in the vicarious world of the dead and returns to the actual world of struggling and mis - educated mortals in the majestic raiment of borrowed immortalities .

		And he pours out upon that world his own contempt for the starveling poet in himself .

		That is why the histories of our literature so often end with a deprecating gesture at about the
year 1890	DATE	, why they stumble and hesi - tate when they discuss Whitman , why they disparage almost everything that conies out of the contemporary mind .

		Now it is this that differentiates the accepted canon of American literature from those of the literatures of
Europe	LOCATION	, and invalidates it .

		The European pro- fessor is relatively free from these in - hibitions ; he views the past through the spectacles of his own intellectual freedom ; consequently the corpus of inherited experience which he lays before the prac - ticing author is not only infinitely richer and more inspiring than ours , but also more usable .

		The European writer , what - ever his personal education may be , has his racial past , in the first place , and then he has his racial past made available for him .

		The American writer , on the other hand , not only has the most meager of birthrights but is cheated out of that .

		For the professorial mind , as I have said , puts a gloss upon the past that renders it sterile for the living mind .

		Instead of reflecting the creative impulse in American history , it reaffirms the values established by the commercial tradition ; it crowns everything that has passed the censorship of the com - mercial and moralistic mind .

		And it ap - pears to be justified because , on the whole , only those American writers who have passed that censorship have undergone a reasonably complete development and in this way entered what is often considered the purview of literary criticism .

		What kind of literature it is that has passed that censorship and `` succeeded '' in this bustling commercial democracy of ours , we all know very well .

		It has been chiefly a literature of exploitation , the counterpart of our American life .

		From Irving and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Cooper	PERSON	and
Bryant	PERSON	, who exploited the legendary and scenic environment of our grandfathers , through the local colorists , who dominated our fiction during the intermediate age and to whom the American people accounted for artistic righteousness their own pro- vincial quaintnesses , down to such living authors , congenial to the academic mind , as
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	, who exploits one after another the `` problems '' of modern society , the literature that has been al - lowed to live in this country , that has been imaginatively nourished , has been not only a literature acceptable to the mind that is bent upon turning the tangible world to account but a literature produced by a cognate process .

		Emerson ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, Whitman there you have the exceptions , the successful exceptions ; but they have survived not because of what they still offer us , but because they were hybrids , with enough pioneer instinct to pay their way among their contemporaries .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 339 There is nothing to resent in this ; it has been a plain matter of historic destiny .

		And historically predestined also is the professorial mind of today .

		But so is the revolt of the younger generation against the professorial mind .

		Aside from any personal considerations , we have the clear - est sort of evidence that exploitation is alien to the true method of literature , if only because it produces the most lament - able effect on the exploiter .

		Look at the local colorists !

		They have all come to a bad end , artistically speaking .

		Is it neces - sary to recall the later work of
Bret Harte	PERSON	after he had squeezed the orange of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia ?

		Or the lachrymosity of Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's ghost revisiting the
Kentucky	LOCATION	apple tree from which he shook down all the fruit a generation ago ?

		That is the sort of spectacle you have to accept complacently if you take the word of the professors that the American tradition in literature is sound and true ; and the pub - lic in general does accept it complacently , because it is not averse to lachrymosity and cares nothing about the ethics of personal growth .

		But the conscientious writer turns aside in disgust .

		Seeing nothing in the past but an oblivion of all things that have meaning to the creative mood , he decides to paddle his own course , even if it leads to shipwreck .

		Unhappily , the spiritual welfare of this country depends altogether upon the fate of its creative minds .

		If they can not grow and ripen , where are we going to get the new ideals , the finer attitudes , that we must get if we are ever to emerge from our existing travesty of a civilization ?

		From this point of view our contemporary literature could hardly be in a graver state .

		We want bold ideas , and we have nuances .

		We want courage , and we have universal fear .

		We want individuality , and we have idiosyncrasy .

		We want vital - ity , and we have intellectualism .

		We want emblems of desire , and we have Niagaras of emotionality .

		We want expansion of soul , and we have an elephantiasis of the vocal organs .

		Why ?

		Because we have no cultural economy , no abiding sense of spiritual values , no body of critical under - standing ?

		Of course ; that is the burden of all our criticism .

		But these conditions result largely , I think , from another condi - tion that is , in part at least , remediable .

		The present is a void , and the American writer floats in that void because the past that survives in the common mind of the present is a past without living value .

		But is this the only possible past ?

		If we need another past so badly , is it inconceivable that we might discover one , that we might even invent one ?

		Discover , invent a usable past we cer - tainly can , and that is what a vital criticism always does .

		The past that
Carlyle	PERSON	put together for
England	LOCATION	would never have existed if
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	had been an American professor .

		And what about the past that
Michelet	PERSON	, groping about in the depths of his own temperament , picked out for the
France	LOCATION	of his generation ?

		We have had our historians , too , and they have held over the dark backward of time the divin - ing-rods of their imagination and conjured out of it what they wanted and what their contemporaries wanted
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's great epic of the self-made man , for instance , which he called `` The Rise of the Dutch Republic . ''

		The past is an inexhaustible storehouse of apt attitudes and adaptable ideals ; it opens of itself at the touch of desire ; it yields up , now this treasure , now that , to anyone who comes to it armed with a capacity for personal choices .

		If , then , we can not use the past our professors offer us , is there any reason why we should not create others of our own ?

		The grey con - ventional mind casts its shadow backward .

		But why should not the creative mind dispel that shadow with shafts of light ?

		So far as our literature is concerned , the slightest acquaintance with other na - tional points of view than our own is enough to show how many conceptions of it are not only possible but already exist as commonplaces in the mind of the world .

		Every people selects from the experience of every other people whatever con - tributes most vitally to its own develop - ment .

		The history of
France	LOCATION	that survives in the mind of
Italy	LOCATION	is totally different from the history of
France	LOCATION	that survives in the mind of
England	LOCATION	, and from this point of view there are just as many his - tories of
America	LOCATION	as there are nations to possess them .

		Go to
England	LOCATION	and you will discover that in English eyes `` Amer - ican literature '' has become , while quite as 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	complete an entity as it is with us , an altogether different one .

		You > will find that an entire scheme of ideas and tenden - cies has survived there out of the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can past to which the American academic point of view is wholly irrelevant .

		This , I say , is a commonplace to anyone whose mind has wandered even the shortest way from home , and to travel in one 's imagina - tion from country to country , from decade to decade , is to have this experience indefi - nitely multiplied .

		Englishmen will ask you why we Americans have so neglected Her - man
Melville	LOCATION	that there is no biography of him .

		Russians will tell you that we never really understood the temperament of
Jack London	PERSON	.

		And so on and so on , through all the ramifications of national psychology .

		By which I do not mean at all that we ought to cut our cloth to fit other people .

		I mean simply that we have every precedent for cutting it to fit our - selves .

		Presumably the orthodox inter - preters of our literature imagine that they speak for the common reason of human - kind .

		But evidently as regards modern literature that common reason is a very subtle and precarious thing , by no means in the possession of minds that consider it a moral duty to impose upon the world notions that have long since lost their sap .

		The world is far too rich to tolerate this .

		When
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	once objected to Sainte-Beuve that he did not consider Lamartine an important writer ,
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve replied , `` Perhaps not , but he is im - portant for us . ''

		Only by the exercise of a little pragmatism of that kind , I think , can the past experience of our people be placed at the service of the future .

		What is important for us ?

		What , out of all the multifarious achievements and impulses and desires of the American lit - erary mind , ought we to elect to remem - ber ?

		The more personally we answer this question , it seems to me , the more likely we are to get a vital order out of the anarchy of the present .

		For the imper - sonal way of answering it has been at least in part responsible for this anarchy , by severing the warm artery that ought to lead from the present back into the past .

		To approach our literature from the point of view not of the successful fact but of the creative impulse , is to throw it into an entirely new focus .

		What emerges then is the desire , the aspiration , the strug - gle , the tentative endeavor , and the appall - ing obstacles our life has placed before them .

		Which immediately casts over the spiritual history of
America	LOCATION	a significance that , for us , it has never had before .

		Now it ^ is impossible to make this ap - proach without having some poignant experience of the shortcomings , the needs , and the difficulties of our literary life as it is now conditioned .

		Its anarchy is merely a compound of these , all of which are to be explained not so much by the absence of a cultural past as by the pres - ence of a practical one .

		In particular , as I have said , this anarchy results from the sudden unbottling of elements that have had no opportunity to develop freely in the open .

		Why not trace those elements back , analyzing them on the way , and showing how they first manifested them - selves , and why , and what repelled them ?

		How many of
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	's defects , for example , are due to an environment that failed to produce the naturalistic mind until the rest of the world had outgrown it and given birth to a more advanced set of needs ?

		And there is Vachel Lindsay .

		If he runs to sound and color in excess and for their sake voids himself within , how much is that because the life of a Middle Western town sets upon those things an altogether scandalous premium ?

		Well , there you have two of the notorious diffi - culties of contemporary authorship ; and for all that our successful tradition may say , difficulties like those have been the death of our creative life in the past .

		The point for us is that they have never pre - vented the creative impulse from being born .

		Look back and you will see , drift - ing in and out of the books of history , appearing and vanishing in the memoirs of more aggressive and more acceptable minds , all manner of queer geniuses , wraith-like personalities that have left be - hind them sometimes a fragment or so that has meaning for us now , more often a mere eccentric name .

		The creative past of this country is a limbo of the non-elect , the fathers and grandfathers of the talent of today .

		If they had had a little of the sun and rain that fell so abundantly upon the Goliaths of nineteenth-century philis -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 341 tinism , how much better conditioned would their descendants be !

		The real task for the American literary historian , then , is not to seek for master - pieces the few masterpieces are all too obvious but for tendencies .

		Why did
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	go wrong ?

		Why did Ste - phen Crane fail to acclimatize the modern method in American fiction twenty years ago ?

		What became of
Herman Melville	PERSON	?

		How did it happen that a mind capable of writing `` The Story of a Country Town '' should have turned up
thirty years later	DATE	with a book like `` Success Easier Than Failure '' ?

		If we were able to answer the hundred and one questions of this sort that present themselves to every curious mind , we might throw an entirely new face not only over the past but over the present and the future also .

		Knowing that others have desired the things we de - sire and have encountered the same ob - stacles , and that in some degree time has begun to face those obstacles down and make the way straight for us , would not the creative forces of this country lose a little of the hectic individualism that keeps them from uniting against their common enemies ?

		And would this not bring about , for the first time , that sense of brother - hood in effort and in aspiration which is the best promise of a national culture ?

		VAN WYCK BROOKS .

		The Creative and
Efficiency Concepts of Education Since Germany	ORGANIZATION	has evolved the best known methods of attaining industrial effi - ciency , and since the German schools have played a leading part in that attainment , our own business men often argue that for patriotic reasons the German system of industrial education should be given a trial in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		If the system were introduced here it is , of course , not certain that it would be effective ; we can by no means be sure that it would produce wage earners readier for service , more single purposed in their industrial activity than they now are .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	it was a comparatively simple matter for the schools to prepare the children for effec - tive and efficient service .

		For when the modern system of industry , with its own characteristic enslavement , was imposed ready-made upon the German people their psychology was still a feudal psychology .

		Unlike the Anglo-Saxon , the German has not experienced the liberating effects of the political philosophy which developed along with modern technology in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		First , then , it is not certain that the system of German industrial education , if introduced into this country , would suc - ceed .

		Second , if it did succeed , is it the sort of education that
America	LOCATION	wants ?

		Let us see .

		As a requisite of efficiency ,
Germany	LOCATION	classified its people ; gave them a definite place in the scheme of things and rigidly held them there .

		By circumscribing the experiences of individuals and by produc - ing specialists , the scheme both increased production and aided the dynastic pur - poses of the Empire .

		This classification and training of the people was naturally the work of the schools .

		The sorting begins in the elementary schools at the early age of ten .

		The child 's social posi - tion is determined at that time .

		It is decided then whether the child shall enter the great army of wage earners or whether he shall be trained for one of the several vocations higher than that of the common laborer .

		This tolling off of children at the age of ten - the assigning of them to a place for life in the social scheme is not American in spirit or purpose .

		To be sure , our habit of letting children escape into life with their places undetermined has made difficulties for our promoters of industry .

		These difficulties in
Germany	LOCATION	were avoided in exact proportion to the elimination of the workers ' chances of escape from their predestined position .

		Avenues of escape from jobs because they are uncongenial are effectively denied , and apparently to the German they are ac - ceptably denied .

		The German has no pressing sense of the need to experiment with life .

		Compulsory attendance at a continuation trade school is required of all German children between the ages of four - 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	teen and eighteen years .

		It is this final moulding of each young person to fit a specific trade , which protects the German manufacturer and the national industrial efficiency as a whole against such vagaries as individual preference for this or that job .

		It is true that in no country do modern conditions of industry offer gen - erous opportunity for individual prefer - ence .

		Yet when people 's desire to choose for themselves is inhibited by such a scheme of national organization as ob - tains in
Germany	LOCATION	, their enslavement is assured .

		Before the war the movement in Amer - ica for industrial education , based on the German idea , was faltering in its progress because the German idea was essentially at variance with our national concepts and political institutions .

		Moreover , our pro- moters of the scheme were suspended be - tween conflicting interests : industry , as it is actually administered , stultifies individ - ual development , while the development of children necessitates some linking-up of the school with the world of work .

		The result is that as the system has been intro - duced in
America	LOCATION	it neither prostitutes the schools in the interest of industry , nor does it give the children the power through experience to meet the real prob - lems of industry .

		In our industrial schools there is an elaboration of technology ; there is , as well , its application to the general principles of physical science , in - dustrial and political history , even to the aesthetics of industry .

		But all of these attempts have emphasized the absence of the really significant factors .

		These factors are those which give men the ability to control industry .

		After all , no work in the subject matter of industry is educational which does not in intention or in fact give the persons involved the ability to participate in the administration of industry .

		Even the best of schemes for industrial education have so far left the pupils helpless before their subject .

		As they furnish them with a certain dexterity and acquaintance with the processes and a supply of subject matter necessarily more or less isolated , the pupils gain more the sense of the power of the subject to control them , than an experience in their power to master the subject .

		It is often suggested that .

		civilization demands the elimination of machinery and the division of labor .

		In a spirit of weari - ness we are sometimes told that we must retrace our steps and go back to crafts - manship and guilds .

		But it is idle to talk about going back or eliminating institu - tionalized features of society .

		We can - not go back , we have not the ability to discard this or that part of our environ - ment except as we make it over .

		This making over might be vitalized by methods which belonged to earlier periods .

		But neither the methods nor the periods , we can safely say , will live again .

		Neither our own nor future generations will escape the influence of modern technology .

		It will play its part .

		It may be a part which will lead away from some of the destruc - tive influences which developed in the era of craftsmanship and which dominate the present era .

		In machine production and in the divi - sion of labor there are emotional and intellectual possibilities which were non - existent in the earlier and simpler methods of production .

		As the power latent in inorganic matter has been freed and applied to common needs , an environment has been evolved , filled with situations incomparably more dramatic and signifi - cant than the provincial affairs of detached peoples and communities .

		But technolog - ical subject matter , rich in opportunities for associated adventure and discovery , is not a part of common experience .

		But isolated as it is , it exists , and if released for common experimentation , it is fit mat - ter for making science a vital experience in everyday life .

		And since capital and , up to the present time , labor has failed to make industry an expansive ex - perience , it becomes the business of edu - cators , concerned with the growth of individuals , to cultivate the field .

		If educators regard such opportunities for growth with sufficient jealousy , they will not wait for industry to emerge with a new programme , or with a new system of production .

		They will of themselves ini - tiate productive enterprises wherein young people will be free to gain first-hand ex - perience in the problems of industry , as
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 those problems stand in relation to their own time and generation .

		The alliance of educators should be made with engin - eers and architects and those managers of industry who , through experience and training , have made themselves the mas - ters of applied science and of the economics of production .

		Engineers , not under the influence of business , are qualified to open up the creative aspects of production to the workers and convince them through their own experience that there are adven - turous possibilities in industry outside the meagre offerings of pay-day .

		Mr.
Robert Wolf	PERSON	is one of the engineers who is ready for the venture .

		He told the members of the
Taylor Society	ORGANIZATION	that `` scientific man - agers have not been scientific enough in dealing with this very important subject of stimulating the thinking and reasoning power of the workman , thereby making him self-reliant and creative . ''

		In describ - ing the field in which practical engineers should operate he laid stress on their giving large space to the originating , choosing , adapting power in men and the direction of it into positive constructive channels to men 's self-consciousness of their place in the great scheme of things .

		This conception of the field of opera - tion for engineers also describes the field for educators .

		In the present industrial arrangement the latter have failed to seize the chance for the development of `` the originating , choosing power '' in the work - ingman because they have been obsessed by the business appreciation of the work - ingman 's power of adaptation .

		It is because they labor under this obsession that they turn industrial education into industrial training whenever they include industry in their curricula .

		Educators know that there is adventure in industry , but they believe that the adventure is the rare property of a few .

		They believe this so finally that they surrender this great field of experience , with its priceless educational content , without reserving the right of such experience even for youth .

		They know , as we all do , that industrial problems carry those who participate in their solution into pure and applied sci - ence , into the study of the market for raw materials and finished products , into the search for unconquered wealth .

		They know that the marketing of goods is an extensive experience in the world of men and desires .

		They are not alone in their lack of courage in admitting that to limit this experience perverts normal desires and creates false ones .

		For the sake of education it is to be hoped that such en - gineers as Mr.
Wolf	PERSON	may overcome the timidity of educators , and that in conjunc - tion with men capable of productive enter - prise they will undertake to give young people , not an experience which is tagged on to industry under the influence of profits , but an experience which is inspired by the desire to produce and the oppor - tunity to develop the inspiration .

		America is , of course , `` different '' from
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Yet so is our position in the world different from what it was .

		Our position is not now , nor could it be , pre - cisely the German position .

		Our past is different , and that alone , if nothing else , will continuously have its effect on our future .

		But we are facing a great period of change , and the strongest forces in the country are the industrial forces , and the strongest leaders are the financial leaders .

		What the financiers and the industrial managers most want is efficient , docile labor .

		The German system of education , in spite of the fact that we are `` different , '' might conceivably have that effect on the youth of the country .

		Under the pressure of industrial rivalry after the war , under the pressure of an imperial industrial policy , it might be that the people of the country would yield to the introduction of a scheme of education which had been proven elsewhere could better than any other known scheme fit children into a system of mass production .

		It is clear that industry could set up models of behavior more successfully in the name of education than in its own , and to the extent American children come up to these models the more employable they would be from the standpoint of business .

		If the pressure is sufficiently strong , the people may yield to the introduction of a system of compulsory continuation schools similar to those of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If they do , I believe they will eventually fail .

		But there is danger and loss of purpose in their introduction .

		The problem for American educators is the retention of our native 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	concept of experimental life and the at - tainment of standards of workmanship the realization of the strength of asso - ciated effort , together with the advance of wealth production .

		In conjunction with educators it is the business of engineers , architects , and others who know the releasing power of creative effort to make it clear to the people of the country that our industrial structure is built on a predatory concept instead of a creative one .

		They need to make clear that as capture is rewarded rather than work , as the possessive desire is stimulated and the productive impulse sacrificed , as employers of men and own - ers of machinery do not engage in produc - tion because of any interest in the process or the product , as wage earners hire out for the day 's work and continue in their trade without interest in its development because , like their employers , they want the highest cash return wealth exploita - tion has come to be synonymous in the minds of men with wealth creation .

		A creative concept which can survive and inhibit the predatory concept must rest upon a people 's desire for productive experience , and their ability to associate together for that common end .

HELEN HOYT	PERSON	.

		Our
Paris	LOCATION	Letter `` This book is an act of faith in and love for that Greek and Latin tradition , all wisdom and beauty , outside of which there is but error and confusion . ''

		This epitome of the creed of Ana - tole
France	LOCATION	is quoted from his few lines of preface to `` Le Genie Latin , '' of which a `` new edition revised by the author '' -LRB- Calmann-Levy ,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- lies before me .

		The whole work of
Anatole France	LOCATION	his whole outlook on life is inspired by that tradition ; no faith has been more operant than his .

		He is lineally descended from the great French classics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , through them from
Rabe	PERSON	- lais , and ultimately from the Greek and Latin founders of European civilization .

		`` The
France	LOCATION	of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	and of Voltaire that is the great , the true ,
France	LOCATION	, '' I heard him say in a speech at
London	LOCATION	in
1913	DATE	: to that
France	LOCATION	he himself belongs .

		There is a reaction at present against a classical education ; it has some justification .

		Most of us wasted our time at school on Latin and Greek , since we spent several years in their almost exclusive study and learned neither of them .

		Few men when they leave school , or even when they leave the university , can read with ease or pleasure
Horace	PERSON	or
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	, Homer or Sophocles in the originals , or have the least desire ever to open a Greek or Latin book again .

		The result of a classical education in most cases is a hearty dislike for the classics .

		But I can not admit that a kno.wledge of Greek and Latin civilization and culture is useless ; a knowledge of the sources of our civilization can not but be useful .

		The fault of a classical education is that as a rule it does not give that knowledge .

		We can not return to Greek or Latin civilization and we do not want to , but they are part of our heritage and , even if it may not be necessary to read Greek and Latin authors in their own tongues although it is always an advantage to read an author in the original they should re - main an integral part of our instruction .

		As
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	says in the remaining lines of the preface just quoted , `` we owe everything philosophy , art , science , jurisprudence to
Greece	LOCATION	and to her conquerors whom she conquered .

		The ancients , yet living , teach us still . ''

		They have , indeed , still much to teach us .

		The modern world is the result of a return to the Greek tradition after its normal development had been arrested by a reaction which kept back human
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 progress for centuries .

		Unfortunately , thanks to
Martin Luther	PERSON	, the Renaissance itself was arrested by another reaction and I doubt whether , in all respects , we have yet covered the lost ground or quite caught up with the Greeks .

		We need not , therefore , be too proud to learn from them .

		It is not my experience that a real knowl - edge of the classics makes men reactionary or even conservative .

		Is not
Anatole France	LOCATION	him - self a Socialist and , at the age of seventy-three , in the vanguard of contemporary thought ?

		One might , indeed , say that the two permanent cur - rents in human thought are represented by the Greek tradition on the one hand and the Catholic or medieval on the other .

		To review at length `` Le Genie Latin '' would be superfluous .

		Readers of
Anatole France	LOCATION	know it already and are aware that it is among the slighter of his works .

		I have not made a detailed comparison of the revised with the original edi - tion , but I can see that the revision has been thorough ; there are many changes , and the result is a perfected work .

		The short essay of ten pages on `` Daphnis and Chloe , '' with which the book begins , is a fine piece of criticism which exposes the artistic skill of the unknown author of that ancient love story .

		The other essays of which the book is composed are for the most part biographical ; the exceptions are the interest - ing discussion of La
Fontaine	PERSON	's vocabulary and the appreciations of Benjamin Constant 's `` Adolphe '' and of Sainte-Beuve 's poetry , the lat - ter particularly important .

		But the biographies contain incidental passages of searching criticism and characteristic flashes of inimitable irony .

		`` Beware of those that are hard on themselves , '' says the author in the essay on
Paul Scarron	PERSON	, `` they will illtreat you by mistake . ''

		The essays on Scarron and on the Abbe
Prevost	PERSON	are per - haps among the most interesting , partly because the subjects are eminently suited to
Anatole France	LOCATION	, partly because we know less about
Scarron	PERSON	and
Prevost	PERSON	than about
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Racine	LOCATION	,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	, and some of the others whom the author has chosen as subjects .

		Few men have had so extraordinary a career as the Benedictine author of ``
Manon Lescaut	PERSON	, '' a prolific writer with a dangerous facility , who produced his one masterpiece by accident , throwing it off in a few weeks as a supplement to his plethoric and rambling `` Memoires d'un Homme de Qualite . ''

		To its author ``
Manon Lescaut	PERSON	'' was a trifle , and it has made him immortal .

		Of all the essays in `` Le Genie Latin , '' however , that on Bernardin de Saint-Pierre seems to me the most character - istic and the most entirely successful ; it is an appreciation of remarkable justice and critical insight .

		One need not at this time of day praise the style of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, which makes what he writes a pleasure to read for the sheer beauty of the language .

		French prose at its best has no equal , and he writes French prose at its best .

		The sumptuous limited edition of the story of
Hassan Badreddine	PERSON	, illustrated by
M. Kees van Dongen	PERSON	-LRB-
Les Editions de la Sirene	ORGANIZATION	, 12 bis rue La Boetie ,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- , is beyond the reach of many purses , for the lowest price at which it can be obtained is
$ 100	MONEY	.

		M. van
Dongen	ORGANIZATION	's drawings are distinguished by a firm line and remarkable decorative design ; they are , moreover , inspired by the spirit of the `` Thousand and One Nights '' and their Oriental flavor is natural and sincere .

		M. van
Dongen	PERSON	has also designed the book itself , so that there is a harmony between the drawings and the printed page which pro- duces an artistic whole .

		The artist has evidently found a means of expression peculiarly suited to his very personal talent and he should continue on this path .

		The text of the story is that of Dr.
J. C. Mardrus	PERSON	's French translation of the `` Thousand and One Nights , '' the best in the language .

		The book is beautifully printed in a fine font of type by Lahure , and the reproduc - tions are unusually successful , especially those in color .

		The hundred pages of black and white drawings are printed from blocks by
Demoulin Freres	ORGANIZATION	, and
M. J. Saude	PERSON	is responsible for the seven reproductions of water colors .

		The new monthly publication called `` Les Cahiers Britanniques et Americains '' -LRB-
Georges	PERSON	-
Bazille	LOCATION	, 16 rue Taitbout ,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- is an attempt to familiarize the French public with English and American authors which deserves success .

		The third number , just published , is an excellent translation by
M. Georges-Bazille	PERSON	of Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	's essay on American humor .

		Each number costs 1 fr .

		50 and it is not pos - sible of course to present the translation of a long book for that price , especially in war time ; but the object of the `` Cahiers '' is to introduce the public to short stories , essays , and so on that have not yet been translated into French .

		Bolo has been convicted and condemned to death in order , as the public prosecutor said at the beginning of his speech at the trial , to `` give satisfaction to public opinion '' ; but most lawyers are not satisfied with the evidence of treason .

		There can be no doubt that he obtained money 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1 1	DATE	from the German Government , but he used about half of it to finance `` jusqu'auboutiste '' propaganda and put the rest in his own pocket .

		He gave money to the committee for annexing the left bank of the Rhine , but not a sou did he ever give to `` pacifist '' or `` defaitiste '' propaganda .

		All the witnesses for the prosecution , with one shady exception , said that they had never heard from Bolo any but the most patriotic sentiments , and there was not the smallest evidence of any connection on his part with any but ultra - patriotic movements .

		Unless it is treasonable to advocate the annexation of the left bank of the Rhine and war to the bitter end , it is difficult to see where the treason comes in .

		It is clear that Bolo , being in need of money , jumped at the chance of getting it which was afforded by
M. Charles Humbert	PERSON	's desire to find
$ 1,100,000	MONEY	for the `` Journal . ''

		He got more than double that sum from
Germany	LOCATION	on the pretext of influencing the press , and did not use quite half of the total in financing newspapers .

		The case is one of com - mon swindling .

		M.
Charles Humbert	PERSON	has been arrested , also perhaps in order to satisfy public opinion .

		Neither the Bolo trial nor that of cer - tain wealthy capitalists accused of selling to Ger - many a chemical used in the manufacture of explosives increases one 's confidence in trial by court-martial .

		The accused in the latter case were acquitted in the teeth of the evidence , and the public prosecutor almost asked for their ac - quittal .

		The hunt for traitors continues and new `` affairs '' crop up every week .

		Last week we had a sensational story of the discovery of a `` nest of spies '' at
St. Etienne	LOCATION	, the great industrial centre which
M. Briand	PERSON	represents in the Chamber .

		The chief conspirator was a German officer who , by some mysterious means , had obtained a permit de sejour and was running a cafe at
St. Etienne	LOCATION	; a cipher correspondence was seized and there seemed to be all the material of a first-rate spy novel .

		Alas !

		the German officer has turned out to be a French citizen of Alsatian descent and the cipher correspondence relates to the `` White Slave '' traffic and to the smuggling of absinthe , which are the chief occupations of the persons arrested .

		The press has hastily dropped the matter and the
St. Etienne	LOCATION	newspapers are mak - ing rude remarks about
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	.

		Much more serious is the organized campaign to discredit French public men and , with them , the Republic itself .

		After the
Caillaux	PERSON	affair we have now the Painleve and
Viviani	PERSON	affairs and , if their authors succeed in their object ,
M. Ribot	PERSON	and
M. Briand	PERSON	will be the next victims .


M. Viviani	PERSON	is violently attacked by the Royalist paper , the `` Action Frangaise , '' because during the
last week of July , 1914	DATE	he very properly kept the French troops at a distance of some six and a quarter miles from the frontier to prevent any risk of frontier incidents .

		The `` Action Frangaise '' asserts that the measure was taken at the suggestion of a German Socialist , who arrived in
Paris	LOCATION	on
August 1	DATE	to confer with the French Socialists ; whereas I myself was informed of it at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	on
July 30 , 1914	DATE	and on that day
M. Viviani	PERSON	mentioned it in a despatch to the French Ambassador at
London	LOCATION	-LRB- See No. 106 in the French Yellow Book ,
1914	DATE	-RRB- .

		The attack on
M. Viviani	PERSON	is grotesque , but so deplorable a state of mind has been created by the treason hunt that people are ready to suspect anybody and to scent traitors everywhere .

		There are two accusations against M. Pain - leve .

		One of them that he tried to hush up the Bolo affair he easily disposed of in a short and dignified speech in the Chamber on Feb - ruary 2 .

		He was loudly applauded by the whole of the Left , especially when he said that there was an organized conspiracy to discredit the Republic by discrediting every successive Prime Minister since the war , `` except the last . ''

		He might have added that the very people who now attack him wanted to hush up the Bolo affair because Bolo was on their side in politics and discovered that it was a `` vast plot '' only when they discovered that Bolo knew
M. Caillaux	PERSON	.

		The other and much more serious charge against
M. Painleve	PERSON	is that he stopped the French offensive
last April	DATE	just when it was going to be a success .

		This story , embellished with a wealth of fictitious details , has reached the American public through the medium of a popular weekly .

		It is quite untrue , and it is of course equally untrue that there was ever the slightest chance that `` the war might have ended with an Allied military victory before
Christmas	DATE	Day '' why not before
May 1	DATE	, since it appears that `` the end of the German invasion in
France	LOCATION	seemed at hand '' ?

		I am sure that the writer of the article in which these absurd statements occurred can not have realized what harm such assertions might do to Franco-American relations by leading the American public to believe that the French Gov - ernment had prevented an Allied victory .

		The internal evidence of the article itself should make
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 it quite clear by whom the writer was inspired , and the American public is certainly intelligent enough to understand that generals who have been removed for incompetence and for uselessly sacrificing French lives by their blunders nat - urally bear a grudge against the Minister who had the courage to do his duty by removing them .

		It is a great pity that
France	LOCATION	had not at the beginning pf the war a Minister of War with the courage to act after the disasters of
Charleroi	LOCATION	and
Morhange	PERSON	as
M. Painleve	PERSON	acted after the disastrous offensive of
last April	DATE	.

		Nothing is more convenient than to put the blame for one 's own mistakes on to other people and generals find it convenient to put the blame on the `` poli - ticians '' when things go wrong .

		It should be understood in
America	LOCATION	once and for all that the responsibility for the strategical and tactical blunders which have cost the Allies so dear lies entirely with the military authorities .

		If the politicians have erred it has been in giving the military too free a hand .


Paris	LOCATION	has been deluged with copies of the American magazine containing this grossly unjust attack on
M. Painleve	PERSON	and French readers of the article in question have been painfully sur - prised at the callous way in which the writer of it speaks of French losses .

		It appears to be to him a light matter whether a few thousand Frenchmen more or less are sacrificed .

		Perhaps if he himself were at the front , or even if the
United States	LOCATION	had had about 1,700,000 men killed in the war , he would think differently .

		Over here we do not like people who are bellicose in arm-chairs and risk other people 's lives with a light heart ; there are still a good many such people in
France	LOCATION	and they are very unpopular , especially at the front .

		I arn sure that the writer of the article in question does not represent American opinion , but such articles are neverthe - less extremely mischievous .

		They unwittingly help to undo the good that is being done by President
Wilson	PERSON	's policy .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is now extremely popular in
France	LOCATION	.

		His last speech to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was hailed as a welcome contrast to the Note of the Ver - sailles
Council	ORGANIZATION	, which was very badly received by the mass of the French people .

		The `` Pays '' described the
Versailles	LOCATION	Note as `` a fresh declara - tion of war '' and that was the prevailing opinion about it .

		It is not a fresh declaration of war that the French or any other people in
Europe	LOCATION	wants just now .

		It is not too much to say that the French people pins its hope of peace to a great extent on President
Wilson	PERSON	and was immensely relieved to learn that he had no Responsibility for the
Versailles	LOCATION	Note .

		In fact , the American Ambassador did not attend any of the Varsailles meetings ; a secretary of the
Embassy	ORGANIZATION	was present at them , or some of them , but only as an observer ; he did not take part in the discussions or deci - sions .

		The decision of the
Inter-Allied Socialist Conference	ORGANIZATION	held in
London	LOCATION
last week	DATE	to send a delegation to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	shows what confidence is felt in him by the mass of the people in all the Allied countries .

		The delegation will also prob - ably visit Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	and enlighten him in regard to the European situation .

		-LSB- Since Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's letter was received , this delegation has been appointed .

		Ed . -RSB-

		Astonishment was caused by a report in the press that he had tele - graphed to Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	that the
Inter-Allied Conference	ORGANIZATION	was inspired by German influences .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has explained that the report was false and that the telegram received by him contained no such statement , but it has since been reported that Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	has declared that peace can not be made until
France	LOCATION	and Bel - gium have been evacuated by the Germans .

		Everybody here is , of course , agreed that com - plete evacuation is an essential condition of peace , but that is quite a different matter .

		Nobody now imagines that complete evacuation will precede peace negotiations .

		A few jingo papers may applaud such utterances as that attributed to Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	, but they make a very bad impression on the general public in
France	LOCATION	.

		May I , without giving offense , beg Americans to be careful what they say about such matters ?

		They need not be more exacting than the French people .

		I am neither an American nor a French - man , but I have been deeply attached all my life both to
France	LOCATION	and to
America	LOCATION	and I believe that it is through
France	LOCATION	that
America	LOCATION	can most easily get into touch with
Europe	LOCATION	.

		That is why I venture to make this suggestion .

		The Wash - ington correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' recently said that it was the growing opinion in
America	LOCATION	that it would not be to the `` interest '' of the
United States	LOCATION	that the war should end soon .

		The effect over here of such statements as that is deplorable .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	knows how to appeal to the French people and , indeed , to all the belligerent peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	; questions of war aims and peace conditions had much better be left to him .

		The unanimity of the
Inter-Allied Socialist Conference	ORGANIZATION	at
London	LOCATION	is a great step in advance 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1 1	DATE	if , as there is good reason to hope , it proves to be real and not merely verbal .

		The Socialist party in every belligerent country has hitherto been paralyzed by internal dissension , but now the Socialists of all the Allied countries in
Europe	LOCATION	have unanimously declared in favor of an inter - national conference .

		The delegates from the British Labor party who came to
Paris	LOCATION	just be - fore the
London	LOCATION	conference are in great measure responsible for this happy result , particularly Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	and Mr.
Ramsay MacDonald	PERSON	, as is also
M. Camille Huysmans	PERSON	, the able secretary of the
Socialist International Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, who accom - panied them .

		-LSB-
M. Huysmans	PERSON	is the head of the delegation to
America	LOCATION	.

		Ed . -RSB-

		They appealed to the French Socialists to sink their differences in order to get an international conference , and the appeal was heard .

		The memorandum on peace conditions , like all compromises , is not always very clear .

		For instance , the paragraph relating to
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	contains some superfluous verbiage introduced to satisfy those that had pre - viously objected to a consultation of the inhabit - ants , but its practical conclusion is in favor of leaving the future of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	to be decided by the inhabitants , which is the only just and reasonable course .

		There was some difficulty in obtaining agreement on this point at the
National Council	ORGANIZATION	of the French Socialist party , which preceded the
London	LOCATION	conference , but it was obtained at last .

		On questions of internal policy the French Socialist party is still sharply divided ; one of the burning questions is whether the Socialist deputies shall continue to vote the war credits .

		At the
National Council	ORGANIZATION	the delegates were just about equally divided on this point ; one vote gave
1476	DATE	mandates for refusing war credits at once and
1461	DATE	for continuing to vote them at present .

		Ultimately the
Council	ORGANIZATION	decided by
1548	DATE	man - dates against
1415	DATE	to vote them for the present , but to reconsider the matter if the
Government	ORGANIZATION	refused passports for an international conference .

		At present
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	is believed to be opposed to giving passports , but the British Gov - ernment is prepared to give them and so , I understand , is the Italian .

		M. Clemenceau at first refused permission to the delegates of the Italian official Socialist party to cross
France	LOCATION	in order to attend the
London	LOCATION	conference , although they had been given passports by their own government ; but in consequence of a vigorous and unanimous protest by the French Socialists , backed by the British and Belgian delegates , he gave way and the Italian delegates went to
London	LOCATION	.

		Nobody here blinks the fact that the military situation is very grave and that we are at the most critical and the darkest moment of the war .

		-LSB- Written , of course , before the present German offensive .

		Ed . -RSB-

		The German triumph in Rus - sia is a melancholy confirmation of
M. Marcel Sembat	PERSON	's warning about the policy of refusing to `` recognize '' the Maximalist government .

		Allied diplomacy in regard to
Russia	LOCATION	has , un - fortunately , been deplorably inefficient and it has a large share of the responsibility for the present disastrous state of affairs in that coun - try .

		It was the bourgeois parties of the
Ukraine	LOCATION	who by making a separate peace betrayed
Russia	LOCATION	and forced the Maximalists to yield to
Germany	LOCATION	; those parties were actually subsidized by the French government , which sent a military mis - sion to the
Ukraine	LOCATION	just before the separate peace was made .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	and
M. Pichon	PERSON	were warned by everybody that knew
Russia	LOCATION	that they were making a mistake ; but although
M. Pichon	PERSON	was ready to listen to advice ,
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was not .

		In particular ,
M. Maklakoff	PERSON	, the Russian Ambassador at
Paris	LOCATION	appointed by
M. Milyoukoff	ORGANIZATION	and confirmed by
M. Kerensky	PERSON	, implored
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	to recog - nize the Maximalist government and warned him against trusting to the Ukranians .


M. Maklakoff	PERSON	is a `` Cadet '' of the Right wing , who has not the least sympathy with the opinions or policy of
M. Lenine	PERSON	and
M. Trotzky	PERSON	, but he be - lieved that it was to the interest both of
Russia	LOCATION	and of the Allies to recognize facts and that nothing but harm could be done by refusing to get into touch with the men that had the power in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- There is a movement now on foot in
France	LOCATION	to recognize the Soviets ' government .

		Seemingly , even
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	now supports it .

		ED . -RSB-

		The policy of the Allied governments , of which the results are now before us , closely resembles that of
Burke	PERSON	in regard to Robes - pierre , against which
Charles James Fox	PERSON	so eloquently but vainly protested .

		The speeches of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	read as if they were delivered yesterday , so exactly do they apply to the present war .

		The adoption by
England	LOCATION	of the policy of
Burke	PERSON	produced
Napoleon	PERSON	and led to twenty years of war .

		Let us hope that the similar blunder of the Allies will not have a similar result .

		ROBERT
DELL	ORGANIZATION	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 349 Shades from the Tory Tomb POLITICAL PORTRAITS .

		By
Charles Whibley	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	has an excellent style and his book is in every sense entertaining , but he belongs to a bygone time and it is perhaps in that aspect that he most deserves analysis .

		For he belongs in reality to those great dead days when the ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' and `` Quarterly '' Reviews decided the reputation of statesmen .

		Like the first-rate journalist , he has read the right books and has all the fitting anecdotes at his fingers ' ends .

		He can retell what every one knows , with a certain fine simplicity that almost conceals the fact of its threadbare antiquity .

		He has all the splendid prejudices of
Macaulay	LOCATION	, and a genius for invec - tive that has not a little of the arch-Whig 's charm .

		Only , and this is for him of vital im - portance , he is definitely on the other side .

		He likes the past .

		He clings to the venerable umbrae nominis we call Church and
King and Aristocracy	ORGANIZATION	.

		He sniffs doughtily in the presence of dissenters .

		He can hardly breathe when a manufacturer obtrudes his personality into poli - tics .

		He does not doubt that not
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	-LRB- as
Acton	PERSON	said -RRB- but , in sober truth , the devil was the first Whig .

		He dispenses the kind of patriotism which consists in a loud - mouthed assertion of the superiority of your own country in every quality that makes life a thing worthy to be lived .

		He seems to have no hesitation in pronouncing that a very special Providence was good enough , somewhere about the time of
Agincourt	LOCATION	, to take charge of the destinies of
England	LOCATION	.

		He is certain that the rural arts are superior to the industrial .

		He likes the kind of world in which the working - man knows his proper place .

		He has the right sort of fine , literary contempt for the low huck - sters of political wares .

		What he likes is the stern bluff soldier like the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, or the haughty gout-tortured rhetorician like the Earl of
Chatham	LOCATION	.

		Of course he is a stern Protectionist ; and he still gnashes his political teeth in anger when he thinks how Peel betrayed the country gentlemen in
1846	DATE	.

		The strong silent man is his beau ideal of a ruler ; except when , under the name of
Frederick the Great	PERSON	, his strength here , admittedly , tempered by garrulousness goes to the enrichment of Ger - many .

		He wants his statesmen to look upon humanity with their tongues in their cheeks like that prince of ignoble tricksters ,
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, or from a lofty and self-erected pinnacle like the younger
Pitt	PERSON	.

		He hates men like Fox who think there may have been some right on the French side in
1792	DATE	, or
Cobden	PERSON	, who preached the mean commercialism of free trade to benefit his own pocket .

		For him the true civilization is neatly ordered into ranks and classes , and the coachman knows that he is inferior to the man inside the coach .

		He wants our gratitude for the
Duke of Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	because he Engaged in politics when he might have been at agricultural shows ; or for Lord
George Bentinck	PERSON	because he sold his stud to oppose the abolition of the sugar duties .

		It all has the fine air of a Hannah More turned
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		The gait is masculine but mincing .

		The air is pleasant so long as you are content to rest on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	; but the sad fact is that there are valleys beneath and those valleys are the facts that Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	most blithely avoids .

		Not that he can not give you the air of scholar - ship .

		He can quote you the long out-of-print book of Mr.
Brewer	PERSON	on
Henry VIII	PERSON	; though he flanks it by an admiring reference to an essay of Mr.
Law	PERSON	's which is only a worthless piece of war-time bookmaking .

		That makes you suspect that Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	's scholarship is rather of the drawing-room variety .

		It goes pleasantly , doubtless , at a fashionable dinner , or barks with a certain air of fantastic charm when the ladies have gone out and the cigars are lit .

		But Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	is about as competent to interpret his story as a dinosaur .

		A man who can think of
Charles James Fox	PERSON	only as a somewhat dishonest gamester of pleasing manners ; a man who has the historic insolence solemnly to urge that
Cobden	PERSON	favored corn law repeal for purely selfish reasons ; who can exalt with enthusiasm
Disraeli	PERSON	's treatment of Peel and never mention that Dis - raeli was at one time his sycophantic suppliant ; who praises
Bentinck	PERSON	's attitude on the sugar duties of
1846	DATE	and does not know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
1852	DATE	admitted that the Tory policy in that regard was one long economic mistake ; who tells us in seeming seriousness that
Wolsey	PERSON	was the government of
England	LOCATION	, and
Henry	PERSON	a mere puppet , in the face of so solid and final a document as Professor
Pollard	PERSON	's history ; who can write twenty eulo - gistic pages on Clarendon and yet forbear to mention the hideous iniquity of the Clarendon Code ; whose study of
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	sees nothing of his lies , his trickery , his coldness , his utter incapacity for generous aspiration this surely is 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	no trustworthy chronicler .

		His hero , if he has one , seems to be
William Lamb	PERSON	, Lord
Mel	PERSON	- bourne .

		Lamb was , indeed , kindly enough ; but one of those cheap gamesters who treat politics as a branch of the hunting-field and are con - sidered learned because they have read the classics is hardly material for a Pantheon .

		`` He ab - horred high-sounding talk , '' says Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	, by which , if he means that
Melbourne	LOCATION	cared nothing for what was great and generous in his age , I judge that Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	likes politicians who shift a twopenny tax on malt or alter the constitution of that kind of government board which never meets .

		`` Born out of my due time , '' Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	might well cry with a far dif - ferent critic of his age , `` why should I try to set the crooked straight ? ''

		It needs no assurance to urge Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	to absolve himself from fur - ther efforts .

		In the good old-fashioned days the man of letters was the timid dependent of a great lord .

		He published his books by subscription , and boasted of the names displayed in the list .

		He wrote sonnets to my lady on the birth of her eldest son , and Latin elegiacs to his Majesty on a fortunate recovery from a serious illness .

		He was adept in the gentle art of album-verses , the sly insertion of an asterisked paragraph in a morning paper .

		He frequented the clubs and carried rumor abroad .

		He was indispensable at a dinner-party when a desired guest failed in his response .

		He had always a smiling face for rank and income .

		Poor enough himself , no one treated with greater contumely the shivering curs who pressed their faces to the railings in
Berkeley Square	LOCATION	to catch a cheering glimpse of the radiance within .

		After middle age the gout afflicted him , and he retired to Bath or the
Wells	LOCATION	to support himself on whist and faded memories .

		A century has passed since then ; and the Tory man of letters is independent .

		He curses the poor and the peaceful and the radical .

		He likes the glitter of Ascot and the mahogany magnificence of
Pall Mall	ORGANIZATION	.

		He reads the `` Quarterly '' and `` Blackwood 's '' and the `` Morn - ing Post , '' and chuckles over the fine logic of Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	.

		He discusses port and the latest bishopric and the deterioration of our times .

		He sees with disturbed distress radi - cals as prime ministers , heretics as bishops , scien - tists as heads of colleges .

		Yet , in a sense , he is the most fortunate of mortals ; for he does not know that he is dead .

		THE WORTH OF ANCIENT LITERATURE TO THE MODERN WORLD .

		By
Viscount Bryce	PERSON	.


General Education Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		With one or two exceptions , this group of books and pamphlets deals directly with the classics ; it is therefore gratifying to find that they are comparatively free from the rage of con - troversy .

		Father
Browne	PERSON	's essays are a thought - ful and at times eloquent argument on behalf of internal reform among teachers of the classics .

		The `` Value of the Classics '' is a record of the addresses delivered at the Conference on Classi - cal Studies held at
Princeton	LOCATION	in
1917	DATE	; and the great names contained in it , together with the long series of opinions derived from business men , scientists , and professional men , will undoubtedly encourage many a timid soul who looks forward with horror to the total disappearance of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	from the school .


J. H. Badley	PERSON	's small volume is a sensible but not inspiring plea for a national system of education in
England	LOCATION	; the best thing in it is his emphasis upon the neces - sity of making the system a highroad accessible to all who have the ability .

		But on turning to
Frank Aydelotte	PERSON	's `` The Ox - ford Stamp , '' we find a genuine note of original - ity .

		Mr.
Aydelotte	PERSON	is one of those rare men who have noticed that here in the
United States	LOCATION	a tremendous amount of time is devoted to the study of the English language and literature , without the attainment of any proportionate result .

		He gives several very interesting chap - ters to his diagnosis of the disease , and to the discussion of the remedy ; and these chapters should be read by every one who has suffered under the old thoughtless regime of `` composi - tion '' and skeletonized fragments of the living body of literature .

		The conclusion to which he comes is that the `` point of view which is destined to be the salvation of our English studies has much in common with the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	study of the literatures of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	; our study of the classics and of English literature as well has tended to confine itself to belles-lettres , while
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 351 the study of the classics at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	owes its dis - tinction to the fact that it is a study of Greek and Roman civilization . ''

		Now this statement is substantially true , and the only danger in making it is that Americans who have heard of
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	and have only the vaguest ideas about
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	will at once admit the truth of Mr.
Aydelotte	PERSON	's statement and nevertheless deny that it carries any lesson for us .

		Men who ought to know better , in - cluding many so-called educational experts , are fond of saying that the undoubted success of the classical studies at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is due really to the intellectual traditions and training of an aris - tocratic class of students .

		Some misconceptions will never die , but it may be worth while to point out that this perennial error has its root in intellectual laziness .

		The secret of the suc - cess of classical studies at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is simply that the student has to study and to acquire for himself ; he is compelled to sharpen his com - prehension by an ever-renewed effort to under - stand the history , literature , and philosophy of the greatest periods of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The real doctrine of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is the doctrine of con - centrated intellectual hard work ; and since that doctrine is the very anthithesis of the educational dogmas current among us , since we are so busy devising machinery for the dissipation of intel - lectual energy , we are inclined to explain away the good results obtained in the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	school of Literae Humaniores , and to attribute them to any reason but the true one .

		Mr.
Aydelotte	PERSON	has called our attention to a way in which the methods of classical Oxford can be utilized for the study of English .

		And now we are in urgent need of some book which will disengage the doctrine of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	from its merely local and temporal associations and show us how it could be applied not only to the study of English , but to the regeneration of our whole secondary and college system .

		There are signs of healthy discontent among us ; the future does not seem so secure as it did a few years ago ; and the law of automatic progress has been dis - credited , except among the members of that earnest but old-fashioned school of thought to which President
Eliot	PERSON	and Mr.
Flexner	PERSON	belong .

		It is , for example , manifest from President
Eliot	PERSON	's pamphlet on Latin that he still believes in
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	; the world has only to abolish a few more `` requirements for the
A.B.	LOCATION	degree , '' and to put `` science '' on a pedestal , in order to be quite happy and virtuous .

		If we desire the next generation to be even more sleepy and self-satisfied than this one is , then we can follow President
Eliot	PERSON	's advice .

		But if we are tired of narcotics and if we are fond of liberty , then we shall insist that the next generation study science to be sure , and plenty of it , but above all that they apply themselves more and more vigorously to the study of the history and litera - ture and thought of the past .

		Our freedom in the present is exactly proportionate to our under - standing of the failures as well as of the suc - cesses of the past ; and that understanding can be won only by hard personal work .

		There will of v course be nothing easy in this process ; it is always easier to relax `` requirements '' and to take the class on a jaunt to the
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	to study `` civics , '' or to show them how to make a fire - less cooker .

		But -LRB- pace Mr.
Flexner	PERSON	-RRB- it is never easy to be free .

		Poets , it may be said , quite as clearly as scien - tists or historians , are reporters for the Journal of Humanity .

		They are the scientists of the soul , or as others might prefer , of the heart , or of consciousness .

		We can imagine them sallying forth into the city of consciousness to report to us what is going on there some of them per - haps to get no further than the main thorough - fare or the shopping centres , while others , bolder spirits , penetrate to obscure and dismal alleys or to suburbs so remote and unfrequented that we are at first inclined to question whether they exist at all .

		In any generation the great majority of the ephemeral poets are those who early in life have discovered the park in this city and are forever after to be found there , loitering .

		One conceives them as saying : `` This is pleasant , so why go farther ?

		No doubt there are mean streets , sinister purlieus , but let us not distress ourselves over them ! ''

		If we reproach them for thus misrepresenting our city , for exaggerating the relative importance and beauty of the park , 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	-LRB- calling them , as Freud does , wish-thinkers -RRB- they can retort that those who ferret out exclusively the mean and sinister are quite as precisely wish - thinkers impelled , as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	said of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	, by the `` delight to stink . ''

		To this , of course , we reply that our ideal reporter who only turns up at rare intervals , as a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, a
Balzac	LOCATION	, a
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, a
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	is the one who sees the city whole .

		We might also add that those who report extensively on the shabby pur - lieus are so much in the minority always that they are far more worthy of encouragement than the park loungers .

		Their influence is , in the aggregate , healthy .

		Miss
Wyatt	PERSON	, Mr.
Glaenzer	PERSON	, and Mr.
Morley	PERSON	are all three in this sense devotees of the park .

		But if they are at one in their representing the park as of supreme importance , their reports are delivered in manners quite distinct .

		Miss
Wyatt	PERSON	is clearly more aware than the other two that there are other aspects to the city she has glimpsed them ; she alludes to them ; she is a little uneasy about them .

		She has heard the factory whistles at morning and evening , and seen people going to work .

		Is it possible that there is a certain amount of suffering and fatigue and dulness entailed ?

		Yes , it is ; but at this point she closes her eyes , and goes into a dactylic trance with regard to wind , rain , flowers , wheat , water - falls , sunset over a lake .

		Life is beautiful , dis - turbing ; it moves one to exclamation or subdued wonder .

		The Vesper star that quivers there A wonder in the darkening air , Still holds me longing for the height And splendor of the fall of night .

		In these four lines Miss
Wyatt	PERSON	gives us her poetic attitude hands clasped and lips parted .

		A great poet could endow this attitude with dignity and power ; but
Miss Wyatt	PERSON	is not a great poet .

		She lacks on the one hand the pre - cision , on the other hand the magic , for the task , though in such a poem as `` An Unknown Coun - try '' she comes close enough to the latter quality to make us regret that she could not come closer .

		She succeeds in making us see how beautiful this poem might have been , by comparison with which vision the actual accomplishment leaves us frus - trate .

		Rhyme and rhythm particularly the dactyl and the use of repetition tyrannize over
Miss Wyatt	LOCATION	, frequently to her undoing ; and this sort of tyranny is symptomatic .

		It relates to a certain emotional or intellectual incompleteness .

		Of the other two poets Mr.
Glaenzer	PERSON	is dis - tinctly the more varied .

		He accepts the park gladly and without question , and he observes it carefully .

		His report is mildly rich , blandly sensuous , unoriginally tuneful .

		His observations are more precise than
Miss Wyatt	PERSON	's , his technique more secure .

		On the other hand he lacks force or direction , he seems to be unable to transpose from one key to another so as to obtain climax , and the exigencies of rhyme lead him a helpless captive .

		It should also be remarked that his sense of humor occasionally fails him , as when he directs his plover to exclaim : Goodie ... coodle ... Hist !

		Expletives of this sort and one recalls
Miss Lowell	PERSON	's tong-ti-bumps and Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's boom - lay-booms are dangerous , to say the least .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, one is at first inclined to add , would not have made this error , for one of the dominants in his book , `` Songs for a
Little House	ORGANIZATION	, '' is humor .

		And yet , on second thought , that is not so certain , for Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has a disheartening talent for spoiling an otherwise refreshingly light or fancifully humorous lyric by collapsing at the close in a treacle of hideous sentimentality .

		Sentimentality is Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's dark angel , and it is curious to see how at the first whisper of its approach his sense of humor either abandons him incontinently or assumes a heavy-footed ness and loutishness which suggests the Teutonic as indeed his sentimentality does also .

		Thus , as an example of the latter quality : Pure as the moonlight , sweet as
midnight	TIME	air , Simple as the primrose , brave and just and fair , Such is my wife .

		The more unworthy I To kiss the little hand of her by whom I lie .

		And of the former : More bright than light that money buys , More pleasing to discerners , The shining lamps of
Helen	PERSON	's eyes , Those lovely double burners !

		One must turn to some of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's sonnets for a maturer and more persuasively imaginative touch , or to his parodies for a surer delicacy of humor .

		The parodies of
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	and
Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	are excellent .

		If these three poets are all determined , as re - porters , to emphasize the pretty and sweet and to ignore the surlier and more tragic demons of consciousness , one finds in the anthologies of war verse edited respectively by Mr.
WTieeler	PERSON	and Mr.
Clark	PERSON	that the disposition to glorify , to escape the unpleasant , is equally prevalent .

		One would have supposed that by this time war would have become so terribly real as to paralyze any such attempt ; yet here they are , hundreds of poets , frantically waving once more the dubious emblems of honor , glory , duty , revenge , self -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 353 sacrifice .

		So unanimous is it that it has almost the air of a conspiracy .

		An amazing intoxica - tion !

		Yet truth has many ways of revenging itself , and in this instance it does so by effectively frustrating the effort to beautify war or make pretty poetry of it .

		For the uniformity or failure in these two collections is nothing short of aston - ishing .

		One closes them with the feeling that few if any of these poets , even those who have made names for themselves , have come within a thousand miles of the reality .

		They shout , they exhort , they lament , they paean , but always with a curious falseness of voice ; it is painfully appar - ent that they have failed to imagine , or more exactly , to see .

		Their verses are histrionic .

		For a glimpse of the truth one must turn to Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Bombardment , '' in a richly imagined and dramatic prose -LRB- which Mr.
Charlton M. Lewis	PERSON	dismisses in his preface with patronizing fatuity -RRB- , to
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets , to
Alan Seeger	PERSON	's `` Champagne , '' or to some of the work of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	and Mr. de la Mare .

		For the rest , one alternates between Kiplingesque narra - tives of incident and sterile odes .

		What is perhaps the finest poem of the war , Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's `` August :
1914	DATE	, '' is in neither anthology , nor is Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Poppies of the Red Year . ''

		Are we to conclude from all this that poetry can not be made of war ?

		Not necessarily .

		What immediately suggests itself is that as war is hideously and predominantly real , an affair of overwhelmingly sinister and ugly forces , it can only be embodied successfully -LRB- with exceptions -RRB- in an art which is realistic , or psycho-realistic .

		To return to the simile with which this review was opened , we might say that those poets who are devotees of the park rather than of the slum will almost inevitably fail in any attempt to de - scribe war in terms of the park .

		And to succeed at all is to falsify , to report the desire rather than the fact .

		It is of such failures adroitly written and interesting , but ephemeral and with the air of hasty marginal notes that these two anthologies largely consist .

		Meanwhile , we await with inter - est the return of the poets from the trenches .

		It is possibe that we shall then learn what war is : they will perhaps tell us directly and simply and subtly what a human being really thinks and feels in such a fantastic environment .

		And we shall probably be surprised .

		Of the two collections Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's is the more comprehensive and the better selected , Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	's the less militaristic and partisan .

		Applied Psychology on Trial APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY .

		By
H. L. Hollingworth	PERSON	and
A. T. Poffenberger	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY .

		By
Kate Gordon	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		The appearance of two texts in applied psychol - ogy , both deserving a place as standard manuals , offers occasion for the discussion of the funda - mental position of this candidate for scientific status .

		Within limitations , the value of such pursuit is secure ; but the determination of these limitations is the issue upon which psychologists are likely to arrange themselves in opposed camps .

		The most unquestioned field is that of the psy - chology of the specialized educational processes .

		Reading , writing , drawing , the handling of num - bers and quantities , and the more puzzling case of spelling , have a psychology of their own .

		The expression of these in the analysis of psychological relations , and the precise study of the basis of their acquisition , is a useful pursuit .

		They are indispensable mental disciplines directly amenable to exact research .

		Back of these lie the more general functions of memory and imagination , association and reasoning , motor skill and com - posite learning by experience ; and still further back , the general laws of behavior , and the ad - justment of instincts to the demands of the en - vironment .

		The problems of heredity and sex , of work and rest , of play and stimulation , of fatigue and efficiency , stand in coordinate impor - tance .

		The vocational applications form the com - prehensive remainder of the field : the psychology of law and medicine , of workshop and market , of the executive and social control of men .

		The program suggests a pemican encyclopedia or a smattering something that everyone should know , or with which everyone can dispense , be - cause he should acquire what he needs of it otherwise .

		An engineer studies his physics and his mathe - matics and then applies them ; he does not substitute an applied for a basic pursuit .

		The psychological student is under temptation to study the application , and let the psychology go .

		He finds that his applied psychology has lifted selected chapters from the orthodox science and pointed them to a practical use .

		This works fairly well for the simpler principles and their simpler applications , as in a boy 's book of enter - taining tricks and experiments based on simple physical principles .

		But the project of applied psychology is inherently ambitious , and it extends to all the complications of human relations and 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1 1	DATE	to all the employments of the hands and minds of men .

		The psychological engineer advises the advertiser how to advertise ; the executive how to judge , organize , and manage men ; the teacher of whatever subject how to teach -LRB- in so far as the professor of pedagogy has not forestalled him -RRB- ; and everyone how to work and play , learn and improve .

		How far does the fact that the practitioner of medicine , law , teaching , manu - facturing , trade , industry , and the many unnamed and unspecialized businesses of life , from parent - hood to `` society '' -LRB- in the reporter 's sense -RRB- , exer - cises his craft on the basis of mental powers and relations how far does this fact give the psycho - logical student the authority to lay down the law on all these occupations ?

		Psychology clearly stands in a relation apart , in so far as all things learned and done are , in one aspect , affairs of the mind , although , in an - other aspect , they are technical acquisitions .

		The responsible applied psychologist recognizes this vital distinction ; he interprets his problem not as that of advice or replacement , but as one of seeking and intensive study of processes and prin - ciples which happen to have a special application in the world of affairs .

		He seeks the quickening of interest , both for psychology and for the voca - tions , which comes from recognizing the mental basis of the pursuits of daily life .

		If he goes beyond this toward a promise of aid to practical success by a knowledge of the psychological as - pects of activities that can be learned by no other art than the art of their practice , he enters upon a dubious career .

		In carrying out their tasks , Professor
Holling	PERSON	- worth and Dr.
Poffenberger	PERSON	have concentrated their aims upon supplying a systematic survey of the field of application .

		They base this upon the interpretation for the practical life , of the general laws of behavior and .

		the specific study of the typical mental processes .

		The task is well done and supplies an easy approach to the content of the new discipline .

		Miss
Gordon	PERSON	proceeds simi - larly for the educational field alone .

		The two volumes overlap in their treatment of the indis - pensable factors of heredity , sex , environment , behavior , and the basic mental procedures .

		Miss
Gordon	PERSON	includes a more detailed treatment of the logical processes .

		Since education not only instructs but proposes to teach reasoning , both texts are written for the specific purpose of directing instruction in courses introducing stu - dents to the applied phases of psychology .

		As aids to study they will prove efficient .

		But , like all instructional work , their value depends directly upon the judgment and competence of the in - structor .

		In this respect , these texts are well sponsored .

		Doubtless there are students whose interests are primarily and legitimately practical .

		The open question is : how far does the satisfaction of that interest , in the detailed terms of application , aid or interfere with the acquisition of the maxi - mum benefits from the study , and the maximum training of the student mind in psychological power ?

		The temper of a study of psychology in which psychological interests are dominant , and application is subsidiary and largely for illustra - tive purposes , and the temper of an applied psy - chology in which application is central and the principles appear darkly in an unaccented back - ground , must of necessity be decidedly different .

		A student becomes scientific-minded as readily by the study of physics as of chemistry , of geology as of biology , although the contents of his ideas are markedly different in the several pursuits .

		But his scientific-mindedness would have a very different cast if it were shaped by the workshop or the farm and not by the laboratory .

		Consequently applied psychology is careful to give the student the laboratory spirit ; it points towards applica - tion , but it utilizes the technique that has come from the interest in principles and basic analyses .

		Yet with all this conceded and well main - tained , as it is in the perspective of these volumes , the query is not dismissed .

		There lurks in the discipline the danger of a false emphasis the risk of a hasty plunge into application , unequipped by solid achievement of comprehension .

		The details of tests of proficiencies loom large ; the interpreta - tion of what they mean tends to be slighted .

		This is particularly unfortunate for the student of American temper , whose habits of thought need strengthening in the very direction which applica - tion is prone to neglect .

		This , for the peda - gogical aspect .

		For the more serious one of ap - preciation of psychological values in evidence , in interpretation , and in those vital conceptions that determine at once the forward steps in a science and the range and grasp of the psychologist 's personal hold , the criticism is yet more pointed .

		The issue emerges jointly in the handling of method and conclusion .

		Application emphasizes the definite numerical statement ; in its confidence it proceeds to substitute what is measurable for what is important .

		There is an analogy in the aesthetic field .

		When machinery saves labor , it is an aid to the finer effort and thus to aesthetics ;
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 355 when the machine dictates the design , and the designer begins to think in terms of the machine and not in terms of the principles of design , the machine is or may become an insidious power for evil .

		Applied psychology is so young that it still has this issue to face .

		A fair illustration is that of the consideration of sex differences , which are rightly placed as matters of first importance by all the chief con - tributors to the movement here reviewed .

		On the basis of laboratory tests , which show with fair equivalence of capacity and much overlap - ping in various fields that in all respects the powers of men and women are equal , they con - clude that any different treatment of boys and girls is due to tradition and prejudice , and that the different careers of men and women are largely the result of imposed license and disquali - fication .

		This conclusion is absolutely refuted by history , by biological and social science , and by discerning analysis in every field .

		The right conclusion , of course , is that the source , of the significant sex differences lies outside the tests , and also that the tests fail to bring them out all of which is an intelligible , though not a sim - ple , tale .

		The assumption that a direct practical attack upon the problem will yield a solution is a rough-rider procedure , totally unadjusted to the obviously intricate and delicate features of the situation .

		This remains the general and deadly charge against the applied spirit .

		The sin is by no means inherent in it .

		Sin is not inevitable only temptation .

		As soon as applied psychology accepts the responsibility of a more adequate analysis of the problems which it right - fully attacks , and as soon as it cultivates the discerning insight which recognizes how many problems can not be sampled -LRB- under the crude assumption that the whole is but the sum of its fractional parts -RRB- , its future will be more con - sistent with the authentic source of its procedures .

		If it insistently affirms that the psychology of advertising is important because its bills are large and do not yield to accounting , applied psychol - ogy will lose perspective and invite suspicion .

		If , similarly , it concludes that men and women are different only as the differences appear in such parallel columns as it has found reason to collect , it will arouse scientific protest .

		If it presumes to dictate to the practitioner on matters in which a practical sense has more value than acquaintance with the uncertain application of an uncertain theory , it will be accused of im - pertinence .

		The dariger of falling between two stools is due to the circumstance that each is already occupied by a rightful claimant .

		It re - mains to be seen whether the new discipline can find a third stool and encamp amicably between the theorist and the practitioner .

		All this is said as much in caution as in criti - cism , as much in appreciation of the important service which applied psychology has done and which is attractively presented in these volumes as in depreciation of certain tendencies which have already appeared .

		The irritating applied psychologist , like the yet more exasperating poli - tician , is the one who assumes that anybody who disagrees with him does so in ignorance of facts and figures , whereas the disagreement may well be based upon certain considerations deeper than facts and more significant than figures .

		The immediate problem of the new discipline is to develop in its practitioners a broader appreciation of what lies within their field , and a more catholic comprehension of what by nature lies beyond it .


JOSEPH JASTROW	PERSON	.

		A Long ff ^ ait in Vain THE LIFE OF
JOHN FISKE	PERSON	.

		By
John Spencer Clark	PERSON	.

		2 vols .


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		Something more is required to make a notable biography than a rich collection of documents and a large store of memories .

		Of this fact the recently published life of
John Fiske	PERSON	is an irre - futable demonstration .

		The work is in two volumes from the pen of
Fiske	PERSON	's intimate friend ,
John Spencer Clark	PERSON	.

		It is a record not only of a significant life but of a significant contest in the cultural history of
America	LOCATION	.

		Fiske 's part in the struggle to wrest higher education from the con - trol of theological tyranny , his early espousal of the theory of evolution , and his long battle for what he believed to be the true ethical and reli - gious interpretation of Darwinism , connect him with episodes of historic importance .

		Should the suspicion which appears to be gaining ground prove to be correct , should it come to be recog - nized as true that somewhere near the turning of the present century a new philosophy came into existence , a philosophy which is essentially the voice of evolution , and that this thing hap - pened in
America	LOCATION	,
John Fiske	PERSON	would have to be regarded as the early pioneer of this extraordi - nary change .

		For this reason his life and work , his educational , social , and religious environment , the magnificent support he received and the pet - 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	tiness of the opposition he overcame , are of vital concern to Americans jealous for the higher in - tellectual life of their country .

		The more pity therefore that this long-awaited biography should prove to be a failure .

		These are not pleasant words to write , but one must choose between writing them and the guilt of silently condoning the publication , by an old and distinguished house , of a performance so amateur and inept .

		The more eminent the subject of the memoir and the more distinguished the publisher , ` the greater the responsibility of the critic .

		The reader who comes to this biography with the hope of finding a living portrayal of
John Fiske	PERSON	and a well considered estimate of his place in the intellectual life of the latter half of the nineteenth century , may be promised a hand - some disappointment .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	appears to be dominated by a single ideal to give in the origi - nal chronological order as many of the details of
Fiske	PERSON	's life , big and little , as can be packed into two good-sized volumes .

		An illustration will be the best criticism .

		The author has been retailing various incidents in
Fiske	PERSON	's life covering the years 1874-9 : the death of his grandmother ; his preparation , in the absence of the maids , of a luncheon for
Mother Brooks	ORGANIZATION	, who was ill ; the removal of the Fiskes to a new house , built for them by his mother and step-father ; the visit of Professor and Mrs.
Huxley	PERSON	-LRB- a rare bit of nat - uralness -RRB- ; and so on .

		Quite in the vein not only of this chapter but of the entire biography he says -LSB- Vol .

		II , page 95 -RSB- : And now we come to an incident in the social life of
Fiske	PERSON	which has left an interesting memorial behind it .

		Among his neighbors in
Cambridge	LOCATION	was
Christo	PERSON	- pher
Pearse Cranch	PERSON	preacher , painter , and poet .

		Cranch was a man of fine culture , and was one of the small circle of Transcendentalists who made so much stir in the intellectual life of
New England	LOCATION	between
1830	DATE	and
1850	DATE	... One day in
February , 1879	DATE	Cranch called upon
Fiske	PERSON	at his house , 22
Berkeley	LOCATION	Street ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Fiske was not at home ; and , while waiting in the library for Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	to come down , Cranch 's feel - ings were deeply stirred by the embodiments of human thought with which he was surrounded .

		Two days after , he brought to
Fiske	PERSON	the thoughts which came to him while in
Fiske	PERSON	's library , expressed in the follow - ing lines : The reader is then treated to a poem of no special merit entitled `` In a Library , '' and a double page insert reproduces the verses in fac - simile !

		For the life of me I have been unable to hit upon any reason why the author should have felt it necessary to make anything of the incident , save that he had the manuscript poem and that he felt obliged to say something nice about Cranch .

		Let the reader be reminded that this is not an isolated example .

		It is strictly typ - ical of the book .

		The work makes the impres - sion of being an unusual approximation to what is known in psychology as `` total recall . ''

		One can understand of course how admiration of a departed friend who was also a man of note might tend to interfere with the selection and rejection of biographical material .

		But one may not therefore excuse it , since without such dis - crimination first-rate biography is impossible .

		So too of another feature of the book .

		One can understand why an author who is by temper a sentimentalist should feel moved to record numerous little family intimacies which , while recalled with peculiar satisfaction by those im - mediately concerned , have little significance for those who fail to get the original imaginative setting .

		But one deplores the lack of taste which does not sense the absence of such setting and consequently does nothing to supply it .

		Then , too , how can a man write an effective biography who is as innocent of a sense of humor as
Mary Baker G. Eddy	PERSON	herself ?

		A like mechanicalness is characteristic of the author 's style .

		It is formalistic , wooden , stilted , monotonous to a degree rarely met with in lite - rary attempts outside the writings of college sophomores .

		The description of
Fiske	PERSON	's court - ship a theme calling for imagination and deli - cacy instead of literalness and pomposity is a classic of its kind .

		No one should read it unless he knows the way of relief through mirth or profanity .

		And how wearisome the author 's labors to establish explicit coherence through continuous prospective and retrospective refer - ence , as a substitute for the vital coherence to be secured only through the organic relations of the inner movement of a story .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has adopted as good literary technique the method of presentation suggested to teachers by a disillu - sioned professor : First tell your pupils what it is you are going to tell them .

		Then tell it to them .

		Then tell them what it was you just told them .

		This for an example -LRB- and not the worst one either -RRB- : And now , having established the subject of this memoir in the helplessness of his infancy in the
Fiske	PERSON	family at
Middletown	LOCATION	, and having put in order his family antecedents which have revealed , on the ^ pater - nal side , the sturdy , free-thinking , genial qualities of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, in contrast , on the maternal side , with the strict , religious character of the Puritan , embodied in the attractive personality of his mother , we will leave him to be brought through the critical period of his infancy , while we make ourselves acquainted with
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 357 some of the physical and social characteristics of Mid - dletown , which served for his environment during the period of his boyhood and his youth .

		One is tempted to clinch the argument by further analysis of the author 's style , calling attention to monstrous hyphenates like `` soci - ologico-political , '' `` philosophico-religious , '' `` me - taphysico-theological , '' `` atheistico-materialistic , '' and other irritating idiosyncrasies of diction .

		But perhaps enough has been said to indicate the author 's literary inadequacy .

		I can not refrain , however , from quoting just one of his novel sen - tences .

		This one occurs in the narration of
Fiske	PERSON	's visit to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , a trip from which he returned rich in pleasant memories : He took with him , as a particularly sweet remem - brance , the home of the
Reverend T. L. Eliot	PERSON	with his accomplished daughters , where in the intervals between lectures he had enjoyed several hours of rare intellectual converse , mingled with delightful music .

		-LSB- Vol .

		II , page 367 . -RSB-

		These defects of literary form are but the superficial and more immediate manifestations of something which goes deeper .

		In the only sense that counts when it comes to writing a biog - raphy , the author has not known
Fiske	PERSON	.

		He describes from the outside .

		He only half under - stands .

		He has never lost himself in the subject .

		His delight in
Fiske	PERSON	is unmistakable ; his admira - tion unrestrained ; his work clearly one long trib - ute .

		For all that , he remains a spectator perhaps just because his attitude is one of wor - ship rather than affection .

		This attitude is clearly seen in his description of
Fiske	PERSON	's entrance upon his career as an American historian : Feeling a deep interest in the occasion , I took a seat where I could observe critically both the speaker and the audience .

		After rising ,
Fiske	PERSON	paused a moment to survey his audience ; and when he had attention at full focus he said , in clear tones , and in a simple , conversational way : `` The voyage of
Columbus	LOCATION	was in many respects the most important event in human history since the birth of Christ . ''

		He then paused a bit .

		The momentary effect upon the audience the attempt to grasp its significance was clearly per - ceptible .

		Observe the immense connotative suggestive - ness of this simple sentence .

		Brief , sententious as it was , it threw a momentary searchlight over the whole period of Christian history , and was a clear intima - tion that a master mind had come to give a philosophic interpretation to the events which had flowed from the memorable voyage of
Columbus	LOCATION	from the port of Palos on the 3d of
August , 1492	DATE	.

		Fiske is not only great but sacred , and he must never be allowed to do or say anything out of character .

		So we are told about an angelic child , who was always dutiful ; who was never guilty of a blot or an erasure in a letter , or a mark of any kind in a book ; who always knew how many volumes he possessed , the color of each binding , and the exact order of their arrangement on his shelves ; whose deportment at school was always perfect ; and whose mental precociousness was the outstanding wonder of all who knew him .

		This is interesting , and so is the slight reference to the hero 's schoolmates , who seem to have judged him by standards of their own , and whom the author calls jealous and cowardly .

		But of much greater interest would have been a critical study of the effect of
Fiske	PERSON	's early environment upon his personality and his views .

		He was brought up by adoring grandparents .

		.

		He was gifted with an extraordinarily keen , agile mind , a quite unu - sual intellectual curiosity , and a remarkably tena - cious memory .

		What was the effect of such an environment upon such an equipment ?

		Here was a biographical opportunity .

		It is made use of to give us a catalogue of childhood virtues viewed from the angle of age .

		It is true that in the course of the long narra - tive there is an occasional , temporary lapse into something resembling real biography .

		But on the whole the model followed in the portrayal of
Fiske	PERSON	's childhood is all too successfully adhered to .

		In place of a serious attempt to analyze
Fiske	PERSON	's personality to arrive at the sources of his power and of his weakness in place of a sober estimate of the nature and value of his contribution to the life of the interesting period in which he lived , we have again a catalogue of virtues .

		We are told over and over of the orderly arrangement in
Fiske	PERSON	's mind of the vast stores of knowledge at his command ; we are assured again and again of his lucid style , of his sim - plicity of manner , of the `` brilliant literary and oratorical success '' of his lectures ; we are referred to many an incident as `` a further revelation of the considerate kindness , the deep poetic sensi - bility , and the profound reverential feeling which were constituent elements of
Fiske	PERSON	's nature '' or words to that effect .

		The failure of the author to grasp and reveal personality is mitigated by his publication of let - ters to and from
Fiske	PERSON	and portions of the latter 's lively and graphic diary .

		With these to draw upon the reader can find material to block out a rough portrait and even to fill in a few details with confidence .

		It is thus sufficiently evident that he was a man of tremendous intellectual energy and great personal charm , who counted among his friends a considerable number of the foremost thinkers of the English-speaking world of his day .

		It is clear too that he was able to move critical audiences , both here and in
Eng	LOCATION	- land , to the highest pitch of enthusiasm , and that 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	something about him enlisted men and women of means in his projects .

		Even more obvious is the fact that affection for Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	and the children was his dominant passion to the end of life .

		`` Being away from you , '' he writes to Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	from the midst of friends in
London	LOCATION	, `` amounts in itself to a serious illness .

		The agonies I have suffered since I landed in
England	LOCATION	are such as no words can ever describe , and it goes far to offset the good effects of my seclusion .

		Nay , rather , let me come home and work as in the old days .

		I fear that this awful homesickness will break down my strength . ''

		And at last he was compelled to leave his task unfinished and go home .

		One recalls
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's remark about
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	: `` A man who could love so deeply must have been lovable himself . ''

		The case is worse for the reader interested in arriving at an estimate of the value of
Fiske	PERSON	's historical and philosophical work .

		Here the biog - raphy is of practically no help .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	is more concerned for
Fiske	PERSON	's personal glory than for the solid success of the movements in which he was engaged .

		There was a time when
Fiske	PERSON	was believed to be delivering great messages .

		He was bringing new hope to people harassed by fears of the religious implications of the theory of evolution , and he was interpreting American political institutions to audiences uplifted by his vision and thrilled by his eloquence .

		What is the state of affairs today ?

		How lasting was the marriage between religion and evolution for which
Fiske	PERSON	was responsible ?

		Of what perma - nent value was his historical work ?

		One wishes that Mr.
Clark	PERSON	had thrown some light on these problems .

		But he appears quite unconscious of the fatal logical weaknesses inherent in
Fiske	PERSON	's religion of evolution .

		And while he is aware of unfavorable criticisms of the historical work , he undertakes no examination of their force .

		Per - haps it is just as well .

		For in the one instance where he attempts adjudication in the debate between
Fiske	PERSON	and
William James	PERSON	he quite misses the point , and , condescendingly takes

		And so in spite of our long wait -LRB- the book is announced by the publishers as the long-awaited biography -RRB- we shall be compelled to wait still longer for a definitive life of Fiske .

		It is not likely that he will ever be recognized as one of our leading philosophers , but in the field of his - tory he seems to be assured a high place .

		His historical writings have always been widely read , and now even historical scholarship , which a few years ago was severe in its criticism , has changed to mildly qualified praise .

		And no one can tell how far this reaction may go .

		At any rate it still remains to be determined to what extent
Henry Irving	PERSON	was speaking with knowledge and judg - ment when he wrote to Mrs.

		Clipped ff ^ ings THE HOUSE OF CONRAD .

		By
Elias Tobenkin	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Is it the mission of
America	LOCATION	to break down the revolutionary ardor of the immigrant , con - vert his sons to a sane and cautious view of working-class progress , and reward his grand - children with an honest homestead in the West , wherewith they may become rich through their own unaided toil ?

		This is the immigrant process Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	suggests in his new novel of the three generations of the `` House of Conrad '' in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The story traces the slow frus - tration of the dream of the fiery young workman disciple of Lassalle who comes to
New York	LOCATION	in the late sixties .

		The young German socialist is obsessed with the idea of founding a `` house '' of stalwart sons who shall liberate the workers of the land of the free .

		But the neighbors soon turn the heir apparent ,
Ferdinand Lassalle Conradi	PERSON	, into plain
Fred Conrad	PERSON	, and to his father 's chagrin the quiet boy grows up not into the flaming leader of the masses but into an intelligent conservative labor leader of his bakers ' unions tepid towards the socialist dogmas , slightly ashamed of his father 's excitement and incorrigible foreign accent .

		He marries a maiden from
Vermont	LOCATION	, and his two children emerge in - distinguishably `` American . ''

		The jealousy of rival labor leaders brings the unfortunate Fred to prison ; his wife dies ; the children become waifs and are taken in charge by the authorities .

		Salvation is found only when the grandson ,
Rob	PERSON	- ert , carrying out his dead father 's dream of a homestead in
California	LOCATION	, rescues his sister and brings her and the mellowed old grandfather to his new ranch .

		In this more ambitious plot , Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 359 leaves little doubt that the gaucheries of his earlier `` Witte Arrives '' were not so much mere symptoms of inexperience as of a very limited imagination about American life .

		He has a real sense for the intense idealism of the socialist workers , their self-sacrifice , and the heroic strug - gles of their little journals and groups .

		He has a real feeling for the boy Fred , with his quiet indus - try , his sober romance , the toil in the bakery , the little politics of his union .

		But the moment he at - tempts to bring the house of Conrad into con - tact with the American native world , unreality shows its face .

		Fred must be given a strong Americanizing influence .

		He must meet some - one who , while sympathizing with the `` under dog , '' teaches the boy how necessary it is for these immigrant idealists to adapt themselves to American ways .

		Yet is it plausible that this native American should be a shrewd New Eng - lander , `` of old Revolutionary stock , '' `` graduate of a leading college , '' once a teacher but now imperturbably a small contractor in the painting and decorating business , and the uncle of the
Vermont	LOCATION	maiden who no sooner is in
New York	LOCATION	than she is walking in the park with the young German baker apprentice ?

		A good novelist can make anything seem plausible : Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	's natives make one shudder .

		What are we to do with the unhappy
Edward Sumner Channing	PERSON	, of impeccable Abolitionist ancestry and of the even more impeccable Fifth Avenue present ?

		Do Chan - nings , when they are unfortunate in their do - mestic relations , talk that way about socialism and about love ?

		Do they fall in love with girls like
Fred	PERSON	's daughter , who has come out of a reformatory to be a companion to their aristo - cratic sister ?

		And if they do , since Ruth is an admirable girl , do they suddenly jump out of windows only because they are asked if their proud sisters would want girls like Ruth for sisters-in-law ?

		Perhaps they do .

		But it requires more artistry than Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	possesses to make it plausible .

		The entire incident of Ruth is preposterous melodrama .

		Are such resolute and rational girls so easily terrorized by cheap police bullies into fleeing the city , without a word to the neglected father , for whom they have just driven their lover to his death ?

		And is a girl of sixteen , so beautiful and intelligent , so resolute and rational as this daughter of
Fred	PERSON	's , immured in a
House of Redemption	ORGANIZATION	because she has once been found with a neighbor 's little boy asleep in her lap ?

		Even though Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	could prove that each of his incidents actually happened , his novel would still be riddled with untruth .

		I fear that his imagination , as soon as it strays out of the realm of what is pure and of good repute , is exceedingly limited .

		This ingenious novel gives the author a certificate of spotless moral char - acter that any sinner might envy .

		Since the Sunday-school books that we used to read in childhood I know nothing quite equal to Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	's notions of the seamy side of life .

		Fred 's adventure with the `` widow , '' from which dates all his woe , is quite characteristic .

		An insistent smugness , a note of the young and earnest immigrant 's proving to the wholesome and earnest native American how very whole - some and earnest he can be , pervades this book .

		One turns with relief to such a masterpiece as ``
David Levinsky	PERSON	, '' where both the immigrant and the native world are seen veraciously , with - out moral bias .

		And Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	's vigorous command of English is as superior to Mr.
Toben	PERSON	- kin 's feeble style as is his American vision to Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	's conception of puritans .

		But what concerns us most is the impression of clipped wings which this young novelist pro- duces .

		Evidently he had the serious purpose of illuminating the immigrant process ; and he is important therefore , if for only his intention .

		Now the main drama of the American immi - grant 's life lies in his reaction to our economic absolutism .

		`` The House of Conrad '' is almost a cunning evasion of that capitalistic issue .


Gott	PERSON	- fried , with his fiery socialist bitterness , is mel - lowed down , one might say , into the harmless manager of a small bookshop .

		The quiet Fred goes to prison , not so much a victim of the em - ployers whom he is fighting as of his own com - rades , punishing him for his sexual virtue .

		The grandson finds liberation in that most inadequate , obsolete social institution , the individually ap - propriated homestead in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Nowhere a grappling with the issue , though the hero springs straight from the Lassallean furnace !

		Every - where the suggestion that while the heart of revolutionary idealism may do it credit ,
Ameri	PERSON	- can sober sense sees that its head is weak !

		For this young novelist the class struggle has been blurred .

		In a time of moral adventure it is the pedestrian virtues that he delicately urges .

		Among the revolutionary appeals , his idealism has grown tepid .

		Whatever
America	LOCATION	may have done to the
House of Conrad	ORGANIZATION	, it has done some - thing unfortunate to Mr.
Elias Tobenkin	PERSON	.

		360 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	BRIEFS ox BOOKS HISTORY OF
INDIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Captain L. J. Trotter	PERSON	.

		Revised and brought up to date by
W. H. Mutton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Not since the soldier-scholar of the old
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	days put the finishing touches to his history in
1899	DATE	, has the text been revised or reissued .

		The service has now been fittingly performed by
Archdeacon Hutton	PERSON	, the
Oxford Reader	ORGANIZATION	in Indian History .

		It was in
Oxford	LOCATION	that the old soldier began and ended his career .

		Histories of
India	LOCATION	have frequently come from the hands of administrators like
Hunter	PERSON	, but rarely , if we exclude Colonel
James Tod	PERSON	's classic study of
Rajputana	LOCATION	, have they come from the hands of a soldier .

		This seems only natural when we consider the turmoil and anarchy , due to the decline of the famous Mughal empire , from which the British rescued
India	LOCATION	. '

		How - ever , those were the days when soldiers readily and efficiently assumed the role of administra - tors .

		It is now certain that we have seen the last of this interesting type in
Cromer	LOCATION	and
Kitchener	LOCATION	.

		But the foundation for
India	LOCATION	's prosperity and order were not fully laid until the keeping of the new , inchoate , heterogeneous empire passed from the overtaxed machinery of the outworn Company of `` merchant-adventurers '' into that of the British Parliament .

		It required an
Ori	PERSON	- ental imagination like that of Disraeli to seize and improve upon the opportunity .

		Thus Vic - toria became Empress of
India	LOCATION	and ruler of a new , vast empire in
1877	DATE	, nineteen years after
India	LOCATION	passed into the hands of a central govern - ment in
London	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Trotter	PERSON	's pages deal largely with the early struggles of the British in contesting the French and Indian adventurers that laid claims to the deliquescent dominions of the Mughal .

		Incidentally ,
Archdeacon	PERSON	Hut - ton 's footnote on the struggle with the French in southeastern
India	LOCATION	reveals the fact that a `` Sergeant
Bernadotte	PERSON	, the future King of Swe - den , was taken prisoner by the English . ''

		Trot - ter 's survey of this military period makes swift and entertaining reading .

		Nowadays , the emphasis is rightly placed on the economic and political phases in history .

		Turning over
Captain Trotter	ORGANIZATION	's pages on early
Hindu	PERSON	and Muhammadan institutions and his - tory , we find them readable and enlightening , even though research and the discoveries of archaeology have uncovered more data than were available at the time of his writing .

		For such early history information is now sought in schol - arly work like that of
Vincent Smith	PERSON	.

		But the American reader and student will find this vol - ume sufficient to their needs , especially at this time when a swift survey is essential to our keep - ing pace with the recasting of our world , East and West .

		The
Black Hole of Calcutta	ORGANIZATION	is familiar enough , but not so the events that pre - ceded and followed that epochal incident .

		What we know of the administration of
Warren Hast	LOCATION	- ings is still obscured by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's inaccurate rhetoric .

		From our oldest preparatory school ,
Dummer Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
South Byfield	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , came the American general , Sir
David Ochterlony	PERSON	, whose statue greets the American tourist in
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		But little do we realize that he stopped that marauding race from
Nepal	LOCATION	, known today as the Gurkhas , who furnished the finest soldiers in the Indian army ; or that he saved
Delhi	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	in
1804	DATE	- the ancient capital , whose name we mispronounce but per - petuate in five states in this country , where an
American Vicereine	ORGANIZATION	entered to a durbar on a state elephant .

		Inded , no more fascinating read - ing can be offered than this brief history of
India	LOCATION	.

		It is convenient to find the place-names and their spellings standardized and provided with diacritical marks : this was the least due our country , that has nurtured Sanskrit scholars like

		DIDEROT 'S EARLY PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS .

		Translated by
Margaret Jourdain	PERSON	.

		Open Court ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It is a commonplace that each advance in sci - ence , each change in economic and social condi - tions , has demanded not only revised conceptions of God but radically different methods for estab - lishing the fact of his existence .

		Diderot lived in one of these transition periods .

		His reaction against the traditional religion and the dogma - tism of French intellectual vested interests is manifested in the early writings which
Margaret Jourdain	PERSON	's admirable translation now makes ac - cessible to American readers .

		The `` Philosophic Thoughts '' are primarily a justification of the skeptic 's position .

		`` What is a skeptic ?

		A philosopher who has questioned all he believes , and who believes what a legiti - mate use of his reason and his senses has proved to him to be true . ''

		He pleads for a free use of reason as against a reliance upon superstition ; for demonstration as against faith in miracles .

		`` He who does not deliberately embrace the faith in which he has been bred can no more plume himself on being a Christian or a Mussulman than upon not being born blind or lame .

		It is his luck , not his merit . ''

		In common with Vol - taire ,
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	was impressed with the argument from design for the existence of God .

		In `` Thought XX '' he presents this argument , but since within three years , in `` The Letter on the Blind , '' he ostensibly quotes the words of the blind
Saunderson	PERSON	in which the latter applies the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 361 principle of relativity to God and suggests the theories of evolution and survival of the fittest as alternatives to special creation , it is probable that even in
1746	DATE	Diderot doubted the effective - ness of this argument .

		`` The Letter on the Blind '' and `` The Letter on the Deaf and Dumb '' are valuable and in - teresting because of Diderot 's thorough utiliza - tion of the principle of relativity .

		He indicates the dependence of morality , as well as intel - lectual conceptions , upon our sense organs .

		`` How different , '' he asks , `` is the morality of the blind from ours ?

		How different would that of a deaf man likewise be from his ?

		And to one with a sense more than we have , how deficient would our morality appear to say nothing more ? ''

		If the psychologist tells us these essays contain much crude and unwarranted specula - tion , we should remember that
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	expresses his keen disappointment with his inability to se - cure experimental verification for his theories .

		He clearly indicates that the test of valid specu - lation must be a scientifically controlled experi - ment , and he proffers suggestions for the educa - tion of the blind and the deaf which are now in operation .

		Americans who do not read French have been excluded too long from direct contact with the intellectual life of eighteenth-century
France	LOCATION	.

		A reading of this book will stimulate a desire for direct acquaintance with the later writings of Diderot and his fellow Encyclopedists .

		The desire , however , is due in part to
Margaret Jourdain	PERSON	's excellent translation , which makes it possible to read Diderot with no thought that the original was penned in a foreign language .

		THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH WEST INDIES , 1700-1763 .

		By
Frank Wesley Pit	PERSON	- man .


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		In the
earlier half of the eighteenth century	DATE	the imperial interests of
England	LOCATION	extended chiefly to four important parts of the world : the
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	country ,
India	LOCATION	, the North American colonies , and the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		As the first two were , so far as
England	LOCATION	was concerned , the exclusive fields of great trading companies , they produced no difficult administrative complications .

		Between the
West Indies	LOCATION	and the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	colonies there existed , however , a conflict of interests which in a large measure was responsible for the disruption of the British empire later in the century .

		The islands of the
West Indies	LOCATION	were sugar colonies ; while the dominions on the mainland produced lumber , live stock , fish , meat , and provisions in other forms .

		It was the presumption at West - minster that these products could be disposed of in the sugar colonies ; but the islanders were unable to consume all the Northern products , nor were they able , in the sale of sugar , to compete with their French neighbors , who sold their wares at a considerably cheaper price .

		To force the trade of the mainland to the English West Indies and at the some time to strike a blow at French commerce ,
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	passed the famous Molasses Act of
1733	DATE	, which must be counted as one of the causes that led to the American revolt .

		The history of this act , the agitation that pre - ceded it , and the futile efforts to enforce it are to American readers the more important subjects treated in Dr.
Pitman	PERSON	's work on the
British West Indies	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author also discusses in detail such matters as social life , the labor problem , slavery and the slave trade , foreign commerce , and eco - nomic arrangements .

		His work further includes a number of carefully prepared statistical appen - dices .

		It is elaborately indexed and is prefaced with a good map of the entire
Caribbean	LOCATION	region .

		THE SPIRIT OF REVOLT IN OLD FRENCH LITERATURE .

		By
Mary Morton	PERSON	Wood .


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Dr. Wood draws from early French and Pro- vengal literature typical passages which show striving toward social justice and freedom of thought in the much abused `` dark ages . ''

		She endeavors to make the work palatable to the gen - eral reader by translating all her citations and by using , to avoid repetition , less than one fifti - eth of the matter originally collected .

		She com - ments on the character of the various authors and the conditions under which they wrote when such explanation is useful in fixing the exact bearing of their attack , but otherwise she refrains from interpretation of her text , for fear of inject - ing twentieth century ideas into the discussion .

		A cardinal defect in much of - the social philoso - phy of the middle ages lies in the `` substitution of charity for justice , '' or `` the assumption that privileged individuals have the right to bestow happiness on others .

		So the moralists , with few exceptions , urged the king to be merciful to his subjects , instead of inciting the people to hold their kings accountable to them . ''

		But courage of expression is noted everywhere , and the right to personal conviction occasionally championed .

		The first and strongest chapter deals with the revolt against political and economic injustice .

		All notes are sounded , from the famous personal laments of the wretched Rutebeuf to the tragic picture of peasant misery drawn by the high churchman
Etienne de Fougeres	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` It is this which distresses me the most , '' sings
Rutebeuf	PERSON	, `` that I dare not , empty handed , knock at my own door . ''

		And again : `` These are friends whom the wind blows away and the wind blew hard before my door . ''

		Etienne de Fougeres writes : `` If he -LSB- the peasant -RSB- has a fat goose or 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	a chicken or a cake of white flour , he intends it all for his lord .

		He never tastes a good mor - sel , bird or roast . ''

		The four following chapters deal with attacks on corruption among the clergy or on church discipline .

		The last chap - ter is entitled `` Protest against Sex Discrimina - tion . ''

		Dr. Wood admits that this protest took a `` perverted form '' in that it was occupied almost exclusively with `` discussion of female depravity . ''

		Since this particular protest is obviously near her heart , she could have greatly strengthened her argument by extending her study to include the first French feminist ,
Christine	PERSON	de
Pisa	LOCATION	.

		Dr. Wood apparently admires the `` Roman de la Rose , '' and refuses to accept the violent asper - sions of
Jean de Meung	PERSON	as reflecting his per - sonal opinion of women .

		Her case is weak here .

		Indeed , when she observes that
Jean	PERSON	's work is a `` defense of marriage against celibacy , '' the reviewer is reminded of the mite once contrib - uted to academic gaiety by an undergraduate who , on being asked what the Rose symbolized , replied gravely , `` The Heart of the Maiden . ''

		THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF BRITISH STATES - MANSHIP .

		By
J. Ellis Barker	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		The problems of British statesmanship which Mr.
Barker	PERSON	considers fall into two general classes foreign and domestic .

		On the foreign side he discusses questions relating to
Constan	PERSON	- tinople ,
Asiatic Turkey	LOCATION	, Autria-Hungary ,
Poland	LOCATION	, and an `` Anglo-American reunion '' ; on the domestic , the question of war finance as related to the economic future , the attainment of British industrial supremacy , and the reorganization of government on the lines shown by the present war to be advantageous .

		The book 's title is misleading .

		Certain problems of British states - manship are taken up at some length , but by no means all .

		The contents , in fact , display the heterogeneity characteristic of books made up , as the present one is , of random articles published in the magazines .

		All of Mr.
Barker	PERSON	's chapters , however , make good reading , and a few command thoughtful attention .

		Among the latter are two in which he argues that the present war , far from impoverishing
Great Britain	LOCATION	, may greatly enrich that nation .

		In support of this contention he cites the experience of
England	LOCATION	after the Na - poleonic wars , and of the
United States	LOCATION	after the Civil War .

		He finds in doubled or trebled taxation a powerful stimulus to industrial initia - tive and to the development of latent resources .

		He estimates British manufacturing , mining , transportaion , and agriculture as only one third as productive per capita prior to
1914	DATE	as
Ameri	LOCATION	- can .

		And he believes that the war will force such an economic reorganization , largely on American lines , as will bring up the efficiency , and hence the wealth-producing power , of British industry , trade , and agriculture to an entirely new level .

		The argument is interesting and plausible , although the effectiveness of it is les - sened by assertions that are palpably extravagant .

		The flat statement , for example , that
Great Britain	LOCATION	can `` treble her yearly output , her yearly income , and her national wealth by
Americaniz	PERSON	- ing her industries '' is absurd , especially when viewed in relation to the enormous depletion of the industrial population for which the war has already been responsible .

		All in all , however , the author has established his point ; namely , that however great the economic losses suffered since
1914	DATE	, they do not yet even approach the character of an irreparable disaster .

		AMERICAN PICTURES AND THEIR PAINT - ERS .

		By
Lorinda Munson Bryant	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		What first attracts one toward Mrs.
Bryant	PERSON	's book is the discrimination manifested in the selection of the illustrations , which form a series displaying the characteristic phases of American painting from Colonial times to the present .

		These examples reveal the general trend and vigor of native painting in oil .

		Artists differing widely in methods and aims are ranged side by side in amicable historical review .

		Even the much despised anecdotist and the latest of the younger radicals are not denied admission .

		There is much biographical detail of an informing nature , and here and there expositions of studio theory .

		The book is written , however , from a popular non-critical point of view ; consequently there is little or no discussion of the various technical methods used by the painters in obtain - ing their effects .

		Whether intentionally or not , the author constantly gives the impression of em - phasizing the importance of subject matter in painting .

		She even adds a rebellious little corol - lary to one of
Whistler	LOCATION	's pronouncements , in which he glorifies the manner at the expense of the matter .

		One sincerely wishes that Mrs.
Bryant	PERSON	in her enthusiasm for nature , both inani - mate and human , had focused her numerous descriptions of the subject matter of the paintings .

		That the painter has chosen to paint a wintry landscape under certain interesting conditions is surely no excuse for a general panegyric on winter , or that the artist has selected a human being or several human beings as a means of expression is no excuse for a general eulogy of mankind .

		In the family circle a little girl , it is true , may be a `` darling , '' but in a painting that may be the least interesting of her attributes .

		If the subject is a man , the author dilates on mascu - line character ; if the subject is a woman , and a thin one at that , the author thinks the artist would have been wiser to select a plumper and
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 363 rosier model .

		The author even says in one place that each brush stroke of a certain artist was a `` stroke of love . ''

		Most artists will confess that their own brush strokes are often accompanied by something more closely resembling profanity .

		Paint , as anyone knows who has worked with it , is a mulish substance .

		And , furthermore , our view is endorsed by famous testimony , for we all recall that historic outcry of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, `` Damn paint ! ''

		Aside from these minor defects the book is a handj and valuable compendium .

		It contains a goodly stock of information , and one is readily able , by means of it , to trace the leading tendencies in our native art .

		THE NEW GREEK COMEDY .

		By
Philippe E. Legrand	PERSON	.

		Translated by
James Loeb	PERSON	.

		Put - nam 's ;
$ 4.50	MONEY	.

		This book , which in the original French is entitled `` Daos , '' has ' been familiar to scholars since
1910	DATE	as a most valuable comprehensive study of
Greek New Comedy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	has made it accessible to the general reader in some - what abridged form , and there is a brief intro - duction by that brilliant Hellenist , the late
John Williams White	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Legrand	PERSON	deals with the subject in the competent and thorough man - ner which we expect of the French critic ; he divides his work into three main sections , which treat of the subject matter of
New Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, the structure of the plays , and their purpose .

		Probably the most interesting pages are fur - nished by the sketch of the dramatis persona ?

		of
New Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, of the strange types which made up the stage world of Menander and his less famous fellows , and which were so meekly bor - rowed by Plautus and
Terence	PERSON	.

		Here they all are : foreigners , rustics , sycophants and parasites , old men virtuous or lecherous rich or poor , young men in love , courtesans of every hue , the pander and the omnipresent slave , the boasting soldier and the misanthrope .

		The adventures of such characters were excellently adapted to amuse the Athenians , now that the Athenians could no longer indulge in political satire ; and the career of New Comedy in
Rome	LOCATION	, and on the modern stage through
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and a host of other imitators , is ample proof of its viability .

		But there is in the original comedies , as
Legrand	PERSON	points out , an undercurrent of piety for which nothing in the modern imitations would prepare us ; we find throughout the New Comedy a tone of resigna - tion in the midst of the fun , and a belief that sal - vation is an individual and not a social concern , which serve as a reminder that the days of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity were coming .

		Such documents are too often neglected by the political historian ; they should serve as clues to the general conditions which underlie events .

		In this sense
Legrand	PERSON	's book is a contribution to history as well as to criticism .

		THE STORY OF
THE SALONIKA ARMY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
G. Ward Price	ORGANIZATION	.

		Clode ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Mr. Price deserved a better sponsor than
Lord Northcliffe	LOCATION	, for he has written a really admirable book , entertaining and genuinely informative .

		Liberal readers might easily be frightened away by such sweeping statements as Lord Northcliffe makes in his encomiastic introduction ; for in - stance , that `` he -LSB- Mr. Price -RSB- makes clear the chicanery which prevented the Greeks from fol - lowing their natural bent .

		He sweeps aside , once and for all , the hollow pretense of
Germany	LOCATION	that her dastardly action in
Belgium	LOCATION	finds a parallel in the treatment of
Greece	LOCATION	by the Allies . ''

		This suggests a propaganda book .

		But this is precisely the kind of book Mr.
Price	PERSON	has not written .

		He gives comparatively little of the confused diplo - matic background which both preceded and followed the landing of the Allied armies at
Salonika	LOCATION	.

		What he does give is the human side of the difficulties confronted by the Allied com - manders , the human side of the struggle on the Macedonian front , and the humor and tragedy and beauty of the fighting in
Albania	LOCATION	and around
Monastir	LOCATION	.

		For example , the chapter headed `` Ourselves and the Greeks : Relations at
Salonika	LOCATION	'' is not a summing up of the evidence of the blue , white , red , yellow , and black books .

		On the contrary , it is an account of picturesque
Salonika	LOCATION	, of the amusing profiteering at `` Floca 's '' -LRB- the famous restaurant has since been burned down -RRB- , of the adventures of the Allied military police when they had to arrest spies in the Turkish quarter , where every house had almost as many secret doors as it had windows .

		The congeries of races at
Salonika	LOCATION	and the contrasts of language , costume , and manners become vivid and intriguing under his descriptions .

		Yet Mr.
Price	PERSON	does not wholly neglect the larger aspects of the whole Balkan situation .

		He gives as the final justification for the Macedonian adventure not so much the desire to help the hard-pressed Serbians although that generous motive had much to do in shaping Allied public opinion to assent as the necessity of not allowing German prestige to have it all its own way in the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		He explains the natural difficulties of terrain which confronted the composite Allied armies .

		Yet even though Mr.
Price	PERSON	is frank to admit that the expedition really came weeks too late to be as effective as it ought to have been , from his book one gets the final impression that the wonder is not that the Allies have done so little in
Mace	LOCATION	- donia , but that they have done so much .

		364 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 11	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT HORACE
WALPOLE	LOCATION	'S EPIGRAM TO THE EFFECT that life is a tragedy to the man who feels and a comedy to the man who thinks , contains a sug - gestion for educators .


Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, who derives as much aesthetic satisfaction from the contemplation of a logical sequence in higher mathematics as a classicist from the niceties of Attic prose , defines the scientific outlook as the refusal to regard our own desires , tastes , and interests as affording any key to the under - standing of the world .

		Yet what is the .

		final objection brought against the modernist by the defenders of Greek and Latin in our schools , if it is not that the new education develops a cheap utilitarian outlook in the student ?

		In brief , the quarrels in the field of education seem to the outsider to make use of subjects only as an occasion for condemning methods .

		It is not science in itself that the classicist really objects to , any more than it is pages of conjugations of verbs which really arouse the ire of the modern - ist .

		It is the fear that the opposing school of pedagogy has not the power to evoke in the student that certain impersonality of outlook , that objectivity , which all appear to agree is a man 's most precious cultural possession .

		It is fear , in a word , that the other fellow does not know how to coax from youngsters the desire to think .

		For although we are long since too sophisticated to accept
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's naive distinction between thought and feeling , the direction and emphasis of his idea finds us recep - tive .

		There is no quarrel with the contention that the life of reason has a humor , charm , and passion beside which the satisfactions of a life dominated bv desire are as evanescent as steam .

		MR.
DURANT	PERSON	'S PROVOCATIVE LETTER TO THE DIAL -LRB- printed on another page -RRB- brings sharply to attention a tragic , although neglected , truth : that while American newspapers and magazines and official spokesmen for public opinion are unanimous in their support of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	's war policy , in his advocacy of a liberal inter - national programme , of which this war policy is the deliberate and conscious expression , President
Wilson	PERSON	stands practically alone .

		The irony of this is that already President
Wilson	PERSON	has the support of the most powerful force in British politics , the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	; that he has the support of the common people of
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	; and that even in
Russia	LOCATION	the earlier sus - picions are vanishing before his courageous insistence emphasized again in his
Baltimore	LOCATION	speech that as far as
America	LOCATION	is concerned an imperialistic peace which sacrifices the fruits of the Russian Revolution will not be tolerated .

		Yet with these clear evidences of a growing world leadership , President
Wilson	PERSON	's liberal inter - national policy , instead of being warmly sup - ported in his own country where he might most hopefully look for support , is the object of covert hostility .

		The very journals which give voluble lip service to President
Wilson	PERSON	and enthusiasti - cally welcome any increase of our military strength , often slyly insinuate that the ideals for which all our sacrifices are freely given are really Utopian ideals .

		In brief , far too many of our newspapers seem glad of the chance to `` stand behind the President '' just as long as it gives them opportunity to pull their own militaristic chest - nuts out of the fire .

		When it comes to a genuine world democracy they are skeptical .

		A year of war has revealed their motives all too clearly : they care nothing about a more decent inter - national system ; they carp only about making
America	LOCATION	a strong military nation .

		BUT WHY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES should American liberals have been so slow in coming to the enthusiastic support of President
Wilson	PERSON	's international programme ?

		Why , indeed , are they still unorganized and ineffective ?

		Be - cause a year ago the liberals suspected not President
Wilson	PERSON	or his intentions but precisely those reactionary forces which today stand so shamelessly revealed .

		There was legitimate sus - picion of those who urged the country to `` stand behind the President '' when the very people who urged this loudest had never lifted a finger to further democracy at home .

		What liberals ob - jected to was not the employment of military force for the words pacifist and liberal are not synonymous but to the purpose for which that force was seemingly to be used .

		It appeared that , in spite of all President
Wilson	PERSON	might be able to do , the war would result merely in a new imperialistic balance of power .

		Certainly those who were most ruthless in condemning the skeptical for their `` lack of patriotism '' did every - thing they could to increase that skepticism .

		But there is no longer any real justification for doubt .

		In the
last year	DATE	President
Wilson	PERSON	has revealed , not once but again and again , that he really means what he says , that he purposes to fight for a new international system based on justice and fair dealing .

		He is gathering to his support all the democratic forces of the world .

		Liberals in
America	LOCATION	can not afford to continue any longer in their present state of disorganization .

		They must present a united front .

		They must actively and whole-heartedly support the President in his war programme , if they expect to have the right to speak concerning his idealistic programme .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 365 As Mr.
Durant	PERSON	has truly said , `` they have noth - ing to lose but their isolation . ''

		Certainly those who never objected to the use of military force for righteous ends have now , after Brest-Litovsk , less cause than ever before to question its em - ployment .

		The German militarists understand no argument except force , and until they are defeated or until they are thrown from power by a revolution , there can be no clean peace .

		It is obvious that the very ideals of President Wil - son , which look forward to making war impos - sible , can not be realized without active support of his present war programme .

		THE DIAL , for its part , has never faltered from active and whole-hearted support of the President in his war programme .

		But it has also , as a liberal journal , gladly supported the President 's attempts to create a more tolerable system of international relations than existed in
July , 1914	DATE	, even when such support has been maliciously or stupidly misconstrued .

		And as a liberal journal , it will continue that support in the future .

		There is no longer in
America	LOCATION	any question of active loyalty to the President 's war programme , except among the handful of the embittered extremists or the really treacherous .

		There is serious question , however , of active loyalty to the President 's inter - national programme which he hopes to make effective as a result of this war .

		In this newer and more significant sense , in this unwavering support of the ideals and plans which alone , according to President
Wilson	PERSON	himself , give the war meaning , THE DIAL proudly takes its place with those few journals which sincerely and honestly `` stand behind the President . ''

		DEATH DID NOT COME TO DEBUSSY
UNEX	ORGANIZATION	- pectedly .

		He had long known that he was incurably ill with cancer and that his tenure of life was short ; calmly enough , he had even spoken about it to his friends .

		Nor can we say that death interrupted his work and deprived us of some development of his art that we might hopefully have anticipated .

		Doubtless the operas his pub - lishers have been vaguely announcing season after season `` La Legende de Tristan '' and the others will now of necessity remain sketches .

		Yet had Debussy lived another quarter-century , it is prob - able they would have remained sketches still .

		Indeed , had he actually completed them , it is likely that they would have refined very little upon the quality of his art .

		For he had long since reached the climax of his powers .

		His more recent compositions such as the piano preludes , the music to d'Annunzio 's `` Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien , '' the `` Images '' for orchestra diaphan - ous , exquisitely fashioned works though they are , add no cubit to his artistic stature .

		They reveal him as a little less persuasive than in his earlier works .

		For all their fluidity and iridescence they lack the warmth and passion and tenderness that inform so beautifully the `` Quartet , '' the `` Nocturnes , '' and `` Pelleas . ''

		During the last few years , in fact ,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's style became com - paratively rigid .

		The poet in him , the blind im - passioned being moved by a dark inner need , had gradually given way to the critic , the man bril - liantly conscious of all that he intends .

		And toward the close of his life he might have said , with
Rameau	PERSON	his master , `` My taste becomes purer from day to day , but my genius has van - ished . ''

		IN WHAT DEGREE IS OUR PRESS RESPONSIBLE for that dismal uniformity in American life which
James Bryce	PERSON	discussed in a famous chap - ter ?

		The other day an influential paper said editorially of a local non-conformist : It is not disclosed that he had anything to gain by expressing himself .

		His egotism seems to have sug - gested to him that he was alone in an arcanum of intelligence and that he ought to emerge from the mysteries of his intellect and set the poor boobs right who were being used by Capitalism with a capital C .

		When egotism suggests such isolation to the possessor of an intellect and starts him on such a mission he becomes an awful thing .

		Taste aside , this is a curiously frank amendment of the theory underlying American freedom of conscience , of thought , and of speech .

		The the - ory is that if you will bring your ideas to the open court of public opinion , it will circulate their truths and let fall their errors .

		The amendment is : make certain that your ideas con - form before you bring them in -LRB- unless you have `` something to gain by expressing '' yourself -RRB- .

		Now a court differs from a mob chiefly in its willingness to entertain and discriminate conflict - ing ideas .

		The effect of the amendment is to turn the court of public opinion into a mob which will insist upon conformity or silence .

		That way lies something even more sinister than a stagnant uniformity the spirit which seeks to compel agreement by enforcing the gestures of agree - ment .

		To this futile and embittering intolerance we are already subject enough .

		The average man has outgrown the notion that you can save people by herding them into churches ; it is his own aphorism that you can not make men good by law ; but daily now we hear of his attempts to make men -LRB- and latterly women as well -RRB- `` loyal '' by forcing them to kiss the flag , on penalty of a duck - ing or worse .

		Loyalty , of course , is our national desire ; but the mob spirit , encouraged by the emphasis our press puts upon superficial conform - ity , defeats the reality of loyalty by exacting its shadow .

		366 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1 1	DATE	COMMTTXICATIOX AMERICAN LIBERALS AND THE WAR -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL -RRB- This is a changing war .

		A year ago most of us saw it as a rather interesting contest between two imperialistic systems for the exclusive domination of the world ; today we begin to see it as a vast and vital struggle between reactionary forces and pro- gressive forces everywhere to determine whether any imperialistic system is to survive at all .

		What is it that has so changed the focus and meaning of the war ?

		Two factors chiefly : first , American participation , under the guidance of a President whose intelligence compels him to liberalism ; second , the growth , in every European country , of liberal forces standing on the power of labor to control production and morale , and strengthened by the indispensable sup - port of the American government .

		When , a year ago , President
Wilson	PERSON	professed himself more interested in the democratic pacifica - tion of the world than in the development of that baby imperialism which flaunts the flag in Wall Street , a considerable proportion of the liberals of this country immured themselves in skeptical isola - tion and suspense .

		But the last year has brought them comfort , and brought them , too , a problem ; for by all the tokens of American diplomacy the President has meant that the splendid phrase which he coined about democracy should be taken at its face value , as the reliable issue of a government prepared to sustain that value with all the resources at its command .

		He has repeatedly thrown the weight of his prestige upon the side of the liberal parties in
Europe	LOCATION	, and has formulated the pro- grammes which these parties have been glad to second and sustain ; he has propounded terms of conciliation so obviously reasonable that no group in any country has dared to take open issue with them ; he has announced himself as unequivocally opposed to the use of military force in the establish - ment of trade-routes or spheres of economic influ - ence ; he has supported radical forces everywhere so far as they did not impede the effective participa - tion of
America	LOCATION	in the production of a warless world ; he has taken labor into his counsels with a quite unprecedented fullness and candor , and has definitely aligned himself against that industrial au - tocracy which threatens to make American democ - racy a sham .

		And with what result ?

		This , that the word has gone forth from all the Vaticans of privilege in
America	LOCATION	to the purchasable press that the position of the President in international diplomacy must be undermined and his high reputation at home bit by bit destroyed .

		Already the printed prostitutes of every city pro- claim that the President has failed : that he has bungled the work of preparation ; that he has not succeeded in stirring up revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, or in guiding it in
Russia	LOCATION	; and that his outrageously open diplomacy has brought dis - union into the aims of the Allies .

		It is forgotten now -LRB- the victims of American journalism are mostly those who are adepts in forgetting -RRB- that the transportation of men and munitions depends on the building of ships , this on the spirited co - operation of the workers , and this on the intelligent decency of employers -LRB- a decency that is decreasing under cover of a war that shunts publicity from domestic affairs -RRB- ; it is forgotten that revolution failed in the Central Empires , and sank into innocu - ous isolation in
Russia	LOCATION	, because of the refusal of certain imperialistic forces to cooperate in a plan which required more liberalism of aim , and threat - ened more progress towards industrial reconstruc - tion , than these forces could digest ; it is forgotten that unity never existed in the war aims of the Allies , and can be secured only through the tran - sient disunion necessarily incident to the demand for a democratic revision .

		All this must be forgotten now ; for if it is remembered and understood , not all the printer 's ink in
America	LOCATION	can blacken the President or make the world safe for autocracy .

		Surely this situation points a problem for Ameri - can liberals , and offers them their chance .

		What are liberals to do ?

		To wait for certainty is to court futility ; to stand idly by is to lose the oppor - tunity of cooperating with the liberals of
Europe	LOCATION	in their uphill effort towards a democratic peace and the gradual demilitarization of the western world .

		Now is the time to wrest a strategical point from the forces of reaction to divert patriot - ism from unwitting subservience to clever conserv - atism into such support of the President as will not only strengthen him against imperialistic attack , but will at the same time considerably enhance the power and prestige of liberal ideas .

		This may involve some mental reservation , to be sure ; but participation in the compromising flux of events is the necessary price to be paid for partici - pation in the direction and determination of events .

		The policy of a government is always in the end determined by the source from which it derives its strongest support ; if liberal support is not forth - coming fully , the President will have to lean more upon the help , and towards the aims , of those forces that have ruled the past and have still a heavy hand upon the future .

		Clearly the strategy of liberalism in the present conjuncture of events is to throw whatever influence it commands upon the side of President
Wilson	PERSON	, offering him full support both in the prosecution of the war against feudalism at home and imperialism abroad , and also in the pursuit of the resolute purpose to write gradual disarmament and compulsory international arbitra - tion into the terms of peace .

		Let the liberals of
America	LOCATION	unite .

		They have a political leadership to gain under which perhaps our total economic structure may be rebuilt .

		And they have nothing to lose but their seclusion .

		THTDIAL Si jFortntff & tty Journal ot Criticism and 2Dtecu00ion of Eiterature and
$ itt	MONEY
& The Passing of National Frontiers It	ORGANIZATION	is to be accepted as a major premise , underlying any argument or speculation that bears on current events or on the calculable future , that the peoples of
Christendom	LOCATION	are now coming to face a revolutionary situation .

		`` It is a condition , not a theory , that confronts us . ''

		This will hold true with equal cogency for inter - national relations and for the domestic affairs of any one of the civilized countries .

		It means not necessarily that a radical change of base in the existing law and order is expedient or desired , but only that circumstances have been falling into such shape that a radical change of base can be avoided , if at all , only at the cost of a hard - handed and sustained reactionary policy .

		Indeed , it may be an open question whether any concerted scheme of reactionary measures will suffice to maintain or to re - establish the passing status quo .

		It takes the form of a question as to whether the Old Order can be rehabilitated , not whether it will stand over by its own inertia .

		And it is , perhaps , still more of an open question what would be the nature and dimensions of those departures from the holding ground of the Old Order which the new conditions of life insist on .

		But the situation is of a revolutionary character , in the sense that those under - lying principles of human intercourse on which the Old Order rests are no longer consonant with the circumstances which now condition this intercourse .

		The spirit - ual ground on which rights and duties have been resting has shifted , beyond recall .

		What has been accepted hitherto as funda - mentally right and good is no longer securely right and good in human inter - course as it must necessarily run under the altered circumstances of today and tomor - row .

		The question , in substance , is not as to whether the scheme is to be revised , but only ^ as to the scope and method of its revision , which may take the direction of a rehabilitation of the passing order , or a drift to new ground and a New Order .

		The principles of right and honest living are of the nature of habit , and like other habits of thought these principles change in response to the circumstances which condition habituation .

		But they change tardily ; they are tenacious and refractory ; and anything like a deliberate shifting to new ground in such a matter will come to pass only after the old position has become patently untenable , and after the discipline exercised by the new conditions of life has had time to bend the spiritual attitude of the community into a new bias that will be consonant with the new conditions .

		At such a juncture a critical situation will arise .

		So today a critical situation has arisen , precipitated and emphasized by the exper - ience of the war , which has served to demonstrate that the received scheme of use and wont , of law and order and equity , is not competent to meet the exigencies of the present .

		In the last resort , these changes of cir - cumstance that have so been going forward and have put the received scheme of law and order out of joint are changes of a technological kind , changes that affect the state of the industrial arts and take effect through the processes of industry .

		One thing and another in the institutional heri - tage has so been outworn , or out-lived ; and among these is the received conception of the place and value of nationalities .

		The modern industrial system is world - wide , and the modern technological knowl - edge is no respecter of national frontiers .

		The best efforts of legislators , police , and business men , bent on confining the knowl - edge and use of the modern industrial arts within national frontiers , has been able to accomplish nothing more to the point than a partial and transient restriction on minor details .

		Such success as these endeavors in restraint of technological knowledge have 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	met with has effected nothing better than a slight retardation of the advance and dif - fusion of such knowledge among the civilized nations .

		Quite patently , these measures in restraint of industrial knowl - edge and practice have been detrimental to all the peoples concerned , in that they have lowered the aggregate industrial efficiency of the peoples concerned , without increasing the efficiency , wealth , or well - being of any one of them .

		Also quite patently , these endeavors in restraint of industry have not successfully prevented the modern industrial system from reach - ing across the national frontiers in all direc - tions , for materials and for information and experience .

		Indeed , so far as regards the industrial work of the modern peoples , as distinct from the commercial traffic of their business men , it is plain that the national frontiers are serving no better pur - pose than a moderately effectual obstruc - tion .

		In this respect , the national frontiers , and all that system of discrimination and jealousy to which the frontiers give defi - nition and emphasis , are worse than use - less ; although circumstances which the commercialized statesmen are unable to control have made the frontiers a less ef - fectual bar to intercourse than would suit the designs of national statecraft .

		The case stands somewhat different as regards that commercial traffic that makes use of the modern industrial system .

		Busi - ness enterprise is a pursuit of private gain .

		Not infrequently one business concern will gain at the cost of another .

		Enterprising business concerns habitually seek their own advantage at the cost of their rivals in the pursuit of gain ; and a disadvantage im - posed on a rival concern or on a competing line of business enterprise constitutes a competitive advantage .

		Hindrance of a competitor is an advantage gained .

		Busi - ness enterprise is competitive , even where given business men may work in collusion for the time being with a view to gains that are presently to be divided .

		And success in business is always finally a matter of private gain , frequently at the cost of some one else .

		Business enterprise is competitive .

		But the like is not the case with indus - trial efficiency .

		And the material interest of the community centres on industrial ef - ficiency , on the uninterrupted production of goods at the lowest practicable cost in terms of material and man power .

		The productive efficiency of any one industrial plant or industrial process is in no degree enhanced by the inefficiency of any other plant or process comprised in the industrial system ; nor does any productive advantage come to the one from a disadvantage imposed on another .

		The industrial proc - ess at large is of a cooperative nature , in no degree competitive and it is on the productive efficiency of the industrial process at large that the community 's material interest centres .

		But while busi - ness enterprise gets its gains from industry , the gains which it gets are got in compe - tition with rivals ; and so it becomes the aim of competitive business concerns to hinder the productive efficiency of those industrial units that are controlled by their rivals .

		Hence what has been called `` capi - talistic sabotage . ''

		All this , of course , is the merest commonplace of economic science .

		At this point the national frontiers come into the scheme of economic life , with the jealousies and discrimination which the frontiers mark and embody .

		The front - iers , and that obstruction to traffic and intercourse in which the frontiers take effect , may serve a gainful purpose for the business concerns within the frontiers by imposing disadvantages on those outside , the result being a lowered efficiency of industry on both sides of the frontier .

		In short , so far as concerns their place and value in modern economic life , the national frontiers are a means of capitalistic sabot - age ; and indeed that is all they are good for in this connection .

		All this , again , is also a commonplace of economic science .

		In past time , before modern industry had taken on its modern character and taken to the use of a wide range of diversified materials and products drawn from all over the habitable world in the past the obstruction to industry , and therefore to material well-being , involved in the use of the frontiers as a means of sabotage was of relatively slight consequence .

		In the state of the industrial arts as it prevailed in that past era , the industrial processes
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 ran on a smaller scale and made relatively little use of materials drawn from abroad .

		The mischief worked by sabotage at the frontiers was consequently also relatively slight ; and it is commonly believed that other , incidental gains of a national charac - ter would accrue from so obstructing traffic at the frontiers , in the way of national self-sufficiency and warlike prep - aration .

		These presumed gains in point of `` preparedness , '' it has been presumed , would outweigh the relatively slight eco - nomic mischief involved in the practice of national sabotage by the obstructive use of the frontiers , under the old system of small-scale and home-bred industry .

		Latterly this state of things , which once served in its degree to minimize the eco - nomic mischief of the national frontiers , has become obsolete .

		As things stand now , no civilized country 's industrial system will work in isolation .

		Not only will it not work at a high efficiency if it is effectually confined within the national frontiers , but it will not work at all .

		The modern state of the industrial arts will not tolerate that degree of isolation on the part of any country , even in case of so large and diversified a country as the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The great war has demon - strated all that .

		Of course , it may be conceived to be conceivable that a modern civilized community should take thought and deliberately forgo the use of this modern state of the industrial arts which demands a draft on all the outlying regions of the earth for resources neces - sary to its carrying-on ; and so should return to the archaic scheme of economic life that prevailed in the days before the Industrial Revolution ; and so would be able to carry on its industrial life in a passable state of isolation , such as still floats before the vision of the commercial - ized statesmen .

		But all that line of fantastic speculation can have only a speculative interest .

		In point of practical fact , the nations of
Christendom	LOCATION	are here together , and they live and move and have their being within this modern state of the industrial arts , which binds them all in an endless web of give and take across all national frontiers and in spite of all the well-devised obstructive measures of the commercialized statesmen .

		As an industrial unit ,
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	is out of date .

		This will have to be the point of departure for the incoming New Order .

		And the New Order will take effect only so far and so soon as men are content to make up their account with this change of base that is enforced by the new com - plexion of the material circumstances which condition human intercourse .

		Life and material well-being are bound up with the effectual working of the industrial system ; and the industrial system is of an international character or it should per - haps rather be said that it is of a cosmo - politan character , under an order of things in which the nation has no place or value .

		But it is otherwise with the business men and their vested interests .

		Such business concerns as come into competition with other business concerns domiciled beyond the national frontiers have an interest in the national frontiers as a means of obstructing competition from beyond .

		For the purpose of private gains , to accrue to certain business concerns within the country , the national frontiers , and the spirit of national jealousy , are valuable as a contrivance for the restraint of trade ; or , as the modern phrasing would make it , these things are made use of as a means of sabotage , to limit competition and pre - vent an unprofitably large output of merchantable goods being put on the market unprofitable , that is , to the vested interests already referred to , though ad - vantageous to the community at large .

		Conversely , vested interests engaged in the pursuit of private gain in foreign parts , in the way of foreign investments , foreign concessions , export trade , and the like , also find the national establishment serviceable in enforcing claims and in procuring a profitably benevolent consideration of their craving for gain on the part of those foreign nations into whose jurisdiction their quest of profits is driving them .

		At this point , again , the community at large , the common men of the nation , have no material interest in furthering the advan - tage of the vested interests by use of the national power ; quite the contrary in fact , inasmuch as the whole matter resolves 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	itself into a use of the nation 's powers and prestige for the pecuniary benefit of certain vested interests which happen to be domi - ciled within the national frontiers .

		All this , again , is a commonplace of economic science .

		The conclusion is equally simple and obvious .

		As regards the modern industrial system , the production and distribution of goods for common use , the national estab - lishment and its frontiers and jurisdiction serve substantially no other purpose than obstruction , retardation , and a lessened efficiency .

		As regards the commercial and financial considerations to be taken care of by the national establishment , they are a matter of special benefits designed to accrue to the vested interests at the cost of the common man .

		So that the question of retaining or discarding the national establishment and its frontiers , in all that touches the community 's economic rela - tions with foreign parts , becomes in effect a detail of that prospective contest between the vested interests and the common man out of which the New Order is to emerge , in case the outcome of the struggle turns in favor of the common man .

		THORSTEIN
VEBLEN	PERSON	.

		Antiquated Youth About five years ago .

		a certain young dramatic critic was dreadfully shocked by being asked if , after all , `` Sumurun '' was n't the sort of thing that the theatre really ought to do instead of tackling social problems .

		At that time the critic was superintending the reformation of the world and his wife through the agency of a few choice spirits and artist-philosophers like
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	,
William C. de Mille	PERSON	,
George Broadhurst	PERSON	, and
Charles Klein	PERSON	, with occasional assistance from the -LRB- printed -RRB- plays of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	and
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		And it only in - creased the critic 's distress to realize that he was getting more spiritual sustenance out of the
Reinhardt	ORGANIZATION	picture-play of pas - sion and knockabout cruelty than he could draw from that defense of woman 's integ - rity , `` Bought and Paid For , '' that expose of corrupt politics , `` The Woman , '' and that arraignment of Wall Street finance , `` The Gamblers , '' all rolled into one .

		In the end , however , the young critic put the doubt from him .

		Of course ,
Klein	PERSON	was just a bit crude as a manufacturer of dramas of discussion .

		Wait till a few of our really distinguished fiction-writers tried their hands at it , and the younger generation came along .

		Since then a great many critics have estimated and reestimated the number of gallons of water that have passed under their favorite metaphorical bridge , and since then we have had a rather disturb - ing series of events in
middle Europe	LOCATION	to make us think a little less or a little more about the theatre .

		Finally have come the distinguished writer of fiction to ask us `` Why Marry ? ''

		and a specimen of the younger generation of
England	LOCATION	to tell us about `` Youth '' all just in time to be compared with a revival of twenty-five - years-old `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession . ''

		And what a terrible bore it all is !

		these plays of Messrs.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	and
Miles Malleson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course this is all very inconsistent and unfair .

		It is critical suicide to applaud the polemic poppycock of `` The Woman '' and sneer at `` Why Marry ? ''

		to salute chastely the maidenly maunderings of `` A Man 's World '' and yawn at `` Youth . ''

		`` Why Marry ? ''

		is clever .

		`` Youth '' is pitifully sincere .

		`` Why Marry ? ''

		has style .

		There is impassioned writing in `` Youth , '' and real humor .

		Yet both of them end by being deeply and thoroughly and boringly unsatisfying .

		To put it as crudely as a thesis-play , a lot of us are tired of these modern dramas , just as we are tired of modern life .

		It is all a mess of grubbing and grabbing and blunder and compromise , with no passion and no blazing faith to light a path across .

		Sometimes it almost seems as if the world itself had become suddenly aware of the stink and boredom of this era and had conceived the perverse solution of com - mitting terrestrial suicide .

		Perhaps we
1918	DATE	-RSB- 391 are retreating into the theatre of beauty just to escape the confusion of today 's terrible immolation .

		But I think we should gladly , however mistakenly , stick to our guns if there were anything worth shoot - ing at .

		What is the use of pottering round with luke-warm heresies and half - baked iconoclasms that ca n't keep pace with the shifting society that they flatter them - selves they are reforming ?

		No , the old world is dead and no one knows the dif - ference which is as sober and as sensible an explanation as any for the sudden futility of plays like `` Why Marry ? ''

		and `` Youth , '' and for the solemnity with which some of us accept them as works of art and the absurd vigor which others bestow on their regurgitation .

		Yet even without the war I think we should be tired of these things .

		We are tired of talk .

		We are tired of talk that everyone accepts and nobody acts on .

		We are tired of talk that nobody accepts and everyone acts on .

		We are even tired of talk that nobody accepts and nobody acts on except , perhaps , the angels and a few Bolsheviki .

		When you go to one of
Mary Shaw	PERSON	's periodic revivals of `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Pro- fession , '' such as she is now giving in
New York	LOCATION	with the aid of the
Washington	LOCATION	Square Players , you remember that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	wrote it just a quarter of a century ago , and you are ready to display at least a little antiquarian curiosity over passages like Sir
George Croft	PERSON	's defense of his partnership with Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	: Why the devil should n't I invest my money that way ?

		I take the interest on my capital like other people : I hope you do n't think I dirty my own hands with the work .

		Come : you would n't refuse the acquaintance of my mother 's cousin , the Duke of
Belgravia	LOCATION	, because some of the rents he gets are earned in queer ways .

		You would n't cut the Archbishop of
Canterbury	LOCATION	, I suppose , because the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	have a few publi - cans and sinners among their tenants ?

		Do you remember your Crofts Scholarship at Newnham ?

		Well , that was founded by my brother the M. P .

		He gets his twenty-two per cent out of a factory with 600 girls in it , and not one of them getting enough to live on .

		How d'ye suppose most of them manage ?

		Ask your mother .

		And do you expect me to turn back on thirty-five per cent when all the rest are pocketing what they can , like sensible men ?

		It is no easier to be moved when Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	assures the twentieth century through `` Why Marry ? ''

		that cer - tain people are wrong in thinking that sex is evil , or that work is rewarded in inverse ratio to its usefulness to society .

		It is even a bit difficult to credit Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liams with cleverness when he urges a defender of the wedding ring as `` only a symbol , '' not to `` insult the woman you love even symbolically . ''

		And when , in the face of the conductor ettes , he expects us to worry about a young lady who bemoans the fact that she is `` following the only pro- fession you 've allowed me to learn mar - riage , '' even the most stalwart pillar of playhouse progress must crack under the strain .

		Likewise Mr.
Miles Malleson	PERSON	, author of `` Youth , '' which preceded `` Mrs. War - ren '' at the Comedy .

		He is more in the good old artist-philosopher strain than Mr.
Williams	PERSON	.

		He has hold of his prob - lem .

		He is n't swinging it in circles round his head like a dead cat on a string .

		And he writes with enthusiasm , even beauty .

		Yet the interesting psychological fact re - mains that it is a bit hard to get excited over things like : A wife is terribly often a married-lady-in-a drawing-room , worn out doing nothing or a married-woman-in-a-kitchen , worn out doing too much ; according to the income of her owner ... Why do you suppose men wink so pleasantly at one another over their own little love affairs , and ca n't find words bad enough for the woman who loves outside her wedding ring ?

		... A wife is the last word in private property ... and that is always a curse ... When the sky is privately owned , some large firm will charge to view the sunset !

		We might as well admit that as talk this is `` old hat '' like everything else we hear in `` plays with a purpose . ''

		If it were carried out in action either in the theatre or in life it would be a little better .

		Both plays might , indeed , have carried us back to some of the fascination of `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' if the playwrights could have seen their themes through with half the resolute enthusiasm that they bestowed on digging up their talk .

		For if both plays are full of `` old hat '' sentiments , they are both written on a thoroughly `` new hat '' sub - ject .

		They both wonder if marriage in the legal sense is good for young people .

		But `` Why Marry ? ''

		never gets any nearer 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	a reason than the false supposition that it is impossible for a couple of young scientists to marry when , one can earn
$ 2000	MONEY	a year and the other
$ 900	MONEY	, and bewilderingly and amusingly chases its tail round that supposition ; while `` Youth '' forgets some excellent doubts that it raises of a young man 's ability to pick a per - manent mate when flushed with youth 's passional curiosity , and backs its two culprits off in a couple of corners to wait a few weeks while the young man makes up a mind which , according to the first two acts , he has been consistently and rightly unable to make up because of the very essence of the problem .

		After all , can this talky-talky business be `` good theatre '' in any but three ways : if it is as thoroughgoing as `` Getting Mar - ried '' absolutely artificial in its elimina - tion of emotional violence ; if it is so handled by an impossible master-drama - tist which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is every now and then that the perfection of the product alone fascinates ; or if somebody chucks all the talk overboard and tells us our modern `` problem story '' in the plain terms of inarticulate human beings and their ac - tions ?

		A man named
Mclntyre	PERSON	once did it in a week 's - run failure called `` Steve , '' and Mr.
Cohan	PERSON	may do it one of these days .

		I am naturally tempted to end with the announcement that only such an eventual - ity will save the theatre from `` Sumurun '' and Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		But it happens that the theatre is rapidly getting old enough to be all things to all men .

		There was a day when a poem was an epic , and another when a book was only a book when Homer cast lyrics under the striding feet of war , and
Bunyan	PERSON	thought he was writing some sort of theological tome when he was making the first English novel .

		The theatre is still a little in that mood .

		But it is no great effort to imagine that when the
Great Peace	ORGANIZATION	has shaken us up a dozen times as thoroughly as the Great War has yet done , our plays may be as full of the fine thrilling variety of life as our prose and poetry today .

		Then those of us who want
Theda Bara	PERSON	and
Charlie Chaplin	PERSON	wed in the guise of `` Sumurun , '' and those of us who like to worry about Youth , will all be satisfied .

		But it is also safe to say that Youth will sing a rather different tune .


KENNETH MACGOWAN	PERSON	.

		* A Gossip on
James Branch Cabell	PERSON	One of the prerogatives of genius , as distinguished from eminent ability or even positive greatness , is the entire impunity with which it refuses to live `` in character . ''

		Everything that living in character has de - manded of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	as a man , he has done in his books as an author and there only .

		There could be no more clinching objection to some widely trusted fashions .

		of deducing an author 's works from his life and then turning about to deduce his life from his works .

		At the same time there could be no more clinching demon - stration that an author 's works are the quintessence of his reality , reducing his life and all else to flat irrelevance .

		The real - ity of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	is jongleur , trickster `` Toy-Maker , '' as he has it in the title of a poem .

		The creator of
Nicolas de Caen	ORGANIZATION	and of
Horvendile	LOCATION	, refusing to play his part out in life , has no license in aesthetics to live at all .

		He should write unhandi - capped by existence , and make his name a legend , so that those who dispute whether his tales are true must also dispute whether their author ever lived .

		He should be an Ossian without any
Macpherson	PERSON	to embar - rass his aesthetic consistency , a jongleur without a genealogist tagging at his heels .

		Time would fail me to set down in any detail the respects in which Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	is the most resourceful jongleur of his trade .

		But at least I may signify how some of the most dexterous of his contrivances involve the name of

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 393 Love , '' Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	invented
Nicolas	PERSON	out - right as the probable author of the first tale , `` Adhelmar at Puysange . ''

		The orig - inal manuscript , `` Les Aventures d' Adhel - mar de Nointel , '' exists `` in an out-of-the - way corner of the library at
Allonby Shaw	ORGANIZATION	'' the library , presumably , of the family of that
Stephen Allonby	PERSON	, later
Marquis	PERSON	of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, who may be met as hero of the seventh tale .


Nicolas de Caen	PERSON	, to whom this manuscript is attributed , `` though on no very conclusive evidence , '' is `` better known as a lyric poet and satirist -LRB- circa 1450 -RRB- . ''

		In the epilogue to `` The Line of Love '' it is noted that ``
Nicolas de Caen	PERSON	as yet lacks an English editor for his ` Roman de
Lusignan	PERSON	' and his curious ` Dizain des
Reines	PERSON	' those not unhand - some pieces , latterly included and anno - tated in the `
Bibliotheca Abscondita	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		Finding
Nicolas	PERSON	accepted at his face value , Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	subsequently evolved the books to fit this hinted promise : the `` Dizain des Reines '' is Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's `` Chivalry '' ; and the `` Roman de
Lusignan	PERSON	, '' for which `` our sole authority ... must continue to be the fragmentary MS. No. 503 in the Allonbian Collection , '' is `` The Soul of Melicent . ''

		It is interesting to note that the poem `` A son Livret , '' which ends
Nicolas	PERSON	's epilogue to `` Chivalry , '' is also the first piece in Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's volume of verses , `` From the Hidden Way '' ; which detail is one among a thousand hints of the elvish magic whereby this author makes all his books conspire together to evoke in you a dreamlike and excited won - der how it happens that you have read them before .

		`` From the Hidden Way '' contains also many another `` adaptation '' from
Nicolas	PERSON	, as well as from his com - peers Raimbaut de Vaqueiras ,
Antoine Riczi	PERSON	,
Theodore Passerat	PERSON	, and several more , all of whose existences are estab - lished in a preface which contains some of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's most admirable fine fooling .

		Few there have been to question the his - toricity of these singers so little `` likely ever to cut a dash in popular romance . ''

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	is rumored on impressive au - thority to prize a letter from
Caen	ORGANIZATION	, where a committee organizing to honor their `` distinguished ex-townsman '' with a me - morial of some sort could find nothing about him in the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	.

		And many a reviewer including the one most redoubtable arbiter elegantiarum among poetic cults , an industrious antholo - gist who presides , a sort of professional omniscience , over the chaos of the newer modes intimated his own casual familiar - ity with the `` originals '' of the verses in `` From the Hidden Way , '' heedless quite of the prefatory admonition : `` Vous enten - dez bien joncherie ? ''

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	must have done , first and last , a deal of chuck - ling over such evidences of his ambidex - terity .

		But I think his greatest debt to
Nicolas de Caen	PERSON	is that worthy 's suggestion of the `` dizain . ''

		For it seems to me that we must seek Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's richest deposits in the four volumes which work out that sugges - tion : in `` Gallantry '' his `` Dizain des Fetes Galantes , '' in `` Chivalry '' his `` Dizain des
Reines	PERSON	, '' in `` The Certain Hour '' his `` Dizain des Poetes , '' and in `` The Line of Love , '' which would be his `` Dizain des Manages '' if he had only thought then of `` the decimal system of composition . ''

		These four , together with `` The Soul of Melicent , '' are purest distillate of
Cabell	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the title of the one dizain of tales casually ascribed to
Nicolas	PERSON	lies the germ of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's quintessential product the sequence of stories unified , not by re - peating the persons , nor yet by enclosing the episodes in one frame of place or period , but by making them illustrational of a common motif , a common acceptance of life .

		`` The Line of Love '' is a geneal - ogy of pairs of lovers tricked by fate into each others ' arms without the romantic prerequisite of a passion shared ; `` Chiv - alry '' is a sequence of studies of the code whose root is `` the assumption ... that a gentleman will serve his God , his honor , and his lady without any reserva - tion '' ; `` Gallantry '' presents in ten `` come - dies '' that Chesterfieldian attitude whose secret was `` to accept the pleasures of life leisurely and its inconveniences with a shrug '' ; and `` The Certain Hour '' is a ten - fold embodiment of the imaginative art - ist 's temperament in its characteristic dilemma of art against human love .

		These tales have individually , I like to repeat from an earlier comment , the vibrancy and the quick vision of the best dramatic mono - logues of
Browning	PERSON	; and for that we make 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	acknowledgment to the author alone .

		But for the shapely continuity of the volumes that contain them I think Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	owes something to that creature of his own de - vising ,
Messire Nicolas de Caen	ORGANIZATION	.

		This extension of jonglerie from the materials into the whole shape and super - structure of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's art is proof enough that the starting-point for appre - ciation is at his inestimable gift for hocus - pocus .

		But this extension is not the end .

		He no sooner perpetrates the jest than he makes a philosophy of it .

		His little world in which the artist is a jester at the expense of the gullible is only one convolution of the greater cosmos in which life is an in - scrutable jester at the expense of us all , including the artist himself .

		``
Heine	PERSON	was right ; there is an Aristophanes in heaven , ''
Robert Etheridge Townsend	PERSON	is overheard to murmur on more than one ironic con - tretemps in `` The Cords of Vanity '' ; and it is but a minor point in the consistency of a universe framed on the jesting principle that there should also be an Aristophanes in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	moves , and is our guide , in a world of `` supernal double-deal - ing . ''

		`` All available analogues , '' reflected
Felix Kennaston	PERSON	in `` The Cream of the Jest , '' `` went to show that nothing in nature dealt with its inferiors candidly '' ; and `` everywhere ... men had labored blindly , at flat odds with rationality , and had achieved everything of note by acci - dent . ''

		It is this same
Kennaston	PERSON	, lately redi - vivus in `` The Cream of the Jest , '' more than a decade after his first appearance in `` The Eagle 's Shadow , '' who makes this philosophy explicit .

		We meet
Kennaston	PERSON	in the midst of a medieval tale which he has himself written , playing in a dream the part of one of his own characters , yet re - membering his twentieth-century identity and vainly trying to persuade the others that they are but puppets of his making and that he alone is real .

		To them he is only the half-insane clerk
Horvendile	PERSON	, and in despair at their incredulity he is driven to reflect : `` It may be that I , too , am only a figment of some greater dream , in just such case as yours , and that I , too , can not under - stand .

		It may be the very cream of the jest that my country is no more real than
Storisende	PERSON	.

		How could I judge if I , too , were a puppet ? ''

		All that happens to him happens `` haphazardly ... in some three pounds of fibrous matter tucked in - side his skull '' ; what , then , is to certify his touch with any objective reality at all ?

		Kennaston , awake and sane in the twen - tieth century , publishes his tale , achieves some eminence , a fortune , social position , a wife whom he is fond of .

		But life con - tinues to mock him .

		He finds half of a broken metal disc covered with strange hieroglyphics , a talisman with which `` the Wardens of Earth unbar strange win - dows . ''

		Hypnotized by its glitter , he escapes more and more gladly out of his hum-drum existence of a prospering and respectable citizen into a world of queerly inconsecutive dream-episodes in - cidentally , they bear a distorted resem - blance to certain of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's earlier tales in which he rejoins for fleeting mo - ments the ageless woman Ettarre .

		These parentheses rapidly become the real con - `` text of his life , and all the rest mere inter - lude ; and in the gaps he wonders `` how this dull fellow seated here in this lux - urious room '' can actually be
Felix Ken	PERSON	- naston .

		Yet even in his dreams life mocked him ; for if he touched Ettarre `` the dream ended , and the universe seemed to fold about him , just as a hand closes . ''

		And , crowning mockery , it trans - pires that his `` talisman '' is but a meaning - less fragment of the cover of a cold cream jar .

		`` Many thousand husbands may find at will among their wives ' possessions just such a talisman as
Kennaston	LOCATION	had discov - ered . ''

		Also , they may find in their wives , the story hints , just such glimpses of Ettarre the ageless woman as Kennaston saw in
Kathleen	PERSON	on the occasion of his dis - covering the other half of the disc on her dressing-table .

		For the upshot of the whole matter is that
Kennaston	PERSON	is every man , and Ettarre the ageless woman of every man 's worship , wholly seen o-f no man save in dreams , yet obscurely prisoned in the flesh of every woman born .

		Succinctly , then ,
Cabell	PERSON	is the comedist of those two beings who wear the flesh of every body of the idealist lover and the earth-bound respectable citizen who ten - ant the same clay .

		All his tales are in some sort `` the song of the double-soul , dis - tortedly two in one . ''

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 395 Thus two by two we wrangle and blunder about the earth , And that body we share we may not spare ; but the gods have need of mirth .

		It is the secret idealist in each of us that mainly interests Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	; for , he seems everywhere to be saying , it is only the one best part of us which is real at all .

		The gods have their jest by yoking us unequally with ourselves ; but there is for every man one way to cheat the jest of half its point , if only he can find the way .

		And what , ultimately , is Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's sense of this way to high individual ad - venture ?

		It is wholly characteristic of him that whatever guidance he offers is the guidance of an artist , never of a moralist .

		His one inclusive and continuous interest is in the artistic or poetizing temper a nar - row enough interest in seeming , when so phrased , but expanded by his tacit defini - tion until it is not only the centre , but also the circumference , of everything .

		The duality of his world is essentially that of the artistic against the mediocre ; for the essential part of every being , the one part that can turn the single life from a sorry jest into a brave spectacle , is the poetic .

		The artist in each man requires that he give up every cherished thing for the sake of one thing cherished most .

		Under this tyranny the lover , the fighter , the chival - rous gentleman , the quixotic fool , the art - ist in words , all sacrifice everything to their own kinds of self-completion ; for self-com - pletion is the law , and attainment of it the only success .

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's ideal of success is to reach the consummation of this some - thing central in one 's self , and incidentally to miss everything else that one might have had .

		His ideal of heroism is to sacrifice all for one 's own kind of perfection and then fail to gain even that , for this is the one kind of failure that has moral dignity enough to be tragic .

		He is at heart , then , a prophet of that austere aesthetic doctrine , the single-mind - edness of the artist .

		He has made up his mind , it seems , to the tragic disparity which condemns the perfect writer to be a wretched bungler at the art of living , the perfect lover a fool in relation to all affairs save those of the heart , and the man of executive might always `` more or less men - tally deficient . ''

		To be perfectly one - self means to miss being everybody else .

		Whence Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's two recurrent char - acters : the artist lover who is an inferior citizen , and the writing artist who is an in - ferior lover .

		His tales are populated with lovers who must say with
Antoine Riczi	PERSON	: `` Love leads us , and through the sunlight of the world he leads us , and through the filth of it Love leads us , but always in the end , if we but follow without swerving , he leads upward .

		Yet , O God upon the Cross !

		Thou that in the article of death didst pardon Dysmas !

		as what maimed warriors of life , as what bemired travellers in muddied byways , must we presently come to Thee ! ''

		And the tales are filled too with those of whom `` life claims nothing very insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful happenings . ''

		These , and the ageless woman by whichever name known , make up his trinity .

		His lovers are great enough artists to find the ageless woman in the human mistress ; his writers are great enough artists to break faith with the human mistress because they can find the ageless woman only in dreams .

		His great - est lovers are various sorts of fools , outlaws , and failures generally ; and his writing men , from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Villon to
Robert Etheridge Townsend	PERSON	and
John Charteris	PERSON	and
Kennaston	PERSON	, are irresponsible hedonists in love .

		It is said of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	in a high quarter that `` he has done quite the most distin - guished romance-writing except Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's very best published in this country during the last twenty-five years . ''

		To my mind this is a little like saying that Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has written quite the most distinguished realistic novels except Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's very best .

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	has doubtless made up his mind to be praised often by the faint damnation of critics who think him almost as great as his inferiors , such as Miss
Johnston	PERSON	and Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	; but one wonders with what equanimity he hears himself dismissed as an innocent romancer who , tired of his trade , has made a few excursions into real - ism , as in `` The Cords of Vanity '' and `` The Rivet in Grandfather 's Neck . ''

		Under whatever trappings of period , cir - cumstance , or code , his work is one in pur - pose and in meaning and the meaning is as realistic in `` The Soul of Melicent '' as in `` The Rivet . ''

		All his work alike is expression of a duality which is in essence realistic the duality , not of the world and 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	the individual , but of the individual within himself .

		Always , even in his one vapidly frivolous book , `` The Eagle 's Shadow , '' he has written of `` the thing one can not do for the reason that one is constituted as one is , '' which is `` the real rivet in grandfath - er 's neck and everybody else 's . ''

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	is a romancer only by the most superficial of all the distinctions that can be drawn .

		Basically , he is a realist without the astigmatism of the localist and the modernist , and without their expert and industrious provision for a quick oblivion .

		He is the realist of the realities which have nothing to say to fashion and change , and his momentary function among us is to reconstitute that higher realism which is the only true romance .

		That he should have got himself accepted to right and left as `` only the idle singer of an empty day '' is perhaps the cream of his own prolonged and elaborate personal jest .

		So at least we may agree to call it unless it should pres - ently transpire that his three goodly vol - umes of genealogy are his sole essays in fiction , and his tales true pages of authentic history .

		This impish inversion , cunningly planned for the subtler fun of watching the clever folk go wrong because of their clev - erness and the stupid folk go right because of their stupidity , would be less Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's self-contradiction than his
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanic crown .

FLORENCE KIPER FRANK	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was not of course to be supposed that Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's charming and vivacious , if sometimes over reticent , portrait of Swin - burne would remain forever unchallenged .

		The counterblast has come , whence it might have been expected , from two members of the
Watts	LOCATION	-
Dunton	PERSON	circle , in a volume entitled `` The Letters of
Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	, with Some Personal Recollections , '' by
Thomas Hake	PERSON	and
Arthur Compton-Rickett	PERSON	-LRB-
John Murray	PERSON	, Lon - don , 10/6 -RRB- .

		It may be said at once that the counterblast takes a singularly gentle and court - eous form and that there is no trace of any desire on the part of the authors to begin one of those gigantic literary quarrels which Swin - burne himself found so pleasant .

		They only remark in their introduction that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is not altogether fair in his account of Swin - burne 's later life , and they protest against his estimate of
Watts-Dunton	ORGANIZATION	's influence .

		In the body of their book they certainly endeavor to present
Swinburne	PERSON	's years of retirement at the
Pines	ORGANIZATION	in as cheerful a light as possible ; but they are far from being quarrelsome and , except in one very slight instance , they do not contradict Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in matters of fact .

		From this point of view the book is a model of restraint and literary good manners .

		It is even I am bound to con - fess , remembering the leanings of its subject a little disappointing .

		But taken as a whole it can not be compared with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's study ; nor is it very good regarded by itself , without any comparison .

		The title is somewhat misleading .

		Only a com - paratively small number of letters are quoted and the book does not cover the whole of Swin - burne 's life or even , with any sort of complete - ness , any one period of his life .

		It looks very much , in fact , as though the authors had at their disposal a quite fortuitously selected heap of letters , out of which they made as good a book as they could .

		They do not seem to have made any use of Mr.
T. J. Wise	PERSON	's privately printed collection , and it is obvious that before we can fully judge
Swinburne	PERSON	as a letter-writer we must wait for the volume which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has an - nounced .

		But such letters as are given here are extremely interesting and whet one 's appetite for a larger and fuller book .

		Swinburne is not likely to be placed in the very first rank of letter-writers for just the same reason that keeps him out of the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 397 first rank of poets .

		He was far too much interested in literature and far too little interested in life .

		It may be objected that nearly all the most entertaining letter-writers write a good deal about literature and that some of the best letters in the world are bookish letters .

		But
Swinburne	PERSON	's curse was that he completely con - fused literature and life .

		He looked at life through literature , and when he was confronted with a new fact or a new personality he promptly made up some more literature through which to regard it .

		All his passions , his republicanism , his enthusiasm for
Italy	LOCATION	a country he hardly knew were self-hypnotisms based on poetical conventions .

		This unfortunate characteristic makes many of his letters as unreal as much of his poetry ; but they are still readable and good , and they are always extremely like their author .

		Some of the best are those in which
Swinburne	PERSON	, in a mixture of ecstasy , humility , and critical precision , advises
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	on the changes to be made in the proof-sheets of his forthcoming volume of poems .

		The opinions are sometimes characteristically extravagant , as when he says : Of the sonnets gathered up together in the book , I can only say I am always in an equal wonder at their overrunning wealth of thought and phrase , clothed and set in such absolutely impeccable and inevitable perfection of expressive form .

		Swinburne 's likes and dislikes were generally pretty irrational ; and when he liked a thing he had as a rule only a rich , but never a very pre - cise or enlightening , vocabulary of praise .

		When he disliked , or liked only faintly or reluctantly , he was often much closer in his expression .

		Thus , in the same letter , he defines the faults of
Morris	PERSON	's `` Earthly Paradise '' very clearly : I have just received
Topsy	ORGANIZATION	's book : the
Oudrun	PERSON	story is excellently told , I can see , and of keen interest , but I find generally no change in the trailing style of work .

		His Muse is like Homer 's Trojan women ; she drags her robes as she walks .

		I really think any Muse -LRB- when she is neither resting or flying -RRB- ought to tighten her girdle , tuck up her skirts , and step out .

		It is better than
Tennyson	PERSON	's short-winded and artificial concision but there is such a thing as swift and spontaneous strife .

		Top 's is spontaneous and slow ; and , especially , my ear hungers for more force and variety of sound in the verse .

		It looks as if he purposely avoided all strenuous emotion or strength of music in thought and word ; and so , when set by other work as good , his work seems hardly done in thorough earnest .

		This is sound and illuminating ; and perhaps the best that can be said of these letters is that they give the ardency and occasional good sense of
Swinburne	LOCATION	's literary criticism without , as a rule , the luxuriant verbiage and high-pitched super - latives of his set essays .

		If they are to be taken as pieces of self-revelation there is nothing in them so pathetic or so enlightening as this , in a letter to Watts-Dunton :
Chatto	PERSON	has not sent a single weekly newspaper to order ; they should all have been here by nine
this morning	TIME	.

		On second thoughts , to prevent any con - fusion of my own with my mother 's account , I shall not order the `` Pall Mall '' of the people who supply her with journals , but order it straight from the office , subscribing for three or six months .

		Will you kindly draw up and forward me a proper business - like order to that effect , and let me know if , and how much , I ought to pay in advance , a task which you , perhaps , would undertake for me , and I could send you a cheque for the amount as soon as you can get and send me a cheque book ?

		This heart-rending paragraph raises at once , in a most uncompromising form , the question whether
Swinburne	PERSON	was right in submitting himself to the protection and guardianship of Watts-Dunton .

		And , personally , I have no hestitation what - ever in replying that the authors of this book are right and that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, with all his sympathy and brilliance , is wrong .

		The ques - tion was whether the amazing and magnificent youthful
Swinburne	PERSON	, whose incredibly dissolute habits we are all so afraid of mentioning , should dissolve altogether or should consent to an order - ing of his life that would prolong it but would certainly rob it of all its magnificence .

		There seems to have been no alternative between a somewhat tamed and faded poet and a dead , or at the very best an insane , poet .

		I do not think the faded poet who lived at the
Pines	ORGANIZATION	was really of very much interest to the world ; but then neither would a poet dead or mad have been .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, I fancy , is led astray by his feeling for composition .

		That ` long and terrible anti- climax offends his artistic instincts , and a Swin - burne either dying horribly or shut up in a mad - house would have made a much more effective close to the story .

		I do not mean that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has thought all this out so brutally , or even consciously at all ; but I think these must be the sub-conscious considerations which have affected his judgment .

		Of course some other person might have been found for the job of guardian .

		Watts-Dunton was an excessively dull novelist and poet , and a critic more magisterial than sympathetic ; but , after all ,
Swinburne	PERSON	probably wanted to live and retain his reason .

		Watts-Dunton managed that for him in a very 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	effective way and may be forgiven for his poems and novels .

		Swinburne is still by way of being a mystery and I may be excused for taking up so much space with anything that throws a little new light on him .

		But I wish I had left myself a little more for dealing with Mr.
Bertrand Rus	PERSON	- sell 's new book , `` Mysticism and Logic '' -LRB- Long - mans , Green ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The other day , when I was reading the literary column of a weekly paper , I was a little astonished to see that the writer , in opposing ' the view that we have today no first-class prose writers , mentioned Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell as an instance to the contrary .

		But the more I thought of it the more I began to believe he was right ; and `` Mysticism and Logic '' has been quite e ` nough to settle my doubts .

		My hesitation was caused by the fact that one thinks first of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	as a mathematical philosopher of extraordinary profundity , part-author of the great `` Principia Mathematica , '' of which it has been said that only eighty-seven persons in the world can understand it and that this number does not include both the authors .

		But he is more besides .

		He is a writer .

		who can popular - ize philosophy , even mathematical philosophy , without making it vulgar or becoming himself condescending ; and he can write nobly and greatly in a manner intelligible to the laity with - out ever seeming to stoop to their level .

		`` Mysticism and Logic '' contains so much wit and handles difficult matters so lightly and adroitly that at first the temptation to use an easy cliche and call Mr.
Russell	PERSON	a `` Laughing Philosopher '' is almost overwhelming .

		But then one turns over the pages and comes on this pas - sage : That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving ; that his origin , his growth , his hopes and fears , his loves and his beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms ; that no fire , no heroism , no intensity of thought and feeling can preserve an individual life beyond the grave ; that all the labours of the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system , and that the whole temple of man 's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins all these things , if not quite beyond dispute , are yet so nearly certain , that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand .

		Only within the scaffolding of these truths , only on the firm founda - tion of unyielding despair , can the soul 's habitation henceforth be safely built .

		This is not comfortable doctrine , but it is nobly expressed ; and the essay from which it is taken , `` A Free Man 's Worship , '' is one of the finest pieces of philosophical writing of modern times .

		In general recent philosophy has either been of a highly technical order -LRB- like
Croce	PERSON	's -RRB- or has leaned towards the popularity of the salon and the lecture-room , more anxious to be striking and up-to-date than to be elevating and profound -LRB- like
Bergson	PERSON	's -RRB- .

		Philosophy was tending to dis - appear in two directions from the survey of the ordinary , unspecialized , but cultured man , who was left to nourish his soul on poetry alone .

		Now again , perhaps , if he has courage to face Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's frightful universe and to extract from it the lessons of courage and exaltation which Mr.
Russell	PERSON	extracts , he can say : How charming is divine philosophy !

		Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose But musical as is Apollo 's lute .

		In conclusion I must mention not a book but an incident or an affair .

		One ought to begin : `` All
London	LOCATION	has been talking .

		.

		; * ' But pre - cisely what bothers me is that
London	LOCATION	has been doing nothing of the kind .

		A certain gentleman , a Mr.
Austin Fryers	PERSON	, has produced on the stage of the Court Theatre a play called `` Realities , '' which , he says , was written by
Ibsen	PERSON	as a sequel to `` Ghosts . ''

		Now Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's English publisher , to whom apparently Mr.
Fry	PERSON	- ers offered the copyright of this piece , produces a letter from Dr.
Sigurd Ibsen	PERSON	, the son of the dramatist , to the effect that his father never wrote any such play .

		Moreover the Norwegian original of the piece , it seems , is not forthcom - ing only the English translation .

		However , it has been performed .

		I do not know whether it is of Ibsen or not .

		Oswald is recovered , Mrs.
Alving	PERSON	is paralyzed ,
Oswald	PERSON	is still in love with
Regina	PERSON	and uses drugs to back up the effects of his blandishments but no !

		I do not think it is by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The odd thing is that no one seems to care , and this perplexes me .

		Of two things , one : either an impudent fraud has been attempted on the English public , or an unknown play of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's maturity has been discovered .

		But , I say again in my bewilderment , no one seems to care ; and the critics rather lackadaisically discuss three possible solutions : -LRB- a -RRB- that it is all Ibsen ; -LRB- b -RRB- that it is all Fryers ; -LRB- c -RRB- that it is some of each .

		The truth is , I suppose , that
Ibsen	PERSON	is a little out of .

		fashion at the moment ; and this must be very disappointing to Mr.
Fryers	PERSON	, whoever wrote the play .

		However it is too late for him now to fasten the thing on to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

London	LOCATION	,
April 6 , 1918	DATE	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 399 The Voice of Reason THE AIMS OF LABOUR .

		By
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	,
M. P.	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	.


Huebsch	PERSON	; 50 cts .

		Here is a pamphlet of some eighty-two pages by Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, to which is appended the `` Memorandum on War Aims '' of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, together with that remarkable document on reconstruction , `` Labour and the New Social Order '' only a hundred odd printed pages in all .

		Yet in this small compass are contained the most explicit and illuminating answers to those questions which the war has compelled every one of us , hopefully or despair - ingly , to ask .

		If we would know the purpose and meaning of the democratic forces which the conflict has summoned even while , for the time being , it has ruthlessly crushed their outward manifestation , that knowledge is here ; if we are eager to discover on what terms and until what point the war ought to continue , the answer is here ; if we sometimes wonder about what kind of programme must be followed in the coming strange days of peace , if we are to avoid disaster in an impoverished and exhausted world , that programme , in specific as well as general terms , is presented to us here .

		All the complexities and cross-purposes that Entente diplomacy has fum - blingly and palteringly bickered over , being either afraid or unwilling to bring them into the open light of common discussion , are here frankly envisaged .

		The
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	does not flinch from the most `` delicate '' questions of the hushed-voice diplomacy , which can not even yet wholly free itself from the nineteenth-century tradition of back-stairs pourparlers .

		The break is complete and final with that kind of conventional foreign - office method which regards the representative chamber as a mere audience hall where the tri - umphs of secret negotiations can be eloquently exposed or the not-to-be-hidden failures gracefully explained away .

		Every card is laid on the table , and although the discussion is tactful , the claims of the feelings of diplomats are not regarded as more urgent than the demand for a more decent world from the millions who have suf - fered all things to bring it into existence .

		For example , the legitimate aspirations of
Italy	LOCATION	are unhesitatingly supported , but the flavor of im - perialistic ambition in other Italian claims is as unhesitatingly condemned .

		Similarly ,
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	is treated , as it ought all along to have been treated , as an international question , not as a private property problem of either
Germany	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	.

		The vexed problems of the
Balkans	LOCATION	and of the African colonies are , with a con - sistency that never loses touch with the facts , freely recommended to the decision of an inter - national commission acting under the authority of that league of nations which it is the business of this war to make practicable .

		The
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	's hostile attitude toward an economic `` war after the war '' and its placing of complete repara - tion of
Belgium	LOCATION	as the sine qua non of even discussion of peace do not need elaboration .

		The point is , nothing has been left to a mere general declaration of good intentions .

		The outline is full and detailed .

		No one can read this document and fail to see that it is the most uncompromising programme for an acceptable peace yet proposed .

		The corner stone of the entire scheme , of course , is the proposed league of nations .

		But it is precisely the surrender of , complete national sovereignty implicit in any league of nations which runs counter to the whole purpose and philosophy of
Germany	LOCATION	's world politics .

		Only a defeated or a revolutionized
Germany	LOCATION	can be a trustworthy partner in any such league as the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	proposes .

		Even what is conventionally called `` victory '' will not satisfy it .

		`` Any victory , '' writes Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, `` however spec - tacular and dramatic in a military sense it may be , which falls short of the realization of the ideals with which we entered the war , will not be a victory but a defeat .

		We strive for victory be - cause we want to end war altogether , not merely to prove the superiority of British arms over those of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		We continue the struggle , dreadful though the cost of it has become , be - cause we have to enforce reparation for a great wrong perpetrated upon a small unoffending nation , to liberate subject peoples and enable them to live under a form of government of their own choosing , and to destroy , not a great nation , but a militarist autocracy which had de - liberately planned war without considering the in - terests either of their own people or of the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean Commonwealth of which they are a part . ''

		Yet in the face of such assertions it is the solemn truth that
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	has been described as a person of `` pacifist '' tendencies by people who really ought to have known bet - ter .

		Perhaps the myth arose from his resigna - tion from the
Lloyd George	PERSON	cabinet when he disagreed with the Premier over the advisabil - ity of sending delegates to the international con - ference of labor and socialists , called by the 400
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 25	DATE	Russians .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is content to leave the judgment upon the merits of that controversy to history , but his growing leadership in interna - tional affairs indicates that perhaps a large part of the contemporary world of labor has already judged .

		He stands today as the most consistent , the most fearless , and the most powerful advo - cate of a moral victory over German and every other imperialism .

		It is no accident that his hopes , and the hopes of those for whom he speaks , receive their greatest encouragement from the policies and aims enunciated by President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		Now what does it mean this clarity and con - ciseness from an unofficial body ?

		Since Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book was written the programme he advocates has been adopted by inter-Allied labor , and the visiting delegates of American labor , according to recent dispatches from
London	LOCATION	, announce themselves as sympathetic .

		In brief , the whole drift of events shows that if governments will not of themselves officially present a common diplomatic front to the enemy , the peoples will do it unofficially and without invitation .

		Already they are making the abolishment of secret diplom - acy more than an unctuous phrase here is a clear instance of open pragmatic diplomacy in action .

		Bit by bit the whole rotten structure of interna - tional intrigue , as we knew it before the war , is being destroyed .

		Conventional diplomacy has shown itself bankrupt , and the peoples are appointing their own receivers `` the people will not choose to entrust their destinies at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	to statesmen who have not perceived the moral significance of the struggle , and who are not prepared to make a people 's peace . ''

		In this pamphlet Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	makes his eloquent plea for preparation for a people 's peace even in war time .

		It is a plea written with admirable good temper and good sense .

		The war has raised so many problems that it is a kind of psychological self-protection to fall back on the mechanical theory of progress that preparation for a new world goes on while we sleep , and that a finer social order somehow inheres in the mere end of hostilities .

		Our own political think - , ing , for instance , is so dominated by the legalistic tradition , which can not even imaginatively envis - age any other political entities than the sovereign national state , that our press is quite content with what one might call the automatic slot machine theory of war and peace .

		The theory is : you put in the penny of a military victory and automat - ically pull out the gum of a perfect peace and a happy world .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	puts the criminal folly of this attitude in a few words : `` The out - standing facts of world politics at the present time and when peace comes this fact will be made still more clear is that a great tide of revolutionary feeling is rising in every country . ''

		The reactionaries are tragically deceiving them - selves if they imagine that the present unchal - lenging submission of the peoples to all sorts of restriction upon freedom is an earnest of the temper with which they will face the problems of reconstruction .

		Of course Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	does not believe in violent revolution ; the whole bent of the English mind is towards constitutional and orderly change .

		Organized revolution in the continental sense is not part of
England	LOCATION	's historic background ; her people do not plan dramatic and sudden coups d'etat .

		But , as Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	points out , they `` are capable of vigorous action , of persistent and steady agitation year in and year out , of stubborn and resolute pressure against which nothing can stand . ''

		Our own gusty and sporadic methods of political agitation might learn with considerable profit from this even , stubborn temper of the British .

		In any modern highly organized industrial democracy the people stand to lose almost as much as they gain by resorting to the barricade and the red flag .

		It is just the prosaic problem of production ; a decent social order is not the flower of that impoverish - ment which inevitably arises when the whole machinery of production is thrown askew .

		Yet the decision as to whether reconstruction is to be a violent or peaceful affair does not , after all , rest with the democracies .

		It rests with the small powerful cliques that control the ma - chinery of the modern state .

		A mere restoration of the capitalistic regime which the war has dis - credited and in large part destroyed will not be tolerated , not even in
Germany	LOCATION	; for as Mr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson says with such fine dispassion , `` conscience and reason do not end upon the frontiers of
Central Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		In a word , when the war is over and democracy has defeated its foreign enemies , it will know how to defeat its domestic enemies .

		That domestic victory will come either through peaceable means or direct assault , but the decision as to which method shall be followed depends upon the reasonableness of those in con - trol .

		They can not too early begin to cultivate the mood whereby they can gracefully relinquish power .

		For only in an atmosphere of rational accommodation can peace , when finally it does come , be in very truth a jewel without price .

		Mr.

		The little essays of this little book are his own second blooming , presumably .

		They are a little forced , and will fade early .

		He seems , himself , to think them rather daring .

		`` I will affront the condemnatory vagueness of wool and fleecy cloud . ''

		I knew a lady once , intelligent and of uncertain age , who confessed that to use the word `` harlot '' always gave her a certain thrill .

		I should say Mr.
George	PERSON	's essays affected him in the same fashion .

		As a matter of fact they are most agreeably genteel .

		Novelists , Mr.

		That the `` literary chapters '' were composed chiefly for American consumption is steadily evident , not only in the use of the pronoun `` you '' whenever

		A Swiss View of ff ^ illiam James THE PHILOSOPHY OF WILLIAM JAMES .

		By
Thomas Flournoy	PERSON	.

		Authorized translation by
Edwin B. Holt	PERSON	and
William James	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Holt ;
$ 1.30	MONEY	.

		In the
spring of 1910	DATE	William
James	PERSON	went abroad to seek relief from the growing heart - trouble which , in the
summer	DATE	of the same year , killed him .

		The president of
the Association Chretienne Suisse d'Etudiants	ORGANIZATION	, learning of the philosopher 's presence in
Europe	LOCATION	, invited him to address the association at its meeting in
St. Croix	LOCATION	.

		He agreed to do so , his health permit - ting .

		His health , however , did not permit , and
M. Flournoy	PERSON	, an old friend of
William James	PERSON	's , was invited to take his place .

		By that time Wil - liam
James	PERSON	was dead .

		The lectures
Flournoy	PERSON	gave , the substance of this book , are a distin - guished act of piety and grace , in memory of a great thinker who was also a near friend .


M. Flournoy	PERSON	has accomplished admirably the task he set himself .

		He has found , in
James	LOCATION	's own spirit , the right beginnings for
James	PERSON	's the - ory of life in
James	LOCATION	's temperament , in that bal - ance of sensibility and reasonableness which makes an artist and which leads him to regard the individuality and autonomy in things with - out missing their connections and interplay .

		402 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	From this regard sprang his rejection of monism , his `` radical empiricism , '' his conception of the character and function of thought and knowing which he called pragmatism , his pluralism , his tychism , and his defence of the plausibility of theism .


M. Flournoy	PERSON	's exposition of these themes and of their interrelation is admirable , and yet And yet although the opinions are the opin - ions of
James	LOCATION	, the spirit is the spirit of Flour - noy .

		That this should be so is more or less inevitable .

		No mind that is truly a mind can merely reproduce what it apprehends .

		Even so passive a thing as a mirror turns around what it reflects , and the relations it presents are con - verse to those presented it .

		How much more transforming the reflection of an active spirit !

		And when the theme is the outlook of a man so myriad-minded and sympathetic as
William James !	PERSON

		It then becomes almost inevitable that the pattern into which his thought is rewoven , the places on which the high lights are thrown and the shadows spread , shall be those that utter , not a little , the temperament and hope of the interpreter at least as much as the character of his subject-matter .


M. Flournoy	PERSON	is of Swiss citizenship , of French nationality , of the Christian religion , and to be counted among idealists in the schools of philosophy .

		And
James	PERSON	had once been a student in
Geneva	LOCATION	!

		The assimilation of his teaching to the national tradition and per - sonal bias of his interpreter has this empirical ground , then ; and it is made unconsciously and imperceptibly .

		Pragmatism is thus turned into a defence of spiritualism , which it is not ; into a doctrine of the limitations of the intellect , which it is not ; into a ideological subjectivism , which it is not .

		It is adduced to
Kant	PERSON	, who would have been horrified , as
James	PERSON	used to be amused , at such adduction , and to a whole series of Swiss writers , among them Secretan and
Fremmel	PERSON	, who were preoccupied with radically different things , special pleadings , in fact , for religion against the scientific method of which pragma - tism is the philosophical statement .

		Radical em - piricism is made to mean that reality is experience , and declared to agree with a `` phenomenalism '' such as Renouvier 's .

		James 's personality and philosophy are declared `` purely Christian in spirit , '' and Christ is designated as `` the first pragmatist when he declared that ` by their fruits shall ye know them ' and that the truth of his doctrine was to be judged by putting it in prac - tice . ''

		Also , Christ treated the problem of evil pluralistically , and was also in this respect at one with
James	PERSON	.

		Finally both were shall I say sus - tained ?

		by a Swiss : `` it would be elaborating the obvious to dwell longer on this justification of views which , heterodox as they are , have been ably supported among us a few years ago by so notable a Christian as
Wilfred Monod	PERSON	. ''

		However , all this is supererogatory .

		M. Flour - noy has written an admirable book , the best on
William James	PERSON	that has yet appeared .

		This English version has been made by
Edwin Holt	PERSON	, an old friend and the most brilliant pupil of
James	LOCATION	, and
William James , Jr.	PERSON	, a son .

		They have given it a distinction which always equals and at points exceeds that of the original .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		A Scholarly Vagabond ALONE IN THE
CARIBBEAN	LOCATION	.

		By
Frederic A. Fenger	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Little as
Milton	PERSON	was thinking of tales of travel when he said the mind can make a heaven of hell , this is exactly what the sensible traveler seems to think when he reports his journey .

		Satan 's wistful idealism is not always needed ; what is needed however is that the writer pro- ceed on the principle that what he thinks about it all is quite as useful and entertaining as where he has been and what he has seen .

		The two things , of course , need not be mutually exclusive .

		Such another Satanic sightseer is Mr.
Fenger	PERSON	, whose `` Alone in the
Caribbean	LOCATION	'' is an absorbing review of his ride along the Lesser Antilles in his sailing canoe `` Yakaboo . ''

		Yet it took more than a jaunty stylist to sail a canoe over the cross currents and chops of these island channels , to the universal wonder of the natives .

		Although Mr.
Fenger	PERSON	pauses to illustrate by diagrams the construction of his craft and to describe subtle tacks at critical times , he is chiefly interested in the country and its inhabitants .

		This interest the reader inherits , and adds to it a hearty liking for the whimsical , independent navigator .

		Much of the interest , to be sure , lies in the nature of the subject : forgotten little islands in the
South Atlantic	LOCATION	which have not changed greatly since the sway of the ancien regime , when the Empress
Josephine	PERSON	and
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	were born here a romantic setting , free for the taking .

		But lively as is kept the reader 's curiosity about the region , and unusual as this vehicle of romance may be -LRB- a deep sea canoe with no rud -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 403 der -RRB- , it is Mr.
Fenger	PERSON	's style of thought and expression that count most .

		In the first place , it is no sentimental journey , no travels with a donkey ; which is to say that it is refreshingly unliterary .


Stevenson	PERSON	,
Conrad	LOCATION	,
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	, the author probably has read , but laudably forgotten quite as they forget one another .

		Somewhere toward the end of his chronicle the writer happens to remark , `` The world is merely one huge farce of comparison . ''

		Making these comparisons is his entertainment and the reader 's as well .

		Some are not espe - cially illustrative ; many of them are brilliant bits of verisimilitude ; but the busy skipper fishes them up and honestly turns all over to you just as they come to him .

		Unlike many a traveloguist , and shopman , he never strives to please .

		The result is that he fascinates from the time `` the new clean sails hung from their spars like the unprinted leaves of a book '' until he `` was back in civilization again and as far from the ` Yakaboo ' and the Lesser Antilles as you , sitting on the back of your neck in a Morris chair . ''

		There is a good Yankee slant to most of these figures which is irresistible .

		In the
Bay of Fort de France	LOCATION	, for example , he had difficulty with the customs officials but succeeded in calling out to the crowd gathered on the quay for one
M. Richaud	PERSON	, to whom he had a letter of introduction .

		`` There was a movement in .

		the crowd and a little man was pushed to the outer edge , like the stone out of a prune '' the more realistic since the crowd was made up of negroes .

		Quite as unprec - edented is the following , from an account of a pursuit of humpback whales in a native outfit : `` We had eaten no food since the
night before	TIME	, and all day long the brown-black almost hairless calves of the men had been reminding me in an agonizing way of the breast of roasted duck . ''

		After passages like that describing the author 's moonlight visit to
St. Pierre	ORGANIZATION	, the
Pompeii	LOCATION	of the Antilles , and how he `` loafed in the high noon of the moon '' through the lava covered streets , tak - ing refuge at last in the cemetery among the legitimately dead and buried , it is not so easy to show that Mr.
Fenger	PERSON	is no stylist .

		At last one realizes the beguilingly simple art of this navi - gator who once recalled
Southern France	LOCATION	and once
Venice	LOCATION	, wore a Swedish leather dog-skin coat over his rags when he climbed Mt.
Pelee	LOCATION	, and read himself to sleep with the ` TEneid '' in the cockpit of his canoe .

		There 's no vagabond like a gentleman and a scholar .

London	LOCATION	; 3/6 .

		For the psychologist there could be few more fascinating problems than the rise and decline of a poet 's power .

		It is a truism to say that for every artist , of whatever art , there comes inevitably a time of deterioration ; but this is particularly true among poets , it is certainly more conspicuous among them , and it may well be asked whether by the rate and time of it one can not accurately appraise a poet 's importance .

		Not always , perhaps ; if we adhered too strictly to this theory we should be compelled to rank the lyric poets almost invariably below the narra - tive or contemplative poets , a ranking which could hardly be acceptable to all .

		For it is a curious fact that just as the novelist usually exhibits greater staying power than the poet , con - triving for a longer time to produce works on a relatively higher plane and in greater quantity , so the objective poet , quite as clearly , tends to outstrip the subjective poet .

		The Freudians might say that this is because the subjective poet , speaking always in his own person , out of his own heart , more rapidly therefore gives release and full expression to his emotional hungers ; whereas the objective poet , finding only semioccasionally in the course of his work an opportunity for surrender to these cherished and secret compul - sions , compulsions of which to be sure he is only partially aware , leaves them , always , in that state of restlessness and frustration which incites him to a renewal of labor .

		It might be a mis - take then , if there are any such things as purely subjective or purely objective poets , to judge the two sorts more than speculatively by this stand - ard .

		It would be obviously fairer to measure only subjective against subjective , objective against objective .

		One has no right to demand of a
Rossetti	PERSON	as prolonged and fecund a bril - liance as of a
Browning	PERSON	.

		The affair is further complicated by the fact that purity of type is so rare , particularly as regards the poet whom we must call , for lack of a more accurate term , 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	objective .

		Many objective poets begin their careers in a lyric vein , and some of them show a disposition to return once more to it at the .

		end .

		This last is perhaps the class to which belong our greatest poets , those whose careers present a cyclic evolution .

		In these rare cases it is not so much deterioration one looks for as change .

		In the main however , if we keep in mind these provisos , we may consider the temporal span of a poet 's evolution to be a fairly good empirical index to his importance , it being understood of course that his work shows sufficient brilliance to warrant the question at all .

		`` This is good , '' we remark , `` but can he keep it up ? ''

		And on the answer depends very largely our judgment .

		There is also to be considered the merely practical aspect of this : in a sphere so overcrowded it is those who endure longest , producing most , who will be longest remembered .

		The lyric poet who early exhausts himself , the narrative poet who begins to repeat his theme and manner , become as it were known quantities ; and unfortunately the world is disposed to lose interest in known quantities all too quickly .

		Only the type of poetic genius who possesses a capacity for new experience , perpetually generating new complexes , evolving therefore from one manner or emotional attitude to another , can continue to delight by continuing to surprise .

		And of this type too there are infinite gradations , some completing their orbits much more rapidly than others .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	are the immediate occasion for these reflections , for all three of them , in their latest books , exhibit a marked deterioration in quality .

		Whether or not this deterioration is permanent we have , to be sure , no way of knowing .

		In the case of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	the deterioration is least striking , as is natural , since Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	is predominantly an objective poet .

		The deterioration of a lyric poet is apt to be abrupt .

		That of a narrative poet is usuajlly slow , sometimes only clearly perceptible in retrospect .

		We can see now that since the publication of `` Fires '' Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has tended to repeat himself , to allow his sensibilities to harden ; his manner has become , to borrow a psychological term , autistic .

		Petrifaction of style , the failure to invent new medium and new theme , the comfortable habit of relying a little too easily on the well-known and often-used gesture , began perhaps in `` Fires '' itself and has now , in `` Hill-Tracks , '' reached a point where , barring an unexpected development , we may say that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has nothing of importance to add to what he has already said .

		He belongs to that type of poet which , while objective , can be objective in only one style , which even when least personal in theme is none the less idiosyn - cratic in manner ; he employs the type of objectivity which does not develop under the guidance of a free - roving and universally healthy intellectual attitude , but at the dictate of a strong personal bias , or what the Freudians would call a complex ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Chaucer in this respect lie at the extreme in one direction ,
Verlaine	PERSON	and Leopardi in the other .

		Poets like
Masefield	PERSON	and
Gibson	PERSON	lie midway between .

		This is not to imply that the present volume is utterly devoid of power and charm : a poet of Mr.
Gib	PERSON	- son 's ability can not lose his technique or per - sonality overnight , and even in deterioration his work remains interesting .

		At the same time , one is driven to conclude that if Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	is to keep his hold on us he must evolve a new manner , sink a new shaft ; his vein seems to be exhausted .

		`` Hill-Tracks '' is a monotonous book , composed almost wholly of poems which lie midway in manner between his earlier narrative style and the ballad .

		The structural method is discourag - ingly uniform .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has surrendered himself to a predilection for place-names which amounts almost to mania , and poem after poem follows the same scheme beginning and ending with a recital of place-names , sometimes even iterating them throughout .

		The narrative ele - ment is thin ; the emotional element is frequently altogether absent .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's book is slight , and demands little comment .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's technique and manner are nearly always precise to the point of preciosity , and in the present instance , as indeed for some time past , they approximate the frigid .

		It is not that she has nothing to say , or nothing to feel ; but the emotivity of the lyric poet is not inexhaustible , and Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's lyric gift was always a slender one .

		It is enough to say that her verse , while adroit , no longer has gusto .

		The case of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	is more interesting and more uncertain .

		One would like nothing better than to be told that his new book , `` The Last Blackbird , '' is not really a successor but a predecessor of the earlier published `` Poems . ''

		If that is not the case , then all one can say is that Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's collapse is nothing short of ap - palling .

		Of the delicious charm and magic which infused `` Eve , '' `` Stupidity Street , '' `` The Bull , '' and other things in the earlier book ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 there remains in the present volume hardly a trace .

		Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	appears to have outwept his rain , and rather suddenly .

		Instead of the earlier warmth , color , and whim , one finds here little but chill abstractions , smooth modulation , and a curious tendency towards the cool formal - ism of certain eighteenth century poets , notably
Thomas Gray	PERSON	.

		It begins to look as if our expectations of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	had been too sanguine .

		Must we class him among the three - poem poets ?

		The remaining four volumes those of Ed - ward
Thomas	PERSON	,
J. C. Squire	PERSON	,
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	, and
Max Plowman	PERSON	do not relate to our theme of deterioration .


Edward Thomas	PERSON	was killed in action , and `` Poems '' was his first and last book of verse .

		To many it will probably prove disappointing .

		Most of it is the work of a sensitive prose craftsman , a lover of poetry , with a mind rich in observation ; but it is not , per - haps , the work of a born poet .

		It is a verse of restless approximations rather than of achieve - ment .

		The sense of rhythm is so imperfect that one is continually obliged to reread a line several times .

		This is no doubt due in part to the verse-theory of Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	-LRB- to whom the book is dedicated -RRB- that the rhythm of poetry should be that of colloquial speech ; but it is also due to defective ear and a consequent poverty in the sense of prosodic arrangement .

		In general the style is cerebral , cumulative rather than selec - tive , and somewhat fatiguing ; the most we can say is that from the book as a whole emerges an engaging personality , a personality of many and complex moods , most at home however in the pastoral .

		In some respects Mr.
J. C. Squire	PERSON	's work is not unlike that of Thomas : it is apt to be crabbed and uneven , and it is almost always cerebral rather than emotional .

		One sometimes admires , but seldom is one moved .

		In the title poem , `` The Lily of Malud , '' Mr.
Squire	PERSON	has con - siderably overworked a goodish idea , though even to begin with the idea was perhaps a trifle precious .

		The effect aimed at was one of eeriness , but Mr.
Squire	PERSON	's details are too commonplacely real , and the rather frequent references to the mud from which the mysterious lily ascends pre - cipitate the vapor of illusion somewhat abruptly .

		... It is a kind of intellectual falseness , also , which undoes Mr.
Sassoon	PERSON	and Mr.
Plow	PERSON	- man .

		Mr.
Sassoon	PERSON	is at his best in the shorter war-poems , though even in these he is a trifle too self-conscious and academic .

		Mr.
Plowman	PERSON	, a disciple of
Blake	PERSON	, eliminates too persistently the sensuous element without which poetry is barren .

		He is also a little too studiously archaic .

		Occasionally however , as in the symbolic poem `` The Bowman , '' he gives us a formal lyric which is very effective .

		On the whole , if these seven volumes are a fair test , it appears that the renaissance of poetry in
England	LOCATION	is not so vigorous or interesting today as it was between
1912	DATE	and
1915	DATE	.

		Have the maturer poets of
England	LOCATION	, those of established reputation , completed their orbits , and has the interregnum now arrived during which the apprentice poets , in greater numbers , and profit - ing by the adventures of their predecessors , are preparing for the next flight ?

		That , at any rate , appears to be the state of things in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	the chief difference being that the American poets will inherit a greater freedom , the English a finer sensitiveness to language .

		The `
Brevity School	ORGANIZATION	in Fiction ON THE STAIRS .

		By
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Last year , you will remember , Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, in THE DIAL , made his plea for shorter novels .

		He had unkind words for the loose-tongued , self - indulgent Englishman who chats , sprawls , goes quite ungirt , and for the diffuseness and form - lessness that are the capital defects of the English novel .

		He approves the critic who says that the task of the novelist is to discover the nature of his interest in life , and to express that interest in the form of a story .

		But , he adds , it must be an interest disciplined , which shall result in a unified impression .

		He believes that in 50,000 words , properly packed , the novelist can cover long periods of time and can handle adequately a large number of individuals and of family groups .

		To this end he would rule out long descriptions of persons , set descriptions of places , conversation which fills the page without .

		illuminating it , con - ventional scenes and situations .

		The novel should be spare-ribbed and athletic .

		The irrelevant should be pared off , so as to leave a clear outline for movement and idea .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's plea for shorter novels was a plea for more artistic novels .

		These interminable stories that Americans are so fond of , with their would-be realism , but without 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	form or development , lack even the rudiments of art .

		We are becoming fatty with too much read - ing .

		The quickened tempo of our modern intelli - gence demands a change .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	did not tell us that , all the time , he had up his sleeve a most brilliant example of the very kind of novel he asked for .

		In `` Lines Long and Short '' he had made a series of sketches for the `` short novel . ''

		Free verse , he saw , offered a tempting vehicle for the modern story seeking to escape the `` stale and inflated conventions . ''

		This new form could `` lay tribute upon some of the best effects and advantages of poetry , the packed thought , the winged epithet , the concentrated ex - pression . ''

		And these little sketches of his dry , sardonic , etched in brisk , sharp strokes made story-telling seem like almost a new art .

		They were spacious enough to improve upon that `` trebly compressed , quintessentialized pungency of Spoon River '' with its `` escape of strongest ammonia . ''

		Yet they avoided all the confection - ery of description and the patter of conversation .

		After such a book and Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's articles the `` short novel '' was inevitable .

		In `` On the Stairs '' he has filled out the design , and has produced a book which has all the brisk , sardonic interest of these free-verse narratives and yet gives the spacious sense of a full-sized novel .

		True to his `` conviction that story-telling , what - ever form it may take , can be done within limits narrower than those now generally employed , '' he has put into less than 50,000 words a story that covers the developing
Chicago	LOCATION	of the last forty years , the history of a wealthy family , the rise of a self-made man , the interlocking of his fortunes with the wealthy scion , who , while the other mounts the stair of fortune , sinks into an ineffective citizen , `` unable to command and un - willing to obey . ''

		There is the younger genera - tion as affected by the war .

		There is the whole ironic comedy of the feeble struggle of the aes - thetic spirit against the hearty and masterful
Chicago	LOCATION	growth and self-confidence .

		Into this story Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has packed the essentials of that sweep of American life that interests him .

		And he has done it triumphantly , with just that terse suggestiveness and classic sense of form that he has admired and urged in others .

		The physician , anxious about the health of American fiction , has quite beautifully healed himself .

		Raymond Prince is a masterly portrait the rich young man utterly indifferent to business or a professional career , who is drawn to
Europe	LOCATION	, where he is too good and self-controlled to do anything but become a pallid servitor of the arts .


Chicago	LOCATION	proves an infertile field for the aesthete .

		Raymond 's personal contacts are scarcely more successful than his contacts with business affairs .

		His protagonist ,
John W. McComas	PERSON	, who began life as the Prince coachman 's son , and has found the world his oyster , manages to swing Ray - mond 's wife and even his son into his influence ; and
Raymond	PERSON	is left , resentfully contented in the obscure , irresponsible bachelor existence that should have been his walk of life from the begin - ning .

		Raymond 's divorced wife is long since married to the widowed
McComas	PERSON	; the son , home from the war , with a financial career ahead of him , is marrying
McComas	PERSON	's daughter .

		Every - one goes up the stairs but
Raymond	PERSON	, who goes out by that same door wherein he went .

		The satiric vision of these two men is contrib - uted by a narrator , who purports to be an old schoolmate of both , tasting in his own life neither the public splendor of
McComas	PERSON	nor the pale European flavor of Raymond .

		He is not envious , this narrator , but his tone , acid but not unpleas - ant , biting but not quite cynical , sets exactly in the most just and vivid light this so indigenously American social study .

		To the consumer of the average American novel `` On the Stairs '' will seem quite dreadfully to lack sympathy .

		But it will delight every person who is looking for that rarest of all qualities in the contemporary Ameri - can novel wisdom .

		It is the wisdom of a mind that has nothing to preach , no social problem to solve , no moral to bequeath .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	looks at this human comedy that he has studied for many years , and puts down in a clear and composed form the truth as it appears to him .

		The result is an extremely bracing attitude , the effect of an uncompromisingly artistic effort instead of an ethical one .

		The reader is balked of any moral preferences .

		The self-made man is no more at - tractive than the tepid connoisseur .

		You may despise
Raymond	PERSON	for his choked patriotism , but you can scarcely admire the young hero , his son , who returns from the war to his capitalistic ambi - tions .

		What you remember is not any moral , but the fine , clear outlines of a piece of literary art that is a criticism of American life as well as a dramatic story .

		It is not only the contour that is classic .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has been able to make his characters types as well as individuals .

		They criticize American society in that they symbolize whole classes , ex - press certain current attitudes .

		Raymond and
Gertrude	PERSON	and
Albert	PERSON	satirize themselves and all
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 407 who are like them , and they do it just by being what they are in the essential attributes that Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	gives them .

		This , I take it , is the note of the good old classic tales , and Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	in his rigor for form has achieved the same effect of significant generality expressed through the indi - vidual .

		Similarly a typical incident or a fragment of talk tells more than pages of description or orthodox vraisemblable conversation .

		`` The world , in these days of easy travel and abundant depiction , has come to know itself pretty well , '' says Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	.

		All we need is a hint to call up the image or the sociological setting we should have before us .

		The novelist who uses more is either letting his poetic nature run away with him , or is writing a sociological document , of value doubtless in future centuries , but inadequate as a contemporary work of art .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	achieves a further criticism of the ordinary novel by maliciously calling the reader 's attention , at various points in the story , to his tempting romantic opportunities only to turn away to the inexorable truth before him and continue his prosaic but tonic way .

		`` On the Stairs '' is thus a variety of good and important things , summing up into a delightful piece of literary art .

		But its chief significance ought to be the liberation of those embryo Ameri - can novelists who have been writing their stories in free verse .

		Here is a brilliant and sound working model of the `` novel within narrower limits . ''

		Will the younger American writers fol - low Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's evolution from lines long and short into the brevity novel ?

		Of course it would be unfair to expect them to achieve the artistic finish of a writer who twenty years ago was writing some of the best novels of his day .

		Per - haps .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	at sixty will have to go on writing the younger generation 's novels for them .

		But here is a new and stirring lead that must be followed if we are to get down in black and white and in brisk pertinent form the myriad stories of the American life we know .

		You can - not read `` On the Stairs '' without hoping that here is a new fashion in literary art .

		`` If a new day , '' Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	said in one of those memorable DIAL articles , `` is going to express itself to ad - vantage , it must make its new moulds as well as find its new material .

		The latter vintage , crude and homely as it may be , deserves its own bot - tles . ''

		A bottle with the fine contour , brilliance , and availability of Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's brevity is a good bottle for any vintage .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS JAPANESE ART MOTIVES .

		By
Maude Rex Allen	PERSON	.

		McClurg ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The survival and persistent revival of the arts of the Orient , particularly of the decorative pos - sibilities which have become an integral part of every recently and properly `` done '' house , make a fitting occasion for the analysis of `` Japanese Art Motives . ''

		In her book
Maude Rex Allen	PERSON	has accomplished her task thoroughly .

		The large selected bibliography with which she concludes her volume confirms the fact that one may find , in several languages , many treatises on the per - petually fascinating topic of Oriental art its origin , significance , and adaptation .

		But this author , foreseeing the limitations of time and knowledge necessarily imposed on the most inter - ested of auditors , has gathered from these sources , and has presented clearly and specifically , the essential factors which from the Japanese angle underlie the objects of beauty and utility from which our civilization is deriving benefit .

		Brought up as we are on the Greek and Roman mythologies , we approach Miss
Allen	PERSON	's subject matter with an unfamiliarity based on ignorance .

		With our proverbially superficial knowledge of even those arts we enjoy , we have accepted the beauty of the Orient with no attempt to com - prehend the meaning that the creators thereof have put into it .

		Even the casual reader of this book will be instantaneously impressed by its wealth of material the abundance of mythol - ogy , of symbolism , of creative imagination .

		It astounds us as much by its similarity to , as by its preponderance over , the conventional classical lore .

		Here , indeed , is an ancient and fecund field wherein the dramatist-artist will find sug - gestive themes , although the recently dramatized legend of `` The Willow Tree '' supplies a none too favorable example .

		Never forgetting her aim or her audience ,
Miss Allen	PERSON	has arranged this undoubtedly chaotic mix - ture of religion , superstition , and fact with skilful care .

		Under the headings `` Plants , '' `` Animals , '' `` Deities , '' and miscellaneous `` Symbolic Objects '' she has grouped the better known emblems , giv - ing them their foreign and English names , and briefly explaining their generic significances and their application .

		We see the reasons for the nu - merous Japanese festivals , and the `` five o'clock '' becomes a doubly cherished moment when , with a charm of detail , we visualize the augustly au - spicious function in which we are participating .

		And we regret that one can not always limit , in the orthodox Japanese fashion , the guests to the `` celestial number '' of five , nor employ thirty-two blessed implements in the brewing .

		Even the ar - tificial landscape arrangements are so interestingly described that we will give attention hereafter 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	to the least attractive of our bowled miniatures an appreciation mingled with an intellectual enjoyment hitherto lacking .

		That is the main contribution of Miss
Allen	PERSON	's compendium .

		Its illustrations , occasionally col - ored , are helpful ; its index and references valu - able ; its tales interesting .

		But its distinctive feature is that it contains and transmits a true educational impulse ; it teaches us by making us learn .

		Perhaps a few hours after our reading we shall have forgotten exactly what the `` Yo and In '' motive meant to the Chinese Emperor from whom it originated .

		The `` Raincoat of Invisi - bility '' may justifiably become a delightful name , instead of a memory of the conventionalized nat - ural form it represents .

		But there is no question that the information to be derived from this book will prevent our handling a Japanese objet d'art without some recognition of the symbolism with which it is pregnant .

		A HISTORY OF
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Joseph Schafer	PERSON	.

		Revised edition .

		Mac - milian ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		This is a new edition of an excellent book .

		It gives , as did the earlier edition , a brief and authoritative account of the discovery , settlement , and acquisition by the
United States	LOCATION	of the region formerly known as the
Oregon Territory	ORGANIZATION	, now
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, and
Idaho	LOCATION	.

		There is a good map of the country , with the emphasis on the
Pacific Northwest	LOCATION	.

		And the interest of the story is enhanced by the inclusion of portraits and illustrations .

		The new chapters treat of the boundary dispute with
England	LOCATION	, of the social changes , and of the recent experiments in govern - mental procedure which the country calls radical .

		The author is not entirely convinced that the initiative , referendum , and recall are the most successful method of reaching social ends ; but he makes very clear the reason why these new com - munities became the experiment stations in reform for the country .

		It is worth noting today that as
Oregon	LOCATION	is abandoning the famous three R 's ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	is making an effort to adopt them .

		Professor
Schafer	PERSON	does not point out that it has always been the new community , at least in the
United States	LOCATION	, which responded most quickly to demands for democratic reforms and the remedy of abuses .

		Kentucky tried to abandon slavery in her early days ;
Illinois	LOCATION	was democratic before she grew rich .

		But he does describe the social revo - lution from ranchmen to small farmers , and then the next revolution from small farmers to great - scale wheat producers .

		Any who may need a handy manual of the principal facts in the up - building of the far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	might go far and search long before finding a better work .

		THE QUEST OF
EL DORADO	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
J. A. Zahm	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Under the pen-name ``
H. J. Mozans	PERSON	, '' Father
Zahm	PERSON	is known as the author of several attractive books of South American travels .

		`` The Quest of
El Dorado	LOCATION	'' is devoted to a series of essays -LRB- `` chapters , '' they are termed -RRB- describing the expeditions of his sixteenth-century predecessors in the same regions that succession of amazing explorers , from Belalcazar to
Raleigh	LOCATION	, who achieved the impossible in their quest of the incredible , and thereby made of
South America	LOCATION	a mine of romance richer and more lasting than the gold of all her empires .

		Nowhere are the pages of human history more writ with the grandiose and the bizarre preposterous courage , preposterous cruelty , preposterous imagination .

		What the Spaniard brought to
America	LOCATION	out - glittered what he found there an orgulous mag - nificence of mind which distorted the world of sensation into the splendors of a mirage .


El Dorado	PERSON	, the `` Gilded Man , '' priest-king of a mythic golden city , was first heard of , according to the tradition , from a poor Indian , whose description of what appears to have been a native rite at one time practiced by the tribes about
Lake Guatavita	LOCATION	so excited at once the love of gold and the imagining of marvels in his hearers that the tale became the noise of the whole world , and , growing in enchantment with its own telling , it mingled with and colored all the fables of
Amazon	LOCATION	queens , lost empires of the Incas , charmed Cities of the Caesars , and resplendent Houses of the Sun , in which the Old and New Worlds had wedded their combining fancies .

		`` The Most Romantic Episode in the History of South American Conquest '' is Father
Zahm	PERSON	's rather tame sub-title for his introduction to what is certainly the most abundant fountain of adventure thrilling and bloody and fuming with glory that is as yet untouched by the literary .

		The introduction itself is admirable , if only for its clear sketch of events and its care - ful references to Spanish originals , many of them little known in the
United States	LOCATION	, and , especially in the case of the South American imprints , not readily accessible .

		The chance of the times is throwing into Span - ish courses many of our young college folk ; this chance will not altogether have failed of fortune if it turn but one or two , fresh with the gift of fancy , to this field of romance at once rich and ripe for a gorgeous harvesting .

		Father
Zahm	PERSON	's book is liberally illustrated with repro - ductions of sixteenth-century prints and maps , which add the glamor of their own quaint dis - tortions of fact .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 409 POEMS OF WAR AND PEACE .

		ITALIAN RHAPSODY , and Other Poems of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		By
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	.

		Published by the author , 70 Fifth Avenue ,
New York	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	and
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Of his `` Poems of War and Peace '' Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, who has become his own publisher , has now issued a second edition , which includes `` The Panama Ode '' and `` The Corridors of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' together with several pieces inspired by the war .

		Although odes , son - nets , and blank verse by no means fill the vol - ume , and in spite of a careful definitive arrange - ment , the heroic mood dominates the book and gives it a somewhat archaic flavor ; for the grand manner with all its panoply of alliteration , rep - etition , inversion , elision , obtrusive rhyme , class - ical gear , capitalized abstractions , and senten - tiousness can no longer report reality , if indeed it ever did .

		In a day of such grim business as today 's , poetry can move us with unique tran - scripts of that business or with complete escapes from it .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	offers neither : he seems unable to report this war as no other war has been reported ; in his pages war is War , peace is Peace , man is Man , the enemy is the Enemy and they are nothing more ; yet he can not escape from the war : What were
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, Love , and Song In the presence of such wro ` ng ?

		He is like a laureate whose business it is to pro- duce occasional poems about events of which he has no intimate knowledge ; and , as becomes an Academician , he does this much rather well if one will overlook the infrequent halt line and hunted rhymes like `` poor ... Kohinoor . ''

		But such poems are not criticisms of life : they are studied reflections of the glamors with which other laureates have gilded life .

		This somewhat stale , somewhat frigid unre - ality characterizes Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's lyrics also .

		It taints the humor of the two or three vernacular pieces , permitting him to make a puppy say : `` For cleanliness , '' my father said , `` Is next , my dears , to dogliness . ''

		His humor , like his beauty and his learning , is bestowed on his subjects from without , instead of suffusing them from within ; his emotions , like his epithets , are bookish .

		The
Italy	LOCATION	of the verses in `` Italian Rhapsody , and Other Poems '' is the
Italy	LOCATION	of the literary visitor , of the poetic tradi - tion the
Italy	LOCATION	of Chaucer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Keats	PERSON	, but not the
Italy	LOCATION	of
Browning	PERSON	.

		This unreality does not preclude feeling , for some of the lyrics and notably the `` Farewell to
Italy	LOCATION	'' achieve beauty through a gentle dew of emo - tion , continently expressed ; but it does preclude the passion that evokes the genius loci .

		In Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's
Italy	LOCATION	no sunburned girls write naughty words with fingers dipped in wine .

		And when - ever feeling deserts him , his ear goes too ; his verses turn pedestrian or jig-jog ; his rhymes become obvious -LRB- `` June ... dune ... tune '' ; `` love ... dove ... above '' -RRB- or wrenched -LRB- `` torso ... more so ... Corso '' -RRB- .

		Passion - ate poets hold their audience in spite of faults of taste , but when taste fails the literary poet he is undone .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is a literary poet whose taste is not always loyal to him .

		PAWNS OF WAR .

		A Play by
Bosworth Crocker	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a foreword by
John Gals	PERSON	- worthy .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This is a compact and moving little play , written in a fine , sustained style .

		Perhaps it is still too early for any play woven around the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	to have the even imperson - ality of tone which is characteristic of great tragedy .

		Yet Mr.
Crocker	PERSON	almost completely avoids the polemical emphasis , and the high praise which Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	bestows in his foreword is well merited .

		The dramatist does not flinch from portraying the full horror of the whole brutal business , as that nation-wide horror is reflected in the lives of one small household .

		But the Germans too are human , caught like the Belgians in the meshes of the net of fate .

		At the final scene an eloquently restrained and pathetic climax when the household is to pay with their lives for the death of the head of the
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	, the German commandant can - not bring himself to punish the wife and the daughter .

		There is tragedy for him as well as the others when he says , `` If my life were mine to give you should go unharmed you and yours ; but my life is not my own ; it is pledged to the honor of the
Fatherland	LOCATION	; I am General of the
Sixteenth Division	ORGANIZATION	; the order has been given ; the proclamation is posted on your walls ; my Chief of Staff has been shot down in this house ; there is no way out . ''

		Anger at the revolting cynicism which could dictate the invasion of a peaceful country as a mere military measure , is strengthened rather than weakened by the play - wright 's assessment of the invaders ' character without moralistic bias .

		And in an atmosphere of bitterness and vindictiveness it is a consider - able achievement to write a play around the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	that shall have some of the inevitability of movement and structure which the mere propaganda play can never attain , to stir pity more than weak hatred .

		The play 's temper is admirably reflected in the title , `` Pawns of War . ''

		410 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 25	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT THE ESTHETIC FUNCTION OF MUSIC , LIKE that of poetry , is most misunderstood by those who are most adept in the practice of the arts .

		Skill in the exercise of technical methods speedily becomes a pleasure in itself , comparable only to the delight of solving a problem in higher mathe - matics .

		The advocates of `` pure '' or absolute music , much as the defenders of imagist poetry , derive their real thrills from their quick recogni - tion of the hidden order in a complicated science of relations .

		They urge an art washed clean of any mere animal feeling , stripped of any factitious penumbra of representational memory or con - fused , instinctive suggestion .

		In a word , they make the fine arts a new and more subtle form of metaphysics .

		These , perhaps , are legitimate pleasures for the virtuosi who can retain the sanity of realizing their own weakness .

		But too many of our musicians and poets are in danger of forgetting the homely maxim that for a work of art , as for a quarrel , two are required the artist and the audience .

		They resent , when they do not ignore , the human , all too human claims of their auditors .

		.

		LIKE EVERY OTHER BELLIGERENT WE HAVE discovered that an atmosphere of war is not necessarily an atmosphere conducive to great lit - erature .

		Especially has it been painfully im - pressed upon us that the war itself is a somewhat thankless muse .


John Masefield	PERSON	, although him - self the author of two notable books about the war , `` Gallipoli '' and `` The Old Front Line '' -LRB- once more , in many places , the line of today -RRB- , has frankly stated his belief that art can not flour - ish during the actual progress of war .

		It must wait for that quieter temper which will follow the end of hostilities .

		Although somewhat em - barrassing , it is not really impossible to remember when we were chuckling at the foolish German `` hymns of hate '' and wondering why on
August 4 , 1914	DATE	all the English writers whom we loved and admired with a strikingly few exceptions seemed all at once to be stricken with literary palsy .

		Well , we have lived for over a year in the glass house of war itself , and certainly are no longer in a position to cast stones at our neighbors .

		What great piece of
American fic	ORGANIZATION	- tion has our first year of war brought forth ?

		Or of poetry ?

		Or of really fine writing ?

		If we are honest , we have to admit practically none .

		Courageous and first-rate bits of jour - nalism we have had more than our due share of .

		Some of Will
Irwin	PERSON	's descriptions , though `` pop - ular '' in every sense , would have been creditable performances for any writer .

		Occasionally there flickers something of the
Mark Twain	PERSON	spirit in the dispatches describing our own `` doughboys '' in
France	LOCATION	.


Ernest Poole	PERSON	's exposition of
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians in his new book , `` The Dark People , '' is a fine bit of work .

		Perhaps a dozen times during the year our poetry has risen to really noble heights , surely an average not greater than that of ordinary peace times .

		But taken altogether these few stars have not constituted a wonderful literary '' firmament .

		We can now appreciate how the propaganda spirit infects even the calmer of our writers .

		Everybody seems anxious to prove something or to disprove some - thing else .

		The recriminating and bickering spirit has insinuated itself into the most objec - tive of our prose stylists .

		It is the mood not of creation , but of argument .

		And when the puri - tan tradition , as strongly entrenched as it is with us , marries a new and rather unwieldly militaristic experiment , the result may come peril - ously close to moral megalomania .

		Our writers have yet to learn , for example , that the most powerful propaganda is the quietest propaganda that under-emphasis is considerably more ef - fective than shrillness , that truth of artistic vision and courage of artistic conviction have inalien - able claims .

		When we wish to catch a glimpse of the human side of that mighty conflict red - dening and rending the earth of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	and
Picardy	LOCATION	we still have to turn to those fine dis - patches of
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	.

		Nowhere do the courage and steadiness of those who are battling for us gleam more clearly ; yet the account is written without rancor and without bitterness , and with great pity at the horror and awfulness of that wasted young flesh .

		THE HISTORY OF OUR SO-CALLED POETIC renaissance will contain no sprightlier chapter than the tale of the Spectrist school .

		The Spec - trists came among us in a moment that favored their design .

		The Muse was on the make here - abouts : patronesses had been discovering her ; prizes were multiplying ; newspapers were giv - ing critics their head ; poetry magazines , mush - rooms or hardier plants , were springing up over - night ; it was raining anthologies boom times !

		In concert hall and museum the public had been acquiring sophistication and a safe air of non - committal amusement before artistic queerness .

		If Cubists , Futurists , Imagists , Vorticists , and Others why not Spectrists ? '

		So when
Emanuel Morgan	ORGANIZATION	and
Anne Knish	PERSON	got out their odd little black and white volume of `` Spectra : - New Poems , '' which Mr.
Kennerley	PERSON	slipped unobtru - sively into the
1916	DATE	tide of anthologies , the public smiled , winked , and swallowed .

		The char - acteristic verse inscription dedicated the Spectra to
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	.

		The inevitable preface
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 expounded , with the right mingling of erudition and mysticism , the Spectric theory that `` the theme of a poem is to be regarded as a prism , upon which the colorless white light of infinite existence falls and is broken up into glowing , beautiful , and intelligible hues '' ; that a poem is , as it were , an after-image of `` the poet 's initial vision '' ; that the `` overtones , adumbrations , or spectres which for the poet haunt all objects both of the seen and the unseen world ... should touch with a tremulous vibrancy of ultimate fact the reader 's sense of the immediate theme '' the last clause fairly crying for an Imagist rebuttal .

		Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	employed metre and rhyme ; Miss Knish wrote free verse : the partisans of each form were gratified .

		By way of madness , the poets headed their Spectra not with titles but with opus numbers ; and by way of reason in their madness , their table of contents supplied the lowbrow a key of titles .

		In due time it was divulged that Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	was a painter who in
Paris	LOCATION	had fallen under the influence of
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	, gone in for poetry , and abandoned painting but not his sensitiveness to color ; that Miss Knish was a Hungarian who had published a volume of poems in Russian under a Latin title .

		Take it altogether ,
Hoyle	PERSON	was satisfied and the Spectrists were gathered to the bosom of the renaissance ... SOME OF THE SPECTRA , TO BE SURE , WERE pretty staggeringly `` queer '' ; but queerer things had been and were to be .

		Some of them , too , were undeniably effective .

		The authors began to be deluged with adulatory letters from the most advanced poets of our very advanced day , of whom the men naturally inclined to address Miss Knish , and the women Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	.

		Here at last , it appeared , was the real thing pretense stripped away , technique reduced to low - est terms , passionate beauty impaled for a marvel - ing posterity that ultimate method for which the poets from Homer to themselves had been so many voices crying in the wilderness .

		Certain poetry magazines were impressed and sought the privilege of giving the world more Spectra , not all of which have yet been printed .

		`` Others '' devoted an entire issue to the Spectrists ; they were successfully parodied in a college magazine ; they acquired disciples a Harvard undergraduate , for instance , forswore Iniagism for Spectrism , and had his apostasy roundly rebuked by the high priestess of his earlier faith .

		Meanwhile poets had been proving their discernment by calling the attention of fellow poets to these bright new stars in the firmament of verse , sometimes inad - vertently introducing the Spectrists to themselves entertaining angels unawares .

		The angels must have had an enviable control of their facial muscles , acquired perhaps through reading the innumerable serious reviews of their so success - ful volume .

		For the reviewers ran signally true to form : the more conservative reviewed with alarm ; the more radical poured out superlatives ; the professionally cautious maintained their fence - rail dignity .

		The supremely canny avoided the question altogether , or evaded responsibility .

		And thereby hangs quite the funniest tale of the whole affair .

		One of the editors of a distin - guished journal of opinion delegated his duty to Mr.
Witter Bynner	PERSON	, and the journal paid Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	a neat honorarium for his solmenly judi - cial appraisal of himself in the role of `` Eman - uel Morgan , '' originator of the Spectrist the - ory .

		. '

		.

		One wonders whether the genesis and course of Spectrism is not the most illuminating criticism of much that is most pretentious in the new arts .

		It seems that Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	, while watching a performance by the Russian Ballet , announced a sudden determination to found a new school in poetry .

		What to call it ?

		His programme lay open at `` La Spectre de la Rose . ''

		Followed two weeks of indefatigable composition in collaboration with `` Miss Knish , '' then pub - lication and fame .

		Probably neither of the authors was prepared for so gratifying a success .

		Indeed , there is no telling how far the `` move - ment '' might have gone but for the interruption of the war , which gave `` Miss Knish '' a commis - sion as Captain
Arthur Davison Ficke	PERSON	.

		THE PUBLISHERS OF `` THE ATLANTIC Monthly '' have assumed control of `` The Liv - ing Age '' and announce that the venerable weekly , than which no American periodical except `` The North American Review '' has had a longer unin - terrupted history , will shortly broaden its scope to include again reprints of contributions to Brit - ish periodicals , to which selections from
Conti	PERSON	- nental magazines will now be added .

		In
1844	DATE	, when
Littell	PERSON	founded `` The Living Age , '' Amer - ican periodicals were almost wholly dependent upon English journals for their contents and upon a very unreliable trans-Atlantic service .

		The editor was wont to complain that he had to go to press hearing `` the noise of the steamer 's arrival , '' knowing that his contributions were on board , but unable to make use of them before another issue .

		The war , which has greatly in - creased our intellectual demands upon
Europe	LOCATION	, has also restored something of that uncertainty of communication , as subscribers to foreign pub - lications can bear witness .

		One trusts that his - tory will not repeat itself too annoyingly in the new office of `` The Living Age . ''

N. J. BRIEFEK	PERSON	MENTION Rather tardily , but perhaps as soon as we could expect , are appearing manuals of information about military organization and insignia , first aids for the inquiring civilian .

		One of the most complete is Lieut.
J. W. Bunkley	PERSON	's `` Military and Naval Rec - ognition Handbook '' -LRB- Van Nostrand ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, a clearly illustrated guide which should prove not without value in the services as well .

		The chap - ters on the organization of our army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, and on the etiquette and customs peculiar to them , are naturally of first interest ; but the descriptions of insignia of rank in the other important armies and navies are already helpful in some American cities and should prove increasingly useful as strange uniforms multiply upon our streets .

		`` A Yankee in the Trenches , '' by
R. Derby Holmes	PERSON	-LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is a straightfor - ward , objective report , not without humor , by an American who enlisted in the British army early in the war .

		His regiment was stationed in the
Somme	LOCATION	district and took part in the battle of High Wood , where the tanks made their dramatic first appear - ance , to the demoralization of the Germans .

		But
Corporal Holmes	PERSON	is most readable when he is tell - ing about the life of
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	between his periods of trench service , that less spectacular life full of quiet incident and homely detail which the author has had to subordinate in his lectures .

		He understands and admires his cockney comrades , most loyal when `` grousing '' most bitterly .

		He de - scribes and commends the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	recreation work .

		His book will help satisfy the curiosity of our stay-at-home public about the everyday routine of life at the front ; and a chapter of suggestions about what to send , and what not to send , to the Sammies should prove even more useful than the appended glossary of army slang .

		`` The Animal Mind , '' by
Margaret Floy Wash	PERSON	- burn -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.90	MONEY	-RRB- has in its second edition been subjected to a thorough and comprehensive revision .

		So much has been added to our knowl - edge of animal behavior in the last decade that the data , and in part the interpretation , must be pre - sented in altered perspective .

		Along with this increased activity , which has brought about a special technique for animal study the product of the joint interest of the biologist and the psychologist the position of comparative psychology has become more central to the interpretation of human behavior .

		All these interests are admirably presented in Pro- fessor
Washburn	PERSON	's work .

		The volume is well suited to the needs of college students ; and its availability should act as an encouragement to the introduction of such courses in institutions that set value upon adequate surveys of the essential fields in the broad domain of the mind .

		Though a wan humor plays over the characters in `` Children of Passage , '' by
Frederick Watson	PERSON	-LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , there is a pervading gloom as of
Highland	LOCATION	mists and mildewed Scottish castles .

		The poor but proud and noble heroine and the ancestor - less millionaire lover are familiar figures which the author has not endowed with any particular dis -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413 tinction .

		Their fortunes fluctuate a bit tediously through the three hundred odd pages , and in the end the hero enlists and the fragile heroine is denied any real earthly happiness .

		Both are allowed the rather doubtful satisfaction of looking forward to some future state where impecunious nobility is supposed to have much in common with plebeian prosperity .

		``
Kitty Canary	PERSON	, '' by
Kate Langley Bosher	PERSON	-LRB- Har - pers ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is a `` glad '' book with a typically loving and cheerful heroine who finds a congenial back - ground for her romantic optimism in a typically Southern village .


Kitty Canary	PERSON	more sedately
Katherine Bird	PERSON	is a precociously philosophical young person , deeply concerned with life and given to high-handed management of her own and other people 's affairs .

		When Father or Miss Susanna shows signs of insubordination ,
Kitty Canary	PERSON	just whirls the objector giddily about the room and after this joyful exercise her wishes are pursued with astonishing docility .

		Lovers are reunited ; a sick wife is nursed back to health ; a selfish husband is punished ; dowdy spinsters are transformed ; and other desirable changes are speedily effected .

		At the end , the heroine 's own love affairs are satis - factorily arranged .

		The village life and characters are pleasantly suggested ; and doubtless the story will contain many charms for girl readers of board - ing school age .

		`` The Neapolitan Lovers '' -LRB- Brentano ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- is an historical novel by the famous author of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' and `` The Three Muske - teers . ''

		Frankly , unless one be of that happy broth - erhood of readers who `` thoroughly enjoy '' his - torical romance , this story is to be read when one is sixteen and cares little if a book be neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring .

		The older reader , used to and demanding credible psychology , is likely to find the story of the story more interesting than the novel itself .

		For , according to the introduction by
R. S. Garnett	PERSON	, the book 's translator , ``
Dumas	PERSON	had long awaited an opportunity of dealing with the
Neapolitan Claudius	PERSON	and the Venetian Mes - salina -LRB-
King Ferdinand	LOCATION	and Queen
Maria Caro	PERSON	- lina -RRB- .

		He might have said in the words of Hernani : ` La meurtre est entre nous affaire de famille . '

		In
1851	DATE	Dumas wrote : ` Perhaps some day my filial vengeance will evoke these two blood - stained spectres and force them to pose in naked hideousness before posterity . ' ''

		For it seems that
King Ferdinand	LOCATION	was
Dumas	PERSON	's father 's murderer , and
Dumas	PERSON	's lifelong desire was for revenge .

		It was through
Garibaldi	PERSON	, who had installed
Dumas	PERSON	in the
Chiatamone Palace	LOCATION	with permission to exam - ine the secret archives of the city , that the author found the unique set of public documents , manu - scripts , and letters which the hangman had reserved for the
King	LOCATION	.

		And anyone who has read even one of
Dumas	PERSON	's many historical romances may easily imagine that writer 's delight at the opportunity .

		This interesting explanation of the writing of the novel , then , may excusably be given in lieu of a review ; there is n't a hint in the romance itself that it is done to revenge the murder of the author 's father .

		What the critics say about that most amaz - ing story of the war Gunner Depew An American sailor in the service of
France	LOCATION	`` It is impossible to laud too highly the optimism and laughing good nature , even amid battle scenes , wounds and death , unfolded in this remarkable story of his part in the big war , as played by an American sailor boy .

		It is the frankest , most natural story of its kind .

		The word-pictures of battle scenes are splendidly written .

		But the most graphic writing in the book is where
Depew	PERSON	describes his experience as a prisoner of war in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''


Portland Ore	LOCATION	- ffonian .

		``
Depew	PERSON	's story needs no embroidering , no exaggera - tions .

		It is a tale that would loom in graphic quality if told in words of one syllable .

		That part of it which relates to the voyage of terror on the Y arrow - dale has been told in its completeness by no other writer . ''

April 25 , 1918	DATE	A Square Deal for the Crippled Soldier When the crippled soldier returns from the front , the govern - ment will provide for him , in addition to medical care , special training for self-support .

		But whether this will really put him back on his feet depends on what the public does to help or hinder .

		In the past , the attitude of the public has been a greater handicap to the cripple than his physical disability .

		People have assumed him to be helpless .

		Too often , they have persuaded him to become so .

		For the disabled soldier there has been `` hero-worship ; '' for the civilian cripple there has been a futile kind of sympathy .

		Both do the cripple more harm than good .

		All the cripple needs is the kind of job he is fitted for , and per - haps a little training in preparation for it .

		There are hundreds of seriously crippled men now holding down jobs of importance .

		Other cripples can do likewise , if given the chance .

		Idleness is the calamity too hard to be borne .

		Your service to the crippled man , therefore , is to find for him a good busy job , and encourage him to tackle it .

		Demand of the cripple that he get back in the work of the world , and you will find him only too ready to do so .

		For the cripple who is occupied is , in truth , no longer handicapped .

		Can the crippled soldier or the industrial cripple as well count on you as a true and sensible friend ?

		RED CROSS INSTITUTE FOR CRIPPLED AND DISABLED MEN .311 Fourth Avenue

Si Ubranr	PERSON	, AL Journal of Criticism ana 2D -LRB- 0cu00ion of EiUratute ana Internationalism as the Condition of Allied Success We have pretty general agreement that the aim of the war , as far as
America	LOCATION	is concerned , is a completer internationalism than we have known in the past a better international order by virtue of which the world will be made safe .

		But the general attitude to that aim is that it is something to be established after victory is won , when we have time and power to carry out political ideals and to try experiments .

		Meantime we are likely to feel that it is better to `` get on with the war '' and to leave Utopias alone , especially Utopias that have any relation to pacifist feeling , which it is well to bury as deep as possible .

		On the whole , perhaps , we feel that the less the public concerns itself in war time with policy at all , the better .

		It is here suggested that this attitude may be disastrous , even in its military consequences ; that , indeed , it has already been so ; that the progressive development during the war of internationalist policy and feeling is an indispensable condition of the military success of our alliance ; that the failure sufficiently to recognize this is one of the main factors of the greatest reverses so far suffered by the alliance .

		It is of course obvious that in the case of a war fought by a large alliance , made up of a number of nations different in character and outlook , success depends not only upon the individual strength of each member , but also upon the capacity of those members to act together for a com - mon purpose .

		And it will readily be admitted that such capacity of many states to act together is in theory `` international - ism . ''

		But , it will be retorted , these things are truisms , so obvious as to be in no danger of oversight , and certainly need - ing no reinforcement from internationalist theory .

		Well , it is just three years and eight months after the beginning of the war that we find Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, pointing to one factor alone as explaining the success of the Ger - man drive .

		The enemy was `` slightly inferior in infantry , slightly inferior in artillery , considerably inferior in cavalry , undoubtedly inferior in aircraft . ''

		But there was one thing in which he was superior unity .

		`` In so far as he has triumphed , he has triumphed mainly be - cause of superior unity , and the concen - tration of his strategic plans . ''

		And the Prime Minister reinforced the point by the story which had come to him from a re - liable source , that the
Kaiser	PERSON	had said to
King Constantine	PERSON	, `` I shall beat them , for they have no united command . ''

		But that , it will be replied , can no longer be said .

		We have now a united command , even if it has taken nearly four years of war to get it .

		Unity of military command however will simply be a trap unless it is based upon unity of political purpose : unless forged in certain condi - tions of public temper and purpose , it will be an instrument that will break in the hand .

		Of what use would unity of com - mand have been
two years ago	DATE	, if at work behind the lines were all the forces that brought about the misunderstanding of the real nature of the revolutionary forces of
Russia	LOCATION	and so the defection of
Russia	LOCATION	; the divergence of purpose between
Italy	LOCATION	and Servia and
Greece	LOCATION	, the alienation of the Southern Slavs ?

		And if in the near future , or for that matter at the peace conference after the defeat of the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	, Allied policy is of such a nature as to drive , or to allow ,
Russia	LOCATION	to drift into the German orbit and become a Prus - sian asset ; as to alienate
Japan	LOCATION	, to develop the elements of revolution in
Ireland	LOCATION	and a divergence of purpose as between the American and the British or French democ - racies if elements of disunity of such a character develop in our alliance , the assertion of permanently preponderant 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	power over the Prussian may well become impossible .

		And such a failure would be a failure of policy due to a certain condition of public temper and feeling , a failure to evolve a really common aim and to em - phasize the internationalist element of our purposes .

		The conclusion so far might be sum - marized thus : The military success of the Allies de - pends upon certain political factors as , for instance , upon the unity of the alliance , the absence of such misunder - standing as might well grow up with
Japan	LOCATION	, or internal disintegration such as that which has put
Russia	LOCATION	out of the war as well as upon the more material ele - ments , both men and munitions , to which attention is more readily given .

		These non-military factors , which are indispensable to military success , depend upon good management by the civilian rulers the politicians .

		Effective civilian rule depends upon civilian public opinion ; it is civilian opinion alone which , for instance , in
Europe	LOCATION	deposes one government , like that of Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	, in favor of an - other , like that of Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	.

		If that change was wise , it must greatly have facilitated the task of the soldier ; if unwise , greatly have hindered it .

		Now stated in that form , these propo - sitions are almost truisms .

		Yet they run directly counter to the position so easily assumed that the public can have nothing to do with policy , or that policy has noth - ing to do with military success .

		The grave fact in the history of the war is that public opinion in some of the Allied countries has at some junctures , with the best intentions in the world , been largely responsible for errors of policy which have added enormously to the military difficulties .

		Internal upheavals , changes of policies and cabinets , sudden losses of confidence , errors in relations with allies have occurred , sometimes , because sin - cerely patriotic people have overlooked the fact that intensity of feeling and emo - tion however good of themselves can - not stand for sound political judgment .

		There are situations in life in which sheer emotional fervor is the one thing necessary to carry one through to safety ; but there are others as when someone cries `` fire '' in a crowded theatre when our instinct not only will not furnish any sure guide as to the right thing to do but will beyond doubt destroy us if we obey it .

		The great need in such circumstances is to `` keep our heads '' ; there must be a certain moral discipline .

		Unless we maintain a certain atmosphere of public opinion , a capacity for sane and sound judgment sufficient to enable us to differentiate between good and bad policy , we make it impossible for the soldier to bring us victory , whatever his efficiency and sacrifice .

		No one will pretend that this relation between a certain condition of public tem - per the need for a wider realization of the indispensability of internationalism and our ultimate military success , is gener - ally recognized .

		It is all but universally ignored .

		It has taken British and French radicalism three years to realize the need for clarifying and emphasizing the inter - nationalist aims of policy as the means whereby disruption of the alliance by fur - ther defections like that of
Russia	LOCATION	may be avoided .

		American public opinion so little realizes the explanation of that de - velopment of policy in European democra - cies , that it shows itself on the whole hostile thereto .

		American public opinion today seems as little disposed to give due weight to certain forces at work in
Britain	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	as were the European Allies a year ago to give due weight to certain forces in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The impatient refusal to consider the nature of these present forces may be as disastrous to our cause in the future as was the failure of
Europe	LOCATION	properly to estimate the nature of the Russian revolution .

		I have attempted to summarize the out - standing considerations in the thesis here broadly indicated by the following ex - tended proposition : The survival of the Western Democracies , in so far as that is a matter of the effective use of their force , depends upon their capacity to use it as a unit , during the war and after .

		That unity we have not attained , even for the purposes of the war , because we have re - fused to recognize its necessary conditions a kind and degree of internationalism
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 429 to which current political ideas and feel - ings are hostile , an internationalism which is not necessary to the enemy , but is to us .

		For
the Grand Alliance	ORGANIZATION	of the democra - cies is a heterogeneous collection of na - tions , not geographically contiguous but scattered over the world , and not domi - nated by one preponderant state able to give unity of direction to the group .

		The enemy alliance , on the other hand , is com - posed of a group of states , geographically contiguous , dominated politically and mil - itarily by the material power and geo - graphical position of one member , able by that fact to impose unity of purpose and direction on the whole .

		If we are to use our power successfully against him in such circumstances during the war , at the set - tlement , and afterwards -LRB- which may well be necessary -RRB- we must achieve a consoli - dation equally effective .

		But in our case that consolidation , not being possible by the material predominance of one mem - ber , must be achieved by a moral factor , the voluntary cooperation of equals a democratic internationalism , necessarily based on a unity of moral aim .

		Because this has not been attained , even during the war , disintegration of our alliance has al - ready set in involving enormous military cost and threatens to become still more acute at the peace .

		The enemy group shows no equivalent disintegration .

		No military decision against the unified enemy group can be permanent if at the peace table it becomes evident that the Western Democracies are to revert to the old lack of consolidation , instability of alliance , covert competition for isolated power and territory , a national particular - ism which makes common action and co - ordination of power cumbrous , difficult , or impossible .

		If there is to be a return to the old disunity of
Europe	LOCATION	the parties which among the enemy favor aggression will realize that however much their pur - pose may temporarily be defeated , the greater material unity of their alliance will enable it sooner or later to overcome states which , though superior in the sum of their power , have shown themselves inferior in their capacity to combine that power for a common purpose .

		And that inferiority might arise as much from passive hostility to abandoning the old national organiza - tion of
Europe	LOCATION	, from sheer lack of habit and practice in international cooperation , political , military , or economic , as from the presence of any active agents of disruption .

		The factors of disintegration in the
Grand Alliance	ORGANIZATION	are of two kinds : conflict - ing territorial claims by the component states -LRB- illustrated by the demands of
Czarist Russia	LOCATION	; of
Italy	LOCATION	,
Servia	LOCATION	, and other Slav groups ; of
Roumania	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and , more obscurely , of
Japan	LOCATION	-RRB- and conflict of economic interest and social aspiration within the nations -LRB- illustrated by the strug - gles of the bourgeois and Socialist parties in
Russia	LOCATION	, less dramatically by the revolu - tionary unrest in
Italy	LOCATION	, and even in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		These latter factors are more dangerous with us than with the enemy , because our historical circum - stances have rendered us less disciplined or less docile , less apt in mechanical and dehumanized obedience .

		The general truth we are here dealing with is of far greater importance to us than to the enemy .

		He can in some meas - ure ignore it .

		We can not .

		His unity , in so far as it rests upon moral factors , can be based upon the old nationalist concep - tions ; our unity depends upon a revision of them , an enlargement into an interna - tionalism .

		The kind and degree of international - ism indispensable for the consolidation of the Western peoples if they are to use their force effectively an internationalism which must take into account the newer social and economic forces of Western society is impossible on the basis of the older statecraft and its political motives .

		For they assume as inevitable a condition of the world in which each nation must look for its security to its own isolated strength -LRB- which must derive from pop - ulation , territory , and strategic position -RRB- , thus making the ultimate interests of the nations necessarily rival .

		The capacity of each to feed its population and assure its economic welfare is assumed to depend upon the extent of its territory .

		A whole philosophy of `` biological necessity , '' `` struggle for life among nations , '' `` inher - ent pugnacity of mankind , '' `` survival of 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	the fit , '' is invoked on behalf of this old and popular conception of international life and politics .

		Such an outlook inevit - ably implies an overt or latent rivalry which must bring even members of the same alliance sooner or later into conflict .

		The only possible unifying alternative to this disruptive policy is the form of internationalism outlined by President
Wilson	PERSON	, based on the assumption that the vital interests of all Western nations are interdependent and call for some perma - nent association of nations by which the security of each shall be made to rest upon the strength of the whole , held together by the reciprocal obligation to defend one another .

		The greatest obstacles to such a system are disbelief in its feasibility and our sub - jection to the traditions of national sov - ereignty and independence .

		Were it gener - ally believed in and desired , it would be not only feasible but inevitable .

		Our gov - ernments could aid in the modification of old ideas through bold and definite projects of change and a new machinery of inter - national representation , compelling pub - lic imagination to take stock of its current conceptions .

		Such references as have been made by Allied statesmanship to these projects have carried the implication that they do not concern the actual waging of the war , or are put forward as an alternative to its continuance .

		And that of itself has suf - ficed to prevent any real consideration of them .

		Yet the internationalism of which President
Wilson	PERSON	has shown himself to be the most consistent advocate is not a sub - stitute for military power , or an alterna - tive to the active prosecution of the war ; it is an essential part of the political means by which the military power of democra - cies , and the actual prosecution of this war , may be made effective .

		It is not some remote aim of the future , but the policy which must be made the basis of our own alliance , for the purposes of the war itself , and for the continued resistance of our group , to the end that we may use our victory effectively by coming to the peace table a united and cohesive league .

		If this is not already an accomplished fact when we do come to the settlement , the disruptive tendencies within the alliance may well be intensified and our problems of justice and security become insoluble .


NORMAN ANGELL	PERSON	.

		Letters to Unknown Women SAPPHO To Sappho of Mitylene : Like so many notorious characters of history you have become an enigma , as ambiguous as an oracle .

		So little can be proved , so much surmised about you tradition is so incoherent and conflicting that each person makes you a projection of what he desires you to be .

		And if it be true that our thoughts of the dead alone preserve them in the fields of Hades , then yours must indeed be a soul of many conflicting personalities .

		The
Sappho of Pierre Louys	ORGANIZATION	would not be recognized by the
Sappho	PERSON	of Miss
Jane Harrison	PERSON	, and the
Sappho of Ovid	ORGANIZATION	would be uneasy with either .

		It has been suggested that you were not one but two .

		You have been reck - lessly given a husband and a daughter and as recklessly deprived of them .

		You have been described as a debauched creature and as a school mistress ; you have been drowned for the sake of a man 's love in the ^ Egean and buried in an Aeolic grave by your girl lovers .

		Swinburne has shown you as a nerve-tortured fierce thing , cry - ing upon death ; and Lyly has made you an allegory of the
Virgin Queen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your character , O sweet-smiling weaver of wiles , is varied and dubious .

		You have been described as everything except a woman .

		Yet your reputation , O Sappho , is en - viable ; you are , perhaps , the most famous of all women .

		Those who have never read a word you wrote and those who
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 431 have studied you to the last syllable are agreed in their estimate of your genius ; while those who have glanced carelessly at your poetry wonder upon what your repu - tation rests .

		Well , it rests upon the mys - tery that surrounds you .

		That mystery is due to a Hebrew tent - maker who , some five hundred years after your death , preached with extraordinary vigor a dogma of more than
Lacedaemo	PERSON	- nian austerity , with the result that later generations in a frenzy of perverted de - structiveness wrecked and burned much that the genius of Hellas had created your poems among them .

		All that we have of you are a few tattered , almost unread - able papyri and such fragments as were quoted by grammarians and critics still extant .

		But the fate that destroyed your work created your reputation .

		We are thrilled by those fragments as by no other poetry in the world , and your fame as the greatest woman-poet of all time remains unchallenged because it can not be disputed .

		Therefore , sweet nightingale , herald of the
spring	DATE	, you prove indeed that unheard melodies are the sweeter .

		To some you are more marvelous as lover than as poet .

		Some are terrified by the fierceness , the madness of your pas - sions and will `` mistranslate and miscon - strue '' to prove you respectable .

		I have already mentioned the fable which has invented two Sapphos , one a matron of eminence and purity who produced your poetry , and one a courtesan who lived your loves !

		If the shades beyond Acheron can smile I am sure your smile is not un - tinged with irony .

		But even this has been bettered and you are represented as an even more commonplace person , a cul - tured , Ruskin-like school mistress presid - ing in all chastity and severity over vir - tuous girls who came to your school to learn poetry .

		Laugh ,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, laugh among the shadowy asphodels where you lie with
Anaktoria	LOCATION	and
Erinna	PERSON	that such things should be said of you , you who from love were paler than sun-dried grass , who sang to please your girl lovers , whose limbs were mastered and shaken by bitter - sweet love , whose soul trembled with de - sire a wind on the mountain falling on the oaks who knew like
Nossis	PERSON	what flowers were the roses of Aphrodite and who mourned when
Atthis	PERSON	left you for Andromeda !

		No ,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, there are some of us so unrepentant that we can not bear to think of you confined in the straight garb of a blameless life .

		`` To the pure all things are pure '' is of all your fragments that most frequently quoted by your moral apologists .

		They are innocent of irony .

		We , perhaps , are too delighted by that quality .

		In any case we prefer the
Sappho of Nossis	ORGANIZATION	and
Renee Vivien	PERSON	to the school mistress .

		It has been your fortune , O Sappho , to be loved not only in your lifetime but after your death .

		When we read those honey-sweet words of Nossis she upon whose tablets melted the wax we feel the slow thrill of a mortal passion stir within us ; and though many have loved you since Nossis , none with so complete an aban - donment as that wistful girl from the great waste beyond the pillars of Hercules who died in
Hellas	LOCATION	because , it seems , our world was not fair enough for one who had sur - prised your secret and looked at beauty through your eyes .

		The world claims you ,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, the world which has lent too ready an ear to the Hebrew tent-maker whose works de - stroyed yours ; the world of school masters and rich common folk claims you , explains you away , lest in their own time loveliness should be justified through you .

		But sometimes , in great loneliness , your voice falls upon us as it fell once upon the poet of Anaktoria who loved you so , and you become ours , ours only .

		We such is our self-esteem seem for a moment really to understand you , really to be one of those whom you call to the golden cups of the Cyprian .

		You become a moment in our lives , a visible embodiment of that abstract beauty of Plato .

		The pride and pathos of your life are ours also and we know why you loved evening that brings back all good things the dawn has stolen and why you sang of the hyacinth trodden underfoot by the careless shepherd .

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		432 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE
The True Authority of Science When	ORGANIZATION	we envisage the problems of higher education in our country nothing seems more desirable than to gain a sane view of the relations of cultural and utili - tarian studies .

		It is not yet sufficiently realized that the failure of the classical curriculum was even greater on the cul - tural than on the practical side : the peda - gogues of the old school were , indeed , successful in imparting a stock of largely useless information , but they were by the very nature of their training unfitted to convey that self-knowledge which consti - tutes the essence of true culture .

		On the specious plea that our modern civilization rested on a foundation supplied by class - ical antiquity , they argued that we could only understand ourselves by imbibing the spirit of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Quite apart from the wholly incongruous machinery they employed to compass this end , they failed to realize that the basis of our cul - ture , both economic and industrial , lay far back of the Hellenic period ; and that pre - cisely what is most characteristic of our own age technology and experimental science is hardly derived at all from classical - sources .

		At the very best , then , they could have interpreted merely some shreds and patches of that mottled fabric we now prize as Caucasian civilization .

		But if our classical schoolmasters failed of achieving their avowed purpose , our modern institutions of learning , with their stress on technical and vocational training , likewise fall short of the mark .

		The stu - dent , take him by and large , learns much of scientific detail ; but of the essence of science , of its place in modern life and the conditions fostering or impeding its growth , he remains densely ignorant .

		These , it might be contended on Grad - grind principles , are all very well but have no place in an avowedly utilitarian course .

		Yet the implied antinomy is false .

		There is no inherent conflict between professional and cultural work .

		Pomology itself , to take the bull by the horns , is not without cultural potentialities .

		On the other hand , it is precisely the lack of this cultural ele - ment in our modern American universi - ties and professional schools that thwarts the highest professional accomplishment .

		Here , then , are the double claims of the
History of Science	ORGANIZATION	to a large , nay a domi - nant , position in our college curricula .

		To the general student it renders intelligible the most distinctive element of latter-day culture , while also it teaches the student of science how to be a student of science .

		These purposes , naturally enough , can not be attained by an uncoordinated accumula - tion of names and dates ; their fulfilment depends on the accentuation of the socio - logical view of science .

		Precisely because science has come to occupy so large a part in modern civiliza - tion , its pursuit has been invested with a mystifying halo which Huxley trenchantly dispelled by defining science as merely a sort of etherealized common sense .

		The scientist , too often yielding to the siren voice of his unsophisticated admirer among the laity , postulates an impossible `` scientific man '' as useless an abstraction as that notorious figment the `` econom - ic man , '' which now graces the refuse - heaps of the political philosopher 's laboratory .

		The truth is that science can be understood solely as a sociological phe - nomenon , as the product of cooperative group activity within a larger social group .

		It may not be flattering to the scientist 's pride to be classed with the members of a guild , a cooperative dairy organization , or a consumers ' league ; but scientific work in its nobler and its lesser aspects becomes comprehensible as soon as it is regarded from this angle .

		With mutual benefit societies of the type described , the informally organized but none the less real brotherhood of sci - entists shares the merging of individual profit in a higher purpose .

		If the effects of scientific cooperation sometimes extend far beyond the immediate circle of the workers ' guild , this must be accounted a by-product rather than an altruistically devised result .

		But membership in an ostensibly altruistic society neither sup - presses the instinct of selfishness nor does it reduce all participants to a dead level of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 433 equality .

		In the rural organizations founded by
Raiffeisen	ORGANIZATION	the benignant spirit of their founder proved to be very unequally distributed among the members ; and so in scientific cooperation the quest of individual glory , as attested by many a nauseating priority squabble , tends to thwart or compromise the common pur - pose .

		Since scientists form a definite group -LRB- or more strictly a number of groups -RRB- within the state , it is possible for a clash of social interests to retard their progress .

		Church and state may interfere to erect obstacles in their path .

		The friction between research and theology forms the burden of an oft repeated tale .

		Legal enactments against vivisection and the util - ization of corpses are a grim reminder that the scientist 's course is not yet strewn with roses .

		Yet as soon as we assume the sociological point of view the whole mat - ter appears in a new light .

		It is not a priori obvious that the scientist must under all circumstances have the right of way .

		Sociologically his ideals represent only one of an indefinitely numerous set of values .

		As the caste of scientists can not endure the over-assertiveness of individual members , so society at large may legitimately wax jealous of the dominance of a caste within its midst .

		May not science appear to the laity as a harmless pastime like chess , or stamp collecting ?

		No one would interfere with such pursuits under normal condi - tions , yet who would yield to them pur - poses of his own ?

		It is here that history must step in to vindicate the ways of sci - ence and show why the standards of sci - ence merit absolute primacy over other values .

		But still more fascinating than the inter - action of selfish and altruistic motives within the guild of learning , or than the conflict of that caste with other castes , is the influence of the group on the intel - lectual work of its single members .

		The individual scientist finds himself in a para - doxical position .

		Without the guild her - itage from the past or the aid of his contemporaries he is powerless .

		Yet that same society which raises him high above the level of earliest beginnings arrests his flight when he takes wing to soar aloft .

		Chafe and fume as he may , he is caught in the vise-like grip of a dread machine .

		For social groups have laws more inexor - able than those of nature , and no victim escapes without paying toll .

		A relatively harmless sociological char - acteristic of the scientists ' group is the importance of imitation .

		Ethnologists have long been familiar with this factor in various domains of culture .

		A set form of artistic product or ritualistic perform - ance springs up and is somehow adopted as a norm , which is reproduced a hundred - fold .

		Science , too , has its fashions and patterns , and like other fashions they change periodically .

		Thirty years ago biologists were outlining genealogical trees ; today they are absorbed in the laws of heredity .

		In the seventies and eighties ethnologists were mapping the resem - blances that obtained between the cultures of remote tribes ; at present their gaze is riveted to historical connections and routes of diffusion .

		Such fashions are not dic - tated by pure reason ; nor are they purely innocuous .

		The scientist caught in the maelstrom of a current movement is likely to lose his sense of values : he neglects what a later period regards as no less sig - nificant than the topic on which he lav - ishes his attention .

		It is the history of his science that alone may bring him to his senses , that may enable him to get his bearings and see his own work in proper perspective ; and it is thus the history of his own subject and that alone which can supply his individual need of culture .

		Scientific fashions of the kind mentioned represent only one phase of the subtle workings of that social menace which con - stitutes the arch-foe of science and of prog - ress respect for authority .

		The authority may be vested in the person of a master ; and here history notes the paradox that the very personality that rises to ascend - ancy by setting at naught the power of precedent , itself becomes a new centre of traditionalism , blighting the development of the disciples ' individualities .

		Yet bane - ful as is the influence of hero-worship , there are still more insidious agencies lurking in the social environment so dif - ferent from the fictitious atmosphere of pure reason in which the scientist actu - 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	ally works .

		By a law of compensation one personality will sooner or later be pitted against another and gain a following .

		But against impersonal authority there is little hope of redress .

		It is not merely the opin - ions of the scholars ' caste as such that weight down the individual seeker of truth .

		From the very beginning he has borne the yoke of a divided allegiance ; nor does he only individually bear the badge of mem - bership in other guilds .

		The whole caste of truth-seekers is ever , by a dire osmosis , tinged by the current conceptions of their age ; nay , it is histor - ically accurate to say that from the start they have been tainted with that larger human society 's original sin of myth-mon - gering .

		As Professor Mach points out in one of the most illuminating chapters of his `` Mechanics , '' a
Newton	LOCATION	himself will lapse into the folklore bequeathed by the past , `` though even on the pages imme - diately preceding his clear intellect shines in undiminished splendor . ''

		And a mod - ern physicist who purports to give experi - mental proof for the atomic theory already casts wistful glances into the future for some subtler hypothetical cause of the now verified atomic phenomena .

		The vicious circle is thus complete .

		Sci - ence has demonstrably , as in the case of chemistry and alchemy , grown out of mythology , and the whole of its progress may be represented as the gradual slough - ing of the folkloristic shell .

		But that shell has infinite powers of regeneration and is constantly nurtured from without and within .

		Indeed , the more we contemplate the conditions of research , the more we marvel at the fact that the scientist 's quest has not been an utter failure .

		He must guard against the promptings of self-inter - est ; he must shun the tutorship of his mas - ters ; he must constantly search his heart to cast out the demons of prepossessions sucked in with the mother 's milk and the surrounding medium in which he lives .

		This duty of eternal vigilance is the lesson he derives from the history of science .

		But for the laymen , too , the history of science has a message hardly less signifi - cant .

		The pursuit of knowledge by an international band of trained workers con - stitutes a sociological experiment on a ` grand scale with results of a crushing a fortiori force .

		No conditions exist , none can be conceived , more favorable to the dominance of reason in any social body than those which actually obtain in the cooperative labor of scientists .

		If even these conditions are so remote from the ideal , if the forces of precedent and myth constantly nullify or minimize progress towards the projected goal , degrading it to one of those ritualistic processions in which every three groping steps in advance are followed by two backward , then the mystic 's view of the danger of excessive rationalization of modern culture is gro - tesquely false .

		As Professor
Robinson	PERSON	in one of the highest flights of historical - mindedness points out , there is not the slightest warrant for putting on the brakes when going uphill .

		Mankind will never be sufficiently radical or sufficiently reason - able ; and as we can never introduce too little reason into our psychologizing , so we can never be too rationalistic in our phi - losophy or too radical in our programmes .

		Herein lies the supreme lesson of the His - tory of Science .


ROBERT H. LOWIE	PERSON	.

		The Return Lilies white and roses Will load the fragrant breeze , But when the mute throng closes We 'll take no note of these .

		Soft music will be swelling In each attentive ear , Of pride and homage telling We shall not heed nor hear .

		There will be talk of slaughter , Of rage and carnage hot Beyond the pathless water But we shall heed them not .

		Around us long-loved faces With tearful eyelids bright Shall take their wonted places Unseen , though full in sight .

		Through tributes fond and loving We 'll go as if at rest , With fast-closed eyes unmoving , Hands crossed upon the breast .

		GUY NEARING .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 435 Our
Paris	LOCATION	Letter Life in
Paris	LOCATION	has been anything but peaceful during the last month .

		Treason `` affairs , '' air raids , long range bombardments everything has been put in the shade by the great battle on which attention is now concentrated , for on its issue may depend the fate of
Paris	LOCATION	and of
France	LOCATION	.


Paris	LOCATION	is waiting , as it waited during that fort - night of
September , 1914	DATE	when its destiny hung in the balance .

		When , after those days of acute tension , the welcome news came that
Paris	LOCATION	was saved , none of us thought that we should ever have to undergo the same experience again .

		And now after nearly four years of war
Paris	LOCATION	is once more threatened .

		The danger , it is true , is not so imminent , but it is there nevertheless .

		I lived with the people of
Paris	LOCATION	during that terrible fortnight and acquired a profound affection and admiration for them .

		When I say the people , I mean what we name in French the peuple as distinct from the bourgeoisie , for the bourgeoisie for the most part was at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	or anywhere but in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Only the real Parisians were left , and in spite of the anxieties of the moment
Paris	LOCATION	was never so charming .

		Now as then
Paris	LOCATION	is left to the Parisians and the Americans .

		Not those Americans , I may add , who inhabit the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne , but the Americans whom the war has brought here to teach the Parisians that they must not judge the
United States	LOCATION	by its idle rich .

		Whatever else may come out of this war , at least it will have enabled the French to have made the acquaintance of real Americans .

		Some Americans , I gather , are a little disillusioned .

		They had idealized the French to such an extent that when they came into contact with them and discovered that they were not all heroes of romance , but just human beings with the ordinary failings of humanity , they were dis - appointed .

		Especially as the particular failings of the French their lack of business habits , for instance are not those common , as a rule , in
America	LOCATION	.

		An American is disconcerted in a country where time does not count , where every - body is late for his appointments , and where a man that calls on you on business will talk for half an hour on everything except the object of his visit and be seriously offended if you show signs of impatience .

		But all that is bound to wear off , and when Americans really get to know the French they will put up with their weaknesses for every one of us has his own and appreciate their great qualities .

		Meanwhile , I hasten to add , if Americans are sometimes irritated a trifle by certain unaccustomed conditions , they never show it .

		The tact of the men in control of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can `` bureaux , '' and their care to avoid the slight - est ruffling of the French susceptibilities , are beyond all praise .

		At a time like this one sees the people of
Paris	LOCATION	at their best , for only the best elements remain .

		There has been a tremendous exodus during the last fortnight , and the population of
Paris	LOCATION	must be temporarily reduced by about one fourth .

		The railway stations have been an extraordinary sight , only to be compared with that which they pre - sented during the exodus of
1914	DATE	.

		No seats can now be reserved and no luggage is registered .

		Tickets have to be taken in advance for a specified train , and there have been long queues of people waiting for hours to get them ; a few days ago an acquaintance of mine had to wait at the Gare d'Orsay from six to eleven in the
morning	TIME	, and many people have had to wait longer .

		The pres - sure is now reduced , but it is still bad enough .

		I have always refused 1 ; o wait in a queue for any - thing , for it is my firm conviction that. , nothing in life is worth it , and neither air raids , nor bom - bardments , nor even the remote danger of a German invasion of
Paris	LOCATION	will induce me to change the habits of a lifetime .

		Besides , when one has
Paris	LOCATION	`` dans le sang , '' to desert her in the hour of danger would seem like deserting one 's mistress .

		But the wealthy and fashionable quar - ters of
Paris	LOCATION	are deserted , and one would imagine , as one walks down the avenues that stretch from the Palace de 1 ` Etoile , the Boulevard Malesherbes or the Avenue des Champs-Elysees and its abut - ting thoroughfares , that it was the end of
August	DATE	instead of the beginning of
April	DATE	.

		Only the tender green of the
spring	DATE	foliage corrects the impression given by the long rows of shuttered windows .

		The well-to-do have been joined in their exodus by the casual inhabitants of
Paris	LOCATION	, those that have come here from the country to earn a living , especially domestic servants , em - ployees of dressmakers and milliners , and so on .

		As the press is forbidden to publish any details about the air raids or the bombardment , gro - tesquely exaggerated reports about their effects have been circulated in the provinces , and panic - stricken families in country towns and villages have implored their relatives in
Paris	LOCATION	to return home at once .

		But the real Parisian peuple remains , as in
1914	DATE	.

		The popular attitude is also the same as in
1914	DATE	, rather pessimistic and quite philosophical ; 436 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	pessimistic , that is to say , in the general and somewhat inaccurate sense of the term .

		The newspapers preach the duty of blind confidence , but the naturally skeptical Parisian , who has heard this duty preached for nearly four years and has observed that blind confidence has not been justified by events , turns a deaf ear .

		With his innate good sense he recognizes too that his feelings about events can have no influence on them .

		He is inclined to fear the worst , but at the same time he is firmly resolved to make the best of it .

		He knows that the French people and the French soldiers have done their utmost to secure success and that , if success be not achieved , `` tant pis . ''

		This war has made me doubtful about the advantages of education , for all through it the `` uneducated classes '' have shown that they possess much more good sense than their `` bet - ters , '' and have kept their heads much more successfully .

		The palm for unreason must cer - tainly be given to the `` intellectuals , '' who have talked more nonsense than any other class .

		One rarely hears among the people , for instance , the hysterical cant that so many newspapers have published about the air raids and the bombard - ment .

		Some journalists , whom one would never have suspected of religious fervor , have denounced the `` sacrilege '' involved in bombarding a church , thereby attributing to the Germans the amazing feat of taking an exact aim from a distance of seventy miles .

		The Parisian public , on the con - trary , is not disposed to make too much of inci - dents which , deplorable as they are , are trifles in comparison with what is going on at the front .

		The Parisians do not like being bombed and bombarded , but they take their risks coolly as inevitable consequences of war and feel that there is something indecent in shrieking at the death of a few score civilians in plain clothes at a moment when thousands of civilians in uniform are falling at the front .

		I sympathize with their attitude , for I have never been able to understand why the life of a man becomes of no value the moment he is dressed in blue or khaki .

		On one point popular opinion in
Paris	LOCATION	is very definite : this must be the last offensive of the war .

		The traditional good sense of the Parisian people tells them that if the German attack is repulsed it will be more than ever plain that no military solution is possible .

		An article by
M. Jean Longuet	PERSON	in the `` Populaire '' of
March 30	DATE	exactly expressed the opinion of the vast majority of the people of
Paris	LOCATION	and of
France	LOCATION	.

		There is , he said , only one immediate duty , to resist the attack ; but when it has been repulsed , the time will have come to negotiate .

		That the censor should have allowed such an article to appear without a word suppressed is in itself significant .

		It is the general opinion that the enemy is making his last desperate effort , an effort due to internal conditions in the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	quite as much as to military considerations ; if that effort fails , negotiations will perforce be much more easy .

		Of course there are still people , especially in newspaper offices , who talk about continuing the war for any number of years that may be neces - sary to obtain a military victory , but few of them are to be found among the proletariat or the peasants still fewer , I should suppose , among the men at the front .

		The old argument that if peace were made now there would be another war ten years hence , no longer has any effect .

		The reply is that it would be a less evil to have another war in ten years than to continue this war for ten years longer .

		Nobody here expects a peace which will establish the millennium or even an ideal peace from the democratic point of view , but again the good sense of the French man or woman of the people says that one can not always have what one would like , and besides there is no guarantee that if the war goes on for several years longer the millennium will be any nearer .

		Peace at any price has very few advo - cates , in fact none ; there is an irreducible mini - mum Lord Lansdowne defined it in his first letter but all beyond that is considered legiti - mate matter for negotiation .

		So thoroughly is this recognized by the peuple that certain jusqu'auboutiste pronouncements cabled to the French press from
America	LOCATION	have caused a certain uneasiness , although they have not destroyed confidence in the policy of Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	, with which they hardly accord .

		Their authors evidently do not yet realize what this war means and , in particular , what it means to
France	LOCATION	.

		Peace with defeat .

		will , of course , never be accepted , but President
Wilson	PERSON	's formula of `` peace without victory '' is not regarded wholly with disfavor .

		If all this sounds somewhat dis - couraged to Americans , they must remember what the French people have sacrificed in this war .

		The ordeal through which we are passing here makes it almost impossible to give one 's mind to anything but the war .

		But the other night , having been awakened by the alarm of an air raid at three in the
morning	TIME	, I began to read a book that had just come from the publishers , `` Le Socialisme centre 1 ` Etat '' -LRB- Berger-Levrault ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 437
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- , by
M. Emile Vandervelde	PERSON	, the distin - guished Belgian Socialist and President of the
International Socialist Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title will astonish many people , for it is a common fallacy that Socialism is identical with `` Etatisme '' why is there no English equivalent for that useful word ?


M. Vandervelde	PERSON	's purpose is to combat that fallacy , which , as he admits , is shared by many Socialists or persons claiming that title .

		He has no difficulty in showing that the Socialism of
Marx	PERSON	and
Engels	PERSON	, for instance , far from being etatiste , was exactly the contrary , for it aimed at the abolition of the state as we know it .

		If they admitted the conversion of certain serv - ices or industries , such as the railways , into state monopolies , it was only as a measure of transition , not as a final aim .

		And they never supposed that a state monopoly was Socialism .

		Many of their followers have even opposed all state monopolies as dangerous to the proletariat , on the ground that they paralyze the action of the working class and strengthen the bourgeoisie .


M. Vandervelde	PERSON	admits the danger if , for instance , the employees of the state are prevented from organizing them - selves and are deprived of the right to strike .

		The notion that Socialism can be brought about by the gradual absorption of production by the state or the municipalities that , for instance , the munici - palization of the gas or water is a step toward
State Socialism	ORGANIZATION	is a delusion .

		A bureaucratic
State Socialism	ORGANIZATION	such as is conceived by some of the leading members of the English Fabian Society would produce a servile community , in which the worker would be the `` wage-slave '' of a state official instead of a capitalist .

		To this conception , that of the organization of labor by the state , Socialism properly so-called opposes that of the organization of labor by the workers themselves , grouped in vast associations independ - ent of government .

		State control of industry has been so enor - mously extended by the war that this book is very opportune .

		That extension has been hailed by many Socialists as a triumph for their ideas and is feared by many opponents of Socialism for the same reason .

		It was necessary to demonstrate that these hopes and fears are alike mistaken , and
M. Vandervelde	PERSON	's demonstration is convincing .

		In fact state control of industry has greatly diminished the liberty of the workmen and ham - pered their collective action and it might easily be used to reduce them to complete subserviency and to make efforts at economic emancipation more difficult than ever .

		It is a maxim of Social Democracy that the workers should aim at the conquest of political power , so as to obtain control of the state in order to get rid of it .

		For the `` government of men '' Socialism would substitute the `` administration of things . ''

		But
M. Vandervelde	PERSON	shows that the conquest of polit - ical power alone will not be sufficient .

		One of the most interesting parts of his book is that in which he exposes the failure of political democ - racy and of the parliamentary system .

		It is a wholesome corrective to the notion that if Ger - many would only adopt the system of a govern - ment responsible to a parliament , all would be well .

		In fact , as
M. Vandervelde	PERSON	shows , the people has very little more effective influence on the government in the countries called demo - cratic than in the others .

		Perhaps , as
M. Vander	PERSON	- velde says , no country in the world is so com - pletely dominated by the financial interests as
France	LOCATION	, which has , in form , the institutions most nearly democratic of all the great nations , not excepting the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is much to be hoped that this book will be translated into English , for it is quite the most valuable work of the kind that has appeared for a long time .

		It would be impossible to give in so small a compass , for the book is quite short , a clearer exposition of what Socialism means and does not mean .


M. Vandervelde	PERSON	has an admirable style and makes his subject interesting to the least specialist of readers ; the book is essentially a popular one .

		Incidentally it should do much to reconcile with the Socialists those revolutionaries , or `` radicals '' as I believe you call them in Amer - ica , who rightly dread the restriction of individual liberty that would result from a system of state monopoly .

		The difference between Socialists and Syndicalists in
France	LOCATION	is chiefly one of method , and there is every sign of a rapprochement be - tween them due to the disgust of the younger Socialists with Parliamentarism and with the etatiste tendencies of some of their leaders , who are much nearer to the Italian `` Reformists '' and the English Fabians than to the
International Socialist	ORGANIZATION	party .

		A scission between these bour - geois Socialists and the adherents of revolutionary Socialism seems sooner or later inevitable .

		In any case , revolutionary Socialism is likely to be stronger than ever after the war and , whether one agrees or not with its principles and aims , it is desirable to know what they are .

		That knowl - edge can be obtained without difficulty from
M. Vandervelde	PERSON	's book .

		438 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	The Determinants of Culture CULTURE AND ETHNOLOGY .

		By
Robert H. Lowie	PERSON	.


Douglas C. McMurtrie	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		There was a time within the memory of men still living when the barely discovered presence of `` primitive man '' was made the occasion for the most elaborate theories of racial differences , of social evolution and social reform .

		The slender - est factual basis was made to carry the most imposing superstructures of speculation , in which patriotism of skin , hair , and language , tribal bias , and the desire to gain or maintain certain economic advantages were blended in the most fantastic manner with half-baked and half - digested data of cephalic indices , of skull sutures , of brain weights , and of cultural stages .

		These were the days when
Gobineau	PERSON	flourished , when
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Woltmann	LOCATION	, and
Wirth	PERSON	burned incense before an idol of their own making called the Aryan , and when a sanctimonious hypocrisy insisted on taking upon itself `` the white man 's burden '' at so much per cent .

		By its own weight and impetus the thing became , in the course of time , a frightful nuis - ance .

		Honest and reputable ethnologists were as afraid of a generalization as of leprosy .

		Prof.
Franz Boas	PERSON	, for example , than whom there is none greater in the field of ethnology , after a lifetime of research has ventured to put forth generalizations covering less than three hundred scanty pages .

		Yet while scientific ethnologists were chary of generalizations , others with the meagerest ethnological information came forth and presented to an expectant world the awful spectacle of the passing of the great race , or put to us the terrible query : race or mongrel ?

		Unbiased thinkers will therefore be more than grateful to Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	for having come out bravely and stated in popular language the exact limits within which any generalizations in ethnol - ogy can safely be made , given the present state of our knowledge concerning primitive man .

		Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	briefly discusses three of the unilateral interpretations of culture the psycho - logical , the racial , and the environmental and comes to the sound conclusion that culture or civilization can not be interpreted in terms other than itself .

		Neither the geographical environ - ment , nor the biological structure of the race , nor the fundamental and general characteristics of the mental processes can account for the rise and continuation of civilization .

		If geographical environment is to account for it , how is it that the same geographical environment gives rise to two different civilizations ?

		If race is to account for it , how is it that a race as different from the white as is the Japanese has shown itself capable of taking over all the civilization of the white man and improving on much of it ?

		Or how account for the fact that the white race itself , although biologically the same for the last two thousand years , has shown such wide and enor - mous changes in civilization ?

		To speak of devel - opment or evolution in this connection is verbiage .

		What , then , does determine culture ?

		Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	realizes the difficulties in the way of any attempt at an analysis of the determinants of civilization , and his conclusions are given cau - tiously .

		He brings forth in explanation what might be called the principle of cumulative incre - ments .

		A very slight advantage of speed or originality or alertness or elasticity , given the complicated set of factors on which it has to work , will result in a very imposing structure .

		Given a certain group which possesses an indi - vidual who , by accident or by design , happens to have produced a better tool than was ever pro- duced before , that tool used by other individuals , with whatever additions they may have to make , will in the course of time result in a tool of greater versatility and effectiveness .

		It follows that the more people there are using such a tool the greater will be the additions made to it , the more it will be perfected , the more it will accom - plish , the greater the control it will give to its owner , and the greater are his possibilities of producing more and better tools .

		And civiliza - tion is chiefly a question of tools .

		It is easy to see now how all the other factors , which up till now were made singly to carry the responsibility of causing civilization , can find their place in such an explanation .

		If race has anything to do with civilization , it probably works in the manner suggested by
McDougal	ORGANIZATION	in the investigation car - ried on by the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Expedition on the Torres Straits natives ; namely , that `` primitive '' communities produced fewer great men than civ - ilized communities .

		The main body of the people remains the same in both , except that at the upper end of the civilized scale there are more `` geniuses '' to get things started and furnish those small increments which , when piled up over a large period and by many people , give us civilization .

		A closer look into the matter however will show us that it is not necessary to assume racial differ - ences to bring forth such a proposition .

		`` Primi - tive '' communities are much smaller in numbers than civilized communities ; hence they will neces - sarily furnish , on the one hand , a smaller per -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 439 centage of unusual variations of great men and on the other , the work of whatever great man there be has a smaller area on which to work and the results will necessarily be more meager .

		So also with the physical environment .

		A very small difference in rainfall and water supply , in sunshine , in accessibility , in soil productivity , in mineral deposits may make or mar a civilization at a time when the tribe is absolutely dependent on any of these factors .

		All it needs is a push , and the logic of events will do the rest .

		And finally , if mental processes should get the slightest kink in them , due to one accident or another , and prevent the meeting of an important situation , or the utilization of certain resources , the group is doomed ; while another group with no such kink will go on and establish a civilization .

		It is perfectly evident , then , how overwhelming a role is played by accident in the origin of civilizations .

		The single factors which determine them are too vast , the combinations too numerous , not to give hostages to chance .

		The trouble with the unilateral explanations of culture is that they are too naive , too elementary .

		They do not see far enough ; they get lost in the contemplation of the foundations .

		Hence they never explain civilization ; they never get that far .

		They are like the scientist who would explain a Greek temple as so many nomadic ions and elec - trons , or a man engaged in the beef-packing indus - try as so much protoplasm and so many chromo - somes .

		Neither explanation tells us what a Greek temple is , or why the man is engaged in the business of beef-packing rather than that of drying prunes .

		And it is not electrons and chromo - somes which make one civilization different from another , but temples and dried prunes .

		As a sort of an `` aside '' for those too much wedded to the notion of racial superiorities and inferiorities , Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	gives a lengthy chapter on primitive family nomenclature .

		This is an ironical comment on those who maintain the simplicity of the mental processes of primitive man .

		Latin syntax or modern `` classical '' political economy can not compete with the complicated machinery of savage relationships .

		I do not know whether Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	intended this chapter to be viewed in this light , but it could not help but occur to me while I was reading his book .

		People who live under the influence of racial antipathies do not read books on ethnology , no matter how good they are .

		And so , unfortunately , Dr.
Lowie	PERSON	is writing for a packed audience , which will not fail to give him hearty applause .

		Sense and Nonsense THE REBUILDING OF
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		By
David Jayne Hill	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		AMERICA AFTER THE WAR .

		By `` An American Jurist . ''

		Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Although the war has started an avalanche of historical apologia and special pleading of one sort or another , discussion about the functions and purpose of the state has been amazingly infertile .

		Practically all that has been written on political theory in the
United States	LOCATION	, for example , has been a fairly dispassionate analysis of the German theory of the state , which has trailed off , usually , into a splutter of invectives that successfully becloud thought .

		The attempt at any really honest intellectual examination of first principles has been mere lip service ; it has been much easier to reflect the emotional warmth of partisan anger .

		That excuse was tempting , for no discipline is more formidable than that involved in thinking out conceptions of the state .

		What is called political science is largely mythology .

		Nearly every other science has to a great extent emancipated itself from its primitive vagueness by sharply limiting its field of application and by devising its own method and its own set of terms , each of which has a constant and clearly defined meaning .

		But political science is still in the nebulous stage where sociology , legal history , and quaint bits of metaphysical jargon jostle in splendid confusion .

		The reason why the Prussian theory of the state is so clearly articulated is that it is not , in reality , a theory of the state at all .

		It is nothing but an appendage to philosophical and historical , and even religious , theories which often are mere ingenious and intricate systems devised to justify an already existing exploitation .

		It is gratifying , then , to find Mr.
Hill	PERSON	writing about first principles with such admirable clarity and good temper .

		`` The Rebuilding of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is an honest attempt to paint two conflicting con - ceptions of the state against a genuine , rather than a partisanly selected , historical background .

		And the gist of his argument is simplicity itself : his book is a long and detailed attack on the theory of absolute sovereignty .

		He shows how the early Roman Empire was in one aspect an attempt to form a society of nations wherein the members had certain obligations to the union as a whole .

		This conception ran directly counter to dynastic ambition , and when medieval
Europe	LOCATION	emerged , it emerged as a congeries of independent nations free to attack each other at their own pleasure .

		The Holy Alliance was the attempt 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	in many ways successful to preserve the unlim - ited right of princes to subdue and control their own people , and to hurl their nation as a whole against any other nation whenever they might think the pastime worth while .

		This childish conception of absolute sovereignty is far from being a mere relic of medievalism , nor would it be fair to say that only
Germany	LOCATION	clung to it .

		What , as Mr.
Hill	PERSON	points out , was
Rousseau	PERSON	's `` la volonte generale '' but the old medieval theory , with the people instead of the prince playing the role of hero ?

		In
1914	DATE	even democracies accepted the absolute sovereignty theory , although they were never so blatant in their profession of it as
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It was considered painfully archaic to say that the king could do no wrong , but it was not even questioned that the state could do no wrong .

		National interests had inalienable rights ; they were limited only by opposing rights which might or might not be stronger .

		Only war could determine .

		This anarchy Mr.
Hill	PERSON	calls
Europe	LOCATION	's heritage of evil , although he might as truly have called it the world 's heritage of evil .

		But the bitter experiences of four years of cooperative warfare have made the theory of limited sov - ereignty extremely popular with democracies .

		The necessity for common action has revived the ancient concept of public right , so cheerfully flung overboard by the Realpolitiker .

		Under the pres - sure of events it is coming to have some of its ancient validity .

		In fact , one of the deepest meanings in this conflict is , shall the idea of abso - lute sovereignty survive ?

		The whole possibility of any future league of nations goes to ruin unless this idea of absolute sovereignty be destroyed .

		When
Germany	LOCATION	, either by military defeat , by revolution , or by a real change of heart due to the disillusion of this war , agrees to limit her sovereignty in those respects where it clashes with public international policy , the war will have been won .

		And Mr.
Hill	PERSON	is fair enough to admit that the Germans do not cling as pertinaciously to the theory of absolute sovereignty as they did four years ago .

		The voice of reason is not silent even in
Central Europe	LOCATION	.

		But it seems to be pretty effectively muffled .

		Even at this late date the Imperial Chancellor can calmly announce to the world that the relations between
Russia	LOCATION	and Ger - many are a purely private affair between those two .

		The accredited spokesmen of
Germany	LOCATION	can still talk as if everybody 's business is nobody 's business but their own .

		It must be admitted that this cheerful defense of international anarchy comes today chiefly from
Germany	LOCATION	.

		We hear none of it in
Russia	LOCATION	, little of it in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	or even in
France	LOCATION	, where the national - istic spirit is probably stronger than in any other country in the world .

		It is principally in Ger - many that public men still talk as if they were living in the dark ages .

		Yet the irony of events is mocking their words .

		For all their braggadocio , even the Germans have come to see that a first - class power can no longer ^ be self-sufficing .

		At the very moment when they announce that their unlimited right to act as a sovereign state can not even be discussed , they dream of an alliance with other states which they call ``
Middle Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		And at the very moment their Junkers are loudly proclaiming that international law no longer exists , they are berating Prince Lichnowsky because he had the indiscretion to point out that
Germany	LOCATION	had not been overscrupulous in observ - ing it .

		It is an impossible game .

		Some day
Germany	LOCATION	will realize that she can not have it both ways , just as the nations opposed to her have already begun to realize that there is no security for any nation except common interna - tional security .

		Future historians will say that
Germany	LOCATION	was the worst sufferer from her own doctrines .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's sensible argument is well summed up in this quotation : In its dynastic sense the word must be eliminated from the vocabulary of international politics .

		For democracies the word sovereignty in its absolute sense has no meaning .

		What remains of it and all to which constitutional states can lay claim is merely the right of a free and independent nation to exist , to legislate for itself , to defend itself , and to enter into relations with other similar states on the basis of juristic equality , under principles of international law which respect its inherent rights as free constitutions respect the rights of the individual persons who live under them .

		Now to turn from Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's sound argument , which has vision but which avoids being just visionary , to the little volume by `` An American Jurist '' is to experience a shock .

		It is so pathet - ically and ridiculously reactionary and stupid that at first one is inclined to believe it a bur - lesque .

		For example : `` The alliance , or , if preferred , the present coordination , of
America	LOCATION	with the Entente powers , is entirely fortuitous ; it is pursuant to no treaty , or even international conversation ... All such alliances are at best but temporary . ''

		Again : `` To enforce Belgian neu - trality is not the primary reason why
America	LOCATION	engaged in the war against
Germany	LOCATION	, nor is the violation of the spirit of American democracy the real reason . ''

		And later , so that the point wo n't be missed : `` It is to be feared that the American proclamation of democracy as a universal prin -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 441 ciple of government is disquieting to those of our own allies whose regime is aristocratical , if not absolutely monarchical .

		It takes no note of the real strength of European aristocracies at the present time .

		Lord Northcliffe has evidently detected this danger , for he has announced that
America	LOCATION	is not now fighting for democracy ... In order to abolish monarchy in
Europe	LOCATION	it will be necessary to uproot the whole social order of all European states except
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		An American propa - ganda for democracy outside of
America	LOCATION	is there - fore inexpedient , as it tends to shock and alienate the aristocratic classes in the various countries of the European allies of
America	LOCATION	... Americans should bear in mind that it is not absolutely impos - sible that in some circumstances
France	LOCATION	may yet become a monarchy and join some future league of the kings . ''

		Incredible , you say .

		But there is more to come .

		`` Whether the future Government of
Russia	LOCATION	, as it shall be ultimately reorganized , may not take exception and umbrage to the speedy recognition by
America	LOCATION	of the Revolution remains to be seen . ''

		And after the war ?

		Well , `` the real test '' will come `` when politicians begin their mischievous appeals for total disarmament and for the neglect of our war defensive with the hope of capturing a discontented and impover - ished people .

		If democracy passes through the ordeal safely , proves conservative , and continues to exhibit an intelligent and elevated political outlook , discarding the coming socialistic program of extreme political demagogues , the republic will be safe for a long , a conservative , and an interest - ing future . ''

		There is really no need of quoting further ; unless one saw it in black and white , it would seem utterly impossible that such senile stupidity could be published and read seriously today .

		Yet it is probably true that the author who ought some day to be glad that he remained anonymous considered that he was writing a shrewd and well balanced argument against the tender-minded shibboleths of our time : democ - racy , the league of nations , socialism , the elimina - tion of war , progressive disarmament , free trade , and so on .

		That is the pity of it .

		It is a joke , of course , but a rather sorry joke for the millions of young men who are going through the ordeal by fire so that a somewhat different and somewhat more rational international system may emerge .

		They are hardly fighting to make the world safe for this kind of international anarchy , which seems so agreeable to the prejudices and unyield - ing perversity of unteachable old men .

		A Statesman Sacrificed THE LIFE OF SIR
CHARLES DILKE	PERSON	.

		By
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	and
Gertrude M. Tuckwell	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 10	MONEY	.

		`` The Life of Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	'' comes as a reminiscence of one of the keenest personal trag - edies of the nineteenth century .

		The case of that unfortunate statesman belongs among those Falls of Princes by which the medieval imagination was taken captive , or the human documents on which Meredith based his novels .

		The clearest intellect , the widest intelligence , the greatest political imagination among the ministers of
Gladstone	PERSON	's government of 1880-5 , sharing with
Chamberlain	PERSON	the hope of the party and recog - nized as almost certainly the successor of Glad - stone in its leadership , on the eve of supplement - ing his great personal force by marriage to the most brilliant woman in
England	LOCATION	, Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	stumbled into one of the pitfalls which society maintains as evidence of its good inten - tions .

		He was named as corespondent in a divorce case , sued for damages by the husband , and though the suit was dismissed in his favor , found no remedy in English judicial procedure .

		The only verdict that he could obtain from the courts was a `` not .

		proved , '' and meanwhile public opinion had found him guilty .

		The forces which united against him are perfectly comprehensible in
Victorian England	LOCATION	royal domesticity , official clericalism , bourgeois puritanism , journalistic sen - sationalism ; the Queen , the government , the church , the press made a phalanx which no man could withstand .

		Against them he had only the loyalty of a few friends , of a constituency of workingmen , and of the woman who married him in the face of popular clamor Mrs.
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, whose youthful portrait
George Eliot	PERSON	drew in
Dorothea Brooke	PERSON	.

		Thenceforth he was relegated to the outer circles of public life , a phenomenon in
Parliament	LOCATION	like
Charles Brad	PERSON	- laugh , the man who came back , or who like
Bacon	PERSON	refused `` to go out in a snuff . ''

		`` The Life of Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	'' is a monument to the strength of character which carried him through a quarter century of failure without diminution of personal dignity , or active will to service , or generous interest in life , or sweetness of mind .

		It is also a record of public waste of precious resources that makes the true tragedy of Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	a national one .

		For
Dilke	PERSON	was one of the few men in the governing aristocracy of
Britain	LOCATION	who took their function seriously .

		He was able and willing to 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	give himself the arduous training necessary for such as are to bear authority in a modern com - monwealth .

		To the ordinary political education of an English university , with its forum for dis - cussion of public affairs , he added a personal in - spection of the British Empire which bore fruit in the book which first made him known , `` Greater
Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		He supplemented this grand tour with journeys to other countries , and made it a prime object to meet and study the men who held the reins of government in them .

		He even overcame the Englishman 's prejudice against knowing a language other than his own .

		Besides this he studied ceaselessly every sub - ject of importance that came before
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in his many years of service : foreign af - fairs were his specialty , but in addition he was an expert in imperial defence both by land and sea ; in local government and parliamentary procedure ; in trades-unionism , housing , industrial insurance , and land tenure ; and no mean critic of the government of the difficult dependencies
Ireland	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		He got up every one of these subjects with an immense accumulation of facts and yet contrived to keep his general grasp firm and his view lucid .

		His speeches in
Parliament	LOCATION	and to his constituents were compact of information , authoritative state - ments .

		His pleasures were true recreations and subordinate to the great end of keeping himself fit for his work .

		The usual avocations of the aristocratic governing class , the barbarians , he put by without a regret .

		There is a scarcely tolerant smile behind the passage in his diary in which he records the efforts to make his chief , Lord Gran - ville , Foreign Secretary in the cabinet of 1880-5 , attend to business : Late on
Tuesday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	,
May 23rd	DATE	, Lord Gran - ville was in such a hurry to adjourn the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, and bolt out of town for Whitsuntide , that he let the French send off our Identic Note to the Powers in a form in which it would do much harm , although this was afterwards slightly altered .

		On the
next day	DATE	,
Wednesday	DATE	, the 24th , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	brought Lord
Granville	PERSON	up to town again , and stopped his going to the Derby , and at 1 :30 p. m. they decided to call for immediate Turkish intervention in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	began public life in
1867	DATE	, offering himself as candidate for
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	from
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		He wrote to his father on this occasion : `` Though I should immensely like to be in Par - liament , still I should feel terribly hampered there if I went in as anything except a Radical . ''

		In this speech he foreshadowed his future atti - tude , favoring reform in electoral machinery and distribution of representation , payment of Mem - bers of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, universal suffrage , legal rec - ognition of trades unions , and direct taxation .

		On his election to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, a year later , he broadened this platform to include practically the whole programme of political radicalism for the
next half century	DATE	.

		It gives one a sense of his extraordinary prescience merely to enumer - ate the causes of which he was an early , some - times the earliest , champion .

		In
1870	DATE	he insisted on complete freedom of national education from religious influence , and resigned the chairman - ship of the
London	LOCATION	Branch of
the Education League	ORGANIZATION	because he would not accept the govern - ment 's compromise on this point .

		In the same year he replied to the stock objection to equal suffrage that most women are against it `` You will always find that in the case of any class which has been despotically governed the great majority of that class are content with the system under which they live . ''

		At the first meeting of the
Land Tenure Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	he declared in favor of taxing the unearned in - crement .

		In the same year he presided at the meeting of the
Aborigines Protection Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was in favor of a large measure of local self - government , and so was ready to vote for Irish Home Rule as early as
1874	DATE	.

		As to coercion of that unhappy country , he could not understand `` how those who shuddered at arbitrary arrests in
Poland	LOCATION	, and who ridiculed the gagging of the press in
France	LOCATION	, could permit the passing of a law for
Ireland	LOCATION	which gave absolute powers of arrest and of suppression of newspapers to the Lord - Lieutenant . ''

		In
1867	DATE	he proposed to extend the factory acts to all employment , and year after year discussed this subject so that Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	declared , `` We can trust no one but Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	in
Parliament	LOCATION	to understand the principles of factory legislation . ''

		He saw with satisfaction the birth of
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	after the
Taff Vale	PERSON	decision against the trades unions , and rejoiced that `` the difficulty of upsetting the judgment ... will nurture , develop , and fortify it -LSB- the party -RSB- in the future . ''

		Although he became a master of parliamentary procedure , he confessed : `` I was never favorable to the Parliamentary , and I was even hostile to the Party system , '' preferring the direct intervention of the people through the referendum .

		In foreign affairs , as in domestic , Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	maintained consistently the attitude which was characteristic of his radicalism .

		He was a sincere friend to small nationalities , the street named for him in
Athens	LOCATION	bearing witness to the gratitude of at least one of them .

		He was a
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 443 member of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's government which in
1882	DATE	intervened in
Egypt	LOCATION	to suppress the nation - alistic movement headed by
Arabi Pasha	PERSON	, but he wrote : `` I thought and still think that anarchy could have been put down and a fairly stable state of things set up without any necessity for a British occupation . ''

		He was opposed to the Boer War , though holding that `` when the country was seized by the war fever interposition was useless . ''

		In the war of
1870	DATE	between
France	LOCATION	and Ger - many , he would have had
England	LOCATION	take the first step in the war against war : If
Gladstone	PERSON	had been a great man , this war would never have broken out , for he would have nobly taken upon himself the responsibility of declaring that the English
Navy	ORGANIZATION	should actively aid whichever of the two Powers was attacked by the other .

		This would have been the beginning of the international justice we are calling for .

		I dp not blame
Gladstone	PERSON	for not daring to do it , for it requires a morally braver man than any of our statesmen to run this kind of risk .

		To him , in common with most Englishmen , it appeared that
France	LOCATION	and not
Germany	LOCATION	was the attacking power , and the sentence in `` Greater
Britain	LOCATION	'' `` If the English race has a mission in the world , it is surely this , to prevent peace on earth from depending on the verdict of a single man '' was written against
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	.

		But later he would have changed its application .

		`` Poor German Liberals , '' he wrote , `` who aban - doned all their principles when they consented to tear
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	from
France	LOCATION	, and who now find themselves powerless against the war party , who say ` What the sword has won the sword shall keep . ' ''

		And he quoted the words of an Alsatian deputy in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	: `` Had you spared us you would have won the admiration of the world , and war had become impos - sible between us and you .

		As it is , you go on arming , and you force all
Europe	LOCATION	to arm also .

		Instead of opening an age of peace , you have inaugurated an era of war ; and now you await fresh campaigns , fresh lists of killed and wounded , containing the names of your brothers and your sons . ''

		He added : `` The view of this Alsatian deputy is my view .

		I do not believe that might makes right . ''

		In
1887	DATE	he wrote a brilliant survey of the relations of the six great powers which appeared first anonymously in `` The Fortnightly Review '' and later in book form as `` The Present Position of European Politics . ''

		He traced the beginning of the `` reign of force '' in
Europe	LOCATION	to the annexation of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	, but he showed how that system was developed with
England	LOCATION	's connivance by the Treaty of
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1878	DATE	.

		He believed that the cup which the rulers of the nations were even then holding to the lips of their crucified peoples might still pass from them .

		Yet his words , those of a statesman whom his countrymen elected in their puritan pride to dishonor , have the pathetic ring of Cassandra prophecy .

		In
1876	DATE	he had noted in
Parliament	LOCATION	one great difficulty in the way of fair dealing among nations secret diplomacy .

		`` This
Europe	LOCATION	is probably mined beneath our feet with secret treaties . ''

		In
1908	DATE	he noted another the press : We are so confident in our own profound knowledge of our wish for European peace that we hardly realize the extreme danger for the future which is caused by all suggestion that we have succeeded in isolating
Germany	LOCATION	, or are striving to bring about that result .

		The
London	LOCATION	articles written in violent support of a supposed alliance did the harm ; and to anyone who keeps touch for himself of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	opinion the harm was undoubted , and tended to produce several undesirable results .

		One scarcely wonders at finding Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	devoting much of his time in his last years to problems of imperial defence .

		The quotations given above serve to identify Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	as a radical in the full force which the term could bear in the years of his active life .

		Indeed some of his utterances ring like those of Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	or Mr.
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	in
1918	DATE	.

		It is difficult therefore to recognize Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	as an aristocrat of the aristocrats .

		In his athletic tastes , his fencing , his rowing , his riding ; in his artistic preferences for fine prints , paintings , porcelains ; above all in his fastidious selection of books and society his essential quality appears .

		Personally he had little in common with the Victorian Liberalism with which he was associated in politics .

		His diaries have been edited with much discretion , but one divines a certain scorn for all its leaders , includ - ing
Gladstone	PERSON	, with the exception of Chamber - lain .

		Of the literary-social quality of his age , of that tolerant gregariousness which
Viscount Morley	PERSON	details so delightfully in his `` Recollec - tions , '' Dilke had nothing .

		In truth , Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	was little of a Victorian Liberal .

		The opposition between him and his age went deeper than the circumstances which set him under its ban .

		He had standards in matters other than sexual morals in art , in living , in government .

		It is said that the finest portrait of him was that of his ancestor , Sir
Thomas Wentworth	PERSON	, who died in
1551	DATE	.

		This reversion to type was not merely physical : in mind and taste Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	was a man of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a belated product , fashioned after the model drawn by Sir
Thomas Elyot	PERSON	in his `` The Book named the Governour , '' written in
1531	DATE	for the education of such as should bear authority in a `` weale publike . ''

		444 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	Especially does this Renaissance quality appear in
Dilke	LOCATION	's mastery of the field which interested him intensely , that of foreign affairs .

		The
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean situation at the close of the nineteenth cen - tury was a reproduction of the Italian at the close of the fifteenth , in both a delicate balance of power depending on an infinite number of details social , political , personal .

		Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	was the only Englishman of his time who learned this situation , as
Lorenzo dei Medici	PERSON	learned his who took pains to know all the facts , and who refused to guess at the answer .

		One can imagine what he suffered from the spectacle of the intricate European machine mishandled by such men as
England	LOCATION	appointed to this service from the indo - lence of Lord
Granville	PERSON	, the frothy ineptitude of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, the cynical stupidity of Lord
Salis	PERSON	- bury .

		He saw
England	LOCATION	renounce her ideals at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Berlin	LOCATION	, drift through sheer blun - dering into the greatest and least excusable preda - tory act of modern political history in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and then fling away her only means of safety in such a mode of life by the cession of
Heligoland	LOCATION	to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Not only did
Dilke	PERSON	know the facts of his world ; he took pains to learn the personal factors of the problem .

		Like a chess player he studied his opponents ' faces and minds , and saw their characters reflected in their play .

		He was the intimate friend of
Gambetta	LOCATION	;
Herbert Bis	PERSON	- marck was often his guest ; he visited the old Chancellor .

		His account of a visit to
Russia	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	reads like the notebook of a Florentine ambassador of the Medici in its swift appraisal of the men in the game .

		In this control of the personal element of diplomacy Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	had the enormous advantage of his birth and training .

		Professor
Veblen	PERSON	in his recent book on `` The Nature of Peace '' takes not a little delight in pointing out how the affairs of the world in the present crisis have fallen into the hands of the `` underbred common run '' who have efficiency and force .

		He points out that this is `` not a gentleman 's wafr . ''

		True .

		The `` underbred common run '' fight the war with a technical thoroughness beyond any - thing the aristocrat has conceived .

		Apparently they can not make peace .

		With an undoubted will to peace the democracies of the world can only assert their efficiency by making war .

		They have no means of sure communication with each other , no system of guarantees by which the first steps toward peace can be taken in mutual confi - dence .

		Proletarians and
Labor Parties	ORGANIZATION	make tentative approaches toward each other through proclamations from Nottingham , conferences at
Stockholm	LOCATION	, and negotiations at Brest-Litovsk .

		Capitalists , in whose supernational selfishness we had so much relied , hold secret parleys at
Zurich	LOCATION	; but to distrust of the foreigner is added the mutual distrust of classes at home , and such abortive efforts toward peace end in misunder - standing , repudiation , and prohibition .

		The tragic fact of the world today is that the nations have lost contact with each other and are fighting like blind men in the dark .

		No wonder that Lord Lansdowne remembers that diplomacy was a gentleman 's game , and urges plausibly that gentlemen be called back ; to retrieve at the council table the errors which they made there .

		It was against such errors that Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	warned his countrymen .

		As we have tried to show , he was preeminently a statesman of the transition , Wandering between two worlds , one dead , .

		The other powerless to be born .

		The old world of aristocratic privilege he tried his best to bury , beginning with the civil list of the royal family .

		The new world of democracy he tried to assist into being by every means which the radical midwifery of the time afforded .

		He realized that the internal democratic upheaval in every country constituted one strong temptation to dying autocracy to save itself by throwing the world backward a century or two .

		His peculiar value lay in the fact that by the use of all the resources of the old diplomacy , the transition might have been accomplished without the terrific catastrophe of universal war .

		The freedom of communication with the governing classes of the world which he possessed as an aristocrat , the trust in the people which he held as a democrat , supremely fitted him for this task a democrat with training and discipline and standards , an aristocrat whose only defence of privilege was noblesse oblige .

		To a discerning spectator in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	during the years from
1890	DATE	to
1909	DATE	the destiny of the nation and indeed of the world was represented , not by the front benches of government and opposition , not by
Gladstone	PERSON	and Campbell-Bannerman and
Asquith	PERSON	and
Lloyd George	PERSON	, nor by
Balfour	PERSON	and
Chamberlain	PERSON	and the Cecils , nor yet by
Redmond	PERSON	and
Dillon	PERSON	,
Keir Hardy	PERSON	and
John Burns	PERSON	, but by the quiet white-haired figure , in his seat below the gangway , always present , always ready , always powerless .

		There is the tragedy of Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	's career , the tragedy of his country and of the democratic world the triumph of the

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 445
Ireland	LOCATION	's New Writer of Fiction A
MUNSTER TWILIGHT	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE THRESHOLD OF QUIET .

		By
Daniel Corkery	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		and
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It seems as if the circumstances of Irish life were not favorable to the development of the novel .


Ireland	LOCATION	has failed so far to produce a novelist worthy to rank with the best of her poets and dramatists , and we know that the great novels of the world 's literature have been written out of conditions very different from those which prevail here .

		To explain the process of literary evolution which has resulted in success in the most difficult and exacting forms of literature , and relative failure in the easiest and most amorphous there is a task for our critics and historians .

		The short story , open or disguised , is the invari - ably successful medium of Irish fiction , and it is noteworthy that Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	, our great - est living writer of fiction , has not yet essayed the novel proper .

		`` The Crock of Gold '' and `` The Demi-Gods '' are masterly elaborations of the method of connecting a series of unrelated incidents with a group of central figures .

		The episodes are in themselves independent of the narrative as a whole , although the genius of the author raises them high above the level of the commonplace stories of conventional humor and sentiment , which are the stock in trade of so many popular Irish story-tellers .

		Mr.
Daniel Corkery	PERSON	was known only by his occasional contributions to Irish periodicals until
1917	DATE	, when he published his first book , `` A Munster Twilight . ''

		This interesting collection of short stories at once showed that the author was entitled to more serious attention than is accorded to the average Irish story-teller .

		Writ - ing on the subject of `` The Peasant in Literature , '' Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	has defined the bulk of our popular Irish peasant literature as `` real in the non-essen - tials and very untrue in the essentials . ''

		In his `` Munster Twilight '' he fulfills the conditions implied by that judgment upon his predecessors .

		The book must be classed with
Padraic Colum	PERSON	's `` Wild Earth '' and
Synge	PERSON	's `` Riders to the Sea , '' two works excepted by Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	from the criticism quoted .

		.

		Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	is as close to the spirit of `` The Shadow of the Glen '' and of `` The Playboy of the Western World '' as an identical feeling and intuition can bring him .

		He knows his
Cork	ORGANIZATION	and
Kerry	PERSON	as
Synge	PERSON	knew the hills of Wicklow and
West Kerry	LOCATION	and the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, and he reveals the people with the same harsh humor that gives its savor to the writing of the dramatist .

		`` The Lady of the Glassy Palace '' and `` Vanity , '' for example , treat of death in a manner which was described as `` brutality '' in
Synge	LOCATION	, but is in reality a manifestation of revolt in both authors against the conventionally lach - rymose pathos of the `` pleasant '' playwrights and story-tellers .

		`` The Wake '' also may be com - mended to those who desire something more true than the jocosities of Lover , or the
Dick	PERSON	- ensian variations upon deathbed themes which are accepted by so many people as the only possible alternative .

		Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	can evoke the grim humor , as well as the pathos , of this hackneyed situation by the simple but difficult process of being perfectly honest .

		This story of the indis - cretion produced by whiskey in a mourner who refers to the composure of a non-existent corpse , the wake being for a son who has died in
America	LOCATION	well , one thinks with a shudder of the pleasantries which the older novelists would have perpetrated .

		It is hard to say what is the more admirable , the restraint of Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	, or his skill in pathetic observation .

		The most conventional -LRB- though admittedly in the new Irish convention -RRB- of Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	's stories is the first , `` The Ploughing of Leaca-na - Naomh , '' which has been most favorably men - tioned by the reviewers , captured , as usual , by what they deem `` awfully Celtic . ''

		It is just such a story as
Dermot O'Byrne	PERSON	might have told , in his enthusiasm for the quality of mysticism and highly colored imagination which fascinated and impressed him in
Gaelic Ireland	LOCATION	.

		But Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	has opportunities and powers denied to the outside observer , and in every other chapter of this book he shows that he can use them .

		`` The Return '' is as grotesque and weird as any - thing in Lord
Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	's `` A Dreamer 's Tales , '' but is at the same time informed by an element of Irish humanity which has consistently escaped the latter writer .

		So long as he preserves this faculty Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	will not be in danger of risking his talent in such sterilities as mar the later work of
Lord Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Child Saint '' and `` The Breath of Life '' are well written , but do not come up to the high level of the volume as a whole , the level which marks it off from its companions , where we expect to find such things .

		Not since `` The Land '' was published has the relation of the peasant to the soil been so finely expressed in prose as in that almost inarticulately emotional story , `` Joy , '' which recounts the return to a rich farm of an old man who had been forced off the poor land 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	he loved into the city .

		`` The Spanceled '' is another notable chapter , which inevitably suggests Synge in its challenging tragedy , developed with the directness and economy of means shared by both writers .

		On the other hand `` The Cry '' could have been conceived only by Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	, who shows himself capable , indeed , of interpret - ing `` the peasant in literature . ''

		In the end we come , as the author himself designed , to the half - dozen episodes related in `` The Cobbler 's Den . ''

		In a sense these brief comedies and tragedies of the people are the most striking pages in `` A Munster Twilight . ''

		Since we learned to know the Old Philosopher in `` The Crock of Gold , '' and
Patsy McCann	PERSON	in `` The Demi-Gods , '' no more delightful group of human beings has lived in Irish fiction than
Maggie Maw	PERSON	, the Blind Man , and
John Ahern	PERSON	, in whose cobbler 's shop they congregate for argument and gossip .

		The effect of that incredible instrument the `` con - nopium '' on
Maggie Maw	ORGANIZATION	's hearers and upon the reader alike will suffice to prepare for the equal pleasure of the succeeding stories .

		The `` con - nopium '' lingers in the mind like the lumps in the porridge of the Old Philosopher .

		Fortunately it occurs in the first of a series of charming inci - dents , thereby gaining by priority where the advent of successive pleasures might have obscured it in the memory of the hasty reader .

		Now Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	has given us a novel which critics and public agree in accepting as the most noteworthy work of fiction produced in
Ireland	LOCATION	for many years .

		`` The Threshold of Quiet '' was written before `` A Munster Twilight , '' but the author was wise to offer the slighter work to the public first , even at the risk of being expected to repeat himself in what will be regarded by the majority of readers as his second book .

		To count upon any resemblance between the two is to pre - pare for a disappointment , but few intelligent readers will refuse the author the careful atten - tion which his previous volume entitled him to expect .

		Having gained the ear of the public by the direct charm and appeal of that work , he now proceeds to unfold a leisured narrative , in the confident belief that we are sympathetically inclined to allow ourselves to be immersed in the quiet stream of provincial life so near and so dear to him .

		Connoisseurs of the picturesque phrase , the cultivators of literary plots not plot - holders , but held by plots will be rebuffed by Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	's disconcerting indifference to the demand for the dialectics of dialect , and for `` a good story . ''

		The substance of his novel is as tenuous as anything in the later works of
Henry James	PERSON	; his manner is as garrulous and expansive as that of Dostoevsky .

		But his sen - tences have not the corresponding subtlety which makes or mars
Henry James	PERSON	, according to one 's fancy .

		`` Swathed in relative clauses as an invalid in shawls , '' is not the description that can be aptly applied to them .

		Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	writes a clear and forceful prose as devoid of mannerism as it is free from cliche ; his style is as fresh and personal as his conception of character .

		Reference has been made to the tendency of Irish fiction to resolve itself into a connected or unrelated series of episodes or incidents .

		The purveyors of humorous and sentimental novels for the libraries alone profess to tell a homogene - ous story , and they are rewarded by a popularity denied either to the nouvelle , as such , or to the prose work of
James Stephens	PERSON	.

		Although Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	has shown in `` A Munster Twilight '' his ability to visualize the dramatic or humorous episode , his novel is innocent of all such effects .

		So completely has he emancipated himself from the common practice that one can easily imagine the impatient admirer of
Katharine Tynan	PERSON	,
Jane Barlow	PERSON	,
George Birmingham	PERSON	, or
Seumas Mac	PERSON	- Manus turning aside from `` The Threshold of Quiet , '' with a complaint that it lacks incident , as it lacks a plot .

		It tells no story like `` Spanish Gold '' ; it relates no scenes of country life , in the comic or sentimental manner of
Jane Barlow	PERSON	and
Seumas MacManus	PERSON	; it eschews the amiable ideal - izations of
Katharine Tynan	PERSON	.

		If a recent parallel be sought it will be found , strange to say , in `` A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . ''

		Not that the morbid retrospection and analysis of Mr.
James Joyce	PERSON	have their counterpart in the work of Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	; but both writers have given their books the inchoate form to which the Russian novelists have reconciled us .

		The former has written a savage and , to some minds , a shocking indictment of
Dublin	LOCATION	; the latter has gently drawn aside the curtain , and softly illumi - nated the quiet and obscure corners of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	.

		One thinks of
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	and Dostoevsky while reading `` The Threshold of Quiet , '' for only in Russian literature does one find the portrayal of such secluded and uneventful lives as drift through these pages , as they drift through `` The Cherry Orchard '' or `` Uncle Vanya . ''

		The mys - terious death of
Frank Bresnan	PERSON	broods over the whole book ; but it occurs at the beginning ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 447 and is the occasion of no greater suspense in the reader than was
Raskolnikov	ORGANIZATION	's crime in
Dostoev	LOCATION	- sky 's masterpiece , for all Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	's skill in allowing the truth of suicide to crystallize slowly and shyly in the minds of the circle whose exist - ence is described .

		As in the case of `` Crime and Punishment , '' there is no attempt to exploit out - ward circumstance , and the story is almost purely cerebral , so carefully does the author restrict its .

		movement to what is passing in the minds of his characters .

		When the book is closed all one has seen happening is the departure of
Finnbarr Bresnan	ORGANIZATION	for
America	LOCATION	, after a hesitation as to whether he had not a vocation for the priesthood ; the tragic ending to the story of
Stevie Galvin	PERSON	and his brother ; the crossing of the `` threshold of quiet '' by
Lily Bresnan	PERSON	when she finally feels free to enter
Kilvirra Convent	ORGANIZATION	, renouncing life and the love of
Martin Cloyne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even these few dramatic moments are not developed , but just cause a slight stir of the deep waters of con - sciousness in which these lives are submerged .

		Yet only the most hasty reader will fail to succumb to the appeal of the book , which cap - tures the mind by its simplicity and sincerity , its absence of factitious interest .

		Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	plunges us at once into the slow current of these lonely lives , whose struggle for peace and happi - ness is no less intense and moving because it takes place on a plane only discernible to the intimate comprehension of a writer whose eyes are fixed on the truth nearest to his own heart .

		The high lights of grand tragedy and the crude glare of melodrama do not light up these pages , steeped in tender and alluring half tones .

		As a genre picture of provincial society in
Ireland	LOCATION	, `` The Threshold of Quiet '' is unique in its serious realism , from which the ugliness of naturalism has been eliminated without detriment to its fidel - ity .

		With a skill that amounts to genius Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	avoids the falsity and mawkishness of the popular idealizations , while preserving the purity at which they aim .

		A great deal of careful pruning has gone to the creation of the mood in which it is possible by the merest hints and suggestions to obtain effects which his contem - poraries have labored and spoiled .

		The religious note is particularly delicate and beautiful , spon - taneous and reserved , eloquent but never didactic .

		It is a remarkable first novel , and gives promise for the future work of Mr.
Corkery	PERSON	, when he finds a theme worthy of his great powers of char - acterization and analysis .

		RNEST A < The Two Magics TOWARDS THE GULF .

		By
Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	is a welcome , though perplexing , figure in contemporary American poetry .

		Wel - come , because along with Mr.
Frost	PERSON	, and perhaps Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	and Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	, he is a realist , and because a vigorous strain of realism is so pro- foundly needed in our literature today as indeed it has always been needed .

		Perplexing , because his relative importance , as posterity will see it , is so extraordinarily difficult to gage .

		Of his welcome there can be no question .

		There has been a disposition among poets and critics of poetry during the last three years to assume that the most important changes , or revolutions , taking place in American poetry at present are those that regard form .

		The Imagists and other free verse writers have found their encomiasts , and to them the renewed vitality of American poetry has in consequence been a little too freely ascribed .

		No one will deny that the current changes in poetic form the earlier Wind revolt , the later effort to mint new forms which shall be organic have their value .

		But we should not forget that of equal and possibly greater importance has been the attempt of our realists to alter not merely the form of poetry but also its content .

		What Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	and Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	did in
England	LOCATION	, it remained for Mr.
Masters	PERSON	and Mr.
Frost	PERSON	to do in
America	LOCATION	.

		The influence of the `` Spoon River Anthology '' and `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	'' can hardly yet be estimated .

		That the Imagists did not share in this influence was perhaps merely an accident .

		There was nothing in the Imagist platform to prevent it .

		It simply happened that the Imagists were without exception lyric poets , or more specifically , poets in the decorative or coloristic tradition .

		While they were still ex - perimenting with new rhythms as the vehicle of expression for a gamut of perceptions and sensa - tions which differed from the traditional percep - tions and sensations of poetry only by being a trifle subtler and more objective , Mr.
Masters	PERSON	and Mr.
Frost	PERSON	, without so much as a preliminary blast of the trumpet , suddenly incorporated into their poetry a new world the world of the indi - vidual consciousness in its complex entirety .

		At the moment , this was a new conception of the nature of poetry .

		A poem was not to be a single jewel of colorful phrases , but the jewel in its matrix .

		Of such poetry , it is readily seen , the appeal would be not merely aesthetic , but 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	intellectual and emotional also in the richest sense , human .

		The distinction between the poetic and the non-poetic vocabulary was broken down , a condition which has obtained conspicuously only in two preceding poetic eras , the Chaucerian and Elizabethan .

		The opportunity for a transfusion of vitality from our tremendously increased prose vocabulary to the comparatively small and static poetic vocabulary was unparalleled .

		New devel - opments of form were involved perhaps , but while the immediate effects of these were more obvious , it is to be questioned whether they were as far - reaching .

		It is safe to say that no poet now writing in this country has escaped the influence .

		In its healthily acrid presence it has been increas - ingly difficult for the prettifiers , the airy treaders of preciosity , the disciples of sweetness and senti - ment , to go their mincing ways .

		Most of them have felt a compulsion either to change tone or to be silent .

		In view of the importance of this influence , therefore , it is interesting to speculate on the nature and function of realistic poetry ; and the work of
Mr. Masters	ORGANIZATION	furnishes an excellent opportunity .

		To say that such work as this delights us , at its best , because it is human , is after all somewhat superficial .

		In a broad sense , even the most treble of dawn-twitters is human .

		But clearly the pleasure it affords us is a different sort of pleasure from that afforded , say , by a lyric of Becquer or Shelley .

		It has , when it is good , a clearly recognizable magic ; but this magic is not quite of the same character as that we associate with `` Kubla Khan '' or `` The Ode to a Grecian Urn . ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in his essay on poetry was apparently insensible to this distinc - tion , for at least one of his famous touchstone lines belongs rather to the realistic than to the lyric category of magic .

		The line of Words - worth , `` And never lifted up a single stone , '' cer - tainly does not appeal , in any clear way , to the sense of beauty ; its felicity is of a different sort .

		What precisely constitutes this second sort of verbal magic is in the present state of psychology perhaps impossible to analyze .

		At most we can perceive certain relations and distinctions .

		On one plane , the mechanism of the two is identical : both depend for their effect on the choice of so sharply characteristic a single detail that a powerful motor reaction will ensue and complete the sensory pattern in its entirety .

		This is known as
Pavlov	PERSON	's law .

		But here begins the divergence , for while this might explain the quality of vivid - ness which is common to both , it appears to have no bearing on the fact that each sort of vividness affects the reader in a specifically different man - ner .

		The first , or Shelley-Becquer type of magic , appeals to what is indefinitely called the sense of beauty ; the second , or Masters-Frost type , appeals perhaps to the sense of reality .

		These terms are deplorably vague .

		Our enjoyment of art is con - sequent upon the satisfaction of two kinds of hunger : hunger for beauty and hunger for knowl - edge .

		Let what the Freudians call an emotional complex be formed early in life upon the frus - trated first of these hungers , and we get a lyric or colorist type of artist ; upon the other , and we get a realist .

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	is of the latter type , though there are traces in him of the former as well .

		The curious thing is that while he frequently mani - fests a vivid desire to employ the lyric kind of magic , he nearly always fails at it ; his average of success with the realistic magic is consistently very much higher .

		He is essentially a digger - out of facts , particularly of those facts which regard the mechanism of human character .

		In the presence of richly human material the suf - ferings , the despairs , the foolish illusions , the amazing overweenings of the individual man or woman he has the cold hunger of the micro - scope .

		Curiosity is his compelling motive , not the desire for beauty .

		He is insatiable for facts and events , for the secrets of human behavior .

		Consequently it is as a narrator that he does his best work .

		He is essentially a psychological story - teller , one who has chosen for his medium not prose but verse , a tumbling and jostling and over - crowded sort of verse , which , to be sure , fre - quently becomes prose .

		Was Mr.
Masters	PERSON	wise in making this choice ?

		He is by nature extremely loquacious and discursive it appears to be painful for him to cut down to mere essentials and prose would seem to be a more natural medium for such a mind .

		But while he almost always fails to compress his material to , the point where it becomes singly powerful , it is only the fact that he uses a verse form which compels him to com - press at all ; and it is also clear that at his moments of keenest pleasure in dissective narra - tion he can only experience satisfaction in a verse of sharply accentuated ictus .

		It is at these moments that his work takes on the quality of realistic magic , the magic of vivid action , dra -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 matic truthfulness , muscular reality .

		We are made to feel powerfully the thrust and fecundity of human life , particularly its animalism ; we are also made to feel its struggle to be , or to believe itself , something more .

		It is in the perception and expression of this something more that Mr.
Masters	PERSON	chiefly fails , not because he is not aware of it -LRB- he repeatedly makes it clear that he is , though not of course in the guise of sentimental - ity -RRB- but because at this point his power and felicity of expression abandon him .

		What emo - tional compulsion he has towards self-expression lies in the other direction .

		His temperament might be compared not inexactly to that of
Hogarth	PERSON	, the
Hogarth	PERSON	of `` Marriage a la Mode '' and `` The Rake 's Progress '' rather than of the caricatures .

		It is in the Hogarthian type of magic that he is most proficient .

		Is it certain however that this proficiency is sufficient to make his work enduring ?

		There is no other poet in
America	LOCATION	today whose work is so amazingly uneven , whose sense of values is so disconcertingly uncertain .

		While in some respects Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's intellectual equipment is richer than that of any of his rivals , it has about it also something of the nouveau riche .

		Much of his erudition seems only half digested , much of it is inaccurate , much of it smells of quackery or the woman 's page of the morning paper .

		Much of it too is dragged in by the heels and is very dull reading .

		Moreover , this uncertainty one might almost say unripeness besets Mr.
Masters	PERSON	on the aesthetic plane quite as clearly as on the intellectual .

		To put it synaesthetically , he appears not to know a yellow word from a purple one .

		He goes from a passage of great power to a passage of bathos , from the vividly true to the blatantly false , from the incisive to the dull , without the least awareness .

		In `` Songs and Satires '' one passed , in bewilderment , from `` Arabel , '' remarkably sustained in atmosphere , vivid in its portraiture , skilful in its use of .

		suspense , to the ludicrous ineffectuality of the Launcelot poem , in which many solemn events were unintentionally comic .

		In the new book , `` Towards the Gulf , '' one passes , with the same astonishment , from the utter falseness and pre - posterous anticlimax of the `` Dialogue at
Perko	PERSON	's '' to the intensity and magic of `` The Widow LaRue . ''

		This means of course that Mr.
Mas	PERSON	- ters is not in the thorough sense an artist .

		He does not know the effect of what he is doing .

		He is indeed , as an artist , careless to the point of recklessness .

		It is as if a steam dredge should become pearl diver : he occasionally finds an oyster , sometimes a pearl ; but he drags up also an amazing amount of mud .

		His felicities and monstrosities are alike the accidents of tempera - ment , not the designs of art .

		Hasty composition is repeatedly manifest .

		Six months more of reflec - tion would perhaps have eliminated such poems as `` The Canticle of the Race '' -LRB- Mr.
Masters	PERSON	is often in the hands of demons when he uses rhyme -RRB- , `` The Awakening , '' `` In the Garden at the Dawn Hour , '' `` Dear Old Dick , '' `` Towards the Gulf , '' and two or three others ; would have indicated the need for cutting and compression in most of the remainder ; and would have dis - closed such verbal errors as `` disregardless '' and `` forgerer '' trifles , indeed , but symptomatic .

		And yet on the whole one is more optimistic as to the future of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	after reading his book than at any time since the appearance of `` Spoon River Anthology . ''

		Bad and good are still confounded , but in more encouraging pro- portions .

		From `` Widow LaRue , '' `` Front , the Ages with a Smile , '' `` Tomorrow is my Birth - day , '' `` Saint Deseret '' one gets an almost unmixed pleasure .

		In these one feels the magic of reality .

		These poems , like `` Arabel '' and `` In the Cage , '' are synthesized ; and it is in this vein that one would like to see Mr. Masters continue , avoiding the pitfalls of the historical , the philosophical , the pseudo-scientific .

		Will he yet learn to employ , as an artist , the selection and compression which in the `` Spoon River Anthology '' were forced upon him by the exigencies of the case ?

		Will he continue at the same time to develop in psycho - logical richness and in his sense of the music of sound and the balance of form ?

		.

		Whether he does or not , we already have reason to be profoundly grateful to him .

		His influence has been widespread and wholesome .

		We are badly in need of poets who are unafraid to call a spade a damned shovel .

		And a good many of us are too ready to forget that realistic magic is quite as legitimate in poetry as lyric magic , and quite as clearly in the English tradition .

		If art is the effort of man to understand himself by means of self-expression , then surely it should not be all ghosts and cobwebs and soul-stuff ... Mr.
Masters	PERSON	reminds us that we are both complex and mortal .

		450 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	Reenter Literary Burlesque THE HARLEQUINADE : An Excursion .

		By
Dion Clayton Calthrop	PERSON	and
Granville Barker	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The five `` episodes '' in Messrs.
Calthrop	PERSON	and
Barker	PERSON	's engaging fantasy are five glimpses into an alleged history of the Harlequin tradition .

		First we see
Mercury	ORGANIZATION	,
Momus	ORGANIZATION	, and
Charon	PERSON	crossing the Styx -LRB- `` the most interesting place in spiritual geography '' -RRB- and setting out to find runaway Psyche beginning on an Olympian
Saturday	DATE	`` the longest
week-end	DATE	on record . ''

		For the second scene proves to be a fifteenth-century Italian pan - tomime , in which the gods , having had some two thousand years to acquire histrionic proficiency , reappear respectively as
Harlequin	LOCATION	, Clown , and
Pantaloon	ORGANIZATION	, with Psyche long since found and now turned into
Columbine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Skipping Pierrot and Mr.
Rich his Harlequins	PERSON	, the gods are next playing valet , rustic squire , and lawyer in an eighteenth-century English comedy of manners , which Psyche , as a chambermaid fresh from the country , deflects into reality or romance , accord - ing to your view .

		Finally -LRB- westward the stars of drama ! -RRB-

		the down-at-heels divinities , reduced to begging for stray roles , come to the `` old '' Ninety-Ninth Street Theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	more exactly , `` Number 2613 of the five thousand Attraction Houses controlled by the
Hustle Trust Circuit of Automatic Drama	ORGANIZATION	'' only to watch a rehearsal from which gramophones labeled `` Arthur '' and `` Grace '' have quite banished the buskins .

		It is too much for Clown , who sets his troupe atumbling in the good old way and with that magic dissolves the automatic theatre in red fire .

		Then we are back at the Styx : it is
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	.

		All of which , of course , makes no very schol - arly contribution to the literature about the Harlequin tradition .

		Had it been meant to , for that matter , it would doubtless have been elab - orated as a pageant like `` Caliban . ''

		But there is another , and if more slender a finer , tradition of the English stage to which consciously or unconsciously `` The Harlequinade '' makes a very genuine contribution the burlesque of literary fashions and technical means .

		From Bottom the
Weaver	PERSON	and `` The Knight of the Burning Pestle '' to the Deputy Sub-Inspector of the
New York	LOCATION	and
New Jersey Division	ORGANIZATION	of the
Hustle Trust Circuit	ORGANIZATION	may seem a far cry .

		And the landmarks between are rare enough , a few more than `` The Rehearsal '' and `` The Critic '' before Victorian taste mistook parody for burlesque and encouraged countless punning trav - esties , now justly forgotten .

		Within our day , however , the stage has seen more frequent revivals of the real burlesque spirit , as when Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	tilted at the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	halo in `` The Dark Lady of the Sonnets '' and pilloried the critics in `` Fanny 's First Play , '' or when Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	reduced the problem formula to absurdity in `` A Slice of Life . ''

		Our revues mostly incline to the easier course of parody ; yet they have helped laugh away the worst excesses of the dance craze , the `` Follies '' once burlesqued themselves and the movies together , and one will not soon forget
Bert Williams	PERSON	's version of `` Androcles and the Lion . ''

		There is health in an art that can laugh at itself .

		And there must be some justification for
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	enthusiasm in a period whose commercial theatre indulges literary burlesque .

		The best stage burlesque satisfies two demands , which easily become contradictory : it must estab - lish intimate relations with the audience , and it must never betray any consciousness of its own humor .

		`` The Harlequinade '' achieves intimacy with a running commentary on its action by an announcer , the ingenuous fifteen-year-old
Alice	PERSON	, who is very much in earnest about the whole mat - ter and who is continually interrupted , checked , or corrected from the other side of the proscenium by her fond
Uncle Edward	ORGANIZATION	.

		Between them they score some shrewd hits on the fashionable audi - ence that arrives late -LRB- `` Some of 'em always late , '' Uncle Edward tells
Alice	PERSON	.

		`` It 's their dinner . '' -RRB-

		, that improves the intermission -LRB- during which Uncle Edward himself sends out for a pint -RRB- , and that has certain pronounced tastes -LRB- `` Uncle , the rest of it is n't a very nice story .

		Will they mind ? ''

		`` They ?

		They 'll like it all the better . ''

		Or again : `` And do n't gabble .

		This ai n't the metaphysics , which they ca n't abear .

		This is '' facts .

		They respect facts . '' -RRB-

		But at no time does either of these slip out of character or appear as other than an anxious , businesslike manager .

		And the players themselves keep properly within the frame thus set up .

		The skeptical philosopher who refuses to credit his senses when he comes to the Styx , the archaic mummery of the pantomime , the preposterous point of honor in the high comedy , even the extravaganza of the automatic rehearsal all are veriest reality to the actors .

		When the Sub-Inspector says to Clown , `` Young man , if this were a performance , you would be dealt with by our aesthetic policewoman .

		Vulgar comments made in public upon works of art are now an indictable offence , '' Clown 's interruptions have not been vulgar ; they have been tragic .

		And it is not horseplay but tragic necessity for Harlequin to leap upon the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 pink , croaking gramophones on their green stands .

		This rehearsal scene , which is really a play within a play within a play , is quite in the
Villiers	LOCATION	-
Sheridan	PERSON	tradition .

		It is also entirely in tradition that the rehearsed piece itself should be less funny than the dia - logue of the onlookers .

		`` Love : a Disease '' -LRB- author `` Number Two Factory of Automatic Dramaturgy ;
Plunkville	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	'' -RRB- is much thinner stuff than `` A Slice of Life '' and might in fact have come from the racing pen of Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	.

		There is more sting in the gossip about
Theodor B. Kedger	PERSON	, who had `` made good '' manipulating `` wood-pulp potatoes , syn - thetic bread , and real estate '' before he purchased all the theatres -LRB- `` both of the Variety and of the Monotonous kind '' -RRB- , bought up all the drama - tists `` with their copyrights present and future , '' paid all the actors to stop acting -LRB- `` which was in some cases a needless expenditure of money '' -RRB- , annexed all the Cinema and talking-machine inter - ests , and began to experiment `` in the scientific manufacture and blending of drama . ''

		Finally no less than twenty-three factories dot the grassy meads of
America	LOCATION	.

		The work is done by clerks em - ployed at moderate salaries for eight hours a dav .

		For the cerebration of whatever new ideas may be needed , several French literary men are kept in chains in the backyard , being fed exclusively on absinthe and caviare sandwiches during their periods of creative activity .

		No less than forty different brands of drama are turned out , each with its description stamped clearly on the can .

		`` Do the public like the stuff ? ''

		asks Clown .

		`` They 've got to like it , '' replies the Deputy Sub-Inspector .

		`` They get nothing else . ''

		CLARENCE BRITTEN .

		An Imagist Novel HONEYCOMB .

		`` Pilgrimage , '' III .

		By
Dorothy M. Richardson	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		What happy intuition told the author of `` Pilgrimage '' to issue the book in these short installments ?

		The process , you find as you read this volume , the third of the series , has been almost exactly timed to your capacity of assimila - tion .

		The sweetish-sour style and the strange , sensitive representations of a young English girl 's impressions of her life are an acquired taste .

		`` Pointed Roofs , '' with its flickering scenes of the German school where the girl goes as governess , was too insubstantial to stir the mind .

		`` Back - water '' might even have repelled you with its close sultry prison of the home to which she returns .

		But `` Honeycomb '' suddenly clarifies what the author is trying to do .

		Her idiom suddenly seems familiar , and the novel slant at which she looks on life captures your imagination as a genuine artistic creation , and not as that trick which it might have seemed .

		The particular idiom and vision of this writer are the same as those of the makers of imagist verse .


Miriam	PERSON	, the girl , sees the world as a stream of sensed pictures , in hard clear outlines , where the form is more significant than the con - tent .

		In `` Honeycomb '' she is the governess in the English country house of a commonplace middle-class family .

		Nothing happens , outside of the children 's lessons and a trip or two to town , except the arrival of quasi-smart people for a
week-end	DATE	.

		This is not , however , what happens to
Miriam	PERSON	's vivid feeling .

		People , house , and furnishings dissolve together and then flow back to her in intense forms and colors , exciting or depressing the reflections of her brain .

		The story is of her quick impressions and the racing stream of her inner thoughts , her puzzles and desires .

		Her contact with people , with social forms , with everything around her are contacts with some - thing alive , hurting her , doing something to her .

		It is not the objective facts that make up her life , but these intensely felt pictures of what goes on around her , and her own wondering mind , jump - ing from idea to idea as , restless and rebellious , it tries to burrow its way out of its squirrel-cage into reality .

		Nothing could be more uncannily real than these quick chains of thought which run through
Miriam	PERSON	's mind .

		Once you have accli - mated yourself , you find in this flow between sensed outer picture and inner reflection the very quality of experience , caught , with a precision that makes you marvel .

		At least , it is the very fibre of sensitive youth , with its despair of happiness and its scorn of the grubbing world .

		She toiled along feeling dreadfully tired ; the sounds of her boot soles on the firm , sand-powdered road mocked her , telling her she must go on .

		.

		If a victoria came along and in it a delicate old gentleman who had a large empty house with deep quiet rooms and a large sunny garden with high walls , and wanted some one to be singing and happy till he died , she would go ... They would share the great secret , dying of happiness .

		People ought to be able to die of happiness if they were able to admit how happy they were .

		If they admitted it aloud they would pass straight out of their bodies , alive ; unhappiness was the same as death , not suffering ; but letting suffering make you unhappy curse God and die , curse life , that was letting life beat you : letting God beat you .

		God did not want that .

		No one admitted it .

		No one seemed to know anything about it .

		People just went on fussing .

		And a `` sensed picture '' or two : Her eyes caught the clear brow and smooth inno - cently sleeked dark hair of a man at the other end of 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	the table under the fine level brows was a loudly talking , busily eating face all the noise of the world , and the brooding grieving unconscious brow above it .

		All the other forms were standing or moving in the gloom ; standing watchful and silent , the gleaming stems of their cues held in rest , shifting and moving and strolling with uncolliding ordered movements and little murmurs of commentary after the little drama the sudden snap of the stroke breaking the stillness , the faint , thundering roll of the single ball , the click of the concussion , the gentle angular explosion of pieces into a new relation and the breaking of the varying triangle as a ball rolled to its hidden destina - tion held by all the eyes in the room until its rumbling pilgrimage ended out of sight in a soft thud .

		It must have been passages like this that caused Wells to refer to
Dorothy Richardson	PERSON	's novel as futuristic .

		Certain passages , like
Miriam	PERSON	's walk on Regent Street , are pure imagism , exactly as the poets write it : Flags of pavement flowing along smooth clean gray squares and oblongs , faintly polished , shaping and drawing away sliding into each other ... I am part of the dense smooth clean paving stone ... sun - lit ; gleaming under dark winter rain ; shining under warm sunlit rain , sending up a fresh stony smell ... always there ... dark and light ... dawn , steal - ing ... But `` Honeycomb '' is not verse masquerading as a novel .

		It is an honest narrative , searching , living fantastic only to those who can not feel these very modern ways of looking at the world .

		The author has simply had the audacity to tell her story of this sensitive girl , neither child nor woman , from the attitude and with the values that those gifted young poets feel who have made us recognize in their nai 've , cool vision of beauty , and in their sense of flowing life , new vistas of our own .

		And she has had the genius to make out of her few materials a book of beauty and truth .

		It is not only the very essence of quivering youth , but of youthful femininity .

		`` Sex '' there is none .

		To
Miriam	PERSON	men are scarcely more than a distant earthquake registered on the seismo - graph of her wonder and perfect uncomprehend - ingness .

		It is women who are real to her and intrigue her the shimmering loveliness of the fair German girls , the marrying sisters at home , Mrs.
Corrie	PERSON	and her gay friends from
London	LOCATION	.

		Yet
Miriam	PERSON	is saturated with the vague , hidden sense of unawakened virginity .

		There is the tense shrinking from life and yet the ardor for life , the air of standing , half-contemptuously but stirred , before a closed door , on the other side of which is an obscure , not even imagined happiness .

		This writer knows the cruelty of life as well as the high , clear , clean , fresh , fair things , for which her
Miriam	PERSON	has so intense a love .

		I wonder if so completely feminine a novel as `` Pilgrimage '' has ever been written .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS THE GREEK ANTHOLOGY .

		5 vols. , Vol .

		III .

		With an English translation by
W. R. Paton	PERSON	.

		The
Loeb Classical Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Put - nam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This third volume of the Greek anthology contains `` the declamatory and descriptive epi - grams '' of Book IX , and seems to be richer in the former .

		But if anything were needed to prove that even at their most rhetorical moments the Greeks had the poetic evocative word , this collection declares it .

		Even the epigrams from the `` Stephanus '' of
Philippus	LOCATION	, which were writ - ten in the rhetorical period , are rich in forceful clarity .

		And the inscriptions for cups , paintings , bas-reliefs , and baths , with which the volume concludes , are especially pregnant .

		Such is the nameless lyric line : `` The Graces bathed here , and to reward the bath they gave to the water the brightness of their limbs . ''

		Mr.
Paton	PERSON	's translation is a happy one ; and while it might be desirable to have such a volume as this show more evidences of scholarly interest , this simple and lovely presentment of the epigrams is a valu - able addition to the classical library .

		THERE Is No DEATH .

		By
Richard Dennys	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The ancient superstition which forbids speak - ing ill of the dead is a most ungenerous handicap for critics who face the vast output of posthum - ous verse .

		Moreover , the friends who fondly publish these pale lyrics are wont to confuse a man 's character with his literary attainments .

		The present volume is no exception .

		It is pre - ceded by a preface that reads like a funeral eulogy .

		The man there presented seems to have been an interesting person , if only because he was privileged to work with
Gordon Craig	PERSON	in Flor - ence .

		But the verse itself shows neither the sensitive artist nor the keen philosopher .

		It has a kind of stereotyped sweetness , but little music , and it is quite barren of the startling phrase that is the true poet 's lightning .

		`` It was ... the world with its duties and conventions that mainly vexed his spiritual nature , '' writes the author of the prefatory note .

		`` People offended ; people requiring answers to their letters ... '' The verse does not betray a spiritual nature so lightly scratched , but that may be because it seems to be quite lacking in any spiritual quality .

		It is such verse as might easily be written by any young man whose education and comfortable living permitted him to appreciate his pleasant hours .

		It is mark - edly the production of youth , for it echoes youth 's sweet melancholy , plays smilingly with despair .

		The dignity of death can not of itself be expected to enhance the simple artifice of the amateur .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 453 A SHORT HISTORY OF DISCOVERY : From the
Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the Founding of Colo - nies on the
American Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Hendrik Willem van Loon	PERSON	.

		McKay ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Dr. van
Loon	ORGANIZATION	has written and drawn that rare thing a real book about real events for real children .

		Both in the prose , which is at once simple and rich , and in the posterish drawings , done in colored inks with a match , there is style , spirit , charm , and a genuine and unobtrusive humor .

		The book is nowhere tainted with the self-conscious sophisticating patronage which has infected so much of contemporary juvenile litera - ture , and only once or twice does it stray into the palpably `` improving . ''

		Yet it contains much accurate and interesting information which the child will not find in his school histories , presented with a running commentary of wise observation and seasoned reflection .

		The author meets his reader easily , as man to man , and tells his story so naturally that he communicates his own enthusiasm for the muse of history , whom his colleagues of the textbooks are smothering in documents .

		He concludes with a gentle satirical dig at the Puritans and their college , where `` by attending lectures , with great patience and indus - try I gradually learned to draw pictures with a fair amount of success . ''

		One closes the book wishing he had continued his narrative into recent times and shown us the romance of polar explora - tion ; one desires his picture of
Andree	PERSON	's balloon , his comment on Dr.
Cook	PERSON	.

		In a foreword `` to all grown-ups '' -LRB- in which all children will take delight -RRB- Dr. van Loon offers his book as `` an historical appetizer . ''

		Happy that adult who refreshes a jaded palate with this cocktail : he may be tempted to let the subsequent repast include the author 's more ambi - tious efforts in Dutch history and navigation .

		LE MORTE DARTHUR OF SIR
THOMAS MALORY	PERSON	AND ITS SOURCES .

		By
Vida D. Scudder	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The title might well indicate a typical erudite product of research , heavily weighted with foot - notes and intended for a few special students .

		But from the nature of the author 's previous work we are not surprised to find that the book `` makes no claim to explore new territory , but it hopes to fill the modest function of guide to a lovely country which is too rarely visited except by pioneers . ''

		After the years of minute research by many scholars `` it would seem , '' says
Miss Scudder	PERSON	, `` that the time is ripe for interpretive study . ''

		To the general reader who knows
King Arthur	PERSON	and his Table Round only through Ten - nyson and perhaps through occasional ventures into
Malory	PERSON	himself , this study will prove a gate - way to the vast and fascinating territory that lies beyond .

		A mere summary of the research of the
last half century	DATE	in this field is badly needed .

		But Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	has given us far more than a mere summary .

		She has given us insight into the meaning of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's redaction , both as a social document and as a work of art .

		And in tracing
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's complex sources she presents a fresh and significant revelation of the whole life of the Middle Ages .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	possesses a method and point of view which have been all too little represented in the past generation of American scholarship .

		But there are signs of a speedy return , at least in aim if not at once in accom - plishment , to this method , which is so character - istic of French criticism .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's book is , then , not only a fascinating guide for the general reader ; it is a model for a more enlight - ened and humane scholarship .

		THE PRESIDENT 'S CONTROL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS .

		By
Edward S. Corwin	PERSON	.

		Prince -
ton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		.

		The prominence assumed by questions of for - eign policy since Wood row
Wilson	PERSON	went to
Washington	LOCATION	has prompted one of the professors of politics at
Princeton	LOCATION	to bring together in a small volume the main historical incidents illus - trating the powers of the President in the diplo - matic field , together with the most instructive discussions which these incidents have aroused .

		Of the three parts into which the book is di - vided , one reproduces the historic debate of `` Pacificus '' -LRB-
Hamilton	PERSON	-RRB- and `` Helvidius '' -LRB- Mad - ison -RRB- in
1793	DATE	, and another an almost equally important discussion by Senators
Spooner	PERSON	and
Bacon	PERSON	in
1906	DATE	; in the third the author considers at some length the agencies of diplomatic inter - course , the making of treaties and executive agreements , and the President 's powers in rela - tion to war-making .

		The problems discussed are mainly such as have arisen from -LRB- a -RRB- the insuffi - ciency of the provisions of the Constitution , without construction , to afford the national gov - ernment its putative complete sovereignty in the handling of foreign affairs , and -LRB- b -RRB- the fre - quent overlapping of the powers bestowed by the Constitution upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and the President .

		`` The gaps ... in the con - stitutional delegation of powers to the national government , affecting foreign relations , have been filled in by the theory that the control of foreign relations is in its nature an executive function and one , therefore , which belongs to the Presi - dent in the absence of specific constitutional pro- vision to the contrary . ''

		The difficulty arising from overlapping of powers has been met by attributing to the respective holders of such powers full constitutional discretion in their dis - charge in other words , by converting a legal 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	complication into a question of practical states - manship , to be solved by negotiation and com - promise .

		The author 's analysis of the constitu - tional restrictions upon the President 's control of our foreign policy , notwithstanding the enormous growth of that control since
1789	DATE	, is especially worthy of mention .

		The treatise is so heavily documented as to become practically a commen - tary on a series of texts presidential messages , congressional debates , judicial decisions , and dip - lomatic correspondence .

		Its form is therefore hardly such as to appeal to the general reader .

		Yet one may venture the hope that our awakened interest in foreign affairs and foreign policy will bring books of this character into hands that in other days would hardly have been open to re - ceive them .

		A HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE .

		By
Fiske Kimball	PERSON	and
G. H. Edgell	PERSON	.

		Harpers ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		This is the first of a series of handbooks on the fine arts prepared , in the words of the pub - lishers ' announcement , `` with reference to class use in the higher institutions of learning , and they also provide authoritative , comprehensive , and interesting histories for the general reader . ''

		Their raison d'etre dwells largely in the fact that by reason of archaeological researches during the past twenty years , and the changed temper of criticism toward the fine arts in their relation to the evolution of civilization , most existing textbooks on these subjects are now relatively obsolete .

		An examinaation of this history of architecture would appear to justify the claims made for it by the publishers .

		It is a work of scholarship free from tediousness , pedantry , or special pleading , full of detailed information , yet with perspective values kept well in hand .

		The index , glossary , and bibliographical notes are full and specific ; the periods are well summarized and their chronology tabulated ; the text illustrations are numerous and well selected , including a grati - fyingly large number of clearly rendered cross sections and plans .

		Because the book deals with architecture in all its important manifestations from prehistoric times to the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and eighteen , the necessity for compression , and even for repression , was imposed ; but the authors have performed their task so well that the sense of this is seldom apparent , and never painfully so .

		Like all skilled performers they do their difficult feats smiling .

		The book must have been a hard one to write , but it is easy to read .

		The portion of the book which deals with the Middle Ages -LRB- Chapters VI-IX -RRB- is the work of Mr.
Edgell	PERSON	.

		It embraces a survey of Christian architecture from early Byzantine to the dawn of the Renaissance .

		The author succeeds in making clear the various phases of that evolution which culminated in the most superb temples to a Living God the world has ever seen .

		The fact that the theatre of this evolution what Mr.
Cram	PERSON	calls `` Heart of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is today the place of Armageddon , and that the finest of these masterpieces ,
Rheims	LOCATION	and
Amiens	LOCATION	, are under fire by German cannon , gives a particular poignancy to the reading of this part of the book .

		One looks with especial interest to the resume and appraisement of American architecture ; here the critical faculty is fatally apt to betray its limitations of vision , for a mist of familiarity renders the present far more obscure than any past which has left recoverable images .

		This chapter , the work of Mr.
Kimball	PERSON	, begins very properly with the Maya architecture of Yucatan .

		The author discusses the Toltec and Aztec remains in
Mexico	LOCATION	and devotes a paragraph to
Peru	LOCATION	, with its magnificent and mysterious ter - raced strongholds of a vanished and voiceless civilization .

		The widely different phases of Colonial architecture are well described , traced each to its source , and their characteristics intel - ligently differentiated .

		The Classic Revival receives in turn some attention , while the remainder of the essay is given over to the discussion of our later and latest architectural phases from
Richardson	PERSON	to
Frank Lloyd Wright	PERSON	.

		One rejoices in a view of the
Woolworth Build	ORGANIZATION	- ing from an unusual angle , though that beautiful obelisk would be represented as a matter of course .

		But it warms the critical heart to find justice done to
Sullivan	PERSON	, in a very true and penetrating analysis of his unique contribution to an architecture of democracy ; and it was both just and gracious to include in even this brief history of American architecture the name of
Harvey Ellis	PERSON	, who although he wrote his name scarcely at all in stone and iron , aroused to thought and to endeavor so many young men in the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		It may be said that the author acquits himself with credit in this essay , and brief as it is there is no better resume of American architecture extant .

		CHILD WELFARE IN
OKLAHOMA	LOCATION	.

		An Inquiry by the
National Child Labor	ORGANIZATION	Com - mittee for
the University of Oklahoma	ORGANIZATION	.

		Direction of
Edward N. Clopper	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pub - lished by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	; 75 cts .

		This inquiry proves to apply not only to local conditions in the state of
Oklahoma	LOCATION	, but to problems of current national importance .

		In this country the great mass of laws governing the welfare and protection of children is practi - cally uncorrelated , is full of discrepancies and loopholes , is about as unstandardized , in fact , as any group of laws that you will find .

		There
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 455 is a growing feeling among those concerned with progressive legislation that specialization must cease and cooperation begin , and that to be effect - ive the laws of each state should be brought together in a children 's code .

		Four states have already done this t but without sufficient previous study of existing conditions and administration .

		In
Oklahoma	LOCATION	, however , a state-wide survey has been made of all the conditions governing child welfare , and the reports of the investigators are now published in one volume .

		They cover the fields of public health , recreation , education , child labor , agriculture , juvenile courts and probation , institutional care of children , home rinding , poor relief , parentage and property rights ; and a chapter is added on the administration of the existing laws .

		Among the most interesting recent findings are those dealing with the problem of farm tenancy .

		But the really interesting feature of the book is that it constitutes the first state - wide survey of the kind that has been made in this country , and thereby sets a notable precedent for action in other states .

		PEACEFUL PENETRATION .

		By
A. D. Mc	PERSON	-
Laren	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Long before
1914	DATE	the world was aware of a well planned and cleverly directed campaign for the extension of German influence in both European and non-European countries .

		Mer - chants , commercial travelers , bank employees , journalists , missionaries , travelers , teachers , clerks , waiters these were but some of the agents employed in the grand propaganda of Deutschtum .

		An immediate object was the expansion of industry and trade , especially through the stimulation of a taste and a demand for German-made goods .

		But there were other and deeper purposes .

		German `` Kultur '' was to be planted throughout the world ; minor states and peoples were to be drawn into the orbit of
Germany	LOCATION	; the national life of great countries like
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	was to be honeycombed with alien influences ; commercial and cultural penetration was to be made to pre - pare the way for political influence .

		The scheme was largely the work of the Pan-Germans .

		But the
Kaiser	PERSON	himself was behind it .

		`` Thousands of your fellow countrymen , '' he declared to his people on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anni - versary of the founding of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, `` are liv - ing in all parts of the world ; German wares , German knowledge , German business energy traverse the ocean .

		The earnest duty , then , devolves upon you to form a strong link with this
Greater Empire	ORGANIZATION	, binding it to the Empire at home . ''

		Since the outbreak of the present war the insidiousness of the work of the advance agents of the
Wilhelmstrasse	LOCATION	has been revealed from many quarters , and the extent and charac - ter of the German efforts to prepare the world for German dominance have been a continual source of astonishment .

		In his `` Peaceful Pene - tration '' Mr.
McLaren	PERSON	, an Australian who lived for many years in
Berlin	LOCATION	, gives a very good , although admittedly but partial , account of these efforts .

		He tells us that his book would have been written had there been no war , because he had long been studying , in
Australia	LOCATION	and else - where , the workings of the German propagandist machine ; the war , he says , revealed to him and other observers a good many things , but con - firmed more .

		After a crisp discussion of what peaceful penetration is and means , he writes in an interesting way of the `` sleuth-hounds '' employed in the Imperial espionage , and espe - cially of the founder of the modern German secret service ,
Stieber	PERSON	.

		He describes the actual work - ings of the German agents in the British domin - ions and elsewhere , and gives an extended , and unfavorable , estimate of the German as a colo - nist .

		In a brief chapter he tells what
Germany	LOCATION	's `` pressing to the East '' means for
Australia	LOCATION	.

		The book can not be characterized as profound ; in some aspects it is decidedly superficial .

		Yet it is commendably temperate and it states in an interesting way many facts of great moment which , if not new , are at least unfamiliar to a large part of the reading public .

		THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION .

		PROTESTANTISM IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		By
Kerr D. MacMillan	PERSON	.


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Both books contain series of lectures delivered during
1917	DATE	, a four-hundredth anniversary year in Lutheran annals .

		The first , a sketchy , brochure - like book of four chapters , is an easy-flowing narrative of overdrawn generalities about the
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	, spending its space to show that the sixteenth century opened with the individual sub - merged because of the prevailing ecclesiastical attitude and closed with the individual having emerged to assert his `` place in the sun '' Luther 's achievement .

		The second , the
L. P. Stone Foundation	ORGANIZATION	lectures at
Princeton	LOCATION	, in its introduc - tion makes the modest claim to be the only work in English covering the development of the territorial system of Lutheran Church govern - ment .

		This development from the Reformation ideal of the universal priesthood of believers to the conviction that it was the duty of the layman to receive religion , like sanitation , from above , is intelligently and interestingly traced , first in Luther 's own thought , then more fully in the thought of the leaders of the following centuries .

		456 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	The entering wedge for this development was Luther 's belief that individual Christians did not have equal rights in the conduct of church affairs , but differing rights according to the estate in which God placed them .

		Of course God had placed the prince at the top !

		The author of this book however fails in appreciation of the social factors that interplay in all religious movements as , for instance , his undervaluation of the social significance of the Peasants ' War , in which Luther directed con - cerning the Peasants , `` Stab , beat , and strangle them , whoever can . ''

		Likewise , his conclusion that had the German states taken the superior Calvinistic system of church government , abso - lute monarchy could not have developed , reveals a strange lack of consideration for the social milieu that led to the divergent characteristics of Lutheranism and Calvinism .

		His derogatory statement that `` most modern German theology is not theology but psychology , '' bespeaks his dearth of interest in the psychosociological as a force in religious and historical development .

		DISASTERS : and the
American Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	in Disaster Relief .

		By
J. Byron Deacon	PERSON	.

		HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT .

		By
Florence Nesbitt	ORGANIZATION	.

		Russell Sage Foundation ; 75 cts .

		each .

		These two titles in the `` Social Work Series '' published by the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	will be of hardly less interest to the socially-minded public than to professional workers .

		Mr.
Dea	PERSON	- con 's account of
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	methods in disaster relief was fortunately just ready for printing when news came of the
Halifax	LOCATION	accident , and its proof sheets , which were sent to the
Canadian Commission	ORGANIZATION	in charge of the rehabilitation of that city , had immediate occasion to prove their use - fulness .

		Having followed one of the policies advocated in the book that of a permanent committee of emergency relief , with preparations made in advance the
Boston	LOCATION	Chapter was able to have supplies and experts on the way to
Hali	PERSON	- fax within a few hours after the catastrophe occurred .

		That the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	organization has fairly won its recognized position of leadership in relief work is largely due to its further policy of never assuming more authority than is freely granted by the local agencies , and to its success in consolidating and coordinating the various relief forces which
spring	DATE	up spontaneously in any emergency .

		A frequent situation which requires tactful handling is caused by independent com - mittees of well-intentioned people `` characterized by their simple , abiding faith in the efficacy of cash and food and clothes to meet all human needs whatsoever . ''

		Extended experience has shown this natural impulse toward indiscrimi - nate giving to be `` always futile and usually demoralizing , '' and a few general principles as to methods of procedure have been adopted : the unit of relief is the family ; relief should be pro- portioned to need , not to loss ; close cooperation with the family and the community is necessary for the restoration of normal living conditions as soon as possible .

		The repetition in successive chapters of the principles which apply to all situa - tions demanding relief , although for the general reader it detracts somewhat from the interest of the book , probably justifies itself to the profes - sional , who may thus refer quickly to a specific chapter in a given emergency .

		Under cover of a rather misleading title
Miss Nesbitt	LOCATION	in `` Household Management '' offers us a glimpse into the housekeeping difficulties of the poorer families , largely foreign born , in our big - ger cities .

		To give any acceptable help to the struggling homeworker in her effort to make inadequate funds yield the maximum of health and happiness to her family , the visiting social worker must be equipped with resourcefulness based on wide experience , with unlimited tact , and with a friendly willingness to distinguish between essential standards in home-making and comparatively unimportant details .

		The chapters devoted to dietary standards and choice of foods will be especially useful to workers who find their dietetic training unequal to the present-day demands for conservation .

		THE WAR AND THE
BAGDAD	LOCATION	RAILWAY .

		By
Morris Jastrow	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Lippincott ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This is much more than just an admirable economic and historical study , for it gives a genuine orientation in the present political welter of cross purposes .

		Most economic and his - torical studies , even when as carefully docu - mented and as engagingly written as this book of Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's , are mere studies in vacuo .

		Too often the sincere student 's timid - ity before generalization , out of fear of losing his objective and authoritative tone , prevents him from drawing the wider conclusions .

		Pro- fessor
Jastrow	PERSON	, although he marshals his bibliog - raphies with care and gives the full historical background that clusters around the story of the great highway from the East to the West , does not hesitate to draw the moral .

		Historically , the
Bagdad Railway	ORGANIZATION	represents `` the last act in the process of reopening the direct way to the
East	LOCATION	which became closed to the West by the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	in
1453	DATE	. ''

		And the in - stinctive reaction of all the Western powers against its control 's passing into the hands of any one power as
Germany	LOCATION	, who never seems to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 learn the significant lessons of history , planned that it should was a legitimate reaction .

		It was based on sound historical tradition .

		For the whole lesson from the past of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor is simply that the highway must be kept open to all nations .

		And that history `` voices a warning to the West that the reopening of the highway must not be used for domination over the
East	LOCATION	but for cooperation with it ; not for exploiting the
East	LOCATION	, but for a union with it . ''

		In a word , one more irrefutable argument is presented for that kind of internationalization which only an effec - tive league of nations can make possible .

		And , incidentally , one more irrefutable argument for the defeat of
Germany	LOCATION	's medieval ambitions .

		`` The War and the
Bagdad	LOCATION	Railway '' is an illu - minating , invaluable book , a product of the best type of humanistic scholarship .

		A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE CIVIL WAR .

		By
Ellis Paxson Ober	PERSON	- holtzer .

		Vol .

		I.
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The remarkable revolutions , social and eco - nomic , through which the people of this country have passed since Lee surrendered at Appomat - tox justify such a work as this proposes to be a history of our country in recent times .

		Not only the importance of the subject attracts both writer and reader , but the absence of critical work in this field of history calls for research and constructive study .

		Five volumes will prove rather a small canvas for such a subject .

		In this first installment Dr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	undertakes to describe the circumstances and con - ditions of American life at the beginning of the period .

		Here he has competitors in
Rhodes	LOCATION	's two thick volumes on the Reconstruction period and in
Emerson Fite	ORGANIZATION	's `` Industrial Conditions during the Civil War '' ; but neither of these competitors has presented the facts in quite so impressive and satisfactory a manner as the present author .

		The portrayal of the prostrate South at the end of the war is certainly unequaled in the literature of the subject .

		At the same time the story of the complex , extravagant , and wildly competitive economic life of the North is adequately treated .

		Rail - road building across the Western prairies , pros - pecting for oil in the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	coal region , emigration to the mining states and territories , the effects of constantly falling prices on agri - culture , and the hustle and hurry of life in the cities of the East all receive due attention .

		The far West of
1866	DATE	, the
Oregon	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	problems , the Chinese question , and the ruthless conduct of a new class of frontiersmen are brought under critical observation if not under critical analysis .

		Of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	and his policy of healing the nation 's wounds there is also much that chal - lenges interest .

		We are made to see what a dif - ference of temper in men placed high in authority may do for a people .

		Johnson endeavored to do exactly what
Lincoln	LOCATION	was beginning to do when the assassin removed him from his task .

		Everybody , both then and since , praises
Lincoln	LOCATION	; while few in
1866	DATE	and not many in later years had any but words of bitter condemnation for
Johnson	PERSON	.

		The difference lay largely in their manner of doing things , though one must not forget that the people themselves changed their position after
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's death and before
John	PERSON	- son had time to develop his policies .

		Perhaps the author has failed somewhat in his treatment of Sumner and
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, or it may be that he has reserved these interesting figures for the succeeding volume .

		At any rate it would have been well in this first installment to show what the real purposes of those bitterest of enemies of the `` accidental president '' were .

		It was the conflict of political and social purposes which led to the disastrous experiences of the
spring of 1868	DATE	which permeated economic life and party organizations .

		The distressing cor - ruption of public life , of business organizations , and even of the courts of justice is sadly described .

		But all this does not stand out in ugly proportions as in
Rhodes	LOCATION	's work .

		It is rather the inventive genius , the rich commercial life , and the buoyant optimism of a people who have just spent nearly a million lives and a third of their total wealth in a fight over the idea of national unity , that interests Mr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	.

		Nor may the reviewer quarrel with the author about this .

		Undoubtedly it is the constructive , the imaginative , and the forward-looking men that require attention from the historian .

		The method of this work is that of descrip - tion .

		Analysis and close scrutiny of men and movements are not conspicuous .

		The reader is brought into touch with American life through quotations from newspapers , addresses of public men , speeches in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and resolutions of labor organizations ; or , where quotations fail , indirect discourse is resorted to .

		The idea of the author is to write the history of the time as nearly as possible in the language and thought of the men of the time .

		The reader might well imagine himself listening to the contemporaries of
Johnson	PERSON	and Sumner as they discussed public measures or quarreled about the Southern prob - lem .

		Deliberate judgments of the merits of questions , of the right or wrong in the conduct of men , seldom appear in these pages .

		It is not the purpose of the author to explain things , but simply to narrate events .

		458 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT THE DEMOCRATIZING OF KNOWLEDGE DE - mands first of all that the sources of knowledge be made as accessible as possible .

		Important sources continue to elude the public collectors of books and manuscripts , and to owe their belated discovery to the initiative of private col - lectors .

		It is therefore encouraging that private collectors appear more and more to feel them - selves under an obligation in this matter that they increasingly recognize themselves rather as trustees than as irresponsible owners .

		A recent instance was that of a private collection of rare first editions , chiefly in the field of English literature , whose inheritor is reported to have sacrificed something like a hundred thousand dollars rather than dispose of it through the commercial channels , accepting instead an offer made on behalf of
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although there are more accessible shelves than those of a university library in
Austin	LOCATION	, at least the collection is not to be scattered , absorbed by other private collectors , and for another genera - tion withheld from students .

		In the same direc - tion lies the decision lately made by the
St. Louis Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	, which has now deposited its valuable collection of some 25,000 volumes in the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Private societies , it is true , have usually been less selfish than indi - viduals with their accumulations , as well as more competent to make profitable use of them ; yet too frequently the value of such libraries is more potential than real the value of an `` uncut '' book .

		Learned societies early recognized that the results of scholarship are public property ; the next step is to recognize that the sources of schol - arship should be available to all .

		A VIGOROUS OPPOSITION HAS OFTEN BEEN called the soul of an efficient government .

		But a vigorous opposition does not mean a merely noisy opposition , and still less a merely petulant one .

		Senator
Sherman	PERSON	, who has recently been making himself ridiculous by his speeches attack - ing the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, has apparently reached that point in intellectual development where he believes that a combination of Billy
Sunday	DATE	slang , cheap vulgarity , and the employment of a few catch-words like `` Socialism , '' `` the reds , '' and `` anarchy '' will impress the public as great states - manship .

		`` It is a bunch of economic fakers , howling dervishes , firebrands and pestilent fiends of sedition that he -LSB- the President -RSB- has around him . ''

		And then he goes on to particularize : Secretary
Baker	PERSON	is `` a half pacifist '' ; Postmaster General
Burleson	PERSON	is `` a State Socialist , '' as is also Secretary
Wilson	PERSON	-LRB- of Labor -RRB- ;
John H. Walker	PERSON	, a member of the President 's
Mediation Commission	ORGANIZATION	`` does not preach direct action in
Washington	LOCATION	, but he practices it at home '' ; Mr.
Creel	PERSON	`` has abused the Constitution , and the fathers who wrote it '' ;
A. C. Townley	PERSON	, who is described as having been `` taken up '' by the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, `` in reality represents pro-German influence '' ;
Louis F. Post	PERSON	,
Assistant Secretary of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, is a single-taxer , and `` it would serve his purpose if all the millionaires were destroyed and nothing but the vagrant and the proletariat remained . ''

		One can only hope that the Repub - lican Party leaders are embarrassed by this kind of incredibly petty `` spell-binding . ''

		Senator Lodge can still attack with dignity and adroit - ness the policies he does not admire .

		In fact is it not true to say that the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	is strengthened rather than hindered by the kind of opposition represented by Senator Sherman ?

		ORDINARILY PUBLIC OPINION WOULD IGNORE this partisan childishness as just a depressing sur - vival of bad taste and that small-minded orator - ical demagoguery which since the war has some - how lost its ancient appeal .

		But the reason it can not be ignored is that , for all its absurd flamboyance , it is symptomatic .

		Fissures have already begun to appear in our `` sacred union '' of political parties and there is a fall campaign coming .

		Consequently it is the duty of all those who sincerely support the liberal international policies of President
Wilson	PERSON	to do all in their power to clarify the opposition and make it definite .

		That opposition has two legitimate sides , both of which have little to do with ordi - nary partisan politics of Democrat versus Repub - lican , as we understand partisan politics in
America	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately there is danger that these two aspects of legitimate opposition will be hope - lessly confused .

		In so far as the opposition con - cerns itself with criticism of the conduct of the war shipping , aeroplane production , munitions , and so on it is , when it is honest and gives no aid to the enemy , to be encouraged .

		A wise govern - ment welcomes all sincere criticism which aids it towards ever greater efficiency .

		But this kind of criticism should not be confused with the attack on President
Wilson	PERSON	's distinctive international purposes a league of nations , progressive dis - armament if possible , removal of the economic barriers and jealousies between nations , a genuine democratic peace , issues that cut right across all conventional party lines .

		Here , again , the oppo - sition has a perfect right to express its views however distressing such expression may be for the more liberal element among our cobelliger - ents and to try to win public opinion to what it believes should be the national policy .

		Only thus can it be fought in the open , and -LRB- we trust -RRB- defeated in fair battle .

		What will be intolerable however will be a confusion in which we shall have to listen to speeches of this sort : `` The
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 459
Administration	ORGANIZATION	has fallen down on its job of conducting the war , and therefore after the war we must have a high tariff to protect our worlcingmen , '' which , of course , is precisely like saying , `` The sum of the squares of two sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse , and therefore red is preferable to green as a color . ''

		Yet it is just this vicious kind of confusion which seems already to be fore - shadowed .

		Right now the duty of the liberal supporters of President
Wilson	PERSON	is to help clarify the opposition so that the contest between those who believe in a new international order and those who cynically cling to the old may be a contest which has some vital relation to our everyday politics .

		This is not a question of mere party lines at all .

		It is a contest between those who believe that President
Wilson	PERSON	's high demo - cratic purposes are possible of attainment , and those who think that this war is like all other wars and that after it is over the old international anarchy of jealous and competitive states will be restored .

		A DELIGHTFUL EXAMPLE OF THAT FLEXIBIL - ity of mind which is one of the principal charms of our contemporary press was recently given by the
New York	LOCATION	`` Globe '' in its comments on Mr.
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	's article `` Traps for the Un - wary , '' published in these pages on
March 28	DATE	.

		Now to change one 's mind is of course no longer considered a mark of intellectual instability .

		We have successfully learned
Emerson	PERSON	's lesson about that `` hobgoblin of little minds , '' and in a chang - ing world changing opinions are an indication of vigor .

		But we must confess that the intellectual world in which the `` Globe '' appears to have its being changes with a bewildering rapidity which is somewhat difficult to follow .

		Clinging to literary standards with a dogmatic stubbornness is not exactly an amiable trait , yet what are we to believe when a newspaper throws over all its standards between twelve o'clock and three o'clock of the same day ?

		Mere provocative caprice ?

		Perhaps , but surely the demands upon the intellectual agility of that newspaper 's readers are somewhat severe .

		In its early `` news extra '' edition of
April 5	DATE	the `` Globe '' said editorially , `` Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	contrasts much of the work here -LSB- in
America	LOCATION	-RSB- , literary and dramatic , with the craftsmanship displayed in
M. Copeau	ORGANIZATION	's season of French dramatic art in the Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	.

		It is a legitimate contrast , and one that can not be too forcibly drawn for our writers .

		We must get over defending and attacking the artificial and dry-rotted conventions of passing society , as they are mirrored in the ` genteel , ' and ignore it .

		Then the open road will lie before our artists and writers . ''

		Naturally on reading this we were gratified that our contributor should receive such favorable mention .

		Alas !

		that pleas - urable emotion was short-lived .

		For the `` final '' edition firmly took away with the left editorial hand what had been so generously bestowed with the right .

		No longer was Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	the wise and shrewd commentator on current literary tendencies .

		On the contrary , so remarkable was the metamorphosis between the crowded study hours of twelve and three that he was now pictured as an intellectual minnow swimming in a shallow pool .

		The illumination of those three hours of ratiocination went even further , and we are awed at the mighty editorial conferences which must have taken place during them .

		No longer must great art of the present be `` an expression of the fulness of life today . ''

		The mellow philosophy of the `` final '' edition expressed it differently : `` It is n't true that the great art of the past has been an expression of life , if by fulness is meant completeness of revelation and absence of convention .

		Convention has always ruled .

		The definition of taboo has changed , but not the fact of taboo . ''

		This would have been confusing enough , in view of the earlier amiabil - ity of the `` Globe , '' if the following rather bitter remark left no doubt that the newspaper had undergone a change of conviction great as it was sudden : `` The creative spirit of our times functions feebly largely because it is pestered and discouraged by gadflies developed out of filth who think parasitism is all there is to life . ''

		We confess we should be glad to answer the `` Globe , '' except that , unfortunately , these light - ning changes of editorial opinion make the task seem one of supererogation .

		Can we be sure that by the time our reply is written the `` Globe '' will not once more have changed its mind ?

		We admit that we have not the `` Globe 's '' technique of celerity in evolving new literary philosophies that we sometimes cling to our opinions for a whole day .

		Evidently newspapers are not bound by any such conventional demands for consistency .

		Certainly it is a convenient freedom .

		We should be indeed sorry to learn that there was anything so ordinary as a mere difference of editorial opinion in the office of the `` Globe , '' for we should then be forced to abandon our admiration for that newspaper 's intellectual versatility .

		THE AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ' ASSOCIATION will hold their annual convention
May 14	DATE	, 15 , and 16 .

		They have postponed accepting an invitation to
Boston	LOCATION	, on the ground that
Boston	LOCATION	offers too many `` distractions '' for a gathering intent upon complying with the government 's require - ment that conventions in war time serve a useful purpose .

		Therefore
New York	LOCATION	!

		Will Father Knickerbocker now amend his estimate of
Boston	LOCATION	as `` a state of mind '' to read `` a distracted state of mind '' ?

		460 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 9	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION From
Franklin	PERSON	and
Woolman	PERSON	, through the journalizing
New Englanders	LOCATION	, to
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, our literature has been fortunate in the readiness with which its makers have discoursed about themselves .

		Few have been so charmingly loquacious as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		His latest work of this kind , `` Years of My Youth , '' originally pub - lished two years ago , has recently appeared in an illustrated edition uniform with his other books -LRB- Harpers ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The illustrations are valuable even for American readers , picturing as they do a workaday section of
America	LOCATION	, southern
Ohio	LOCATION	, that has been alien ground to most novel readers .

		Espe - cially alien is that drab democratic individualistic
Ohio River	LOCATION	country of a time that was warming to the bloody solution of the slavery problem .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	presents a faithful picture fully and vividly , so fully and vividly that the professional historian will value his account .

		The slavery struggle at least once came to the very heart of the family circle : `` These uncles had grown up in a slave state , and they thought , without thinking , that slavery must be right ; but once when an abolition lecturer was denied public hearing at
Martin 's Ferry	ORGANIZATION	, they said he should speak in their mother 's house ; and there , much unaware , I heard my first and last abolition lecture , barely escaping with my life , for one of the objections urged by the mob outside was a stone hurled through the window , where my mother sat with me in her arms . ''

		In the new dispensation following the war , the federal principle , as developed in American history , will doubtless play an important part .

		For this reason the thinking American , who is not perhaps very easy to find , will wish to know more about the growth of the federal principle than he presum - ably knows now ; and for this reason he may care to browse in a new life of
Calhoun	PERSON	`` The Life of
John Caldwell Calhoun	PERSON	, '' by
William M. Meigs	PERSON	-LRB-
Neale	LOCATION	; boxed ,
$ 10	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		Only the professional his - torian will care to read every word of this two - volume , 934-page book .

		Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	's point of view , in dealing with so delicate a subject , is happily that of a man who , entering sympathetically into an idea in his eager youth , now sees its inadequacy .

		We are therefore assured both sympathy and judgment .

		It is the first `` full-length '' portrait of
Calhoun	PERSON	, who is revealed as an interesting figure and a great man with clearly defined limitations .

		It is also , inci - dentally , a history of battles long ago that should be vividly present to the intelligent American patriot .

		`` Journalism for High Schools , '' by
Charles Dillon	PERSON	-LRB-
Lloyd Adams	PERSON	Noble ;
$ !	MONEY

		. -RRB-

		is a generously illus - trated and `` documented '' handbook that seems a little uncertain whether it is addressed to teachers or to pupils .

		The point is important because the pages which urge the adoption of some journalistic instruction in the high school contain several argu - ments calculated to make the student feel that the whole project is only a cunning device to promote discipline and protect thin-skinned teachers from anonymous `` roasts . ''

		A disproportionate emphasis upon censorship unfits the book for the use of pupils .

		On the other hand , it contains much that is too elementary to be of value to any teacher intelligent enough to be entrusted with so exacting a subject .

		The author presupposes the expropria - tion of the school paper as a laboratory a confisca - tion demanding some delicacy and perhaps not worth while , for the American pupil usually resents any invasion of his precious `` activities '' and there seems to be a growing doubt among teachers of journalism as to whether the laboratory method is valuable enough to justify the hard work it enforces from the instructor .

		Meanwhile Mr.
Dillon	PERSON	's plea for making elementary English instruction vital through contacts with the everyday demands upon written expression is a sound one ; and the teacher expected to provide such instruction will find in this book some very useful material , doubly useful for its practical hints if he be called upon to create or maintain a school paper .

		He should not let it be forgotten however that the language has nobler uses than those of journalism .

		Mrs.
R. Clipston Sturgis	PERSON	has a very jolly way of reflecting grandmotherhood in her `` Random Reflec - tions of a Grandmother '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ !	MONEY

		. -RRB-

		No sit-by-the-fire-and-knit ancestress is she , but a modern of the moderns , and gifted with a very charming way of writing about her houseful of three generations .

		She is in many ways however a most baffling modern grandmother .

		Her sense of humor is delightfully apparent , and yet she actually says in sober seriousness that
Boston	LOCATION	`` is really the only place outside
England	LOCATION	in which any one of intelligence would be willing to live , and I am not unmindful of my privileges . ''

		Now the question is , was she trying to take us in ?

		Literature very rarely presents so clearly the point of view of contracted cosmopolitanism for which the author stands .

		She is completely , unconsciously , delight - fully of her class and of its standards .

		Her outlook is a completed product , almost a work of art .

		Trust problems have been reviewed from various angles , including in their range the wise and the foolish , not to mention the hysterical .

		The grow - ing mass of literature on the subject testifies to the general interest in the problem .

		The present work , `` The Trust Problem , '' by
J. W. Jenks	PERSON	and
W. E. Clark	PERSON	-LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, is a thorough revision and enlargement of an earlier book , and as it is based on first-hand investigation , with all its facts reexamined to square them with contemporary changes , the volume has special value in this new form .

		Cavalry , except on the far fringes of the war , has been robbed of its historic and picturesque utility .

		But the horse and pony and mule have played no inconsiderable part in that desperate economy that has made modern warfare possible .

		It is , however , of the place that the small horse occupies in our normal , domestic economy , where his latest cham - pion maintains that he may easily become a rival to the horse , and in the increasing use of this breed in our sports and out-door recreation , that
Frank Townend Barton	PERSON	has written with such knowledge and enthusiasm in `` Ponies and All About Them '' -LRB-

$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		Moreover , with the decline of racing on these shores and the se - questration of polo in our society as a game to be indulged in only by the rich , the chief appeal of such a painstaking volume will be to the American breeder and horse-lover .

		Yet it is a volume that should be in the library of all animal-friends , serv -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 461 ing a practical as well as an educative purpose .

		While the time is still distant when `` the game of kings '' will become widely indigenous -LRB- the polo pony , as in
India	LOCATION	, drawing the family dog-cart be - tween games -RRB- , still there is a need for wider in - terest than is now bestowed on this attractive breed .

		How many of American riders acquired the rudi - ments of a good seat and hands on the pony of their childhood !

		As for the
Shetland	LOCATION	, because of his docility and endurance he is and will continue to be par excellence the child 's mount .

		An enthu - siastic veterinarian like Mr.
Barton	PERSON	takes stock of all the characteristic and ideal points of the small horse , imparts valuable hints regarding con - formation of the different types that will be ap - preciated by breeders , and includes indispensable chapters on anatomy , care and management , and diseases .

		The illustrations , especially of famous perfect types of the various breeds , are well chosen .

		Needless to say , a book of this definitive nature , in these parlous times , could only have found an author and a publisher across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		`` The Human Side of Birds '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- is the latest member of a series of books by
Royal Dixon	ORGANIZATION	designed to demonstrate the remarkable intel - ligence of plants and animals , the older volumes being `` The Human Side of Plants '' and `` The Human Side of Trees . ''

		As the titles suggest , the books are popular in treatment ; the author has simply collected from his own observation and all manner of other sources the facts that point in the desired direction .

		Many excellent photographic illustrations help out the text .

		The author tells of `` feathered artists , '' `` policemen of the air , '' `` dancers , '' `` feathered athletes , '' `` scavengers and street cleaners , '' `` courts of justice , '' `` bird actors and their theatres '' and other winged people , emphasiz - ing the human element so vigorously that one fears at times that he finds it where it is n't .


Alice E. Ball	PERSON	's book , `` A Year with the Birds '' -LRB-

		, is a very different kind of thing a long series of pictures illustrated with verses , chiefly by `` A. E. B. '' Like the plates in
Chapman	PERSON	's `` Bird Life , '' the plates of the present book are excellent sketches so skilfully drawn and colored that they are more useful for identification than any other kind of illustration more useful , even , than bird skins would be .

		With scarcely any exceptions , the plates are either as good as any others or better .

		Mr.
T. Gilbert Pearson	PERSON	rightly remarks , `` I should like to see the book in the hands of every Junior Audubon Society member and every school-child in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It has all the requisites of a gift book , even unto the price , which is three dollars .

		Among the indirect gains resulting from the war will be a largely increased variety in our repertoire of menus and a more intelligent interest in the value of food .

		Housewives and teachers of cookery who for years have been trying to interest their circles in attractive recipes to relieve the monotony of the con - ventional American combinations , and have been meeting with but half-hearted encouragement , are now fortified by the conservation campaign .

		The result is a vigorous crop of cookery books .

		`` Wheat - less and Meatless Days '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- by
Pauline D. Partridge	PERSON	and
Hester M. Conklin	PERSON	one a housewife and the other a practical teacher is a well chosen collection of recipes , at the same time simple in the making and inexpensive .

		`` Savings and Savoury Dishes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	; 65 cts . -RRB-

		, which was originally published by the
Patriotic Food League	ORGANIZATION	of
Scotland	LOCATION	to meet the needs of small house - holders on war-reduced incomes , contains many old - country recipes and customs worthy of emulation here .

		Although such provocative names as Toad-in - the-Hole , Pot
Haggis	PERSON	, and
Cornflour Shape	ORGANIZATION	disguise dishes more or less familiar to us , the book contains much we can learn and more we can practice in the way of economies neglected during our fat years .

		`` War-Time Bread and Cakes , '' by
Amy L. Handy	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	; 75 cts . -RRB-

		, is made up of recipes for combining various kinds of flour that may be substituted for white flour .

		The recipes have been carefully worked out in the author 's kitchen and should be welcomed by the housewife who has lately been tending toward the use of baker 's bread because of the difficulty of making a satisfactory loaf from war-time flours .

		The recipes in the `` Economy Cook Book , '' by
Maria Mcllvaine Gill	PERSON	- more -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, are designed to carry out the plans of the
Food Administration	ORGANIZATION	by reducing the use of wheat , meats , sweets , and fats .

		The book includes much of our new-found wisdom in con - servation and will prove a useful kitchen handbook .

		The present condition of the food supply is treated simply and readably in
Mary S. Rose	PERSON	's `` Everyday Foods in War Time '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	; 80 cts . -RRB-

		, which explains the nutritive values of our common foods and makes suggestions for adapting them to the household menu .


Dora Morrell Hughes	PERSON	gossips about `` Thrift in the Household '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- in very practical fashion and man - ages to include a surprising number of suggestions for economy and better management that will be new to many housewives .

		A less specialized book , which is destined to super - sede many of the standard old cook books as a household favorite , is ``
Caroline King	PERSON	's Cook Book '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The author reduces the whole subject matter of cookery to a few funda - mental processes and basic formulae , which can be elaborated at will to emulate the most complicated lists of recipes .

		It is a method of treatment that will prove illuminating to the experienced house - keeper and reassuring to the beginner .

		In `` Diabetic Cookery '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-


Rebecca W. Oppenheimer	PERSON	presents a valuable handbook of recipes successfully used in the treatments at
Carlsbad	LOCATION	and Neuenahr , with diet tables and a list of places where specially prepared foods may be secured .

		The volume is fully supplied with information to make it practical for use in the home , and it should be valuable to anyone who has to solve the problem of a diabetic dietary .

		`` The Child 's Food Garden , '' by
Van Evrie Kil	ORGANIZATION	- patrick -LRB-
World Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	; 48 cts . -RRB-

		, is a useful little book which , can be put direct into the hands of children in the grammar grades to teach them how to start a garden and how to take care of it .

		The instructions are simple and definite enough to be of use to adult amateurs who have forgotten , if they ever knew , how to help things grow .

$ 1.50	MONEY	THE MACMILLAN COMPANY , Publishers ,
New York	LOCATION	When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL .

		THE DIAL jfortnirrfjtlp Journal of Criticism and SDiscussion of Hitrraturc and Artist and Tradesman Thank you very much for your kind letter and please thank the
Dunsany Dramatic Circle	ORGANIZATION	from me : tell them I am most grateful to them for their appre - ciation , a thing denied to so many poets during their lifetime .

		It is indeed most generous of them , for there is no law to compel any one to pay the simple debt of appreciation , if it is indeed due , and almost immemorial custom would support them in not paying it yet .

		When a poet is dead his death certificate is regarded as a kind of invoice , and people say , `` Now we must give him the thanks that we owe him . ''

		Even your letter too might well have come at such a time , for it was written on the day on which I had long expected to go to the front , in which I was disappointed only at the last moment .

		Well , you ask me for `` advice to aspir - ing playwrights '' ; so I will try to do as you please out of common gratitude , although I would sooner not , for it is presumptuous of me to offer advice and really I know nothing of the stage .

		I know that my dreams have got on to the stage , but that is not because I knew anything of its rules but because the march of dreams is irre - sistible , the mightiest things on earth .

		Now there are two kinds of playwrights -LRB- indeed all writers are divided into two kinds , quite distinct -RRB- tradesmen and artists .

		The first are the more numerous , the more rich ; they are the rulers of the time .

		-LRB- I mean by tradesmen the men whose in - spiration is money . -RRB-

		To them I would say , `` Try painting pieces of lead yellow and selling them in the street as gold bricks . ''

		Money can be made that way and it is money they need .

		I know it is an old trick , but no older nor more trans - parent than theirs ; above all it is more honest to sell lead for gold than to sell stale phrases as thought , and false con - ventions as emotion .

		They are the men whose disinterested purpose is to `` provide what the public wants , '' they always pla - giarize the play that pleased the basest part of the mind of the greatest number last year .

		But because the public ate oranges in the gutter
last night	TIME	, it does not want the peel -LRB- with a few chemicals added -RRB- put before it as marmalade for - ever .

		But the artists are the rulers of the generations .

		They are the only people to whom it is worth giving advice , and the only people who do n't need it .

		So what can I say to them ?

		Merely idle thoughts as they run through my mind .

		A play is made of sincerity , with that , kink in its tail that we call the dramatic , and style .

		One can say nothing of style except that a man 's own style is the only one for him to write in ; it grows with him and changes with him and is a part of him .

		One ca n't write in another man 's style that is his job : it 's like trying to do your own plumbing , which may annoy the plumber and in any case is n't a bit like plumbing when it is done .

		Style is the expression of your own sincerity .

		There is not one Truth in the world , nor one world .

		In one drop of water there are many heavens reflected , according to where you stand and look at it .

		In the same way many truths shine on the human mind and are reflected back by it .

		One man says , ``
Russia	LOCATION	is like this '' ; another says , `` It is like that '' ; and another says , `` It is like another thing '' all speaking the truth as they 've seen it .

		And the fool writes a book called ``
Russia	LOCATION	as it Really Is , '' think - * A letter written to the
Dunsany Dramatic Circle	ORGANIZATION	in response to a request for advice to `` aspiring playwrights . ''

		In writing THE DIAL , granting permission to publish the letter -LRB- a permission previously granted by its owner -RRB- ,
Lord Dunsany	PERSON	explained the tardiness of his reply as follows : `` I was in the Hindenburg Line at the time and the place was not propitious to the mood of letter-writing , which comes of leisure ; and we occupied our leisure there in eating , sleep - ing , and discussing subjects like the creation of the world and modern politicians and how to keep flies out of jam . ''

		474 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	ing there can be only one manifestation of one thing to all the world forever .

		Sincerity is a great force in all work and is too great a light to be hidden under any bushel .

		-LRB- I get near truisms now . -RRB-

		All men have sincerity and it flashes forth from their work .

		The man that tries to cheat you on the race course and the man that writes advertisements of poisonous drugs have sincerity : their sincere purpose is to get your money , and this purpose is seen in their style just as the same purpose is seen in the tradesman 's play , with his eye all the while on the box-office .

		The message of most modern plays is `` Give Me Money . ''

		But the message of a work of art is too complex to be put into a few words or into a few sentences , or into words any shorter than the length of the work itself even if it is an epic .

		There are millions who would say of Ham - let , `` What is it all about ? ''

		and expect to be told in half a minute what it took
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself many months to write .

		I am not my own master till this war is won , and being often interrupted I find it difficult to write a consecutive letter .

		But the gist of my impertinence , for it is impertinent to offer advice to artists , is sincerity of purpose and the certainty that the worker 's purpose is revealed in every work .

		I mean let them not call grass purple if they think it green in order to appear daringly original ; or green if they think it purple in order to please the public who believe it to be green .

		An artist in fact must be true to his own inspiration And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man .

		I think you can only have seen my `` Five Plays '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- .

		Of these `` The Glittering Gate '' is without beauty , being written in cockney dialect ; `` The Lost Silk Hat '' is frivolous ; and `` King Argimenes , '' though it has a pleasant beginning a king in rags gnawing a bone rather falls away from that inspiration and does not climb up as it should to a great climax , or in stage parlance `` a good curtain . ''

		Yet there are certainly things in it I like myself , such as `` the tear-song , the chaunt of the low born '' -LRB- the words have a pleasant sound to me as I recall them -RRB- and `` who - ever be thy gods , whether they punish thee or whether they bless thee . ''

		Yes , that is in a new and unknown country right enough where people speak like that , and it is in an unknown country that I laid the play .

		But the construction is bad , though the atmosphere is all right .

		It was a very early play and I had the inspiration of a king sitting on the ground in rags eat - ing his bone , and built the play on that , which is rather like building a roof and the house afterwards but you do in
America	LOCATION	, do n't you ?

		Then there is `` The Golden Doom , '' rather slight I fear ; but there cer - tainly is a truth in that , the very little hav - ing its share in events as much as the very great , as an inch of a rope is as important as a mile of it .

		I liked the start of that play , I remember the feeling of oppression , al - most of doom , and the sentry sighing , `` I would that I were swimming down the Gyshon , on the cool side , under the fruit - trees . ''

		But there is only one of the five with which I am content .

		I love the `` Gods of the Mountain . ''

		`` And the doom found him on the hills at evening '' I remember how that pleased me , and the despairing cry `` Rock should not walk in the
evening	TIME	. ''

		But I have two plays better than that , a four-act tragedy and a rather short three - act one ; and a one-act play about equal to it all unacted yet and unprinted ; and a two-act play called `` The Tents of the Arabs '' -LRB- `` Plays of Gods and Men . ''

		Luce -RRB- , perhaps a little more poetical than dramatic , which was acted in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Manchester	LOCATION	; and a three-act comedy ; and another one-act play ; besides two one-act plays that I do n't care for and do n't wish staged .

		Please bow for me to the Circle that has honored me and say that if ever their fancies have found pleasure in playing by strange seas to which I have led them for a moment , your letter has well repaid me .

		Yours , and theirs , gratefully , DUNSANY .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 475 The Public Library and the
Public Need Greece	ORGANIZATION	fell because she did not know the difference between a museum and a bank .

		This illuminating diagnosis of Pro- fessor
Zimmern	PERSON	's applies not merely to the ancient world ; it also has a significance for contemporary
America	LOCATION	.

		All over the country are store-houses of information , but these public libraries are in the nature of the Greek `` liturgy , '' monuments of local interest .

		In hardly any sense are they national banks of thought .

		For the gold standard of intellectual life is scientific knowledge , and its currency should be available not merely to the stu - dent preparing his thesis in solitary en - thusiasm , but likewise to the citizen working for a healthy government , to the business man who wants knowledge of other men 's experience , to that too large majority of our population which has not had any organized learning since the meagre offering of the public schools .

		Who will maintain that our libraries now successfully perform all of these functions ?

		There are , of course , isolated instances of libraries which accomplish great things .

		Two typical examples are
the Business Branch of the Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, established by
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	over ten years ago , and the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh	ORGANIZATION	, which is said by one of its former workers to be `` twenty years ahead of its public . ''

		The
Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has had the advantage of a gradual growth that other libraries , such as the one in
New York	LOCATION	, which is the largest in the country , have lacked .

		The
Newark	LOCATION	library , de - veloping with its city , has been able to make itself an integral part of civic life .

		It circulates not merely books but pictures and exhibits of all sorts , to the great bene - fit of the schools .

		These loan collections are distinct from the exhibitions continually maintained for the visiting public .

		But it is the Business Branch that is of signal importance .

		This is located in the very core of the business district .

		Within a radius of three blocks are nearly all the offices of this city of 400,000 .

		As the library meets the needs of its clientele in point of location , so it answers them in the arrangement of its interior and in the complete flexibility of its system .

		It was started on the assumption that a vital need of business is access to unbound literature of no more than immediate value .

		The twelve years of its history have meant the rich accumulation of material of this nature : directories , domestic and foreign , of localities , and of trades and professions ; reports of the
New York Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	and of transactions in local securities ; maps of all sizes and descriptions rural delivery maps , soil maps , local and general atlases books and periodicals dealing with business administration ; and techni - cal books and journals accessible to the Branch through two daily deliveries from the
Technical Department of the Main Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The large maps are arranged on labeled shade rollers ; the smaller ones 1 in a vertical file , so that they are as con - venient as cards in a catalogue .

		Pam - phlets crowd the open shelves .

		These are classified by strips of colored paper , which indicate each leaflet 's alphabetical and topi - cal place .

		At the information desk an attendant is ready to give assistance either in the Branch itself or by telephone .

		From its alluring show-window to the small room holding its free typewriter , the Branch pre - sents a serviceable attraction to the busi - ness men of this growing city .

		It repre - sents to them what the consulting engineer is to a huge plant , or a consulting physi - cian to a troubled practitioner .

		Last year the cost of the Branch was only four per cent of the total expenditure , but its value to its clientele is probably inestimable .

		Similarly , the
Carnegie Library of Pitts	ORGANIZATION	- burgh attempts to make itself an aggres - sive social force .

		It does not limit itself to any single group in the community , but spreads a network over the city in fac : tories , schools , homes , and civic centres .

		Altogether it has over two hundred agen - cies , only eight of which are conventional branch libraries .

		Cooperation between the schools and the library is probably closer in
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	than in any other city of its size .

		Not merely are the children taught 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	to use the library , but the library provides college classes , study groups , and clubs with elaborate reference material , even to the extent of printed bibliographies .

		In a community largely immigrant , hetero - geneous , and diffident , it is an educative instrumentality of the first order .

		Yet such instrumentalities are shining exceptions .

		For too long a period the library , like a sinking ship , has provided for women and children first .

		Unless ade - quate steps are taken , the library will ful - fill the analogy and go down .

		Indifference to its potentialities of service to students and business men is largely due to the lack of coordination .

		There is neither coordination between the libraries in dif - ferent cities , nor between the libraries and the public , and occasionally it is lacking within a given library itself .

		The result is general dissatisfaction , and a steady drain of its best workers into other professions , with a mortal effect upon the institution .

		Typical of the general chaos is the fact that each library has not merely its own system of administration , but an employ - ment system peculiar to itself .

		This varies from the libraries where the Director ad - ministers the finances and does the hiring and firing as well , to those which chafe under civil service .

		In some cases the apprenticeship system is in effect , which means that the librarian does the work of the job above and receives the salary of the job below .

		Frequently library school graduates are preferred for promotion to librarians in good standing who have no library school diploma .

		This confusion is intensified by the lack of standard training .


Adelaide R. Hasse	PERSON	, Chief of the Eco - nomics Division of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, declares : `` A corporation main - tained for the sole purpose of doing busi - ness directly with the public is confined in the selection of its personnel largely to schools whose curriculum is confessedly weakest in exactly those subjects most vitally required by the corporation . ''

		The average librarian is schooled to be a com - bination filing-clerk and social uplifter .

		A library can not be run without efficient filing-clerks .

		The circulation department can doubtless be run best by people who make efficient sociologists .

		Neither of these types of workers , however , is desir - able in the reference departments .

		There the need is for men as well as women -LRB- ability as a librarian has not yet been proven a sex-link characteristic -RRB- who are capable of scholarly research and sym - pathetic collaboration .

		There are a few such people in
the library today	DATE	, but they are either underpaid or undervalued , and sometimes both .

		Indeed , the salary question is a fair indication of the difficulty faced by the library today .

		The circle is a vicious one : the library can not function properly until the public opens the purse-strings ; the public will not grant money until it recog - nizes the library as a necessity .

		It is widely acknowledged that librarians are generally unable to live upon their salaries without substantial aid from outside sources .

		Library school graduates are probably as highly paid as any in the pro- fession .

		The
University of Illinois Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary School estimates that the Salary of its average woman graduate is
$ 1175	MONEY	a year , according to answers to a question - naire sent out to the graduates of
1916	DATE	.

		Pratt statistics for
1917	DATE	declare that there are more graduates earning
$ 1200	MONEY	than any other single figure , and there are as many earning only
$ 900	MONEY	as are earning
$ 1500	MONEY	.

		The average salaries paid in
1917	DATE	in the
Circulation Department	ORGANIZATION	of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	range from the salary of the Junior Assistant at
$ 581	MONEY	to that of the Branch Librarian at
$ 1283	MONEY	.

		The Director of one of the foremost libraries in the country has written : `` I shall ... have to confess that I am ashamed of the salaries paid - at this insti - tution , and as a matter of pride do not wish to call attention to the present un - satisfactory conditions of employment .

		I hope and am doing my best to improve matters as rapidly as possible . ''

		In fact the problem became so acute that last
March	DATE	saw the initiation of the
Library Employees ' Union	ORGANIZATION	, with the object of standardizing jobs and salaries and en - couraging promotion from the ranks -LRB- that is , from among librarians not necessarily graduated from the library school -RRB- .

		Many librarians conceive this affiliation with the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	as a stain upon the dignity of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 their profession .

		But when many others in the field are doing so-called `` practice '' work at the wage of a factory hand or a department-store clerk , it is difficult to view this underpaid and unstandardized job as a profession at all .

		Standardization may eventually prove to be the solution of many of the problems which both the public and the library have to face .

		In a statement made before the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	in
June , 1917	DATE	its committee declared that standard - ization is the necessary preliminary to certification , which librarians desire as the means of ranking them on an equal plane with teachers as regards service and pay .

		Libraries could be standardized with respect to income , population served , and the lines of work undertaken .

		Library service could be standardized by the intro - duction of at least a reasonable uniformity of titles , a statement of duties , regulated hours of service , salaries and pensions , promotion schedules , efficiency records , and certification .

		The arguments for certifi - cation are , first of all , the arguments for economy .

		Secondly , it would prevent the continuance of the spoils system , of which
Boston	LOCATION	has recently shown a glaring ex - ample .

		By ranking the librarian 's work with that of the doctor and the lawyer it would protect both the profession and the public .

		Moreover it would prevent an extended application of civil service to libraries , and yet permit a pension system from public funds .

		Finally , certification would imply the library 's definite relation to the other educational agencies of the state .

		The two strongest arguments against it are that it would injure library extension , and that it would not be flexible enough to meet local requirements .

		But these seem to be outweighed by the evidence in its favor .

		And in working out the details these prob - lems would get due consideration .

		Standardization means a long step toward complete governmental control of the library .

		In a democracy such a con - trol presents no terrors to those who set high value on the independent intellectual life .

		In its purpose the library is al - ready a public institution ; no one questions that it ought to come into more popu - lar use .

		And in the long run , of course , popular use will mean popular control .

		In fact a nationalized library would function not very differently from a national bank .

		It would mean a federal reserve of infor - mation , on which each locality could draw as need dictated .

		Neither the militant concern of the librarians nor the efforts of library administrators , however , can achieve this end without active popular interest .

		The public must appreciate the library as its own instrument not a liter - ary museum , but a bank where intellectual currency may be `` lent , borrowed , issued , and cared for , '' to promote social inter - course and accomplishment .


BABETTE DEUTSCH	PERSON	.

		In Dedication It is well that we have come to question these Lip-protestations , and have grown beyond The need of crying our uncertainties Down every quiet hour .

		There is a bond In these near moments of our voicelessness .

		If all were said , what would there then remain To fill a winter 's evening , or confess In subtle ways that make all meanings plain ?

		We have stood together at the little door And looked across the threshold into clear Amazing spaces where the four winds are .

		What can we ask of understanding more !

		Our silences are such as lovers hear Like music heard through portals left ajar .

		LESLIE
NELSON JENNINGS	PERSON	.

		478 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	A
Gordon Craig	PERSON	from Broadway Perhaps you expect such things of the German theatre .

		The fact remains that , outside
Germany	LOCATION	, it has not been the suc - cessful commercial managers of
Europe	LOCATION	, but theorists like Appia and
Craig	PERSON	, who have attempted to set down practical , revo - lutionary , and far reaching principles of stage production .

		But now
America	LOCATION	has at last contributed its volume of original theory , and the author turns out to be a man who like
Fuchs	PERSON	, author of `` Die Revolution des Theatres , '' is an actual worker in the actual theatre and like
Hagemann	PERSON	, author of `` Die Regie , '' an actual director and producer .

		More than that , our American theorist happens to be a successful Broadway manager .

		He is also something else .

		For his name is Ar - thur
Hopkins	PERSON	.

		His book , `` How 's Your Second Act ? ''

		-LRB-
Philip Goodman	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- , is danger - ous .

		It demolishes any theatregoer 's interest in the 99-95/100 per cent , pure rot which passes for the art of production in
America	LOCATION	.

		It also leaves a critic in peril of being absurdly ecstatic .

		Here is a little book of about seven thousand words with all the larger laws of the theatre written plain .

		Here is a complete aesthetic theory set down by a practical Broadway manager in the words of a
Claire Briggs	PERSON	`` regular fellow . ''

		This Broadway manager recognizes the import - ance of the economic organization of the theatre and the criminal power for evil in our theatrical system .

		He stands for syn - thetic , unified production everything in one key and tells us how to get it , in fact how he has got it .

		More than that , he understands modern scientific psychology well enough to recognize the application of Freudian theories of the unconscious to the theatre ; to grasp why the truth of `` thought through emotion '' is nowhere more important that in the playhouse .

		This is , roughly , the nature and content of `` How 's Your Second Act ? ''

		Here extracted from Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	's chapter on what he calls `` unconscious pro- jection '' is the essence of
America	LOCATION	's first contribution to theatrical theory : It has frequently been said of my productions , that they conveyed a certain sustained illusion that seemed not to be of the theatre ... Complete illusion has to do entirely with the unconscious mind ... The conscious mind should play no part .

		The theatre is always seeking unanimous reaction .

		It is palpably evident that unanimous reaction from conscious minds is practically impos - sible .

		Seat a dozen people in a room , present any problem which you ask them consciously to solve , and you will get nearly as many different reactions as there are people ; but place five thousand people in a room and strike some note or appeal that is associated with an unconscious idea common to all of them , and you will get a practically unanimous reaction .

		In the theatre I do not want the emotion that rises out of thought , but the thought that rises out of emotion .

		The emotional reaction must be secured first .

		The problem now arises : `` How can we in the theatre confine ourselves to the unconscious mind ? ''

		The hypnotist has supplied us with the answer : `` Still the conscious mind . ''

		The hypnotist 's first effort is to render inoperative the conscious mind of the subject .

		With that out of the way he can direct his commands to an undistracted unconscious mind and get definite reactions .

		The subject has no opportunity to think about it .

		In the theatre we can secure a similar result by giving the audience no reason to think about it , by presenting every phase so unobtrusively , so free from confusing gesture , movement , and emphasis , that all passing action seems inevitable , so that we are never challenged or consciously asked why ... This method entails sweeping readjustments .

		To begin with , author , director , scene designer , and actor must become completely the servants of the play .

		Each must resist every temptation to score personally ... It must all be inevitable , im - personal , and untrammelled .

		It requires a com .

		plete surrender of selfishness .

		In fact , it demands of everyone the honest rigidity of the true artist , who will stoop to nothing because it is effective or conspicuous or because `` it goes . ''

		It is the opposite of all that has become tradi - tional in the theatre .

		It is rather a pity Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	could n't have given up one of his productions this season `` The Rescuing Angel , ''
Billie Burke	PERSON	's vehicle , for choice and have built up his book to the regulation tome with a thorough description and analysis of the various means he has employed in his productions to obtain what he calls `` unconscious projection . ''

		It would have been much more interesting to have des - cription of the special low couches and chairs and stools which Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	and Mr.
Robert E. Jones	PERSON	have devised for use close to the footlights than to see Billie
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 479 Burke sitting on them .

		This doubtless seems a small matter , but out of such ingenuity springs a genuinely natural and yet well pointed movement of the players .

		In a
Hopkins	PERSON	production there are a score of such elements that deserve description and analysis ; the playgoer would benefit and the rival producer and the playgoer again .

		Three quarters of our progress in production has been individual experimen - tation and selection ; three sixteenths has been learned by personal contact .

		A great , great deal of this waste labor could be saved by intelligent and open discussion .

		Hopkins himself , even at this stage of his progress , could learn much by it .

		While he described and explained the system of shallow and carefully balanced settings by which he secures a certain repose essen - tial to the cultivation of the unconscious , he might come upon a realization of the fact that consciousness of this bare balance may distract a certain part of his audience unless the design has somewhere in it one unsymmetrical touch so subtly placed as to lull that small minority without disturbing the rest .

		If he went further into the acting prob - lems than such excellent statements as u The true test of a performance is the ease with which it is accomplished , '' he might note that an actor may accomplish his ef - fect with ease and sureness with the ease and sureness , for instance , of
Lionel Atwill	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	's own productions of `` The Wild Duck '' and ``
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	'' and yet accomplish an effect quite alien to the part he plays .

		There have been some striking things about Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	's spring productions of Ibsen with Mme.
Nazi	PERSON	- mova : the actress 's creation of
Hedwig	LOCATION	, the etched quality of the figures in `` The Wild Duck , '' and the strikingly exotic qual - ity of everything in ``
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	. ''

		You must admit these things while you criticize the basically wrong conceptions of Hial - mar and
Gregers	PERSON	in `` The Wild Duck '' and of
Tesman	PERSON	in `` Hedda . ''

		And while you abuse Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	for allowing any exigency on earth to make him exhibit the horrible old-fashioned , weak , moulding - painted setting which struck the wrong note at the ` very start of `` The Wild Duck , '' and while you point out that a genuine , middle-class , small-town `` Hedda '' for once might be really illuminating , you must recognize the beautiful , unreal , and grotesquely entertaining flavor of this `` Hedda , '' keyed to
Nazimova	PERSON	's peculiar conception of the leading part .

		You must recognize the thrill which
Hopkins	PERSON	and
Jones	PERSON	threw into the expected and dis - counted suicide by having
Hedda	PERSON	, after she had closed the curtains behind her , sud - denly reappear framed against the grave - black inner side of those hangings , visible for the first time as she held them back .

		But you must recognize just as surely the sin of
Hopkins	PERSON	in letting an actor like
Lionel Atwill	PERSON	, skilled technically as he is , play his parts each night more and more for the laughter and applause that were in them .

		Atwill 's performance , described by
Hopkins	PERSON	himself , would make an excel - lent addition to the producer 's statement : `` It is quite essential for the reaction that I seek that we never do anything for the benefit of the audience . ''

		If
Hopkins	PERSON	wrote such a technical text - book , he could put in a score more of im - portant things important to himself as much as to the next producer .

		He might describe his mellow , sculpturesque over - head lighting and yet reflect on the dis - turbing fact that , beautiful as it is , it strikes you as beautifully unnatural unless some grand parlor or hotel or bar supplies an excuse for `` indirect '' chandeliers high above as a supposititious source of the light .

		With the little table lamp of `` The Wild Duck '' and white reflecting walls , this lighting played havoc with the illusion of the various times of day and weather called for in the play .

		But such a book would include too descriptions of unapproachable settings like those schemed out by
Hopkins	PERSON	and
Jones	PERSON	for `` The Devil 's Garden , '' and the hotel corridor of `` Good Gracious Anna - belle . ''

		It would picture a great many perfect ensembles from the days of the now forgotten ``
Steve	PERSON	, '' in which
Arnold Daly	PERSON	appeared , to the quite as much for - gotten `` Deluge '' of
last fall	DATE	.

		It would form a record of work unique in our com - mercial theatre .

		But , in the last analysis , it could only point and illumine the unique and thoughtful essence of
Hopkins	PERSON	's little
KENNETH MACGOWAN	PERSON	.

		480 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	Our
London	LOCATION	Letter I do wish that literary persons including professors , critics , publishers , and similar rabble could be induced to admit that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is a poet and to live up to their admission .

		When I want to read Flecker or Brooke or
Housman	PERSON	or even
Swinburne	PERSON	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	, I can read them in pleasantly bound and printed volumes of a convenient size with nothing to take my attention away from the poetry .

		But if I want to read Shakespeare , I may get any sort of an edition .

		Some are for the waistcoat pocket and look like diaries of engagements .

		Others are decorated with portraits of famous actors , depicted in flagrante delicto that is , in the very act of cutting and recasting the plays to their own taste .

		I knew one edition that solemnly showed all the cuts and alterations made by Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, and there are some that reproduce all the misprints of the folios and take an especial pride in adding the misprints of the quartos wherever it is possible .

		These are by way of being eccentricities , I own ; the most common form of decoration is notes critical , biographi - cal , historical , moral , psychological , and merely childish .

		I however like my
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	neat .

		I want an edition with a sensible text , produced by an editor who is not in a fever to tell me why he has adopted the emendation '' ' a babbled of green fields '' and who can refrain from telling me that `` since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake '' means that they change for the worse .

		This tirade is drawn from me by the latest and , I think , the last volume of the
Arden Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, which contains the sonnets and `` A Lover 's Complaint . ''

		But I mean no disrespect to the
Arden Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Why complain of a potato because it is not a lily ?

		And the
Arden Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is an admirably complete and scholarly edition , very useful and filling a felt want .

		But I shall never read Shakespeare in it .

		I doubt whether anyone could who took anything more than a scholar 's interest in him .

		I open the book at random and on page 48 I discover lines 3-14 of Sonnet XLIV and lines 1-4 of Sonnet XLV .

		I also find three textual notes and 30 lines of elucidative and philogical notes , in small type and double columns .

		You can not enjoy the sonnets when your eye is constantly besought to leave the verse in order to learn that the word `` liberty '' in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has a meaning which varies `` from the privilege of dispensing with conventions to license in the worst sense . ''

		But having emitted that last com - plaint , I have done .

		There is much to be said for the
Arden Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and I wish I had the whole of it .

		And Mr.
C. Knox Pooler	PERSON	has performed a really remarkable feat in producing an edition of the sonnets with an introduction that is neither dull nor silly .

		He knows as well as any that all over the world there is a horde of cranks and anti-cranks prepared to leap out on any editor of the sonnets whose foot slips for a moment .

		So he details one after another all the different theories in a cool , dry way which hardly indicates whether he believes in any one of them more than in another .

		His account of the
Mary Fitton	PERSON	theory is very good ; and there is an interesting citation of Lady
Newdigate	PERSON	, who declares that
Mary	PERSON	's reputation as a dark beauty is derived solely from the griminess of her effigy in the family monument at
Cawsbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		He concludes with the admirable decision that `` hitherto , no theory or discovery has increased our enjoyment of any line in the sonnets or cleared up any difficulty . ''

		But there is one theory that he has not quoted .

		I refer to the theory which was enunciated by Mr.
T. W. H. Crosland	PERSON	in his recent book `` The English Sonnet '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		In his prefatory note Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	announced with pomp that `` the theory as to the true origin of the sonnets of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is ... new . ''

		One wondered helplessly in reading it who in the world Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	was now .

		But the ex - planation , when one reached it , was the simple , sensible , but nevertheless unexpected story that follows : It is safe to say that when
Shakespeare	PERSON	set out on his sonnet-writing , he was absolutely care-free so far as his affections were concerned , and the first twenty-six sonnets have no more to do with heart - unlocking in the sense insisted upon by the biogra - phists than they have to do with the binomial theorem .

		We shall go further and submit that until he wrote Sonnet 144 that is to say , until he came virtually to the end of his sonnet performance he had no clear conception of any plot or story which the sonnets should unfold , and that Sonnet 144 was written out of an endeavour to give some showing of a relation to the hundred and forty-three pieces which precede it , and help the reader to imagine that he had been perusing a set tale .

		In other words , `` the story of the sonnets , '' such as it is , was evolved fortuitously out of the writing and sequence of the pieces , and the sonnets were not written out of a story , personal or impersonal .

		Besides this , Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	drops the nonchalant remark that `` Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	... was a fig -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 481 ment , set up to provoke talk . ''

		Now I am not sure that I can accept even this theory whole - heartedly ; but I do maintain that it may very well increase our enjoyment of the sonnets and clear away a great many difficulties .

		It seems to me unlikely , for instance , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets to the young man who was unwilling to marry have anything like their surface signifi - cance .

		The young man can not have been any - thing more than a peg on which , by way of a convention of passionate friendship ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	hung his otherwise unrelated poetical inspirations .

		But I find it equally impossible to believe that the sonnets written to the unfaithful lady have not a much closer relation to actual events .

		This does not mean that the sonnets to the friend are insincere and those to the mistress sincere ; but they are certainly on different planes of sin - cerity .

		And if this disparity of tone be once admitted , there is an end at once , I think , of the notion that the whole sequence is a connected confession or the account of any definite episode in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		It seems to me much more probable that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote sonnets because he wanted to write sonnets and that he now used actual incidents , now built on a convention , just as he felt inclined and , finally , that he collected all together simply because they were all sonnets .

		The poetical imagination is a very strange thing .

		Sonnet CXLIV is a definite and a delib - erate attempt to unite the young man -LRB- `` the better angel '' -RRB- and the mistress -LRB- `` the worser spirit '' -RRB- in a common relation to the life of the poet .

		But Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	's suggestion that this is designed to give a narrative interest to the whole sequence is a little crude .

		Shake - speare may have imagined for purposes of poetry an intrigue , which he knew did not exist , between mistress and friend .

		He may even have imagined the situation arising , though the mistress and friend had never met , merely out of the contrast between his own presentation of the friend and that of the mistress .

		I do not know , and I am not trying to solve the insoluble .

		I am merely trying to demonstrate how hard the solution is .

		Poetic inspiration springs from deep and mys - terious sources , and it is impossible to predicate a negative concerning it .

		But one thing does leap to the eye from an impartial rereading of the sonnets and that is , how absurd it is to judge Shakespeare as an Elizabethan .

		The fact that other poets of the era wrote sonnet sequences is even more irrel - evant than the fact that other poets wrote plays in blank verse .

		There is no Elizabethan sequence which approaches this not even `` Astrophel and Stella '' for vigor , variety , mastery of words , and sheer magic of personality .

		The things in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	transcends all poets are so much more important than those which he has in common with the Elizabethans that his epoch seems perfectly unimportant .

		I do not put this forward as a new idea or even an idea which was worth restating for its intrinsic merits .

		I mention it as a matter of interest simply because it sprang up in my mind quite spontaneously while I was reading the sonnets again , and be - cause for a moment its unassailable truth seemed to me to make it shine with novelty .

		482 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	La Tear de la Vie REFLECTIONS ON WAR AND DEATH .

		By
Sigmund Freud	PERSON	.

		Authorized translation by
A. A. Brill	PERSON	and
Alfred B. Kuttner	PERSON	.

		Moffat ,
Yard	LOCATION	; 75 cts .

		It is curious what different types of mind and what different methods of intellectual approach have produced an almost identical diagnosis of the anemia of modern industrial civilization .

		Long before the present world war
William James	PERSON	, in his now prophetic essay `` A Moral Equivalent for War , '' expressed the criticism of the alert and discerning mind at the thinness and barrenness of a universe constructed from merely well-intentioned humanitarian ideals .

		To a man of such vigor and real daring a world of placid utopianism was intolerable .

		James 's whole essay was a straightforward attempt to assess the high value of danger and risk in any endurable soci - ety .

		Yet so utterly unlike a temperament as that represented by
George Santayana	PERSON	made a similar complaint in `` Winds of Doctrine , '' say - ing with great bitterness that nothing was meaner and more contemptible than the desire to live on , somehow , at any price a desire which seemed to be the chief characteristic , and to fur - ther which was the main intellectual preoccu - pation , of the age .

		Even in so unphilosophical and essentially journalistic and contemporary a writer as
H. G. Wells	PERSON	there often recurred this same bitterness at the lack of color and move - ment in modern life , where , as he once expressed it , a man could live through his entire three score years and ten fudging and evading and never being really hungry , never being really thirsty or angry or in danger , or facing a really great emotion , until the agony of the deathbed .

		Civilization had not merely refused to calculate on death , but had come almost to the point of refusing to believe in it .

		The keener minds rebelled against that hypocrisy .

		Then came the war , and with it that most disconcerting phenomenon which
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	has described as `` the peacefulness of being at war '' the sense , at last , that there was really danger and high adventure and the possibility of deal - ing and receiving death once more .

		Of course the conventional reformist type of mind was shocked and horrified at this emergence of death as a reality .

		Up to what we might call the satu - ration point of sensitiveness these minds dwelt with almost unctuous detail upon blood , pus , agony , and human hopes shattered to bits by unfeeling fire and shrapnel .

		These were the people who during the first year of the war never tired of telling us that civilization had tumbled into ruins .

		But as they had never really faced death before the war came , so they never really faced it afterward .

		Their shrinking from war 's horrors was not sincere ; they protested too much .

		Unlike the average soldier , dragged from an industrial life of doubtful happiness , thwarted in his aspirations for creative activity , crushed in his few timid strivings for genuine emotions , bound by routine , they did not accept the war as a kind of release from the diligent muffling against the realities of life and death which we call modern civilization .

		In all men in whose veins blood has not wholly turned to water there is left a strong instinct of what the French call `` nostalgic de la boue , '' and while they do not pretend to like lice and mud and sudden pain and hunger and cold and an iron discipline that reduces their own individuality to zero , it would be idle to deny that they find in all these things a kind of deep gratification -LRB- a gratification which the conventional pacifist mind can not even imaginatively appreciate -RRB- that life is not the smooth , round , tasteless monotony which the industrial revolution had almost succeeded in making it .

		Naturally soldiers do not intellectualize about war in the ingenious fashion of Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	, and for them its glamor has little connection with the trappings and parade and music of militar - istic romance .

		What is undeniable , however , is that war , in so far as it is war and not a cor - poration-like mechanism , does satisfy a funda - mental and thwarted human need .

		This is either ignored or denied by the conventional humani - tarian mind , which suddenly in
August 1914	DATE	dis - covered that war was horrible and men were the sons of women .

		And as a consequence this type of reformist intellectual approach by far the most common after its first shattering of amiable illusions developed a curious technique of evasion , which is precisely as much a denial of the reality of death in actual war time as it was formerly in the piping days of peace .

		De - tails are not here necessary , for we all recognize those for whom today the emphasis is all upon the happy by-products of the present agony , the new world , integration , and so on .

		Indeed , instead of being shocked by war out of their ear - lier paltry utopianism to face and to calculate upon the reality of death in life , the last four years seem merely to have made them take ref - uge in even more grandiose utopianisms .

		Too
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 483 many of the schemes for a reconstructed world after the war are merely self-protective prisons in which the well-wishers defend themselves from the assaults of the awful reality beating at their doors .

		But the competent and realistic mind is not afraid either to face the possibility of death or to describe modern war in any other terms than those of permanent human values .

		It does not shrink from a world of danger and struggle , yet neither does it gloss over or prettify the tragic fruits of the modern battlefield .


Bertrand Russell	PERSON	is a signal example of the humanist and realist who strikes this compromise between a recogni - tion of the necessity for danger and color and creation and movement in a decent civilization , and a recognition of the futility and waste of modern war .

		He realizes , as
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	in his passionate little book `` Freedom '' also real - izes , that modern wars are the atonement we make for our lack of appreciating the human evils of a pallid , `` safe '' industrialism .

		On the other side of the enemy frontier , Professor Sig - mund Freud voices much the same idea in this short essay , `` Reflections on War and Death , '' for the translation of which we have to thank the diligence and scientific interest of Dr.
A. A. Brill	PERSON	and Mr.
A. B. Kuttner	PERSON	.

		It is true that Dr.
Freud	PERSON	's final plea has not entirely the hope - ful and prophetic quality of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	's vision .

		Evidently the essay was written early in the war , for it is spotty and uncoordinated and slight .

		Freud has not attempted to deal with the second and less cynical part of the dilemma of modern war as definitely and optimistically as
Russell	PERSON	.

		But he has stated afresh with great vigor , and with the powerful reinforcement of his well known technique of psychological analy - sis , the barrenness of modern civilization a bar - renness which arose from its refusal to calculate upon death .

		`` Life becomes impoverished and loses its inter - est when life itself , the highest stake in the game of living , must not be risked . ''

		In ordinary , everyday existence we can get only the thin grati - fication of our ever-dying , ever-resurrected heroes of literature and the stage .

		All our risks and our challenges of fate are vicarious .

		Thus we are inconsolable when death actually happens , and we act `` as if we belonged to the tribe of the
Asra	ORGANIZATION	, who also die when those whdm they love perish . ''

		As Freud points out , war compels us to change all that to recognize the reality of death , just as the death of the beloved of primi - tive man -LRB- who , like our own unconscious today , did not believe in death -RRB- forced him to recog - nize its reality .

		For war restores what civiliza - tion can hide , heroism which springs from our deep inability to believe in our own death , pleas - ure in the killing of the hated one in the enemy -LRB- the hatred which is the component of all love -RRB- , and power to rise above `` the shock of the death of friends . ''

		Freud asks us if we have not , in our civilized attitude towards death , lived psy - chologically beyond our means .

		His own answer of course is in the affirmative , and the affirma - tive is probably correct .

		He is certainly right in urging us to shake off our hypocrisy about death and to calculate upon its realities .

		But it is a plea which is relevant for peace as for war .

		Whatever civilization emerges from the present clash of arms , it can have no stability and no crea - tive joy unless our former timidities are exor - cised .

		Life loses its major virility when we strive at all costs to maintain it .

		That is the justifi - cation for
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's plea , and it is sufficient .

		A
Novelist Turned Trophet MID-AMERICAN CHAKTS	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Sherwood Anderson	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Unsympathetic as it may sound , `` Mid-Ameri - can Chants '' is an important-looking volume rather than an important book .

		It burns with sincerity ; it is charged with a fervent passion ; it echoes great hopes and a high purpose .

		But these very qualities are so apparent that they seem a trifle forced ; the voice of the prophet sounds a bit self-conscious and his mantle bags about the knees .

		Even his `` Foreword '' has a pat and almost patronizing tone : I do not believe that my people of midwestern
America	LOCATION	, immersed as we are in affairs , hurried and harried through life by the terrible engine industrialism have come to the time of song ... For this book of chants I ask simply that it be allowed to stand stark against the background of my own place and generation .

		In secret a million men and women are trying ^ as I have tried here , to express the hunger within and I have dared to put these chants forth only because I hope and believe they may find an answering and clearer call in the hearts of other Mid-Americans .

		I do not want to suggest that these sentences show Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	as anything but modest and genuinely moved and yet they strike me as some - what dubious .

		What , for instance , does Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	mean by implying that because mid - 484 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	western
America	LOCATION	is `` hurried and harried '' by industrialism it can not sing .

		Has he forgotten
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	,
Harry Kemp	PERSON	,
Edgar Lee Mas	PERSON	- ters ,
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	?

		Or has he a more special definition of what constitutes song ?

		Or is he , perhaps , laboring under the old fallacy that a harassed and over-worked race is necessarily an inexpressive and silent one .

		Let him consider the Greeks , nine tenths of whom were actually slaves ; the Elizabethans , `` harried and hurried through life '' by a thousand tyrannies and oppressions ; our own negroes , possibly the most spontaneous ` of melody makers , broken of everything but their desire to sing .

		If the absence of machinery and of the wage system would bring about a literary efflorescence , the aesthetic world would be led by the
Esquimaux	PERSON	, the Javanese , and the
Senegam	PERSON	- bians .

		Song , as a matter of scientific fact , has sprung not only out of a leisurely contemplation of art but from a sharp necessity .

		It has risen out of dirt and despair in jubilations as well as protests .

		It is both a relief and a release from the conditions that go to create it .

		The conditions rather than the song are sug - gested in Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's small but ambitious volume .

		It would be pleasant to record that they are suggested with the same power and original utterance that were so striking in `` Marching Men , '' `` Windy
McPherson	PERSON	's Son , '' and the short stories that caused such enthusiastic com - ment upon their appearance in `` The Seven Arts . ''

		But even a casual reading of these loosely written chants reveals how frequently the author has forced his note and how much his utterance is indebted to
Whitman	PERSON	and the idiom of Sand - burg .

		Here is an illustration : SONG TO THE SAP In my breast the sap of
spring	DATE	, In my brain grey winter , bleak and hard , Through my whole being , surging strong and sure , The call of gods , The forward push of mystery and of life .

		Men , sweaty men , who walk on frozen roads , Or stand and listen by the factory door , Look up , men !

		Stand hard !

		On winds the gods sweep down .

		In denser shadows by the factory walls , In my old cornfields , broken where the cattle roam , The shadow of the face of God falls down .

		From all of
Mid-America	ORGANIZATION	a prayer , To newer , braver gods , to dawns and days , To truth and cleaner , braver life we come .

		Lift up a song , My sweaty men , Lift up a song .

		And here is the first half of one of the finest of the rhapsodies : I am pregnant with song .

		My body aches but do not betray me .

		I will sing songs and hide them away .

		I will tear them into bits and throw them in the street .

		The streets of my city are full of dark holes .

		I will hide my songs in the holes of the streets .

		In the darkness of the night I awoke and the bands that bind me were broken .

		I was determined to bring old things into the land of the new .

		A sacred vessel I found and ran with it into the fields , into the long fields where the corn rustles .

		All of the people of my time were bound with chains .

		They had forgotten the long fields and the stand - ing corn .

		They had forgotten the west winds .

		Into the cities my people had gathered .

		They had be - come dizzy with words .

		Words had choked them .

		They could not breathe .

		The defects of Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's prose poems are of the same character as the faults in his novels .

		In `` Windy
McPherson	PERSON	's Son , '' for instance , one could almost see the dividing line where the story broke off abruptly and shifted from intensified fact to mere colored fiction .

		Here the transition is less abrupt ; but the pages , for the greater part , are closely related to the latter and lesser half of Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's remarkable books .

		They lose themselves in flights of orac - ular vagueness ; in their determined effort to be prophetic they show nothing so much as an inchoate wish , a desire to adjust to the rapidly shifting world of labor a desire that is scarcely accomplished .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	himself may be able to face realities , but his poetry is not nearly so courageous .

		It is far more evasive than most of his prose ; it goes round about , rather than through , the fact .

		It expresses itself mainly through the sort of circumlocutory symbolism that we have learned to belittle when we find it embodied in the more regular forms .

		THE PLANTING 'T is then I am the tiny thing , A little bug , a figure wondrous small , a sower on prairies limitless .

		Into her arms I creep and wait and dream that I may serve , And do the work of gods in that vast place .

		Awake asleep remade to serve , I stretch my arms and lie intense expectant 'til her moment comes .

		Then seeds leap forth .

		The mighty hills rise up and gods and tiny things like me proclaim their joy .

		Man in the making seeds in the ground , O'er all my western country now a wind .

		Rich , milky smell of cornfields , dancing nymphs , And tiny men that turn away to dream .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 485 Still , Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	aims so much higher than most of his contemporaries that we should be attentive if not grateful to him .

		Even if `` Mid - American Chants '' is composed of the stuff of poetry rather than poetry itself , we can not with - hold our admiration from one whose utterance is so vibrant .

		From such passion , from such rude earnestness may rise the clearer voice that is im - plicit in Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's prophetic promise .

BENEDETTO CROCE	PERSON	: The Problem of Art and History .

H. Wildon Carr	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.


Benedetto Croce	PERSON	has been unfortunate in the manner of his introduction to the English speak - ing people .

		His books have been translated into a jargon that is not only a caricature of his own lucid and penetrating style , but that at times hardly deserves to be called English at all .

		His translators have limited themselves to his formal treatises to the great works on '' / Esthetic , '' `` Logic , '' `` Economics and Ethics , '' or to the monographs on Vico ,
Hegel	LOCATION	,
Marx	PERSON	wholly neg - lecting the rich storehouse of his critical essays and his informal studies of ideas and men .

		For through the columns of his journal , `` La Critica , '' and through his collected and uncollected essays ,
Croce	PERSON	has carried on a ceaseless warfare against the dual enemies of his philosophy , the older metaphysics and the newer positivism , and against the dual enemies of his theory of art and lit - erature , the older traditionalism and the newer sociology masquerading in the guise of literary history .

		With such weapons he has not only transformed Italian thought , but has breathed the breath of life into Italian criticism .

		Few Ameri - cans realize this resistless and inspiriting swords - manship of one of the greatest protagonists of modern thought .

		Nor will this book help them to realize it .

		It is a serious and dignified summary of
Croce	PERSON	's philosophy , with special emphasis on one , and that the most fruitful , of its many phases his theory of art and history .

		To say less would be ungenerous in the case of a book which is , after all , the first of its kind in English .

		But its sober method and rather stodgy style are barriers behind which brood
Croce	PERSON	's seminal power , and no new conquests will be made by it for what is new and fertilizing in
Croce	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		No reader will suspect that he is face to face with a thinker who has given the world a vitally new concept of art , who has rejuvenated literary criticism by giving it a new purpose and meaning , who has transformed logic from a formal and lifeless thing into a function of thought itself , who has given a new interpretation to the old idea of truth and error , and a new meaning to the part played by economic activity in human life , and who , as his latest and greatest achieve - ment , has altered man 's outlook on the past and the present by unfolding the eternal contem - poraneity of history .

		`` Monks and professors can not write the lives of poets , '' said an Italian critic ; and it would seem as if the President of the Aristotelian Society of
London	LOCATION	is hardly the ideal interpreter for this freest of human minds the mind of a man who has held aloof from all official position , in order that he might express himself on all occasions as seemed to him best .

		I remember , some sixteen years ago when
Croce	PERSON	sent me the first edition of the '' / Esthetic '' -LRB- there are now many editions , and translations into many languages -RRB- , how little I suspected the real significance of the gift .

		I had known his his - torical work for some time , but knew nothing of his speculative interest and power .

		So it was to the historical portion of the book that I turned , and it was to this portion that I devoted the whole of my review in the `` Nation , '' the first review of the book outside of
Italy	LOCATION	, so far as I know .

		I shudder to think of the few perfunctory words with which I summed up the theoretical portion , which I had skimmed through hastily and assumed to be merely another machine-made `` theory of art . ''

		Professor
Santayana	PERSON	, to whom I sent the book for review in the `` Journal of Comparative Literature , '' which I was then editing , reversed the process , but gave an unsympathetic and -LRB- may I add ? -RRB-

		equally blind report of its contents .

		If it took me a year or more to realize the signifi - cance of a friend 's work and to become its champion a book which I had at hand and was corfstantly consulting how can I wonder that its message should not strike home to those for whom , because of its language , it was closed with more than seven seals ?

		The English trans - lation a few years later brought it many friends , among temperaments as different as Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	and the author of ``
Peter Dooley	PERSON	, '' but still its significance is unapprehended by the Eng - lish speaking world , where
Croce	PERSON	has been obliged 486 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	to play second fiddle to the striking but relatively inferior thought of
Bergson	PERSON	.

		Perhaps this is not wholly to be wondered at , for the '' ^ Esthetic , '' though the most striking , is the first and least mature of
Croce	PERSON	's great philosophical treatises .

		It loses half of its meaning without such commen - tary and interpretation as may be found in his later and maturer books , such as the `` Logic , '' which is accessible in an English translation , and the `` Problems of Esthetics , '' the `` Critical Con - versations , '' and the `` Theory of History , '' which are not .

		So the work and personality of
Benedetto Croce	PERSON	still await an English interpreter .

		No little guidance may be found in this new book , and still more in Italian , though there the , slight and inadequate volume of Prezzolini remains the only book covering the whole subject of
Croce	PERSON	's life and thought .

		But the literature regarding him has become enormous : articles by the hundred in every European tongue indicate the interest which he has aroused among philosophers and men of letters .

		Yet what shall we think of this ocean of print , which we may search in vain for a single volume of creative interpreta - tion a single book of which we may say : `` If you wish to know what
Croce	PERSON	means for the modern world , and what is the source of his intellectual power , read this '' ?

		Our Enemy Speaks MEN IN WAR .

		By
Andreas Latzko	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Adele Seltzer	ORGANIZATION	.


Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The longer the war goes on , the more acute becomes the spiritual dilemma which it evokes .

		For if it be regarded as a war to end war , must not every mind carry into the coming peace the lesson that this horror can never be allowed to break loose again ?

		Anything , then , which miti - gated the ghastly reality of war would by so much relax our vigilance against its recurrence .

		But on the other hand , events require that we gird our loins and pursue the war to the end without faltering ; in order to keep the national mind taut for the unfaltering prosecution of the war military operations ought to seem not only palatable but even exhilarating .

		Hence the uni - versal preoccupation with `` morale . ''

		Faith and delight in war as an effective means for pursuing national ends must be maintained in order that war may be slain forever as the vilest human scourge and pestilence .

		This is why the liberal mind has everywhere taken delight in a book like `` Under Fire , '' which artistically resolves the dilemma .

		The conventional mind will still pre - fer `` The Glory of the Trenches '' to the real - ism of Barbusse , even though French soldiers testify that `` Le Feu '' has not inhibited them from their dread task .

		But to those who have had to reconcile their hatred of war with their determination to engage in it ,
Barbusse	PERSON	has been a salvation .

		For the ideal attitude is realistically to appreciate the horrors , and yet continue to believe that the grim work has got to be done .

		Unfortunately , just as this most artistic and valuable reconciliation of the paradox has been made , we are presented with a book which makes Barbusse look like a Christian Scientist .

		Here is an artistic mind which has collapsed under the actual business of war , and painstakingly tells us why .

		The six stories of this volume reveal , in a tone of concentrated fury , a mind for which modern war is unendurable and unmitigated .

		No ray of extenuation and relief steals into these terrible exposures .

		There is none of that soft hope , as in `` Under Fire , '' of the return to a better world .

		`` Men in War '' return , for instance in the story `` Home Again , '' only to kill .

		Mutilated men , men in agony , the horror of bloodstained insanity this , to the Austrian officer
Andreas Latzko	PERSON	, is the sum of war .

		Behind the scenes , as in the story of `` The Victor , '' the gen - eral whom war has picked from obscurity and deluged with power and riches , lie those manip - ulators whose greed of life has been fed by the war , and to whom the greatest affront is the word `` peace . ''

		Nowhere does
Latzko	PERSON	see a shred of rationality or justification to this busi - ness in which the world has engaged itself .

		The heart of the book is the story `` Baptism of Fire , '' which follows in torturing detail the thoughts and feelings of an Austrian captain as he leads his men under fire against the Italians .

		Advancing to the attack , his body is saturated with sympathy for his men as victims ; his con - sciousness retains all its memories of the peaceful background of their lives ; he sees them as harm - less humans in whose murder he is assisting .

		Even the dead enemy arouses in him a `` tangled web of memories . ''

		`` Two trips on a vacation in
Italy	LOCATION	drove an army of sorrowing figures through his mind . ''

		Hp can do nothing , in his agonized impotence , but turn over the command to a young lieutenant who has thirsted for this advance on the enemy and who robustly handles his men as
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 487 military material .

		And as they are mortally wounded together the captain 's last thought is of exultation that this creature of war is him - self at last suffering .

		It is of course easy to dismiss such a book as the product of a constitutional psychopathic con - dition , or at least of shattered nerves .


Marsch	PERSON	- ner is certainly no typical officer .

		Most officers are neither neurotic nor of the type which learns to think of its men as replaceable wastage , of the enemy as a mechanical target or as a swarm of noxious rodents , of wounds and agony as so much routine for the doctors and nurses .

		Yet is it nec - essarily neurotic to retain this full consciousness of soldiers as suffering , sensing human lives side by side with the activity of sending them into battle ?

		The ordinary man is able to suspend , when he thinks or acts in combat , all his usual concepts , memories , and desires for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .

		Otherwise war would be impossible .

		What makes this book so unprecedentedly grisly is that the author insists on seeing the war not in terms of itself , but in terms of ordinary kindly human life .

		The stories of `` Men in War '' are composed with sufficient skill to give one the disquieting thought that they may not be the work of a con - stitutional psychopath , but of the artistic temper - ament .

		If so , then we have to conclude that modern war , seen through the artistic tempera - ment of a Hungarian like Latzko , loses all con - tact with human sanity .

		If there were many more Austrian officers like this one , Austrian morale would collapse .

		Is it possible that part of the demoralization reported there is due to temperamental reactions such as are pictured in this book ?

		Then the lesson for the nation which wishes to keep up militaristic morale is not to let the artistic temperament get anywhere near the trenches .

		A man who reports the expe - rience of war as lying without the pale of human sanity is infinitely more dangerous than any con - scientious objector .

		It is not for the sake of the artist 's sensitiveness that he should be exempted from all war service ; it is for the sake of military morale .

		If this book means anything , it means that militarism should weed out its Marschners and coerce them back to the ivory towers of their art , to the egoism of their own spiritual and moral integrity .

		For if this is the way the artist sees war , his apathy is something the shrewd mil - itarist will fairly beg for .

		The `` Sage and Serious '' `` Poet EDMUND SPENSER : A CRITICAL STUDY .

		By
Herbert Ellsworth Cory	PERSON	.


University of California Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lications in
Modern Philology	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		For the past ten years and more scholars have been unusually occupied with the study of Spenser .

		In
America	LOCATION	,
Long	LOCATION	,
Greenlaw	PERSON	, and
Padelford	LOCATION	, to mention only the most active , have examined various aspects of his poetry ; in
England	LOCATION	, scholars like Miss
Winstanley	PERSON	have shared in the work .

		There was need of an attempt to reinterpret Spen - ser in the light of their investigations .

		And for this attempt Professor
Cory	PERSON	is in many ways especially well qualified .

		He is not a newcomer in the field , and his previous studies have revealed a tendency to view
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's achievement in its larger rather than its special aspects .

		Moreover , one peril of the present undertaking was eclecticism , and from this he is saved by the possession of a theory of his own , a conception of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's development from the `` Shepherd 's Calendar '' to the cantos on `` Mutability '' which completely dominates his use of particular contributions .

		As a result , though we are kept in touch with what other scholars have done , we are never diverted from the main purpose of his study , the presentation of the poet in a new light .

		We should not be diverted , that is , if Pro- fessor
Cory	PERSON	kept to his Spenser .

		But he does not .

		He also has a theory of criticism , in which he is almost as much interested as he is in his avowed subject , and which is constantly intruding into his study of Spenser .

		The preface hints at the reason .

		`` Already the academic student of literatures ancient or modern , '' he writes , `` is the object of the gentle contempt of his more robust col - leagues . ''

		He is not content , like most of us who teach literature , to acknowledge the fact privately , turn it to such mental profit as he can , and go on with his business as if the joke were too old to be worth bothering about which it is .

		Perhaps his more robust colleagues at
Berkeley	LOCATION	are more robust and sarcastic than the average .

		If so , they will henceforward have to hurl their sarcasms at others than him , for he has collected a critical armory from all the modern movements and sciences the labor movement , feminism , im - perialism , ethnology , heredity , psychopathology , the empirical study of ethical values , and so on .

		He does not overtly use all that he retails in the preface , but he uses enough to remind one at times of
David	PERSON	in the armor of
Saul	PERSON	and to set one thinking that a literary critic had best keep 488 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	to his sling , as
David	PERSON	eventually did .

		If one can not endure the taunts of Goliath of
Gath	PERSON	, the proper retort is still a smooth stone from the brook .

		All this display of method seems par - ticularly inappropriate to the interpretation of Spenser , whose own respect for learning appeared so unobtrusively .

		This too modern method , moreover , sometimes leads to an over-emphatic style .

		To say of the lines which conclude Book VI of the `` Faery Queen '' that they `` hiss with the dry sneer of despair '' is surely to lay on style with a trowel .

		Critics may disagree about the moods of Spenser , yet even Professor
Cory	PERSON	would probably admit that the phrase was excessive .

		Let us hope that on reflection he would also renounce the adjective `` purblind , '' which he bestows rather too easily on those who disagree with his estimate of the `` supreme poet . ''

		However , the value of this study is not depend - ent upon method or style .

		What the reader brings away from it is a new conception of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, a conception which , even when it is not wholly plausible , is always provocative .

		For what we have here is no `` discovery , '' to be accepted or rejected on specific evidence and filed as a fact or a mare 's nest , but an interpretation , suggestive of many possibilities .

		That is the advantage of trying to see a poet as a whole , with one 's own eyes : one may exaggerate the signifi - cance of this or that trait , but one 's portrait of him is likely to help others to see him more clearly .

		Professor
Cory	PERSON	's point of view is avowedly that of
Dowden	PERSON	's essay on `` Spenser , the Poet and Teacher . ''

		He holds , as
Dowden	PERSON	did , that to see nothing in Spenser except the poetry of romantic delightsomeness is to misunderstand him fatally .

		He believes that
Spenser	PERSON	is essentially what
Milton	PERSON	called him , in the much hackneyed phrase , `` sage and serious . ''

		From one opinion or the other all fundamental criticism of the poet must start , and Professor
Cory	PERSON	takes his stand by
Milton	PERSON	.

		Of course there is danger in stating the issue too simply .

		The question is not merely whether the poet of the `` Faery Queen '' was in earnest about his teaching .

		Some have maintained that his teaching was a pure convention imposed upon him by the standards of his day , which demanded that an epic should be edifying , although the majority of commentators have agreed that
Spenser	PERSON	's declaration of purpose was sincere .

		Yet most of the latter would still main - tain that what has made his poetry last is not moral flavor but sheer romantic charm , the delightsomeness which has always won him fol - lowers , generation after generation .

		And that view merits something more than mere denuncia - tion .

		To insist that
Spenser	PERSON	, like
Dante	PERSON	, is a `` supreme poet '' is only to make the disagreement harder to compose ; for about a supreme poet , at this
late day	DATE	, there is not likely to be much chance for misunderstanding .

		No ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	will not be accepted for a supreme poet , nor his moral value considered the equivalent of the really great moralist 's .

		Perhaps the question resolves itself into one of taste , and is therefore not to be argued .

		If so , the hedonists might be met with their own weapons ; for surely , to fail to perceive that
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's greatest work has a tone of moral dignity and sweetness which is quite as delightful to those who care for these qualities as its merely sensuous charm , is to convict oneself of defective sensibilities .

		Proceeding from this fundamental conception of Spenser that he is a man of sincere moral earnestness Professor
Cory	PERSON	endeavors to trace the line of his natural development .

		We have had studies in
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's art and in his philosophic idealism , his religion ; yet heretofore nobody has conceived of following his moral and emotional experiences down the line of his successive poems .

		I have not space for a full survey of all the results , and a summary is never quite fair ; but fair or not , the gist of it may , I think , be given in a sentence : the poet 's career proceeds from an ardent youthful hope of being the prophet of his country 's true greatness , through disillusion and bitterness as he sees his counsels ignored , to a final mood of reconciliation with the world , which is not the ignoble peace of philosophic retirement but a casting forward into eternity .

		The crucial point of this is the conception of Spenser as a prophet .

		Every reader of his poetry has noted the occasional moods of dejection or discontent , and these have commonly been laid to the disappoint - ments of his material career .

		Professor
Cory	PERSON	sees otherwise .

		According to him , these disap - pointments , though real enough , were only sec - ondary ; the main cause of Spenser 's heartache was the failure in his larger hopes .

		He had begun his `` Faery Queen '' as an `` epic of the future , '' a promulgation of the spiritual condi - tions under which his country might thrive .

		He had centred his hopes for the realization of these in his patron
Leicester	PERSON	, who was to marry the Queen -LRB- as
Arthur	PERSON	was to be united with
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 489 Gloriana -RRB- and settle the kingdom firmly on the true bases of national greatness .

		But
Leicester	PERSON	died before the first three books were finished , and his death took the heart out of the poet 's enterprise .

		The discouragement was completed by the course of the nation 's life , as it became clear that the governing classes cared nothing for the ideals on which the poem was grounded .

		From the disillusion of this experience , which may be traced in the aimlessness and sense of futility of the later books , the poet was to recover only in his final years .

		To discuss the validity of this thesis without following the critic into detail would be ungener - ous .

		It is argued with sincere conviction , and if at times the evidence seems rather frail for the conclusions , one need only reflect that , after all , the benefit of studies such as this does not neces - sarily lie in conclusiveness .

		Professor
Cory	PERSON	has suggested more than a merely interesting view .


R. E. NEIL DODGE	PERSON	.

		May
Sinclair	PERSON	, Sentimentalist THE TREE OF HEAVEN .

		By
May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		If only `` The Tree of Heaven '' were not so subtly and so well constructed .

		The author has thoroughly documented the history of the Har - rison family from the youth of its men children until , as men , they fall in the great war .

		It is a family which lives in the `` ruinous adoration '' of a mother 's eyes .

		The children , beautiful in body and fine of mind , are painted against a background of desiccated lives a grandmother and three spinster aunts full of the subtle antago - nisms of old women for the unsuccessful of their sex , one drunkard uncle and one uncle mismated .

		Those waste people are painted in early in the children 's lives , at the height of their adolescence , and as survivors of the three sons
Michael	PERSON	,
Nicky	PERSON	, and
John	PERSON	who have been sucked into the war .

		Here you have part of the book 's conscious irony .

		Then there is the approach of war down the years upon the unconscious members of the Har - rison family .


Michael	PERSON	's resistance to war is forecast in his humanism and libertarianism : he is ardently for Irish freedom at the age of thir - teen .

		Nicky by the predisposing hand of the author is made to invent a `` forteresse mobile , '' a sort of forerunner of the tank .

		Frances , the mother , is shown in sublime upper-class satisfac - tion informing herself of the affairs of the nation by skimming the columns of the `` Times , '' only to have those affairs thrust themselves violently into her life and her children 's lives .

		Even the author 's great `` reality '' that immi - nent death and transfiguration her young men write about and face in battle is forecast in the middle third of her book , called `` Vortex . ''

		Here the children of the
Harrison	PERSON	family are engaged in various adventures : Dorothy in intellectualist feminism ,
Michael	PERSON	in futurist art , Nicky in scien - tific invention and sex .

		And each of the adventures is made to seem pale in retrospect from the overwhelming tide of war .

		If only the book were not so well constructed .

		For it is full of strange beauties of insight into a mother 's feelings , the sheer and naked thoughts of children , the pervasive consciousness that makes a family , the awesome mysteries of young girlhood .

		There are scenes whose haunting beauty lies not in any phrase but in the simplicity with which human beings are observed .

		There is a chapter of
Nicky	PERSON	and his cat
Jerry	PERSON	, of the yellow eyes `` the soul of
Nicky	ORGANIZATION	is in that cat '' which has the best of childhood in it , as has
Nicky	ORGANIZATION	's earache and the smile he made carefully so it wojild not hurt him .

		There is the
Veronica	PERSON	of honey-colored hair , `` a little , slender girl in a straight white frock , '' who sees ghosts like
Ferdie	PERSON	, her mother 's lover .

		There are even descriptions of crowds that seem by some nearly orgiastic ebb and flow of words to represent motion .

		There is the pageantry and exaltation of a suffrage pro- cession seen through the eyes of
Veronica	LOCATION	, who did not know she had been chosen to lead because of her youth and `` her processional , hieratic beauty . ''

		Spots there are of foreseeing and retro - spection which would have been richer if
Miss Sinclair	LOCATION	had n't been afraid of writing imagism like
Miss Richardson	PERSON	's , author of that important trilogy `` Backwater . ''

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	has n't been so afraid as some writers of upper-class bias of her own and other people 's unbidden thoughts .

		And so the book , written in a fine feminine hand , is full of subtle and truthfully observed impres - sions .

		But it is too inexorably harnessed to what
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	has made her people in their unprophetic amaze call `` Armageddon . ''

		She might have rested on the
Harrison	PERSON	family as she saw it , with the stray thoughts of
Frances	PERSON	, the unfolding of
Michael	PERSON	and
Nicky	PERSON	and the cousin
Veronica	PERSON	, the 490 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	art world and the other worlds of turmoil that make their way into the circle .

		But she has rested her book upon an apex of war .

		So doing , she challenges a criticism of her understanding of war .

		So doing , she has romanticized Nicky because partly he was to do the right thing in that war ; while
Michael	PERSON	, the poet , who at times seems to represent her heart 's desire , she has been tenderly charitable to and has cruelly misrepre - sented and misunderstood .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's atti - tude toward war has vitiated her attitude toward
Michael	PERSON	, as toward art .

		She has an incredibly mean and cheap sneer at
Michael	PERSON	, poet and resister of war : `` After all , the Germans had been held back from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		As
Stephen	PERSON	pointed out to him , the Battle of the Marne had saved
Michael	PERSON	.

		In magnificent defiance of the enemy , the ` New Poems ' of
Michael Harrison	PERSON	, with illustrations by
Austin Mitchell	PERSON	, were announced as forthcoming in
October	DATE	. ''

		She is cheap again when
Lawrence Stephen	PERSON	, a figure she intended to be of artistic potence and freedom , is as it were converted to war and is made to say : `` My grandmother was a hard Ulster woman and I hated her .

		But I would n't be a thorn in my grandmother 's side if the old lady was assaulted by a brutal voluptuary , and I saw her down and fighting for her honor . ''

		Her use of the upper - class slang , `` funk , '' which means not doing things in an upper-class way , failing from the upper - class point of view , is just a little facile .

		If the `` reality '' of war is as her men and women see it , it is a very partial reality .

		Michael after his conversion to war dismisses a French - man , who can be none other than
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	, with : `` It 's a sort of literary ' f rightfulness . ' ''

		One questions Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's taste in dismissing Barbusse through the pen of her exalted young man .

		There is no less reality in
Barbusse	LOCATION	, who still fought , though without exaltations and great mystic `` realities . ''

		Barbusse 's realities were the stinks and horrors of war mixed with its humani - ties , on the one hand , and on the other , the deep realization that the roots of war are in social and economic inequality .

		Of this sort of reality Miss Sinclair seems to have taken cognizance in only one sentence of her book .

		It was when
Michael	PERSON	saw `` that the strength of the Allies was in exact proportion to the strength and enlightenment of their democracies . ''

		For the rest , it is to be feared that
Barbusse	PERSON	might find `` The Tree of Heaven '' just a little naive and perhaps senti - BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS mental .


HERBERT J. SELIGMANN	PERSON	.

		THE VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
Luther K. Zabriskie	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		The former Consul at
St. Thomas	ORGANIZATION	devotes this volume of 339 pages to a semipopular description of our latest territorial acquisition .

		Three of the 35 chapters in which the book is divided serve for a historical introduction .

		Then he follows with a geographical description of each of the three important islands .

		Their com - merce , their banking facilities , their products , and their occupations complete two thirds of the work .

		Three short chapters deal with general social conditions .

		The remaining fourth of the book treats of recent events , and of the story of the transfer to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The narrative is largely made up of quotations from contem - porary documents .

		In contrast with other works dealing with these islands , particularly the recent volume of
Westergaard	LOCATION	, the present work is much lighter in character and aims to be more general in its description .

		It is obviously a work of love on the part of the author , and it will warrant careful attention on the part of the curious reader .

		THE LANGUAGE OF COLOR .

		By
M. Luck	PERSON	- iesh .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This book is modeled upon an old pattern a pattern useful to the preparation of themes in college or papers at
Women 's Clubs	ORGANIZATION	.

		It covers much ground , and at no point digs deep .

		Yet fair as is this description of the type , it is not fair to the merit with which the pattern is fol - lowed in this specific book .

		For the casual reader desirous of having something about `` Color '' on the shelves of his library , will find `` The Lan - guage of Color '' suitable to his needs .

		In its four divisions it covers the mythology , the histor - ical and emotional associations of color , the sym - bolisms of the several colors , and the scientific facts of .

		color , particularly the psychological facts , which are well considered in the light of modern experiments on color preferences .

		Even the aesthetics of color is discussed .

		These inter - ests may not clash ; but they are more or less differentiated , and their nearly parallel treat - ment gives the false implication that the data and opinions are of comparable importance and stand on comparable evidence .

		An author with greater insight than the present is demanded for a book of real perspicacity and clarity .

		Yet this criticism is perhaps itself open to the criti - cism that it is not just to judge a book for not accomplishing what it does not attempt .

		For a rapid survey of the field the volume has its uses ; it opens invitingly the door to the house of color .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 491 FURNITURE OF THE OLDEN TIME .

		By
Frances Clarey Morse	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		Twenty years ago our country was overrun by a cult of the old .

		The `` old-fashioned '' and the `` new-fangled '' were locked in a death grip , and in matters aesthetic the former seemed about to triumph .

		Old furniture , dusty pewter , and even fishing-nets as ceiling decorations were in vogue .

		The `` old for old 's sake '' was a watchword .

		It was the open season for `` the quaint . ''

		`` Junk and Dust , Junk and Dust , '' sang
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	in a waspish mood as he attacked the affected connoisseurship of the time , which bade fair to strangle the impulse toward a rational aesthetic attitude .

		But much furniture has come out of
Michigan	LOCATION	since then .

		It is through the circula - tion of such books as `` Furniture of the Olden Time '' that we are being brought to see the trend of our national taste .

		Once we were free of the mid - Victorian incubus , the return to the Colonial type of furniture was more than mere sentiment .

		Indeed , had our Colonial period been from
1400	DATE	to
1600	DATE	instead of two centuries later , it is inevitable that our preferences today would have been the same .

		We should not now rave over
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	or
Henry VIII	PERSON	pieces or other Gothic work , for the simple reason that the
Anne	PERSON	- Georgian period saw the development of the best forms and the finest furniture craftsmanship all over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This perhaps is more a matter of evolution than art , but its realization is extremely important to a young nation of our industrial tendencies .

		Miss
Morse	PERSON	deals with furniture actually in
America	LOCATION	and much of it American made .

		The various pieces chairs , settees , and so on are grouped in separate chapters , a process slightly cumbersome , but no better system has so far been evolved .

		The illustrations , though small , are excellently chosen and reproduced , and the book contains two welcome chapters on musical instruments and staircases .

		NINETY-SIX HOURS ' LEAVE .

		By
Stephen McKenna	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		Any author who can write so fine and discern - ing a study of the change in English life from the old world of peace to the new war world of today as `` Sonia '' was , can lay legitimate claim to a holiday .

		Mr.
McKenna	PERSON	frankly takes his holi - day in this gay little story of three British offi - cers on four days ' leave .

		One 's first temptation is to regard the book more as an expression of happy versatility than as an intrinsically inter - esting example in the genre of high-spirited good humor .

		This is the unfortunate penalty one often pays for writing an excellent serious novel ; but `` Ninety-Six Hours ' Leave '' is an amusing bit , and Mr.
McKenna	PERSON	could venture to be its sponsor quite on its own merits .

		It is a non - sensical fable about assuming a disguise for fun and the absurd contretemps which result .

		Inter - est in the mood and temper in which it was writ - ten persists after the book has accomplished its avowed purpose of entertaining .

		One wonders if German officers on leave have as light-hearted a time .

		For it is one of the most enduring traits of the British temperament not to take even a world cataclysm too seriously it is something to be endured , to be `` seen through , '' and to be laughed at as a great joke .

		Two SUMMERS IN THE ICE WILDS OF EASTERN KARAKORAM .

		By
Fannie Bullock Workman	ORGANIZATION	and
William Hunter Workman	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 8	MONEY	.

		Eight summers ' explorations in the remotest fastnesses of the Karakorams from
1898	DATE	to
1912	DATE	create the background of knowledge and ex - perience for this account of the greatest achieve - ments of these noted Himalayists ; to wit , the exploration of
1900	DATE	square miles of mountain and glacier .

		The crowning accomplishment was the exploration and mapping of the great Siachen or Rose Glacier , the longest non-polar ice mass in the world , forty-six miles in length , and ranging in altitude from 12,000 to 18,705 feet .

		The task was an arduous one , not devoid of danger from mud flows , crevasses , and ava - lanches , to say nothing of an earthquake which crumbled the cliffs and filled the air with dust for days .

		Long familiarity on the part of the authors with these dangers of mountain-climbing and ice work has robbed this book of the fresh - ness and novelty of new adventure , although there is enough material therein for repeated thrills .

		Instead of receiving stimulus from an exhilarating tale of achievement - the reader is wearied by acidulous replies to critics of , and comment upon , previous accounts of the authors ' mountain experiences .

		He is even more pained by the strident assertion and repeated emphasis on the part of the feminine author of her share in the enterprise .

		One finds himself unconsciously looking for the legend `` Votes for Women '' printed large across the excellently elaborated map of the
Rose Glacier	ORGANIZATION	.

		However , this quality is doubtless useful in conquering mountains , physical as well as political and social , and the work as a scientific treatise on glaciers and the topography of the eastern Karakoram has a large , permanent value .

		The 141 photogravures are superb portrayals of mountain scenery at the top of the world , many of them novel and in - structive pictures of the glacial ice in action .

		SONNETS , and Other Lyrics .

		By
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Silliman Hillyer	PERSON	.


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	; 75 cts .

		The vogue of free verse has accomplished this that we can no longer be deceived by mere pageantry of words held together by the conven - tional meters .

		The appeal of real poetry in such meters however has not been lessened .

		Miss
Linn	PERSON	's vocabulary contains such words as `` som - nolent , '' `` opalescence , '' `` incarnadined , '' `` limned , '' `` bedight , '' `` chalice , '' `` minarets , '' `` cerulean , '' `` pleached , '' `` gnomon , '' `` solstice , '' `` estival , '' `` florescence . ''

		Behind this rich flow of words there is seldom to be found an idea justifying the existence of the sonnets .

		In spite of some very pretty and worth while poems , the volume gives the impression , furthermore , that
Miss Linn	PERSON	has not derived her inspiration from reality .

		On two occasions the sonnet on the left page tells of the impermanence of her love , while that on the right insists that she will love on eternally .

		Mr.
Hillyer	PERSON	's sonnets , on the other hand , are , vitalized by consistent , well expressed ideas and are additional evidence that the sonnet can be used with signal success in the face of the re - valuing of poetical standards going on today .

		The best of his poems are intimate , real , satisfy - ing .

		Some are mere Elizabethan imitations , but these are in the minority ; the others show an individual expression which promises much .

		Mr.
Hillyer	PERSON	understands well what can be done and what can not be done in a sonnet .

		The other pieces are both good and bad ; sometimes he has caught the lyric quality of the best American poetry .

		Taken as a whole the book is a readable addition to our poetry , and heralds a welcome addition to our poets .

		THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FUTURE .

		By
Emile Boirac	PERSON	.

		Translated and edited by
W. de Kerlor	ORGANIZATION	.

		Stokes ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		A recent view , supported by the evidence of an increasing number of books like the present , sets forth that in matters substantiated by clear scientific evidence we believe with strong reason - able confidence ; but in those of which we have only inexpert or uncertain knowledge , like poli - tics and psychical research , we have absolute , unshakable convictions .

		For these , like instincts , speak with the authentic voice of an older nature .

		M. Boirac should have called his work `` The Psychology of the Past . ''

		His voice sounds like that of a primitive man proving his modernity by speaking through a telephone .

		The book is one of the many contemporary attempts to revive occult mysticism by conscripting some of the products of scientific observation like trance , dual personality , hypnosis or by forcing analo - gies with X rays and wireless telegraphy .

		But the oil and water will not mix ; it is the old story of telepathy and clairvoyance and psychic healing and messages from the beyond .

		It is just a change of costume , old folk superstition in the dress of Greek words , and a pretentious logical ges - ture in imitation of the wand of science .

		Whether one finds this sort of thing amusing or pathetic depends upon one 's mood : one can be either like Puck contemplating the folly of mortals , or like
Carlyle	PERSON	in despair over the ineducability of nine - teenth-century minds .

		Books of this kind cre - ate a luminous fog in which the unwary see , as in a halo , the reflection of their own limitations .

		Reputable publishers should have some con - science about extending their pernicious influ - ence by translation .

		Absurdity vies with absurd - ity on every page , and pretense is added to pre - tense , from the jacket , which announces that the human body `` radiates a powerful magnetic energy , '' to the last page , which gives up a `` cryp - topsychic '' interpretation of the universe .

		A YEAR OF COSTA RICAN NATURAL HIS - TORY .

		By
A. S. and P. P. Calvert	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Barriers of language and culture have long separated us from our sister republics to the south , and even the recently greatly improved facilities for transportation as a result of the growth of the banana trade have not turned any considerable tide of tourist travel to the trop - ical shores of the Central American republics .

		Indeed , if one is looking for the luxuries of travel in the tropics , he will find little to entice him in Professor and Mrs.
Calvert	PERSON	's narrative of their year of varied experiences in the upland cities and forests of
Costa Rica	LOCATION	.

		Dragon flies were the quest .

		It took the explorers into the banana plantations , the low - land jungles , and upland forests , by canyon streams , by morass and mountain lake .

		The book is an entomological diary of daily jungle adven - tures , of successful stalks on mosquito hawks and water bears , of the joys over quarry taken and the disappointments over big bugs that escaped .

		In fact , the general reader is often lost in the multitudinous details of entomological lore which tire and do not illuminate .

		A topical treatment with well-developed examples and an omission of minor , oft-repeated details would have made a more readable work .

		But the book contains valuable information , not only for the prospective traveler in
Costa Rica	LOCATION	, but also for anyone going for scientific exploration into the American tropics .

		It gives a sympathetic and reliable picture of present-day village and country life in
Costa Rica	LOCATION	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 493 HUGO GROTIUS : the Father of the
Modern Science of International Law	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Hamilton Vreeland	PERSON	, Jr. .


Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Grotius was born at seven o'clock in the even - ing , and died `` exactly at
midnight	TIME	. ''

		His `` vital organs were sealed in a copper casket and buried in the
Cathedral of Rostock	ORGANIZATION	, to the left of the choir . ''

		These and many other facts can be learned from this short biography .

		For the book is narrowly biographical , containing no discus - sion of the Grotian legal philosophy nor of its contribution to European thought .

		True , one of the twelve chapters is called `` The ` De Jure Prasdae ' '' and another `` The ` De
Jure Belli	PERSON	ac Pads ' '' ; but both chapters do little more than describe the circumstances under which the books were written , briefly state their contents , and inform us that they are masterpieces .

		Earlier writers are mentioned only to exonerate Grotius of plagiarism .

		It is perhaps fortunate that the writer so restricted himself .

		When he translates `` jus '' as both ' `` law '' and `` right '' in the same sentence , we can not help suspecting that he does not know that the confusion of these two words is fundamentally characteristic of Grotius and all his followers .

		Mr.
Vreeland	PERSON	, in all the lauda - tion of his hero pro tern , never hints at the great
Hollander	PERSON	's chief service to the world his rest - ing law on a basis other than theology .

		If Mr.
Vreeland	PERSON	does not know these things , it is bet - ter that he content himself a.s he has , recount - ing the miscellaneous historical details which make up the volume .

		He loves all facts impar - tially , the small and irrelevant as much as the great and significant .

		He loves them as facts .

		An oasis in this desert might have been
Grotius	PERSON	's es - cape from prison in a trunk ; but Mr.
Vreeland	PERSON	was on the lookout and carefully prefaced the story with a statement of how it turned out .

		He would probably be shocked at the thought of a historian consciously trying to prevent his work from being dull .

		OVER HERE .

		By
Hector MacQuarrie	PERSON	.

		Lip - pincott ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		This is frankly a book of gossipy impressions by a young Lieutenant of the
Royal Field Artil	ORGANIZATION	- lery , sent to this country as inspector of produc - tion for the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	, after being invalided from
Ypres	LOCATION	.

		Now most books of gossip seem impertinences in war time .

		But it would be an exceedingly finicky and humorless person who did not find `` Over Here '' a delightful three hours ' excursion .

		Lieutenant
MacQuarrie	PERSON	does not pretend to be writing a literary masterpiece , and as he hopes his book will be read at home that is , in
England	LOCATION	as much as in the country where he has been so observing and gracious a guest , he can afford to be franker in his criticisms .

		He discovers the ethnology of a big steel town , the money-spending possibilities of
Atlantic City	LOCATION	, the privileged position of American wives , the `` chicken , '' the cocktail and the mint julep , the country club , and the human side of that
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean myth `` the American business man . ''

		It is all very gay and amusing .

		And the temper of it is almost a rebuke to some of our excesses .

		`` I do n't believe either , and no one I knew in
France	LOCATION	during my year there believed , that the
Boche	PERSON	were always dirty in their tricks , though I will admit that they show up badly as sports - men ... I dislike intensely this savage hate propaganda that is being affected here -LSB- in the
United States	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		It is stupid , useless , and danger - ous .

		Did n't some philosopher say that if he wanted to punish a man he would teach him how to hate ?

		... I always feel that in the same way you hide love from the rest of the world be - cause you are proud of it , so you hide hate because you are ashamed of it . ''

		There speaks the true sportsman .

		We like Lieutenant
MacQuarrie	PERSON	all the better for this directness .

		But from the time he learned to accommodate himself to the public horrors of our sleeping cars we liked him any - way .

		The spirit of Anglo-American cooperation is stronger for his having come here .

		FORECASTING THE YIELD AND THE PRICE OF COTTON .

		By
Henry Ludwell Moore	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The mark of a real science is said to be the power of prediction , the power to forecast the future .

		Given certain conditions , certain results must follow .

		But in the social sciences like economics , sociology , and history the human equation enters and must be reckoned with ; and while it is doubtless ultimately true that all human actions are the result of definitely related forces , it is also true that these forces and their relations are so complex and elusive that they have , thus far at least , escaped our grasp .

		This is especially true in the field of economics , al - though some advance has been made by the use of statistics and mathematical methods .

		The present essay on the yield and the price of cotton is a scholarly attempt to obtain a method by which accurate prediction may be possible .

		Math - ematical methods of probability are used to reduce to system the extraction of truth contained in official statistics and to compute with relative exactitude the influence of various factors .

		An informing chapter on the mathematics of correla - tion describes clearly the method used .

		Two chapters are devoted to a critical examination of the methods and results of the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	as to the yield and value per acre and of the current reports of the
Weather Bureau	ORGANIZATION	as to rainfall and temperature .

		A better method of correlation is substituted for the offi - 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	cial one , and the conclusion seems to be worked out that given certain conditions , a certain yield can be forecast .

		The same method is then carried over into the field of demand .

		Here however the result is not so conclusive , because when the supply of cotton varies , it is necessary that the demand for other articles remain the same if the demand for cotton is to be forecast accurately .

		Changes in style the human equa - tion enter into the problem .

		Who could have forecast , for example , the slump in the bicy9le industry ?

		Again , a court goes into mourning and there is an unpredictable demand for black goods .

		The demand for cotton goods may be more stable than that for most goods , but the effect of high prices on consumption is a very difficult problem to solve correctly .

		Many econo - mists question the value of mathematical state - ments except as illustrating previously ascertained truth .

		The trouble lies in the fact that the con - clusion is wrapped up in the mathematical pre - mise .

		Professor
Moore	PERSON	has however made in this study a distinct and interesting contribution to economic literature .

		SOUTH-EASTERN
EUROPE	LOCATION	: The Main Prob - lem of the
Present World Struggle	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Vladislav R. Savic	PERSON	.

		Revell ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It is altogether likely that the most difficult task that will fall to the negotiators of the com - ing peace will be the solution of the Balkan prob - lem .

		Statesmen , diplomats , and warriors have vainly sought such a settlement through the cen - turies ; one of the most colossal blunders .

		of the past hundred years the revision of the treaty of
San Stefano	LOCATION	at
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1875	DATE	was commit - ted in the course of the search .

		Two or three main requirements of the situation are obvious to all fair-minded people .

		The Turk as a ruler should be finally and completely expelled from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The just claims of
Greece	LOCATION	should be recognized .

		Most important of all , the whole vast stretch of territory from the Drave and the Isonzo to the
Bosphorus	LOCATION	and the j ^ Egean should be laid out in a new group of states based funda - mentally upon the principle of nationality .

		One of the most important of these new , truly national states would , under any arrangement , \ be that of the Jugoslavs , or Southern Slavs , composed of the Serbs , the Croats , and the Slovenes ; and in
Savic	LOCATION	's `` South-Eastern
Europe	LOCATION	'' are presented in vivid fashion the arguments for this particular part of the general readjustment .

		The author is a native Serb who has been head of the press bureau in the foreign office at
Belgrade	LOCATION	, and also a correspondent of various English and other foreign newspapers .

		He writes good journalistic English and shows a considerable acquaintance with modern European history and politics .

		The reader must occasionally make allowance for an excess of enthusiasm .

		Yet on the whole the tone is restrained and the argument unassailable .

		How the Jugoslavs came to be in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, the incongruity of their exposed international position with their pacific character , the wrongs which they have suffered from
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, the role of Servia in the Balkan wars and in the present conflict , the aspirations and rights of the South Slav peoples , the reasons why Americans should be interested in seeing justice done in
Southeastern Europe	LOCATION	: these are the matters to which space is chiefly given .

		The South Slav state which Mr.
Savic	PERSON	conceives would in - clude , besides Servia and
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	,
Carniola	LOCATION	,
Goritzia	LOCATION	, half of
Istria	LOCATION	, all of the Dalmatian coast , and other pieces of land , aggregating one hundred thou - sand square miles and having a population of about fourteen millions .

		To create such a state would mean , of course , to unite certain Balkan states that hitherto have been independent , to dismember
Hungary	LOCATION	, and to attach the coastal territories for which
Italy	LOCATION	is actively reaching out in the present conflict .

		Assuming the defeat of the Teutonic powers , the chief difficulty is likely to arise from the clash of interests with the Italians .

		Mr.
Savic	PERSON	presents fairly the Ital - ian claims and then produces strong armument to show that they should not be allowed to stand as against the superior rights of the Jugoslavs .

		Italian expansionists have an unanswerable case in the Trentino , and a fairly good one in
Trieste	LOCATION	.

		But the Dalmatian coasts southward to
Albania	LOCATION	-LRB- which Mr.
Savic	PERSON	would leave autonomous -RRB- are ethnically and in other ways far more Slavic than Italian .

		It is to be hoped that the Italian de - mands in
this quarter	DATE	will not be pressed , for the result could hardly fail to be discord and misfortune all round .

		To fulfill the legitimate aspirations of a long divided and oppressed peo - ple , thereby contributing to the future stability of the Southeast , and to set up the very sort of barrier to Teutonic imperialistic advance south - eastward which the
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	govern - ments in
1914	DATE	proposed to avert these the author convincingly puts forward as the great reasons why `` Jugoslavia '' should , at the restora - tion of peace , be allowed at last to become a reality .

		ON THE HEADWATERS OF PEACE RIVER .

		By
Paul Leland Haworth	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		We owe most of the good books of backwoods travel to men who are lured into the wilds by the spirit of adventure rather than stern necessity .

		If
Daniel Boone	PERSON	had been a writer , there would have remained comparatively few opportunities for men like
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	,
Stewart	PERSON	1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 495
Edward White	ORGANIZATION	, and
Paul Leland Haworth	PERSON	to distinguish themselves .

		But the earlier woods - men had neither the leisure nor the ability to chronicle more than the barest outlines of their achievements .

		Mr.
Haworth	PERSON	possesses in a marked degree the faculty of seeing in retrospect the picturesque features of an expedition .

		With a guide who had been part way he penetrated into the upper reaches of the
Peace River	LOCATION	basin and explored some hitherto unvisited country .

		While the trip involved some hardships and re - quired considerable skill in woodcraft , it did not present any extraordinary danger .

		The adven - tures were chiefly those which come to all hunters and fishermen who get far away from beaten tracks .

		There was enough pot-hunting to make it interesting from the sportsman 's point of view , inasmuch as the game included bear , moose , mountain sheep , and the like , and certain of the streams provided royal fishing .

		Mr.
Haworth	PERSON	named one of the unmapped peaks Mount
Lloyd George	PERSON	, a stream after the heroic aviator
Warne	PERSON	- ford , and a mountain range for
Marshal Joffre	ORGANIZATION	.

		He discovered the glacier that makes the
Quada	PERSON	- cha River white and cleared up a popular mis - conception of the reason for the phenomenon .

		These were practically all of the geographical results of the expedition .

		The book is mainly a very fascinating record of an out-of-door man 's good time .

		A SOLDIER 'S MEMORIES .

		By
Major-Gen	PERSON	- eral Sir
George Younghusband	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		It is safe to say that the reminiscences of British army officers dating from the period be - fore the present world struggle will soon give way to the experiences of youthful veterans now engaged in making history .

		One would expect the old and the new schools to belong to the period of the Boer War and after ; but the latest War Office statistics show the heavy toll taken of the South African veterans .

		Thus such vol - umes as Sir
George Younghusband	PERSON	's are the last to cover the period from the Afghan to the Boer War .

		From the literary point of view , apart from the technical point of view now grown obsolete , the change will be welcome .

		It is a commonplace that wit and humor have had small place in these records of the recent past , when a certain brand of labored , smoking-room hilar - ity glossed the horseplay and skylarking famil - iarly associated with the `` griffins '' as raw young subalterns are termed on their first , callow ap - pearances in
India	LOCATION	.

		Since the Territorial regi - ments took up the garrisoning of
India	LOCATION	and the Colonies during the present war , the hobblede - hoy of the Kipling school has given way to the university-bred and far more intelligent type of junior officer .

		General
Younghusband	PERSON	-LRB- not to be confused with a scholarly brother who led the British to Lhassa -RRB- has seen fit to regale us with many such excerpts from a life devoted to soldiering in
India	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and
South Africa	LOCATION	, and the selec - tions are not very amusing .

		We are certain that subalterns of the new army will have better taste than to train their dogs to `` go for niggers , '' and those of them who have seen the heroism and sacrifices of the
Indian Army	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	,
East Africa	LOCATION	, the Dardanelles ,
Palestine	LOCATION	, and
Mesopo	PERSON	- tamia will certainly refrain from designating their Aryan comrades by that name .

		But Gen - eral
Younghusband	PERSON	is frankly of the old school , and his pages contain interesting and exciting records of Asiatic adventure .

		Glimpses of the early days on the
Northwest Frontier	ORGANIZATION	of
India	LOCATION	, of the customs and methods of fighting among Afghan and
Afridi	PERSON	, including experiences among the picturesque Shans of the Burmese frontier , on the Egyptian hinterland , and in
South Africa	LOCATION	, help to light up swashbuckling annals that were nuts and wine to the adolescent Kipling , but which are rapidly growing old-fashioned .

		Gen - eral
Younghusband	PERSON	only once surpasses himself in his portrait of the Column Commander he fought under in
South Africa	LOCATION	; we can only hope that the new army will discover many men of that knightly mould .

		The author has been free in recording the names of kings , generals , and many nonentities in his pages , but we wish that the name of the Column Commander had sur - vived .

		We did not expect to find the General illu - minating on the Indian problem , and we are not disappointed .

		He belongs to that defunct school of Anglo-Indian officials who , writing on
India	LOCATION	and the Indians , are at their best when they are sentimental .

		Thus the devotion of the old na - tive officer ,
Ibrahim Khan	PERSON	, to the
Younghusband	PERSON	family is fittingly recorded .

		It is to the civil and military officers of the present generation that we look for a solution of the problem .

		On the whole , the author 's long service in
India	LOCATION	has not gleaned the rich harvest of that fascinating ethnical laboratory we have been rewarded with in books from men slightly his junior .

		Nor are the sketches of the men he has met , from
King Edward	LOCATION	to officers like
Roberts	PERSON	and
Kitchener	LOCATION	, of any value to the biographer .

		Writing like a soldier , however , he makes his impressions , including those of a brief sojourn in
America	LOCATION	, typical of that military valetudinarian - ism of which
General Younghusband	ORGANIZATION	is a notable example .

		We are indebted to him for some interesting data on British mess and regimental customs which will appeal to the new army , together with a chapter on the almost forgotten deeds that won the coveted Cross for some of his contemporaries in
Victorian India	LOCATION	.

		496 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT THE GERMAN IMPERIALISTS WHO ARE so gaily plundering the border states of
Russia	LOCATION	and so busily handing out dukedoms and petty princi - palities to the faithful , will not read President
Wilson	PERSON	's Red Cross speech with any considerable pleasure .

		It is the first public announcement from the Allied side that the open season in
Russia	LOCATION	has definitely closed .

		Sooner or later the clique of titled bandits who are leading
Germany	LOCATION	and the German people to ruin will realize that there is a certain irreducible minimum which they must offer before they can even dis - cuss peace with the Allies .

		That minimum has been stated in
Germany	LOCATION	itself and by the majority of a body they now affect to despise the
Reichs	PERSON	- tag .

		Sooner or later the military party will realize that the famous phrase of the resolution no annexations and no indemnities does repre - sent a political reality which they must cal - culate upon .

		May the German people themselves soon realize it too .

		For although the Allies may demand much more than a status quo peace , from the temper of President
Wilson	PERSON	's speech it is clear they will not even discuss peace until this much has been guaranteed .

		IN A RECENT ISSUE OF THE
LONDON	LOCATION	`` NA - tion ''
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	concludes a review of `` A World in Ferment '' with this remarkable sentence : `` In an hour of testing trial we may indeed be thankful to possess across the wide
Atlantic	LOCATION	such leaders of men as the two American Doctors
Wilson	PERSON	and
Butler	PERSON	. ''

		We say `` re - markable , '' for in any event it would be something odd to discover an English contemporary so eager to prove the intellectual leadership of an ally , hitherto seldom conceded any intellectual leader - ship , as to advance this astounding comparison .

		The sentence is all the more remarkable how - ever in view of the curious pattern of the review which precedes , the strangest mosaic of satire and amiability that we have read for a long time even in the `` Nation . ''

		That characteristic of Dr.
Butler	PERSON	's style and method of thought , sen - tentious platitude , has evidently not escaped so discerning and shrewd a critic as Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	.

		But he is terribly nice about it : `` I will add , as nearly as possible in Dr.
Butler	PERSON	's own words , which at times glow with ` an unconquerable optimism ' I find it easier to love than to share , half-a-dozen of his Sententiae , which may serve us , in default of any
Thomas Fuller	PERSON	of our own , for ` Good Thoughts in Bad Times . ' ''

		Here the desire to please American academic vanity obvi - ously clashes with the desire to be somewhat harsher than any vanity could endure .

		Mr.
Bir	PERSON	- rell should be advised that he really does not need to be so meticulously discriminating and friendly .

		American intellectual circles will not be aggrieved at any severe judgment on Dr. But - ler 's intellectual processes .

		And Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	may rest easy in his mind about such severity 's tend - ing by ever so infinitely little to disturb that intel - lectual rapprochement which is one of the hap - piest by-products of the present Anglo-American cooperation .

		WHAT Miss
DEUTSCH	PERSON	HAS TO SAY ABOUT librarians ' salaries in this issue of THE DIAL is reenforced in a letter recently prepared by a com - mittee of
the Association of American Library Schools	ORGANIZATION	and addressed to library trustees and librarians .

		The letter sets forth that the present great demand , in business and in government bureaus , for persons skilled in filing and indexing has created a situation which `` has affected directly or indirectly nearly all libraries and has become a grave one in some of the larger . ''

		Last year , for instance , two depart - ments of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	lost no less than 208 trained employees to this competi - tion .

		The committee estimates that `` probably 1000 persons receiving salaries from
$ 500	MONEY	to
$ 1000	MONEY	have been drawn out of active library work by initial salaries of
$ 1000	MONEY	to
$ 1500	MONEY	. ''

		Clearly this competition will not relax during the war , and may not afterward ; so that the libraries must face the alternatives of paying higher salaries or submitting to incompetent serv - ice .

		What used to be an agitation for a just wage is rapidly becoming a grim economic neces - sity .

		It is probable that in most cases librarians , and in many cases boards of trustees , are powerless to meet the situation from present appropriations ; but in addressing them , the committee , who can scarcely address the holders of the public purse strings throughout the country , have done what they could to get the situation recognized in the proper quarters .

		It remains for library officers to urge upon the authorities not only the justice of higher salaries , but their immediate necessity if the library is not to fall away from what effi - ciency it has attained in its public function .

		THAT THE NEFARIOUS INTERLOCKING OF business with politics has its parallel in the academic world in the interlocking of business with doctrine and academic control is of course no secret .

		The cases of Nearing ,
Keasbey	LOCATION	, Cat - tell ,
Dana	PERSON	,
Beard	ORGANIZATION	, and others keep reminding us , and the dignified if impotent Association of Uni - versity Professors does not let us forget .

		But that impatience with the situation should take trie form of a programme for a new
College of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	, free from all control except
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 497 a firm purpose to speak and teach the truth , is a bit of news as welcome as it is exciting .

		A plan is afoot to create in
New York	LOCATION	a
College of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	that shall study political questions purely in the spirit of science , that shall seek in that spirit to train public servants by means of courses leading to the degrees of Mas - ter of Arts and
Doctor of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The instructors are to be chosen from the most dis - tinguished specialists in the various branches of social science .

		They are to have complete self - government , to be free from administrative responsibilities and the administrative machine of deans , presidents , and `` the usual administrative retinue . ''

		Such administration as may be needed is to be carried on by a board of trustees , one half of whom are to be elected annually by the faculty , which is also to have exclusive power of appointment and dismissal .

		The influence that such a college could wield over the political and academic life and standards of the country is , if it lived up to its programme , little short of controlling .

		There should be no delay in its establishment .

		THE QUESTION OF WHAT PART ADVERTISING and reviewing play in the making of a book is per - haps an older one than we think .


Henry Adams	PERSON	, it seems , asked it a generation ago .

		`` The Life of John Hay '' lately gave away the long kept secret of his authorship of `` Democracy , '' and
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, his publishers , now divulge the fact that he was also the author of `` Esther , '' a novel issued in
1884	DATE	.

		`` Democracy '' was marketed in the usual way and has run through sixteen edi - tions .

		`` Esther '' was neither advertised nor sent out for review , the author making it a test of a book 's opportunity to succeed on its own merit and who remembers `` Esther '' ?

		Had the novel been another `` Democracy '' the test might have had some value .

		But when was an author or , for that matter , his publisher a sound judge of his book 's merit ?

		Even while the publisher is advertising the book 's excellence , the reviewers begin speaking for the ultimate judge , the public ; and that is a verdict which generally occasions some revision , either downward or upward , in their claims .

		Make reviewing difficult , and you delay , more than likely you prevent , the handing down of that verdict .

		Wine may perhaps dis - pense with a bush , but books are not books with - out reviewers .

		IN
THE AMUSING QUARREL D'ESTIME	ORGANIZATION	, AS IT might be called , between Postmaster General Bur - leson and ex-President
Roosevelt	PERSON	apropos of the degree of patriotism manifested by the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' `` Collier 's , '' and the `` Metropolitan '' as contrasted with the
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	newspapers , Mr.
Burleson	PERSON	certainly has the better of the argument so far , at any rate ; for it is not like the Colonel to allow anyone else the last word when he points out that `` all but two of the articles in the
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	papers referred to by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	were published before the passage of the Espionage Act -LRB-
June 15 , 1917	DATE	-RRB- and some of them before our entry into the war . ''

		This is the hit direct .

		For if the provisions of the Espionage Act are to be made retroactive there is no logical reason why it should stop short at any particular point .

		It might even go back to the time when Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	said nice things about the
Kaiser	PERSON	long before the present war , to be sure , but mere chronology would be irrele - vant were the retroactive principle strictly ap - plied .

		It might even include professors who received honorary degrees from German univer - sities , and praised the meticulous efficiency of Prussian scholarship .

		It might cover all who have seen aesthetic charm in the stage-settings of the
Munich	LOCATION	theatre .

		In fact , who of us would ` scape whipping if all the nice things we said about
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans before we en - tered the war were brought up against us ?

		That is the reductio ad absurdum of the theory that the Espionage Act is a kind of free-for-all test of character from birth -LRB- as some excited individ - uals are actually trying to make it -RRB- instead of what it obviously is , a special measure for war time and war time alone .

		THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WAR Service	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- discussed in THE DIAL for
January 31	DATE	-RRB- now reports that more than three million books were donated to the soldiers and sailors in the recent campaign .

		Not only the number but also the high quality of the donations exceeded the librarians ' expectations .

		The library thus assem - bled is one third larger than the Congressional and handsomely lives up to the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's an - nounced aim : `` For every man in service a book in service . ''

		Best of all , it permits the library funds to be devoted more to building and main - tenance than to the purchase of books .

		Here is cause for congratulation but not for ceasing to give .

		Shortly there will be long casualty lists among the three million volumes , whose ranks must receive constant reinforcements from fresh donations .

		One must however observe certain precautions in his giving : these librarians , like their public colleagues , play the censor .

		Zola 's `` L' Assommoir , ''
Daudet	PERSON	's `` Sapho , '' and Mau - passant 's `` Bel-Ami , '' it appears , are to have no chance to rub the bloom off our soldiers .

		But if one is so fortunate as to possess a copy of the famous expurgated edition of
Felicia Hemans	PERSON	's poems , one has no right to withhold it from the army .

		.498 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 23	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION Many , we suppose , are the reasons for travel - ing : pure wanderlust ; the desire to say , `` Yes , I have been there '' ; and the expectancy of its being the short road to culture .

		And as many as the reasons for doing it are the varieties of books written to coax the cautious dollar from the pockets of those who are smitten with the travel fever .

		We remember hearing one of our best known globe-trotters say some four years ago that
South America	LOCATION	would be the tourists ' Mecca in the near future .

		Since that time numberless have been the books issued regarding that continent some picturing it a second Eden , some as the breeding - place of every ill known to man , and some taking a middle ground .

		In `` Vagabonding down the Andes '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 4	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Franck	PERSON	shows it as a country little removed from savagery , where even the largest cities do not know the alpha of clean - liness or sanitation and where the natives are still using the primitive instruments of the Incas .

		He asserts over and over that many of the leaders in society there are of an intelligence equal to that of a schoolboy in our country .

		To one of Mr.
Franck	PERSON	's temperament , however , this very primi - tiveness is one of the country 's chief charms .

		With the winding road ever beckoning him on , he makes the journey from
Colombia	LOCATION	to
Argentina	LOCATION	mostly on foot along the little frequented roads and trails of the mid-Andes .

		He gets so far out of touch with the world that he is obliged to make him - self understood with his few words of
Quichua	LOCATION	, the ancient Indian language .

		Part of the journey is amusingly reminiscent of
R. L. S.	PERSON	, for Mr.
Franck	PERSON	buys a donkey to carry his luggage .

		Whatever the difficulties of bitter cold , or hard travel , the adven - turer clings to his camera and as a result we have a most unusual collection of photographs .

		The book makes good reading but is hardly likely to create enthusiasm in the breast of the ordinary tourist or business man .

		One prefers to suffer the trib - ulations of South American travel by proxy .

		In , striking contrast to the cold , forbidding Andean landscape and hard travel there , is
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	's comfortable motor trip through the soft smiling landscape of
Great Britain	LOCATION	a trip made with almost no engine trouble , over nearly perfect roads , and punctuated by stops at the best of inns .

		Mr.
Shackleton	PERSON	tells how , in six weeks , all points of historical or literary interest or of beauty were visited in a roundabout journey that goes through
Wales	LOCATION	, over into
England	LOCATION	, along the Wye valley , the coast of
Somerset	LOCATION	and
Devon	LOCATION	, the whole south coast of
England	LOCATION	, north to
Canterbury	LOCATION	, Lon - don , and on to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Stratford	LOCATION	,
Warwick	PERSON	,

		`` Touring Great

Longstreth	PERSON	is possessed of much enthusiasm for his subject but little native ability in organizing his impressions .

		He starts out by writing a sort of daily journal which gives an account of his trip through the mountains .

		Then he breaks off into chapters , wherein he discusses the tree and ani - mal life found there , the inns , a few of the better known peaks all somewhat incoherently done .

		When at length he gives us a bibliography of Adi - rondack literature , we discover that there really is a need both for reliable , comprehensive guides and for records of impressions .

		Both are indeed meager and incomplete .

		Perhaps the nearest ap - proach to the latter is Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's account of his ascent of Ampersand in `` Little Rivers . ''

		``
Finland	LOCATION	and the Finns , '' by
Arthur Reade	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, is a timely book , considering that the world is looking so much to
Russia	LOCATION	and her sister states just now .

		It is a clear exposition of the various political and social problems of the Finnish people .

		This means giving the reader an interesting historical perspective wherein is traced the varying Russian , Swedish , and Finnish influences .


Finland	LOCATION	is a most remarkable example of a country pre - serving intact its national traits ' in spite of outside oppression .

		There are also fine chapters on the painting , music , and literature of
Finland	LOCATION	, on edu - cation there and the status of woman , and a suffi - ciently clear account of the chief industries .

		Beside all this the author shows us both city and country folk their manners , customs , and beliefs .

		Today one is permitted to study the potentialities of any country and especially of a country as young -LRB- politically speaking -RRB- as
Finland	LOCATION	, for it is only within the
last decade	DATE	that this race has managed to make its own language the official one for every purpose .

		Just here is where Mr.
Reade	PERSON	's book is valuable : it is an authoritative source of material for such a study material wholly pertinent and sensibly classified a book not to be missed by any student of today 's affairs .

		One would imagine that there was no corner of
Europe	LOCATION	but had been described over and over , yet that there is something new
Eugenie M. Fryer	PERSON	reveals , classifying some beautiful places under the title of `` The Hill-Towns of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		She has put them into four groups : `` First , the large town , commanded and protected by the turrets and massive towers of its walls and cita - del ; second , the feudal castle , the residence of some great lord about whose walls a straggling town has grown up ; third , the fortified town , com - munal in character , which governed by no over - lord and possessed of no castle , protects itself from invasion by fortifying its houses and churches also ; fourth , the monastic hill-town , its defences built primarily to defend a shrine . ''

		It is in one sense a guidebook , but it is no less a book to be enjoyed by the winter fireside .

		Almost thirty towns are de - scribed without too many cliches , and the history or romance of each one given ; and such is the art of the author that the very spirit of
France	LOCATION	, the essence of her beauty and strength , is put upon the page .

		The book is charmingly illustrated with both drawings and photographs .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 499 For all our admiration for
France	LOCATION	, even our affection , French literature can not yet be said to appeal very widely to American readers .

		Certainly the easiest form to begin with is the short story , and
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	's `` The Great Modern French Stories '' -LRB-
Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- offers a convenient and interesting means of approach .

		Its introduction of twenty-nine pages traces with clarity and some distinction , but with a rather noticeable disregard of foreign influence
Scott	PERSON	is barely mentioned and
Poe	PERSON	not at all the development of French fiction as a whole , rather than that of the short story , from
Rousseau	PERSON	to Barres and
Philippe	LOCATION	.

		Then follow in satisfactory translations twenty-two stories by a score of writers it is Maupassant who is represented by three .

		Such a choice must of course include some stories that have become hackneyed through inclusion in numerous anthologies , but most of them are fresh as well as typical of their authors .

		Short biog - raphies of the authors and a discriminating account of available translations of their works into Eng - lish , a valuable assistance to libraries and other purchasers who would avoid inadequate editions , complete this useful and well arranged book .

		The casual traveler in our Southwestern country who comes suddenly upon the serene gray ruins of an old Spanish mission outlined against the radiant sky must stop to wonder what events in the human drama produced the air of mystery and romance which hangs about its crumbling walls .

		Its architecture , conspicuously out of time and place in its present environment and thereby the more precious ; a solitary goat nibbling in subdued fashion in the deserted kitchen garden ; half remem - bered tales of subterranean passages for retreat : such fragments of recollection will be happily re - vived by the `` Stories of the Old Missions of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia '' in
Charles Franklin Carter	PERSON	's book -LRB- Paul Elder ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		`` These legends are recognized in the recorded history of the period and they reflect the spirit of rebellion which occasionally flared up among the mission Indians , as well as the peaceful and industrious life which for the most part they followed under the civilizing influence of the
Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his folk stories of the sea
Wilbur Bassett	PERSON	tells us that all the tales of `` Wander-Ships '' -LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- are variations from five familiar types : phantom-ships , devil-ships , death-ships , reward-ships , and punishment-ships .

		`` The Flying Dutchman , '' for instance , is technically a punishment-ship .

		Still it is reassuring that each new appearance of a wander-ship tale , bringing with it something of glamor and mystery , makes its own uncritical appeal to lovers of the sea .

		In these days one wonders whether the advent of the submarine may not produce a whole new literature of sea legends .

		And the submarine itself is it to add a sixth classification to Mr.
Bassett	PERSON	's five , or will it find itself at home among the devil - ships ?

		The author 's notes on the origin of wander - ship legends include variants of the narratives which are often more interesting , because less elaborated , than the versions he has selected .

		That English scholarship pursues its wonted way despite the abysmal distractions of the great war within hearing distance is suggested by the latest volume of `` Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.40	MONEY	-RRB- con - taining the papers read during the session 1916-17 .

		Aside from a paper on
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` French Revolu - tion , '' which can not avoid letting the din of the present in , the essays concern themselves with `` The Romantic Age in Italian Literature , '' `` Ann Rad - cliffe , '' `` The Modern Hindustani Drama , '' `` Dante and
Boethius	PERSON	, '' `` Currents of English Drama in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` Gongora . ''

		Of the `` French Revolution ''
J. Holland	PERSON	Rose remarks : `` The whole work , indeed , belongs to the poetry of revolt a revolt directed against the new Supply - and-Demand
England	LOCATION	quite as much as against the shams of I ` ancien regime . ''

		And later : `` Was not the seer of
Chelsea	LOCATION	right ?

		Has not our modern civilization blinkered the soul and hobbled the feet of man ?

		Is he not the tool and victim of the machinery created about a century ago ?

		And is not civilization now in danger of perishing under the load of the inventions , of which , even in their initial stages ,
Carlyle	PERSON	discerned the danger ? ''

		This reminds one of
Bergson	PERSON	's remarks , at the beginning of the war , about the swallowing up of man by the machinery he has created , and of
Emerson	LOCATION	's line of long ago , `` Things are in the saddle , and ride mankind . ''

		How often has the spectator thought of the ideals that animate the actor ?

Fiske	PERSON	: Her Views on Actors , Acting , and the Problems of Production , '' by
Alexander Woolcott	PERSON	-LRB- Century ;

		, that from the beginning good acting is science almost to the very end , although `` great acting , of course , is a thing of the spirit ; in its best estate a convey - ance of certain abstract spiritual qualities , with the person of the actor as medium . ''

		But as for her personal taste , `` as soon as I suspect a fine effect is being achieved by accident , I lose interest .

		I am not interested , you see , in unskilled labor . ''

		Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	is of course the scientific actor par excellence .

		Her present production of `` Madame Sand '' is visi - ble proof of that .

		She appeared on the stage as soon as she could walk ; she had a speaking part as soon as she could talk ; for her the stage has never held any glamor .

		It is as natural a phenomenon as the air or the sky .

		Upon such a biographical background does Mr.
Woolcott	PERSON	, one time dramatic critic of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' base his table talks with Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	.

		They contain brilliance , humor , sound sense ; to anyone who loves the thea - tre , they are enthralling .

		For Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	is a scientist no less in regard to theatrical production than in her method of acting .

		She believes implicitly in the artistic integrity of the professional stage .

		Her views on the repertory theatre and the earnest students of the drama will shock and astound those ladies and gentlemen .

		THE UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO	LOCATION	PRESS 5803 Ellis Avenue
CHICAGO ILLINOIS	LOCATION	COMMUNICATION THE OXFORD METHOD IN ENGLISH INSTRUCTION -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your reviewer 's article of
April 11	DATE	, entitled `` The Oxford Spirit , '' suggests the possibility of utilizing the methods of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in our study of English .

		As a graduate of
Oxford	LOCATION	, or more strictly as a holder of the certificate given to women by
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in lieu of the Honors degree , I am deeply inter - ested in the point touched on by Mr.
Hack	PERSON	.

		How far the general doctrine of Oxford could be applied to our secondary system I am unable to say ; but in the English work of our colleges two at least of its methods should produce far better results than we are at present obtaining .

		Those two meth - ods are the refusal to treat English composition as a separate study , and the system of `` set books . ''

		Every student of letters , ancient or modern , at
Oxford	LOCATION	, must write , write , write upon the books he is studying and the affiliations of those books .

		He is obliged in many cases to extend his study to other literatures and he must invariably relate his literary topic to its historical and philosophical background .

		Thus the realization of the immense nexus of influences spread through all literature and all history , of the binding and loosing power of personalities and of systems , of the recombinations which we call `` literary periods '' comes sooner and more clearly to Oxford students than to those of other universities .

		And the power of expression is not there cultivated as an isolated growth ;
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	believes that only the developing mind can set free real power to express , and that the growth of such power proceeds most sanely by discussing the essay - ists , the historians , and the poets whose noble and lucid English may at once discipline the student 's language and stimulate his thought .

		The mass of trivial , ephemeral , and personal subject matter so frequently offered to and offered by students of our `` required theme '' courses is once for all excluded .

		Inasmuch as the great majority of the men who conduct these Oxford courses have themselves un - dergone that training , they are as able to criticize their students ' expressive power as to criticize their facts or their logic .

		The prime difficulty in apply - ing this `` Oxford method '' throughout our letters and history courses would be the number of pres - ent day instructors who are insensitive to English speech , and insensitive because of the false separa - tion of their study-discipline from their expression - discipline during their undergraduate years .

		The other aspect of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's `` English '' method of which I would speak is the study of `` set books . ''

		The so-called `` rapid reading '' courses of some of our colleges are no parallel to the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	work .

		One play by such an author , two poems by such another , part of a novel by another , one canto of So-and-so 's epic , so many chapters of a certain his - tory these and a score of similar extracts are to give the American student his idea of the `` period . ''

		And when this is covered at the rate required by our short-term colleges , it is next to impossible that a clear impression of any single work or of the interrelations of those works should be received
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 501 or retained .

		Oxford selects a few works from each `` age '' ; these are read in part in class , dis - cussed as wholes in class and in the papers , with their values , their influences , their relations .

		Col - lateral readings are advised and urged ; and in the Honors Finals the student has to show not only knowledge of the `` set books , '' but related reading and thinking not done under guidance .

		I write `` knowledge '' ; but at Oxford neither read - ing nor knowledge is a substitute for thought .

Imperial Rome	LOCATION	at the time of her greatest power and splendor the period which
Gibbon	PERSON	declared to have been , of all the world 's his - tory , the time and place most worth living in ?

		Actually and intimately share in the daily life of the Roman aristocracy during the reign of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	?

		It would be a unique experience thus to go back from the twentieth to the
second century	DATE	but you can have it by reading THE UNWILLING VESTAL BY
EDWARD LUCAS	PERSON	WHITE Whose remarkable South American historical romance , `` El Supremo , '' established his ability to make the past live again in the very life and color of its daily habit .

		In `` The Unwilling Vestal '' he repeats and even betters THE MIRACLE OF RE-CREATION HE ACCOMPLISHED in `` El Supremo . ''

		Mr.
White	PERSON	is a keen student of the life , literature and history of the Romans , he knows perfectly their manner of living and has saturated himself with their spirit .

		He sees them with the same vivifying eye and accurate knowledge with which the Italian historian
Ferrero	PERSON	has written about them , and he has put their daily life into a lively , dramatic , swiftly moving romance , glowing with the gorgeous color of pageants , cir - cuses and ceremonials , rilled with stir and bustle , the men and women The chorus of praise which has everywhere greeted the book emphasizes the tense , dra - matic interest of the story it tells , the graphic coloring and accurate depiction of the daily life of the time , and the human , flesh-and - blood quality of its people , so different from the paper-dry , lamp-smelling characters of most novels of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		These few ex - tracts , which might be multiplied many times , give an idea of the cordial reception the novel is having from reviewers : The Outlook : `` Mr.
White	PERSON	, in his fascinating story of
Old Rome	LOCATION	, purposely makes Emperor ,
Vestal Virgins	ORGANIZATION	, slaves and everyone else talk like the people you see at movies or meet on the railway .

		For once we have a story of classical days over which we do not go to sleep .

		We get closer to social , every-day life in
Rome	LOCATION	than anywhere else , except in some of the Latin comedies , which not many people read . ''

Rome	LOCATION	as he portrays it seems very near to us . ''


New York	LOCATION	Sun : `` Action ?

		From the first word of the first sentence Mr.
White	PERSON	hardly ever lets up .

		As a story pure and simple , ` The Unwilling
Vestal	PERSON	' is technically miles ahead of ` El Supremo . '

		Like his first novel , this tale of
Rome	LOCATION	in the years between 100 and 200 A. D. , is related mostly by episodes .

		But the story does not lack continuity .

		And it has suspense to a notable degree , to a degree far beyond the power of many novelists to achieve . ''

Antonines	LOCATION	, it is one of the most absorbingly interesting novels we re - member having read of recent years .

		For the first time in our knowledge we have read a writer who treats the ancient Romans as if they had really existed and had been flesh and blood creations .

		THE DIAL jrortnitrljtlp Journal of Criticism and 2Discu00ion of Eittraturr and
Ctje Announcement THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	announces that on
July 1	DATE	its publication offices will be moved to
New York	LOCATION	and that on
October 3 , 1918	DATE	it will begin weekly publication .

		This step is taken in order to consider more comprehensively the shifting forces which are now making for a new social order .

		Contemporary ideas change and crystallize more rapidly today than at any previous period in history .

		Even literary criticism , if it attempts to reflect the intellectual temper of the day , must be more alert .

		No journal can now retain any reality or vigor which does not react to the tendencies characteristic of our age .

		THE DIAL is not content to present to its readers discussions of these significant forces merely through the medium of book reviews .

		For this reason it has deter - mined to extend the editorial policy to include , in addition to the present literary features , discussion of internationalism and a programme of reconstruction in in - dustry and education .

		This new editorial policy will in no sense be a break with THE DIAL 'S tradi - tion .

		Rather it will be the logical develop - ment of that tradition to meet the changing conditions which are making not only for a new social order but for a new epoch in literature and the arts .

		To these new problems THE DIAL will bring that lib - eral spirit of intellectual curiosity and con - structive criticism which has distinguished its literary policy in the past .

		The present features the book review service and the general articles on litera - ture , art , music , and the theatre will be continued and extended .

		The important current publications will be reviewed promptly in order that the complex pat - tern of intellectual progress may be con - temporaneously reported .

		THE DIAL will be interested in princi - ples and fundamental readjustments rather than in evanescent political issues .

		It will not use the excuse of tolerance or of flabby intellectual good will to evade the task of formulating definite opinions .

		But it will not cling stubbornly to any con - clusion before the discipline of new facts .

		With a sympathetic attitude toward the novelties of the present and the proposals for the future , THE DIAL will not forget the experience and illuminations which his - tory provides .

		Committed to no dogma or preconception , THE PIAL will strive to be hard-hitting , straight-thinking , and authoritative .

		The editorial cooperation of those rec - ognized as the most effective thinkers in their particular fields has been secured .

		The Editors will be :
John Dewey	PERSON	, Thor - stein
Veblen	PERSON	,
Helen Marot	PERSON	, and
George Donlin	PERSON	.

		The Associate Editors will be :
Harold Stearns	PERSON	,
Clarence Britten	PERSON	, Ran -
dolph Bourne	PERSON	, and
Scofield Thayer	PERSON	.


John Dewey	PERSON	is known in
America	LOCATION	for his creative contributions to the problems of education .

		Abroad he is accepted as
America	LOCATION	's senior thinker and philosopher since the death of
William James	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	will write for THE DIAL on educa - tional subjects .


Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	, who will contribute articles dealing with economic and indus - trial reconstruction , is perhaps best known through his volume `` An Inquiry into the Nature of Peace . ''

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	com - bines with an accurate knowledge of facts a ruthless power of analysis and a brilliant irony which makes his style an intellectual adventure .


Helen Marot	PERSON	, who for many years has been associated with American labor or - ganizations , brings to the problems of readjustment both imagination and prac - tical understanding .

		She has published one book , entitled `` American Labor Unions . ''

		THE DIAL 'S present editor ,
George Donlin	PERSON	, will act in the capacity of Editor - in-Chief .

		522 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	Pilgrim Sons of
1920	DATE
The United States	ORGANIZATION	contains a people which has been recruited in the main from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Today some millions of Ameri - cans , most of whom have never seen
Europe	LOCATION	, are returning thither to fight for the cause of the Allies .

		Many will lay down their lives .

		A few may find new homes in the Old World .

		But most will come back again , bringing with them thousands of comrades who , having been informed about
America	LOCATION	, will wish to settle here .

		I am told that of the Aus - tralian troops forty thousand have chosen British wives , many of whom have sailed for the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	in advance of their husbands .

		American soldiers also may marry European girls , who will set forth across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to build up homes .

		Most of these girls are likely to be British , but in any event each state and each city in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	will have in its midst a new type of citizen , young , with many years of activity ahead , and with special memories a special experience for mental back - ground .

		We have seen how the texture of American life has been woven of racial elements from
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and other lands .

		The retired soldier will tell his story to his children and his grand - children .

		No later research by scholars will materially alter his first-hand impres - sion .

		He is today serving on a jury , taking evidence on the spot , examining witnesses , and drawing up the verdict .

		The future opinion of
America	LOCATION	rests not with editors , special correspondents , and lec - turers but with `` the boys '' who have seen things for themselves .

		Their views will determine national policy and their hopes will inspire national ideals .

		They are crossing the ocean and leaving a bridge behind them .

		Americans can not appre - ciate in advance what a difference will be made by `` the boys '' when they get talk - ing here among their friends , after the war .

		At the moment , this vast human force is directed against a foreign foe .

		Whether in camp or in trench , the American soldier has disappeared from civil life and we do not know what opinion he is forming .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	, the talk of soldiers is already beginning to tell .


Russia	LOCATION	has found that out , and so has
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The
United States	LOCATION	will discover that the pilgrim sons of
1920	DATE	will make as much history as the pilgrim fathers of three hundred years earlier .

		We expect in
Britain	LOCATION	that whatever is academic or unreal in our political ma - chine will be swept away .

		Liberalism will embrace Labor , the Socialists ,
Free Trade	ORGANIZATION	, the
International Ideal	ORGANIZATION	.

		Conser - vatism will be a sincere and vigorous reaction , not on the old Tory lines but rather along the principle set up by Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		In the
United States	ORGANIZATION	also the Republican and Democratic parties must become instruments of definite popular impulses and aims , or vanish in the furnace .

		An editor in this country receives news - papers from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He is startled by their contents and often takes refuge in a cautious silence .

		He does not quite like the evidences of war-weariness which greet his eye .

		He is worried by the growth of Socialism in
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
Britain	LOCATION	.

		I am not criticizing his ret - icence .

		Possibly he is a wise guide .

		War is surgery which requires an anaesthetic .

		But when the American soldier is billeted somewhere in
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	he does not close his eyes or stop up his ears .

		He is doubtless most interested in the very paragraphs which American editors are most reluctant to emphasize .

		He will come back to tell his neighbors that in
Britain	LOCATION	the state runs railroads , tramways , gas , water , telephones , telegraphs , savings banks , shipping , tubes , and even food supply and coal mines .

		He will add that in every European country , including Ger - many ,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Hungary	LOCATION	, trade - unionists sit in the legislature .

		He will describe great schemes of national housing .

		He will describe how in no European country are rich men debarred from poli - tics or poor men looked at askance if they enter politics .

		He will discover wage earners in the British Parliament who spend years in public life without amassing
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 523 one penny for themselves .

		It may be that , stirred by these object lessons , he will him - self seize on the American citizenship which he has defended and will make of politics something nobler than has yet been imagined , whether in
Europe	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	.

		Witnessing , as they will , parliaments in
London	LOCATION	and in
Paris	LOCATION	where ministers are constitutionally responsible to the legisla - ture , it may easily happen that the pilgrim sons of
1920	DATE	will open interesting dis - cussion about
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, its powers , responsibilities , opportunities .

		There is not an institution in your land that will escape a searching comparison .

		Hitherto American statesmanship has preserved a dignified isolation from for - eign responsibilities .

		In the future the manhood of
America	LOCATION	will hold a construc - tive opinion on world progress .

		Other countries , even
Britain	LOCATION	, will be entities for which American blood and treasure will have been poured out in which American funds are heavily invested .

		To know those countries intimately will be a simple matter to men who have spent months , possibly years , in them .

		The knowledge which one country has of an - other is always likely to be out of date and it is the duty of responsible writers to bring the impressions of the past into accurate conformity with the facts of the present .

		These American soldiers will have seen the last of the old British Em - pire .


London	LOCATION	is no longer , and will never again become , the money market of the world .

		She is borrowing from
New York	LOCATION	.


Britain	LOCATION	is no longer the chief carrier of the world .

		While her ships sink ,
America	LOCATION	builds .

		Nor is
Britain	LOCATION	the keystone of the alliance against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		That influence also has passed to Wash - ington .

		And all this means that in the diplomatic reconstruction of the peoples of the earth
America	LOCATION	will be heavily involved .

		She must sit at the peace table ; she must act as arbitrator and mediator , not only between allies and enemies but between ally and ally .

		The time is probably far distant , if not in years at least in agony and supreme effort , before this situation can arise .

		But I am here writing for responsible Americans , who have the duty of thinking things out in advance .

		The most dangerous unpreparedness is not of munitions but of mind .


Britain	LOCATION	has led ; she is now obviously following .

		It may be because her states - manship in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	lacked imagination .

		It may be because neither Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	nor Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	discovered a counterpart to Mr.
House	PERSON	.

		Or it may be sheer public spirit which cares nothing if others get the credit provided that the thing required is done .

		But the fact remains that no President has ever wielded such influence within
Great Britain	LOCATION	as Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, and a problem which must be faced is in two words the British Empire .

		I will be quite frank about it I am proud of that Empire .

		To keep four hundred millions of people from murdering one another is a notable achievement .

		And it is not done by com - pulsion .

		But does anybody suppose that the British Empire will be unchanged by the war ?

		He lives in a fool 's paradise .

		The British Empire must be restated in international terms .

		It must be woven into the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its sanction must be not
Britain	LOCATION	alone but mankind .

		And
America	LOCATION	will help in the quiet transforma - tion .

		At least , one hopes so .

		People still talk as if this or that colony `` belonged '' to
Great Britain	LOCATION	as if terri - tory were u a possession . ''

		How much land in
India	LOCATION	is owned by or pays rent to any white British subject ?

		British rule is , in the main , and always ought to be merely a form of social service .

		The multitude of officials who go forth from public schools and universities and `` govern '' native races return when they are fifty as poor in pocket as when they set out , except for a pension which in
America	LOCATION	would be called nominal .

		I am not claiming any infallibility for these men .

		Usually their mental bent is conservative .

		Often they are proud , reserved , and even prejudiced against ideals and theories .

		But their life work is , in the main , to help the weak , to maintain order , to combat famine and disease , to build railroads and highways , to cut away corruption among tax - gatherers and blackmail among police .

		The self-governing dominions are mas - ters of their own fiscal arrangements , and in such matters they are independent of 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	all Imperial control .

		But
India	LOCATION	and the Crown Colonies , which are ruled under specific instructions from
London	LOCATION	, are as open to international as they are to British trade .

		Our view has been that , by seeking no commercial privileges , we shall get our share of commerce without encountering jealousy from other powers which do not exercise so wide a sovereignty as our own happens to be .

		It has been at
Germany	LOCATION	's hands alone that we have received bitter enmity , not because we ex - cluded German enterprise on the con - trary , it was prospering in many parts of our Empire but because
Germany	LOCATION	wished to substitute for our conception of service her conception of dominion .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's messages have com - mitted
America	LOCATION	forever to a world-wide foreign policy .

		As he expresses it , he stands by
Russia	LOCATION	as well as by
France	LOCATION	.

		No words are fuller of meaning than those .

		They signify that American influence in
Russia	LOCATION	and the Near East will be , not per - haps the same thing , but none the less as real a thing as British influence in
India	LOCATION	.


Britain	LOCATION	has labored under the badge of sovereignty .

		The watchword for
America	LOCATION	may be , let us say , brotherhood , coopera - tion , a partnership in responsibility with other well disposed powers .

		She will work in harmony with
Japan	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Britain	LOCATION	, and with the Russians themselves .

		But if this should be her destiny , then there is nothing in substance to differentiate her aims and motives and methods from those which animated the founders of modern
Uganda	LOCATION	or the reformers of modern
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		To many Americans such a field for activity offers serious pitfalls .

		`` We are not ready '' is what they say .

		They know that there is a seamy side to relations be - tween the white man and the colored or Asiatic races .

		They are not reassured by the language of altruism .

		To all of such unconvinced and skeptical persons I would submit that somebody will have to accept responsibility for
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and
Bagdad	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	, and German islands in the
South Seas	LOCATION	.

		This war was fought not for the expansion of the British Empire but for the safety of democracy , and
Britain	LOCATION	can not assume , unaided , the whole `` white man 's burden . ''

		The financial resources at her disposal will be insufficient .

		There must be guarantors of her good faith and partakers of her obligations .

		In due course events , including the re - turn of American troops and especially of men trained previously in universities , will force these considerations on the notice of the people .

		I suggest that the press should lead the way .

		Editors are doubtless confused by the bewildering complexity of a world in chaos .

		Head - lines cause headache .

		There is now a su - preme opportunity for the detached , well informed , impartial leader-writer .

		He should be free from all idea of making a case .

		Clear , continuous , interpretative treatment of foreign news should be assured for every American citizen who pays his
two cents	MONEY	for the journal of his district .

		Today the craft of writer is war work of the highest importance .

		It may make the difference between
Ameri	PERSON	- can idealism in the world and something very much lower .

		And is American thought so ill equipped as some Americans seem to believe for contributing to the solution of inter - national difficulties ?

		I am by no means convinced of this .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	has ex - perience that is true .

		But
America	LOCATION	has a fresh outlook and a detachment from entangling traditions .

		In every case , al - most , she has approached native races as a missionary and not as a trader or a soldier or as a magistrate .

		Her weapon has been persuasion and reason , not power and secular authority .

		Her achievement has been limited , doubtless , in actual bulk missionaries are few and , according to political standards , they are weak .

		But in concentrating as they have done on medi - cine and on education the missionaries have seen further , I think , than the statesmen .

		It will be the statesman who will grad - ually absorb into his policy the mission - ary 's foolishness , not the missionary who will need to absorb the statesman 's wis - dom .

		Many Americans and American organizations have therefore studied the world from the right angle as a place where all men and women should enjoy a certain divine status and receive the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 525 acknowledgment thereof from kings and governors .

		To combine the ideals of
America	LOCATION	with the experience and sagacity of
Europe	LOCATION	is the great and urgent duty , I suggest , of American and European journalists .

		We need to work together , realizing that the matters on which we discourse are no longer , if they ever were , merely academic or sensational .

		For mil - lions they involve the issues of life and death .

		I have said something of the mind of the soldier .

		The messages of President
Wilson	PERSON	have a military value just because they affect the minds of sol - diers .

		They put a case for which brave and enlightened men are prepared to die .

		Mere detestation of the enemy is not enough .

		In a long war like this you must add a principle of hope , a larger loyalty , embracing the true interests of all man - kind , if an international army , with an international navy , fighting an inter - national battle , for an international cause , is to prevail .

		R w _ WILSON < Letters to Unknown Women
HELEN To Helen	PERSON	the Queen : Had I lived in your own time it is most probable that I should never have spoken to you .

		I might have seen you or have been killed before your indifferent eyes when all Hellas contended for possession of you .

		But now you are dead and your lovers also are dead , your name , your reputation , your beauty are at the service of any slave or descendent of Thersites who chooses to make you the subject of his desecrations .

		In this way , O Queen , pos - terity is revenged upon all who were emi - nent for beauty , talent , or courage in the past .

		Lucian has shown us your skull bleaching in Hades , but could you know all that has been said of you by poets of many tongues and races you would con - sider
Lucian	PERSON	the least insulting of those who are unable to respect the dead .

		Thus a poet of my own country , some four hun - dred years ago , dared to place upon the stage a scene in which you revisited the world as the mistress of a conjurer .

		Had you remained loyally with
Menelaus	PERSON	your fame would never have been thus ques - tionably published .

		It is not for me to censure a great lady and a queen , but you must consider the ignorance of a barbar - ian and a slave , and pardon my indelicacy .

		I pose a question .

		Did you exist ?

		In the flesh , I mean , and tangibly a woman mortal and attractive who began this tra - dition of adultery which has had so many terrifying consequences for the world ?

		Or rather , O gold-sandaled one , are you a dream of the poet , a lovely symbol of an unrealizable desire , a type chosen to rep - resent the eternal Ate 's apple that is woman , the source of the contention of men a -LRB- forgive me -RRB- sexual abstraction ?

		Assuming that you did exist , you would , if you were still sentient , consider this question absurd and irrelevant .

		But I am one of a diseased generation .

		We do not live as you lived , in yourself , for yourself , and by yourself , but vicariously , through arts and literature diseases that were un - known to you .

		And your story is part of our lives .

		Therefore it concerns us to know whether you were a woman or a symbol .

		You are altogether elusive that tale of your preserving wifely fidelity ten long years in
Egypt	LOCATION	, while your lover embraced a cloud , needs a faith which our skepti - cism can not muster .

		Moreover we know too much to regard you altogether with awe and reverence you have a patholog - ical interest for us .

		We debate about you ; our more emotional writers consider that your mere name gives their verse an incomparable embellishment .

		Others feel that your case is over-rated , too emphati - cally stressed .

		But in any event you elude us .

		I am not familiar with the queens of my day those I have seen , at a respectful distance , were neither young nor lovely .

		No man would be so foolish as to run away with them , and it must need the force of great reasons of state to compel the kings , their husbands , to act the part of lovers .

		Thus , taking into account all 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	that the poets who lived nearest to you have recorded , we can not believe that you resembled the ordinary queen of our pres - ent life .

		You were , it appears , beautiful .

		Well , you were beautiful .

		But how ?

		Sometimes we think of you as the dream created by the Greeks , of that material loveliness which moved them far more than it ever can us sluggish barbarians .

		Were you that beauty , that unattainable beauty who forever flees the
Menelaus	PERSON	of reality to live with the
Paris	LOCATION	of romance ?

		Were you that tenuous loveliness , that flowerlike fragility , that misty instability ?

		If so , yours is a great destiny to repre - sent the yearning of all Hellas , to be the immortal projection of that yearning !

		But there is
Clytemnestra	LOCATION	, your sister .

		Was adultery a strain in your heredity ?

		Grant that you were , that you existed .

		You still elude us .

		Were you a sort of
Madame Bovary	ORGANIZATION	fretted by the inanity of life in a provincial sort of court , sur - rounded by frigid soldiers and unintelli - gent lawyers who would have died rather than salute your cheek unchastely ?

		An
Hellenic Madame Bovary	ORGANIZATION	, who threw her - self into the arms of the first charming young man who cared to solicit her favors ?

		This at least would explain the tenacity of your husband , who was not content to leave your punishment to swift disillusion - ment , but who prolonged your guilty honeymoon for ten years by his incredible obstinacy .

		You were indeed fortunate both in your husband and in your lover .

		But that is only half the story .

		Some - times we picture you a sort of
Gudrun	PERSON	, a brutal kind of sensual woman imposing your passion upon an unsophisticated boy , taking pleasure in tearing him from his country sweetheart , forcing yourself upon his family and delighted in a gross way by the slaughter and suffering you caused .

		It is indeed but the justice of the world as we know it that you should escape from the consequences of your adultery , while Andromache , the faultless wife ,
Hecuba	LOCATION	, the venerable mother , and
Cassandra	PERSON	, the virgin , all suffer horror upon horror through you .

		The cynicism of this pleases our somewhat frigid skepticism , though here again we begin to suspect that you are a symbol .

		Menelaus is too stupid a man to be so easily moved by his aesthetic mood you are too much like the dream of Hellas at the moment when you are forgiven .

		Still , nothing can spoil our en - joyment of this savory injustice .

		Yet again you elude us and we fumble with the concept of Fate .

		Are you a mar - ionette in the great game , a puppet of Fate using Aphrodite to jerk the string that moves you ?

		The golden apple was it not Fate that sent Herakles to pluck it ?

		Are you the motive that dislodges upon Hellas its pre-ordained confusion ?

		Can we really believe that ten thousand ships would furrow the ^ Egean because your face was beautiful ?

		Must we not rather believe that Fate sent some strange mad - ness into men 's hearts , so that they mur - dered each other , in appearance for you , in reality for some inscrutable Fate ?

		Are you that error in the lives of just men which brings them to destruction , to terror , to death ?

		Are you that smiling poison , that disastrous loveliness ?

		We can not tell .

		But , O Queen , O deathless , smiling , golden one , this we can tell , that the memory of your beauty whether real of feigned still afflicts our hearts , and for your sake , because of you , we are sick and desolate with a wild yearning that nothing can appease , not the cold wind of our hills , not the drab insipidity of our cities , not the confusion of our disordered thought .

		Queen , it is said that reverence is gone from the world ; certainly , if you returned to the earth you would not know it as the place where you walked with gold-braided hair upon white turrets to watch the chiv - alry of Troy and
Hellas	PERSON	battle for your sake .

		But at least this same old yearning for inexplicable loveliness remains , and you would find a few who would bring you flowers to remind you of the smooth lawns below Ida .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 527 An Imperturbable Artist Though it give aid and comfort to the enemy , I must confess that my heart still goes out in gratitude to one
Bernard Tauchnitz	PERSON	of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, from whose paper edition I first came to know
Leonard Mer	ORGANIZATION	- rick .

		`` While
Paris	LOCATION	Laughed '' is a new volume of his stories , soon to be published , which carry one back indeed to the days when those jolly knaves of Montmartre Tricotrin the dramatist ,
Pitou	PERSON	the com - poser , and Lajeunie the novelist first played their pranks for us , they the tragic and the impoverished , breakfasting on brave hopes and warming their hands be - fore the `` sacred fire , '' inheritors of the imperishable vagabond spirit that defies the boundaries .

		Into these new tales
Leon	PERSON	- ard Merrick the story-teller has put some of his best effort .

		To define the fascination which is the chief and most enduring attraction of
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	the novelist , is a difficult matter .

		His talent in this field is at once more profound , more delicate , and less apparent to the average reader who knows him for the .

		most part through his short stories alone .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who was one of his earliest critics in this country , was first impressed by the `` singular shapeli - ness '' and the form of his novels .

		His feeling for proportion and emphasis in writing is to be compared with the same qualities in a good architect or in a painter .

		He leads the mind to grasp what is essen - tial , for his form is an intrinsic part of the emotion he wishes to convey .

		Divorce his style from his subject and you have mere scaffolding or to change the meta - phor , mere uncoordinated oils and colors .

		Is it this `` singular shapeliness '' that con - stitutes his charm ?

		Not wholly , I think .

		Briefly , it consists for me in the intimate treatment of his subject matter , combined with his emotional reserve , and in the evi - dent , sincere , and deep-rooted enchant - ment which his own work holds for him .

		Though he writes of poverty and cheap - ness he does not grovel , and though the emotion of his story would tempt an ordinary writer to exhaust it by abandon - ment he has intensified it by his restraint .

		Probably it is this reserve , so unaccus - tomed to it are we modern readers , that has prevented the immediate popularity of his work .

		Frequently an author needs but to mention the stage to obtain a flock of readers ; but Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	's books filled with actors , actresses , authors , and managers have attracted only a small circle .

		To be sure , he depicts almost with - out exception the struggles of these people , not their successes , and rather holds up to ridicule the adulation of the public .

		The romance of the `` romantic couple '' Blanche and
Royce Oliphant	PERSON	of `` The Actor-Mana - ger '' existed chiefly in the imaginations of the public who saw them behind the foot - lights and not behind the breakfast dishes ; and if the public could have had a private view of
Peggy Harper	PERSON	, the marionette made into the semblance of an actress by months of managerial coaching , its en - thusiasm might have been tempered by something approaching disgust .

		Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	applies a realism to its darlings of which the public can hardly be expected to approve .

		Times have changed since he began to write , and the public is interested as it has never been before in the private lives of the writers and the actors who provide its amuse - ment ; but the interest is purely personal and Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	's dictum still holds true : `` To choose an author as the protagonist of an English play or of an English novel is to handicap the thing from the word ` go . ' '

		That he sees this fact so clearly , that he can treat it with humor and with - out bitterness , that he does in fact make copy out of his own misfortune and con - tinue to let it make not a jot of difference in his choice of a subject , is in itself a warrant of his abiding sense of humor and his artistic imperturbability .

		Sainte-Beuve considered it necessary for the proper comprehension of an author to
* E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	's publishers in this country , have announced a uniform edition of his books with introductions by English writers .

		`` Conrad in Quest of his Youth , '' with an introduction by Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	, will be published early this
summer	DATE	.

		It will be followed by `` The Position of
Peggy Harper	PERSON	, '' with an introduction by Sir
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	; `` The Man Who Understood Women , '' with an introduction by
W. J. Locke	PERSON	; and `` When Love Flies out o '' the Window , '' with an introduction by Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	.

		528 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	frame the man 's work in his life : Tel arbre , tel fruit .

		This is more than usually true of
Merrick	ORGANIZATION	.

		In `` The Worldlings '' we read of his heartbreaking years in the South African diamond fields ; in `` The Actor-Manager , '' of the lonely years in
London	LOCATION	when he was struggling for theatrical and literary recognition , and when he met , one may imagine , with some - thing resembling
Logan Ross	PERSON	's reply to Tatham in ``
Peggy Harper	PERSON	'' : `` We do n't want human beings , my boy , we want parts .

		The audience do n't want to hear why he was n't drowned .

		Show him , my boy ; it does n't matter how he was saved , bring him on : ` That / am here to prove ! '

		Terrific round of applause .

		See what I mean ?

		You lose your grip if you explain things . ''

		A clerk with whom he took lodgings during those days of struggle and dis - appointment , and who is now well known in the
New York	LOCATION	business world , wrote to his friend on the publication of ``
Peggy Harper	PERSON	'' : `` How I remember some of those lodgings you describe in your new book . ''

		Let us take a look at them , and incidentally review a very fine scene .

		It is in `` Cynthia . ''

		On the eve of Kent 's marriage Kent and Turquand , who have shared lodgings , share also a melancholy farewell dinner at the Suisse and return early to their rooms : There was a pause , while the pair smoked slowly , each busy with his thoughts , and considering if anything of what he felt could be said without its sounding sentimental .

		Both were remembering that they would never be sitting at home together in the room again , and though it had many faults , it assumed to the one who was leaving it a `` tender grace '' now .

		He had written his novel at that table ; his first review had come to him here .

		Associations crept out and trailed across the floor ; he felt that this room must always contain an integral portion of his life .

		And Turquand would miss him .

		`` Be dull for you to-morrow evening , rather , I 'm afraid , wo n't it ? ''

		he said in a burst .

		`` Oh , I was alone while you were in
Dieppe	LOCATION	, you know .

		I shall jog along all right ... You 've bought a desk for yourself , have n't you ? ''

		`` Yes .

		Swagger , eh ? ''

		`` You wo n't ` know where yer are . '

		.

		.

		What 's that do you feel a draught ? ''

		`` No I well , perhaps there is a draught now you mention it .

		Yes , I shall work in style when we come back .

		Strange feeling , going to be married ,
Turk	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Is it ? ''

		said
Turquand	LOCATION	.

		`` Have n't had the ex - perience .

		Hope Mrs.
Kent	PERSON	will like me they never do in fiction ... You might tell her I 'm not a bad sort of a damned fool , will you ?

		And er I want to say , do n't have the funks about asking me to your house once in a way , old chap , when I sha n't be a nuisance ; take my oath I 'll never shock your wife ,
Humphrey	PERSON	too fond of you ... Be as careful as as you can , I give you my word . ''

		His teeth dosed round his pipe tightly .

		Neither man looked at the other ;
Humphrey	PERSON	put out his hand without speaking , and Turquand gripped it .

		There was a silence again .

		Both stared at the dead ashes .

		The clock of
St. Giles-in-the-Fields	ORGANIZATION	tolled twelve , and neither commented on it , though they simultaneously reflected that it was now the marriage morning .

		`` Strikes me we were nearly making bally asses of ourselves , '' said Turquand at last in a shaky voice .

		`` Finish your whisky and let 's to bed . ''

		It is in scenes like this that Mr.
Mer	PERSON	- rick shows his greatest power .

		In every - thing he writes he grasps the essential spirit of human relationships ; and though one may laugh at his humor , and de - light in his turns of speech , or suffer acutely with his people when they strike hard times , still it is the picture like this that remains in one 's mind after the plot and the humor and the words are lost .

		The spirit of his relationships remains and the people who made them .

		His character - ization is like his style exact , and at the same time infinitely suggestive .

		How well we know
Blanche Ellerton	PERSON	in her various moods , from the time that she lies awake after the candle is put out repenting of her engagement seven hours after its con - summation , to that other moment when , after tempting
Fairbairn	PERSON	to wrong his friend , her husband , `` the woman whom he had yet to understand lay back upon the sofa with her eyes closed thinking too . ''


Blanche Ellerton	PERSON	, under the author 's hand , becomes a person infinitely more real to us than many of our so-called friends .

		We see her at the table , red-eyed , her face bathed in tears and eau-de-cologne , com - posing her advertisement of `` her little angel in Heaven , '' while
Oliphant	PERSON	sits in the next room , stunned beside his boy 's cot .

		We see her attending lawn parties where fashion was `` being charitable in elaborate toilettes , '' and posing with her husband , to whom in private it was hardly worth while to speak .

		And there are twenty others in his novels all as carefully drawn , as clearly conceived .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 529 Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	's `` heroes '' are so real that one does not even notice their reality .

		He never describes them directly and rarely speaks of them through his other characters ; for the time being they are
Merrick	ORGANIZATION	, and
Merrick	ORGANIZATION	they .

		One shpuld use the singular however ; there is but one , profoundly studied , represented in all the boundless wealth of possibility offered by the conception of an absorbing personality .

		This hero is like Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	, as we have seen , in many superficial ways .

		But what of the real Merrick ?

		His impersonality is extraordinary .

		It is as if he said : `` The greatest compliment you can pay me is to be so enthralled by my stories that the writer of them does not interest you not even exist to you as a separate entity . ''

		It is the reserve of a man whose life is so completely in his work that other self - expression and all self-assertion are un - necessary .

		But what is his real philosophy of writing ?

		What are the literary ideals that underlie these delicately constructed stories of struggle and disappointment or fulfillment , of tragedy and humor ?

		`` My business is to present , '' he remarks , `` not to defend .

		Were tales tellable only when the hero fulfilled both definitions of the word , reviewers would have less to do . ''

		To this business of his he keeps very closely .

		He does defend , but it is through creating sympathy for the object of his own sympathy , never by objective protag - onism .

		But on the other hand , he speaks of `` life , which has no construction and no moral , '' and the first impulse of the critic is to pounce upon an inconsistency .

		For Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	does construct and he does imply a moral , although he does not point it .

		Yet life and art in his mind are as distinct as mirror and portrait in the conception of a painter .

		His realism is the product of his imagination , which transforms life in the construction of art .

		Much the same interpretation is to be found in his own words ; and it is impos - sible not to believe that
Oliphant	PERSON	's ambi - tion of the `` dream theatre '' embodies
Merrick	PERSON	's own hope for literature : The men and women live !

		They are not pup - pets pulled by inexorable strings through four acts to a conventional end .

		Reward for virtue and punishment for vice are shown to exist in the soul , and not in material success and failure .

		To depict the world as a school , where virtue wins the prize and vice gets a flogging , is immoral .

		The drama - tist who comes to me is free : free to be true to his convictions and his art ... and the love within him for all humanity would point the moral when it needed pointing ... The one command laid upon him is to see things nobly that his deeper vision shall help the crowd .

		If
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's dictum remain true , that `` in a novel we want life , not learning , '' then
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	is indeed a novelist .

		That he contemplates life through the comparatively small opening of the stage does not prevent him from obtaining fundamental breadth of vision .

		His sur - face action may lack variety , his essential motivation never .

		His people , though confined to a narrow sphere , exhibit the emotions of human beings , not of actors , actresses , and managers only as such .

		In modern novels the tendency is to plaster modern ideas onto life , and the ideas have a way of interesting the authors more than the life interests them .

		The result ^ of attempting to tell a story with living characters , to make them utter consistent propaganda , and to make the story repre - sent an Idea with a capital / is likely to be a rather hazy , incomplete , and discord - ant patchwork .

		Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	does not at - tempt this alluring task ; but he does gain and give a sense of completeness which many more famous than he are lacking in .

		Primarily he is a writer , not a philosopher .

		This qualification may have kept him from a place among the greatest writers , but at least his perfection in the work he aspires to do lifts him far above the ranks of the spurious philosophers in literature .

		To have lived his life , to have faced his struggles still more difficult , to have faced the lack of appreciation of that public for whom he wrote ; and yet to have kept the delicate edge of his irony unblunted by bitterness , and his humorous optimism unspoiled , indicates an independ - ent devotion to his art that is indeed rare .

		530 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	Our
Paris	LOCATION	Letter I have been reading again
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's essay on `` The Literary Influence of Academies '' ; it has not converted me .

		I am still of the opinion that I expressed in THE DIAL four months ago that academies are the bane of literature and art , and the enemies of individuality .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	thought that English literature would have gained , and the purity of the English lan - guage would have been better preserved , had there been in
England	LOCATION	an institution like the Aca - demic Franchise .

		He says with truth that Riche - lieu intended the Academy to be `` a high court of letters for
France	LOCATION	, '' a `` sovereign organ of opinion , '' and he adds , `` This is what it has , from time to time , really been ; by being , or tending to be this , far more than even by what it has done for the language , it is of such importance in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		It is true that the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	has at certain epochs since its foundation nearly three centuries ago exercised such an authority in mat - ters of intellect and taste as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	indicates and desires .

		Sometimes that authority may have been well exercised , but it would be very difficult to prove that in the long run the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	has benefited French literature .

		Cer - tainly one may be thankful that it has had no such an authority for a long time past .

		For had the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	been able to do so , it would have suppressed every new movement in French lit - erature during the last fifty years .

		Even if it be possible , as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	supposed , to discover a `` law of good taste '' and for my part I doubt it he forgot that such a law could only be relative and provisional .

		`` Je comprends tout , mais il y a des choses qui me degoutent , '' says
Felicie Nanteuil	PERSON	in `` Histoire Comique . ''

		The tendency of an official academy is to try to stereotype taste and , by means of tra - dition , to impose the taste of one generation on all its successors .

		That is very evident in the case of art : the `` tradition '' which the Academic des Beaux Arts maintains and tries to impose in its school is merely the taste of the epoch of
Louis	LOCATION	-
Philippe	PERSON	exalted into a doctrine .

		The attempt to stereotype a language is as per - nicious as that to stereotype taste .

		I contest
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's view that the Academic Fran - c.aise has rendered great services to the French language .

		It has fought against every new word and expression and admitted an innovation only when it could resist no longer .

		Only quite re - cently have we been officially permitted to say `` chic '' or `` epatant , '' which every inhabitant of
France	LOCATION	except a few pedants has said for years .

		The tendency of an academy is not to embellish the language but to impoverish it ; in the seven - teentlj and eighteenth centuries , when the Aca - demic Franchise was at the height of its power and influence , the French language was impover - ished to a deplorable extent in obedience to a `` law of good taste . ''

		The loss is irreparable and it has ruined French poetry .

		Prose has over - come the disadvantage , although the paucity of words in the French language makes it one of the most difficult in the world to write well ; but modern French is not a poetical language , thanks to the academic pedants of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , whereas the French of the fifteenth century was one .

		Even Voltaire , perhaps the greatest prose writer that the world has ever known , must share the blame .

		In litera - ture and art , as in everything else , I am for ' liberty against authority ; both have their disad - vantages , but experience shows that those of liberty are the less .

		The Academic Frangaise seems to recognize that its authority as a `` high court of letters '' is impaired , for it shows a tendency to set itself up as an arbiter of civic and military virtue and an organ of patriotic manifestations .

		Just before the war it elected General Lyautey , and the only new Academician elected since the war began until the other day was Marshal Joffre .

		What - ever may be the military qualities of these two eminent generals , neither of them has the small - est qualification for membership of an institution whose objects are those set out in
Richelieu	LOCATION	's statutes .

		The other day the Academy met to fill the vacancies caused by the deaths of
Henri Roujon	PERSON	,
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	, and
Albert de Mun	PERSON	; there are still six vacancies , for ten Academicians had died since
June , 1914	DATE	and only one election that of Marshal Joffre had been held since then .


M. Anatole France	PERSON	, who has returned to the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	since the war , after refusing for several years to attend its meetings , took part in the election ; but his conversion or reaction which most of his friends profoundly regret , can not obliterate the scathing irony with which the pretensions of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	are demolished in `` Les Opinions de
Jerome Cogniard	PERSON	. ''

		Certain Academicians had proposed that
Cardinal Lugon	ORGANIZATION	, Archbishop of
Reims	LOCATION	, should be elected as the successor of
Count Albert de Mun	ORGANIZATION	as an homage
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 531 to the city which has suffered so terribly from the war .

		The cardinal however , who must have a sense of humor , solved the problem by refusing to be a candidate .

		In the `` Temps '' on
April 29	DATE	M.
Paul Souday	PERSON	, one of the few independent critics left in the Parisian press , congratulated Cardinal Luc.on on his good sense .

		If
Reims	LOCATION	is to have a representative in the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, the natural person to choose , as
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	remarked , would be the Mayor of the town , who has shown no less courage and devotion than the Archbishop .

		But
M. Souday	PERSON	rightly maintained that it is not the business of the Academy to reward public services and that it was not founded to be `` an organ of civic manifestations or a salon of notables of every description . ''

		This development however is a sign that the original functions of the Academy are becoming obsolete .

		Its recourse to those who are in the public eye is a desperate attempt to recover its lost prestige , and at the same time an admission - that it is no longer able to fulfil its original purpose .

		Long since the
Academic Franchise	ORGANIZATION	became political , and the political opinions of candidates have much more influence on their chances than their literary qualities .

		It is a great disadvantage to be a Republican , even a moderate one ; the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	likes bien-pensant gentlemen , even if they write bad French .

		The two Academicians just elected both fulfil that condition : one of them , Mgr .

		Baudrillart , completely ; the other ,
M. Barthou	PERSON	, relatively ; and neither of them writes bad French .

		Mgr .

		Baudrillart is the Rector of the
Catholic Institute of Paris	ORGANIZATION	and the author of many historical works ; it seems for some reason to have been generally agreed that an ecclesiastic should be chosen to succeed
M. de Mun	PERSON	and , as
M. Souday	PERSON	said , Mgr .

		Baudrillart seems to be the only ecclesiastic with any pre - tensions to a chair in the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.


M. Barthou	PERSON	, who succeeds
M. Roujon	PERSON	, was Prime Minister in
1913	DATE	and was the author of the Three - Year Service Law ; to the latter fact he owes his elec - tion , although he has literary tastes and is the author of works on Mirabeau and
Lamartine	PERSON	.

		The chair occupied by
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	was not filled ; in four ballots no candidate obtained the clear majority required by the statutes .

		The two serious candidates were
M. Abel Hermant	PERSON	and
M. Henri Bordeaux	PERSON	.


M. Hermant	PERSON	is not a great writer , but he has produced some interest - ing and amusing novels showing considerable powers of observation and some psychological gifts .

		M.
Bordeaux	LOCATION	is a prolific producer of sen - timental trash which since the war has become patriotic trash and thirteen of the twenty-seven Academicians present thought him worthy to succeed
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	, who after all was some - body both as a writer and as a critic .

		The reason is that
M. Bordeaux	LOCATION	is bien-pensant which has not always prevented him from being more or less pornographic whereas
M. Hermant	PERSON	has a shady past , politically speaking .

		Thus does the sovereign organ of opinion show its capacity to impose upon us a high standard in matters of intellect and taste .

		If
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	were still living he might revise his essay .

		Again I have to record that the unofficial Academic Goncourt gives no more support to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's thesis than its ancient rival .

		On
April 29	DATE	it again refused to admit
Georges Courteline	PERSON	within its ranks ;
M. Henri Ceard	PERSON	was elected to fill the place of the late
Judith Gautier	PERSON	.


M. Ceard	PERSON	was , it is true , chosen by
Edmond de Goncourt	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	to succeed
Paul de Saint-Victor	PERSON	as a member of the Academy ; but Goncourt changed his mind and nominated
M. Rosny	PERSON	nine .

		Three years later
Edmond de Gon	PERSON	- court appointed
M. Ceard	PERSON	to be one of his execu - tors -LRB- the other was
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	-RRB- , but he again changed his mind and substituted
M. Leon Hennique	PERSON	.

		Perhaps it was to console
M. Ceard	PERSON	for having replaced him that
M. Rosny	PERSON	aine and
M. Hennique	PERSON	both voted for him the other day .

		They could hardly pretend that they honestly believe his gifts to be more remarkable than those of
Georges Courteline	PERSON	, who would have been a member of the
Academic Franchise	ORGANIZATION	long ago if that institution came anywhere near to realizing the intentions of its founders .


M. Ceard	PERSON	is the author of some novels and plays which have had as little success as they deserve and , having been an adept of the naturalist school and a disciple of the Goncourts and
Zola	ORGANIZATION	, he has in recent years vilified Zola in reactionary newspapers .

		The Academic Franchise has nar - rowly escaped setting up
M. Henri Bordeaux	PERSON	as one of the forty examples , with
General Lyautey	ORGANIZATION	and
Marshal Joffre	PERSON	, of the highest obtainable standard in matters of intellect and taste .

		The
Academic Goncourt	ORGANIZATION	has asked us to regard `` Terrains a vendre '' as superior to `` Boubou - roche '' and `` Le Train de 8h .47 . ''

		If these are the laws of good taste , let us all be anarchists .

		At the
Petit Palais	PERSON	an opportunity is given of comparing the results of officialism in art with its 532 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	effect on literature .

		A Salon is being held there , the first since the war ; but it is unlike the usual Salon in that it is entirely composed of works by members of the two official societies .

		The absence of `` outsiders '' exposes the poverty of the societies more plainly than ever ; never has it been more evident that the outsiders have saved previous Salons from utter banality .

		As might be expected , the rooms of the
Societe Nationale	ORGANIZATION	des Beaux Arts are rather more interesting and alive than those of the Societe des Artistes Fran - c.ais , which produce a depressing sensation of life - lessness .

		It is almost miraculous that in a country which has initiated all the great movements in modern painting it should be possible for so considerable a number of painters to have so completely escaped the influence of those move - ments as have these who claim the proud title of `` Les Artistes Frangais . ''

		One would imagine , as one walks through the rooms , that even Im - pressionism , now made respectable by age , had never existed .

		And one has the sense of having seen all the pictures before : one has seen them all before at successive Salons any time these twenty years .

		Only the numerous portraits of Marshal
Joffre	PERSON	and other generals and a few conventional battle pieces , which might repre - sent any war at any epoch except the present , attest the influence of the war .

		The level of the
Societe Nationale	ORGANIZATION	des Beaux Arts is higher and it includes more painters of real talent ; but even its members too often repeat themselves almost mechanically , and some of them are much below their own standard .

		At present the influence of the war on art does not seem to be favorable .

		A charming distemper painting of a little girl , rapidly painted and purposely unfinished , by
Albert Besnard	PERSON	, shows the great qualities of the artist whom
Degas	PERSON	described as `` un prix de
Rome	LOCATION	qui a mal tourne , '' from the point of view , that is to say , of his masters .

		Not often has
Besnard	ORGANIZATION	come up to this in recent years .

		Four paintings and a pastel by
Degas	PERSON	only serve to emphasize the banality of the rest of the exhibi - tion ; yet none of them is a particularly fine or characteristic example .

		An exhibition of con - temporary French art is just opening at
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Its organization has been entrusted to the Aca - demic des Beaux Arts ; thus does the state under - stand artistic propaganda abroad .

		It is more than probable that none of the movements that have made contemporary French art what it is will be represented in the exhibition .

		The terrible anxiety of a month ago is some - what relieved ; for although the danger is not yet over , the fact that after six weeks the Ger - mans have not attained one of their objects greatly increases the possibility that they will never attain them .

		In an offensive , time is on the side of the defenders .

		In spite of such mishaps as the loss of
Mont Kemmel	PERSON	, we are justified in believing it to be probable that the attack will be definitely checked .

		But the military situation is still grave .

		The offensive has naturally silenced political con - troversy to a great extent , but the Socialist party has been violently attacked for deciding to cele - brate the hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Karl Marx	ORGANIZATION	.

		So much so that , by a small majority , the Executive of the party went back on its previous decision to hold a great demon - stration for the whole of
Paris	LOCATION	, and there will be only smaller meetings in the various districts .

		The party has however issued a manifesto on the occasion , the work of
M. Bracke	PERSON	and
M. Jean Longuet	PERSON	-LRB- a grandson of Karl Mark -RRB- , in which the importance of the life and work of the founder of modern Socialism is set forth .

		Some of the leaders against the Socialist party show a strange ignorance of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	's character and doc - trines .

		Unfortunately a knowledge of economic questions is not very common in
France	LOCATION	and there is a certain insularity which leads to ignorance about everything outside
France	LOCATION	itself .

		But a paper of the reputation of the `` Journal des Debats '' ought not to say that the theories of the greatest economist of the nineteenth century have no merit but their obscurity ; and it is hardly worthy of the `` Temps '' to declare that
Marx	PERSON	was a bitter enemy of
France	LOCATION	, seeing that he pro- tested against the annexation of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	as `` a crime which revives the policy of conquest in
the second half of the nineteenth century	DATE	'' and wrote on
January 16 , 1871	DATE	that
France	LOCATION	was fighting `` not only for her national independence , but for the liberty of
Germany	LOCATION	and of the world . ''

		The remarkable little book by

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 533 Conscious Control of the Body MAN 'S SUPREME INHERITANCE : Conscious Guid - ance and
Control in Relation to Human Evolu	ORGANIZATION	- tion in Civilization .

		By
F. Matthias Alexander	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Nature and civilization are names .

		Nature stands for the conditions of human life that we find ; civilization , for the conditions of human life that we make .

		In neither are we particularly prosperous or particularly at ease .

		For civilization is the adventure of a race seeking to escape from nature , and nature is the goal of a race seeking freedom from the oppressions of civilization .

		`` Back to nature '' is the universal device , employed even by Germans and no people is more wor - shipful of its own Kultur-toxins .

		There exists a widespread and distinguished gospel of life summed up in this maxim ; and its apostles vary from the pulpiteer
Wagner	PERSON	, famous for his promulgation of `` The Simple Life , '' through the pietist Tolstoy , famous for his practice of it , to the prophet
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	, famous for his definition of its righteousness .

		The title of Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's definition is , indeed , final in the condemnation of the man-made world `` Civil - ization , Its Cause and Cure . ''

		To the fellowship of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Carpenter	PERSON	may be added
F. Matthias Alexander	PERSON	.

		To the diversities of preacher , pietist , and prophet may b ; added that of scientist .

		But where his predecessors see the cure for civilization in an abandonment of it , Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	sees the cure in a growing control of the human organism at work in it .

		In many ways Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's theory and practice bear a striking resemblance to
Freud 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may be said , in fact , that Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	treats the body as
Freud	ORGANIZATION	does the mind .

		The work of the two men seems to me to be supplementary , and I am not sure that
Alexander	PERSON	's is not more fundamental .

		The observations on which he bases his work are , briefly , these : The human body is an organ - ism having an inconceivably ancient inheritance of adaptations to conditions of life to be found only in nature .

		The instinctive responses of the body its postures , attitudes , adjustments ; how it walks , sits , runs , attends , moves its trunk and arms , and so on are responses coordinate with conditions to be found only in a very primitive world , in which unreflective bodily activity is at maximum and thought at minimum .

		The growth of the body did not keep pace with the complications of the nervous system .

		The com - plication of the nervous system meant the coming thought and the emergence of a new and human world , the world of civilization .

		But the physical organs with which we utter and obey thought are the old animal organs of the expression of instinct and impulse and appetite .

		These organs do not fit well into a world of books , desks , skyscrapers , machines , and drinks .

		The physical organs with which we utter and obey thought are mostly not arranged to respond to the evocations of postur - ings , manners , and movements which are the signs of social consciousness and response .

		The soldier 's , machinist 's , farmer 's , desk-worker 's , and gentlewoman 's postures and movements are dis - tortions and cripplings of their bodies .

		There is hardly a man or woman in the civilized world whose efficiency is not lower , whose energy is not wasted , whose physical system is not in strife `` the scene of a civil war , and the heart , lungs , and other semiautomatic organs are in a state of perpetual readjustment to opposing conditions , '' those of nature and those of civilization .

		The effect is a growing depletion of the nerv - ous life of civilized mankind breakdowns , hys - terias , cripplings , and accompanying quackeries like physical culture , osteopathy , and mental heal - ings , aimed to relieve these conditions but failing in the long run .

		The cause of their failure is that they affect symptoms , not causes .

		And the causes here are conflicts within the organism itself , conflicts generated by opposing directions of action in the conditions of life itself .

		One way out would be to abandon civilization as
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Carpenter	PERSON	suggest .

		But that is neither feasible nor courageous nor desirable .

		In the mind which has created civilization man has an infallible instrument for the correction of its evils .

		The way out is the reintegration of bodily action , by means of conscious control .

		To attain this control however requires a long process of reeducation .

		A clinical experience of more than twenty years has convinced Mr.
Alex	PERSON	- ander that most people are the victims of what he brilliantly calls a `` debauched kinaesthesia . ''

		They have a sense of physical ease or adjustment which is habitual and fixed .

		That sense sets the standard of posture for them .

		Yet from the point of view of correctness , the feeling of com - fort and ease may accompany the most deleterious posture .

		Thus there is , in terms of the mechanical arrangement of the body , one position , and one only , which is the position of `` mechanical ad - vantage , '' though because of vicious training and 534 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	long standing habit , that position may at first make the subject feel as if he were set out of shape .

		The readjustment of the organs in terms of the position of `` mechanical advantage , '' and the attainment of a new kinaesthesia are thus basic to a handling of the body at maximum advantage in all the activities of life .

		Conscious guidance and control will do this ; and as Professor
Dewey	PERSON	says , Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	`` possesses and offers a defi - nite method for its realization . ''

		That person would be not only polite but wise who said nothing inflammable concerning the religious poetry of others .

		He should not forget that religious poetry is probably of all poetry most seriously an affair of the heart ; he ought to speak discreetly therefore , and deal with reserve .

		Discriminations however should not be dis - pensed with ; for if religious poetry is to be estimated at all , it obviously can be estimated less as religion than as poetry .

		Once the reader commences discrimination , he will come to the conclusion that the fear of the Lord is not neces - sarily the beginning of poetry .

		In particular he will see , even if he but skims these four volumes , that the most important poetically the `` Manual of Mystic Verse '' is one of the less strictly re - ligious .

		In this volume , even the adverse minded must concede , is contained much of - what is excellent in poetry , certainly most of the best in mystic poetry ; it can not be denied that the exclud - ing of the mediocre and the worst , of which there is a good deal to do , has been thorough and sure .

		One sounds the bass strings of his imagina - tion in being a mystic ; and when one goes so low , the distinction between music and noise is frequently not discoverable .

		Yet from noise this anthology is free : there is practically no one in this various company of the mystic and the mysti - cally inclined whose tone loses clarity as it gains emotion .

		Of the impression made by the collec - tion as a whole hardly less can be said ; it is an impression much removed from the indistinctness , the empty symbolism that mars so much mystic thought and verse .

		You are really not sensible of the dangers of mysticism when you read poetry characterized by so much restraint , by so much dignity and humanity .

		The poems are freely secular , wide ranging , and rich in the depth of experience they draw upon ; and as a consequence the tones with which they speak of Divinity are authoritative and final rather than fanatic .

		These poets , you feel , praise God from well filled minds , and there is the implication in their language that they know what discipline of the heart is .

		For with all their positive intuitions , their `` associations with eternity , '' they do not fail to see , and to use in their praise , the many things that the excessively mystic would neglect or deny , the things that lend themselves especially to poetry not only the inheritance of sense but also all which humanity has won for itself by patience and degrees , and without which it is only accidental that the inheritance of sense can become poetry .

		In fact one is ready to believe that the debt which such successful mysticism owes to cultivation is not slight ; for certainly the debt is not a small one which poetry itself owes to cultivation .

		We are apt to grow negligent in our recognition of such debts when we contrast the urbane , difficult , and slow prog - ress of cultivation with the swift and vivid passions that kindle poetry and religion ; and the mystic , in proportion to his degree of mysticism , is likely to grow contemptuous .

		Yet even the mystic , unless he is bent on final dissolution , must pause to admit that if cultivation has made us artificial it has also made us articulate .

		So there is countenance perhaps , in view of the original and liberal soundness of these particular mystics , for the question : Does not he love God best who can remember otherwise than derogatorily the force of `` what man has made of man '' ?

		Of the next volume , `` Dreams and Images , '' one regrets that so much can not be said .

		Like the `` Manual '' it skirts easily the dangers of mysti - cism ; it does so however by being more restricted , more official , and more partisan .

		It voices a less rich and varied spiritual experience , and it lacks the equanimity and resonance that make the poems of the `` Manual '' the excellent praise and spiritual fortification that they are .

		There is , of course , no defect of fervor ; yet one feels acutely a thinness of expressive resources , and if not a disavowal , a neglect both of the rich poetic tex - tiles that the senses supply and of the valuable patterns that cultivation furnishes .

		The urgent necessity that poetry is perpetually under of being
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 535 at once unique and inevitable , novel and familiar , discloses in this volume a good deal that seems to have been in circulation before , and leads to the suspicion that the stores here drawn upon are not copious .

		These poems are too slightly charged with the perception which chiefly , perhaps alone , clarifies - passion and gives it authority .

		The writers seem to have been in too much haste to praise : they should have gone about ; they should have looked at the world less narrowly ; they should have known that after all the way afield more abounds in the praise of heaven which they are seeking than does the hard high road of dogma .

		Conceding that such a road if it is hard is also fine and smooth , and that those who travel it are safe from the amorphous subjectivity which overtakes the too indulgent mystic , one still feels that if one 's companions must be not only orthodox but poetic , their view should have perspective enough to include the art as well as the object of art .

		The Lord is better praised and man more lastingly fortified in the `` Manual '' than in `` Dreams and Images , '' because those who wrote the former made haste more thoughtfully in their fashion of praise , and with wider con - sideration , than those who wrote the latter .

		Yet the author of `` Poems of Conformity '' has taken thought too , one finds , after having searched somewhat uncertainly through their adorned and intricate convolutions .

		Reviewing his impressions of this volume one is surprised to find at the end a postscript of dissatisfaction that he can scarcely explain .

		It is not because of thinness ; that shortcoming can not be charged to Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's rather complicated maturity ; his verse is even somewhat euphuistic in its ex - hibition of craft and poetic abundance .

		His orthodoxy , too , is richer in experience and has more weight certainly than that of most of the poets in `` Dreams and Images . ''

		Pursuing the matter one comes presently to the conclusion that it is the poet 's sophistication that he dislikes ; and almost at once arises the suspicion that this sophistication shelters as comprehensive a mystic as one has yet seen .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	possesses an abundance of verse ideas of a valuable sort ; the flights of his imagination are somewhat short , but they are multifarious and very skilfully guided ; he seems markedly absorbed in the science of distinction , for he sins by virtuosity sometimes ; yet in spite of all this he stands rather betrayed by the blank mysticism of a poem like `` Rich - mond Park . ''

		Such a betrayal has , indeed , all the appearance of an accident , for the author has ordinarily a firmly orthodox religious voice and so abundant and involved , yet so well modulated , an utterance that one is inclined to credit him with being better practiced in the art of felicity than in felicity itself .

		So the reader is forced to return upon himself and ask what has become of his distinction between the `` Manual '' and `` Dreams and Images , '' of his impression as to the greater excellence and more liberal maturity of the former .

		But he will find that the distinction still holds , for it is not hard to see that the `` Poems of Conformity '' are mature in a more narrowly specialized way than those in the `` Manual . ''

		One becomes the more convinced in this im - pression when he turns to the more ingenuous emotion and less skilfully guided impression - ability of Mr.
Innes Stitt	PERSON	and Mr.
Leo Ward	PERSON	.

		The same distinction which is to be seen in its outcome by a comparison of the `` Poems of Con - formity '' with those in the `` Manual '' can be seen here in its inception .

		The disparity is even emphasized by the arrangement of the poems in the volume , for those dealing with the same or relative aspects of religious emotion are so paired that comparison is inevitable .

		And Mr.
Ward	PERSON	is at a disadvantage in being placed so close to Mr.
Stitt	PERSON	, who , perhaps no richer in potentiality , is yet more arresting by his greater clarity and immediacy .

		The spiritual unity of the two is doubtless as their editor says complete , but poetically they are in very different ways .

		The reader must seek the frequently remote mean - ing of
Leo Ward	PERSON	through intricacies and sub - versions which do not always justify the labor they entail as those of Mr.
Williams	PERSON	usually do .

		One sometimes fails of ready comprehension and wonders if a meaning is really there .

		The result is unfortunate for Mr.
Ward	PERSON	, for one turns to such poems as `` To-Morrow , '' by
Innes Stitt	PERSON	, rather predisposed to accept their easy intelligibil - ity as a mark of superiority .

		And one finds them not only easily intelligible ; they are at once familiar and distinguished ; they are characterized by sincere inspiration , by lucid perception , and by a very delicate spirit of choice .

		Really such achievements should be held not only as the better art but also as the better religious praise , the better spiritual fortification .

		In such achieve - ments is not forgotten the value , so greatly prized by
Emerson	PERSON	, of `` things used as language , '' a value the too partisanly religious neglect , to their own detriment ; yet neither is the purpose of such praise forgotten in the business of com - posn S

		536 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	Lords of Language OSCAR WILDE , His LIFE AND CONFESSIONS .

		By
Frank Harris	PERSON	.

		With a chapter by
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Two vols .

		Published by the author ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		Oscar Wilde was himself too good a story - teller not to have relished this tactfully reasoned account of his own life .

		In what I take to have been
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's most mature phase and accordingly that in which his personality found most complete expression , in those last years in
Paris	LOCATION	, we know he always began the day by the absorption of aperitifs .

		Like the conscientious artist that he is ,
Frank Harris	PERSON	has modeled his book upon his hero even in this detail : he begins with a twenty - two page report of the trial of Oscar Wilde 's father , a distinguished
Dublin	LOCATION	oculist , for the seduction of one of the younger and more charm - ing of his patients .

		We already know the book is to be what Oscar would have called `` scarlet . ''

		It is appropriate that so diverting a narrative should now be issued in a less unpopularly ex - pensive edition than the form in which the book was first published two years ago .

		Incidentally this life of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is the most satisfying we pos - sess , not merely containing much personal data , but also vivified and made articulate by the dramatic genius of the author .

		The style is clear and easy , not seldom illumined by such good things as this reflection on Oscar 's talk : `` It was all like champagne ; meant to be drunk quickly ; if you let it stand , you soon realized that some still wines had rarer virtues . ''

		This hagiology should at length burke those heretics who would deny the importance of our most aesthetic martyr .

		For he that can keep the centre stage in a book by
Frank Harris	PERSON	has cer - tainly vindicated his right to wear those spurs which in his case were so early won across the teacups of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		To few men after their death is it given to carry off so signal a triumph as this of holding through two volumes our undi - vided attention , even with
Harris	PERSON	all the time in full view and of course not allowing us for a moment to forget that he has taken out all the big dogs of his day on leash for airing .

		Neither are the famous dogs of other days allowed to sulk behind the wings .

		The book includes several score and among them such diverse thorough - breds as Luther and Baudelaire ,
Bentham	PERSON	and
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	,
Socrates	PERSON	and
Bernhardt	PERSON	, not to mention the old headliners ,
Alexander	PERSON	and
Cae	ORGANIZATION	- sar .

		But our producer appears to see in Goethe his best drawing-card .

		Indeed we find him on the first page of the little circular sent around to advertise the show .

		During the performance proper we are treated to the great Boche at least once in every number solemnly stalking across the scene for all the world like the negro giant in `` Chu Chin Chow . ''

		Were there not already a rather cumbersome bunch of appendices dangling from the end of volume two , I should recommend to Mr.
Harris	PERSON	that in his next edition he include a `` Who 's Who '' of the performers .


Harris	PERSON	's
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, as at once more condensed and more readable , might well supersede in the education of
America	LOCATION	President
Eliot	PERSON	's somewhat diffuse `` Harvard Classics . ''

		But I have no right to treat as a vaudeville what the word `` Confessions '' in the title might well have admonished me was to be a tragedy .

		Also in that same little annunciatory tract we read : `` Yet his ruin and death were an exempli - fication of the moral law ; he was punished wherein he had sinned . ''

		Yes , a tragedy it is , with the protagonist likened to
Milton	PERSON	's Satan and `` the wild horses of Fate had run away with the light chariot of his fortune . ''

		Whether or not
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	be correct in his diagnosis of Wilde as a prey to an obscure disease called giantism , we are certain that Fate at any rate has here contracted a like complaint .

		The book is almost as bad as a play by Sophocles .

		Were it not for such romantic touches as the thrice repeated phrase `` strange sins '' and for the stimulating atmosphere of `` The Police Gazette , '' I fear some of us moderns could not have survived this biog - raphy of the purest modern of us all .

		Seriously , it is provoking to have that deft master of the quirk and cigarette silhouetted against a not less disturbedly fumy heaven than that behind the
Dresden Rubens of Christ	ORGANIZATION	on the Cross .

		Together with these impertinent paraphernalia of tragedy we find a not less impertinent , if less Greek , moral bias .

		Not only does
Harris	PERSON	exhaust us as well as
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	with interminable arguments against his friend 's peche favori , but also he must needs whitewash Oscar of blasphemy .

		He for - gets that he is not writing a character reference , that all the good words in the world can not make Oscar a curate now .

		We have startling evidence of how potent the Puritan tradition yet is when a writer of
Harris	PERSON	's ability can state as a truism that `` all high humanity is the reward of constant striving against natural desires . ''

		All through the book we are aware of two presences at either shoulder of our author , Melpomene the trumpet-mouthed and the more nasal Virtue .

		In the end the more expansively fateful lady gets in the last word : Since Luther we have been living in a centrifugal movement , in a wild individualism where all ties
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 537 of love and affection have been loosened , and now that the centripetal movement has come into power we shall find that in another fifty years or so friend - ship and love will win again to honor and affinities of all sorts will proclaim themselves without shame and without fear .

		In this sense Oscar might have regarded himself as a forerunner and not as a sur - vival or `` sport . ''

		Really one can not let this sort of guff pass .

		What has social solidarity to do with an abnor - mal manifestation of sex ?

		And if in fifty years
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is to be honored , why not now ?

		Though he used it only to heat the curling - iron for his complicated coiffure of paradox , yet Oscar Wilde undoubtedly had in him a spurt of the divine fire .

		Try to read a man like
Chester	PERSON	- ton and you will not go far before your nerves begin to blench from those metallic paradoxes which come with all the precision of an automatic alarum .

		In
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , they are never the mere jolts we find them in the ordi - nary writer .

		Each has a peculiar grace and flavor of its own and one is no more the double to another than are two persons merely because both happen to be dressed in other than the expected costume .

		Such a book as `` The Decay of Lying '' has only one fault : the argument is so patently just that the style almost wearies us charming though it be and we desire nuts less easy to crack .

		Of course to the Philistines these ideas were , are , and ever will be very real paradoxes indeed .

		Here lies the secret not only of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary method , but also of his life : both his words and his poses were forever addressed to the .

		Philis - tines , and that he should have found them worth mystifying is the real tragedy .

		Nowhere else than in
England	LOCATION	could a man of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's intelli - gence have been bunkoed into taking the proper - tied classes at their own valuation .

		There , how - ever , so inexpugnably are they entrenched that better men than he have accepted conditions and become , like him , despite their genius , mere snobs .

		Such power has the shell-fire of public opinion when kept up from the home through school and university .

		From Lord
Byron	PERSON	to Lord Al - fred
Douglas	PERSON	we can watch file by the terrible troop of the damned .

		Had Dante been an Eng - lishman he would have constructed in hell a tenth circle and there we should have seen no more piteous figure than
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet mediocrity remains the prime condition of popularity , and we are pleased to find that our fop of genius never was quite the button on the cap of
London	LOCATION	society that he liked to imagine .

		But if we feel his writing to be self-conscious , let us remember that in this world sanity can not be otherwise ; and of such affectations as there are we can truly say that they take our heart as no sincerity ever could do .

		His teaching , too , was essentially good , for in all his writings we find that most needed and most difficult of les - sons : to perceive the value of the passing moment is the aim of all sound culture .


Frank Harris	PERSON	was a staunch friend and will always be sure of the respect and honor due to one who had the generosity to stand by a wronged man when all
England	LOCATION	forgot the meaning of the words fair play .

		But if it was the part of a friend to arrange for flight and to counsel it with so multiform an ingenuity , yet it was the part of a Roman , however imperial he thought him - self , to stand trial .


Harris	PERSON	was of course also right in urging his friend to conciliate `` Philis - tine jurymen . ''

		But knowing
Wilde	PERSON	and know - ing Anglo-Saxon jurymen , does anyone believe that to have been possible ?

		Wilde 's behavior at the trial would have been a gesture for which we could now have little but admiration , if only in the sequence he had carried it off .

		Knowing what followed , we fear lest of the many explana - tions he afterwards gave for his passivity , the true one was that had he not brought suit against Queensberry and had he later fled to
France	LOCATION	, `` everyone would be laughing at me '' to a snob the one unthinkable disaster .

		Even so , a more virile character would have put up a fight .

		Reading
Wilde	PERSON	's life we can well believe his assertions of distaste at the ani - malism of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	and Oxford and his friends ' witness that he always shrank from any gross or crude expression .

		The same idiosyncrasy of tem - perament comes out in his inability to compre - hend
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, even when illustrating his own `` Salome . ''

		He was not sufficiently down - right to savor the falcon-like intensity of him who so sheerly pounces to the sanguine heart of his subject .

		It would have been better to have kept complete silence than to have spoken .

		of that divine guttersnipe as an `` orchid-like personality . ''

		`` The Ballad of Reading Gaol , '' says
Frank Harris	PERSON	, `` is beyond all comparison the greatest ballad in English : one of the noblest poems in the language . ''

		Lord
Alfred Douglas	PERSON	in that most terrible of all books , `` Oscar Wilde and Myself , '' demonstrates to his own satisfaction the worthlessness of all his friend 's work .

		I am not fond of the word demonstrate applied to ques - tions of taste , but surely if there ever can be a demonstration in such matters , we have it in
Harris	LOCATION	's juxtaposition of some verses from `` The Shropshire Lad '' and parts of `` The Ballad . ''

		538 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	In such company , to my ear at least , `` The Bal - lad '' rings second-rate : the best one can say of it is that it is less insipid than the rest of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's verse .


Harris	PERSON	speaks of the `` De Profundis '' as `` the best pages of prose he ever wrote . ''

		Here again some of us would differ ; we think that Oscar Wilde wrote better things than this pompous rigmarole in which he calls his grief at his moth - er 's death `` the incommunicable pageant of my purple woe . ''

		Despite the at least mauve quality of Lady Wilde , such an expression seems a bit thick .

		I wish
Frank Harris	PERSON	had not liked the `` De Profundis '' so well : the influence has not been good .

		This extraordinary letter is an ex - ample of man 's attempt to persuade himself that all is for the best and in particular that his indi - vidual fortune , whatever it be , is good .

		When Oscar was proud , he did not have to reflect much to reach the decision that pride is a virtue .

		Now that worldly disaster had overthrown his pride , there became for him no virtue like humility .

		In the light of his pose at the trial , this is all rather funny , but pitiful too ; and regarding the `` De Profundis '' as a piece in the structure of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's whole life , it assumes truly frightful proportions .

		Written to expose the perfidy of
Douglas	PERSON	, it exposes in even more embarrassing fashion the writer himself .

		For the world then saw that he who had roared so prettily , now that the lion-tonic of adulation was taken from him , could only bleat those damning dicta which all humanity inevitably applaud .


Harris	PERSON	, like everybody else , is interested in the question of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's unproductiveness those last years in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Again and again he urged his friend to write , but always in vain .

		Why would he do nothing ?

		Was it perhaps that literary composition had never been so easy for him as he had once pretended ?

		Did Wilde analyze justly when he said he could write only of joy , and his prison life had made that henceforth impossible ?

		How then could he talk , as he surely did , with the old verve and abandon ?

		Was not the real reason that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	had a !

		: last come to know himself and consequently his limitations ?

		Did he not see that of his writings his plays were the best ?

		And was not their worth almost wholly in the brilliant dialogue ?

		A true artist , he devoted himself to what was best in him , his conversation .

		What right had those who were privileged to hear him to grudge him his support ?

		Is there any earthly reason why we should not pay for conversation as well as for books ?

		It is fitting that the manner of payment for this most haphazard of the arts should also be unregulated .

		As Wilde himself said , `` at any rate we who talk should not be condemned by those to whom we dedicate our talents .

		It is for posterity to blame us . ''

		In favor of good conversation there is , be - sides , the excellent argument that , after all , those who in any period can really enjoy the best of a language are so few they can easily be reached in the more intimate manner .

		Wilde appears to have possessed when animated a rare personal phosphorescence , such as we expect to find only in women and there not often .

		This combined with the genius of the man must have been irre - sistible .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	is temerarious so lightly to condemn the method of
Socrates	LOCATION	and of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		But in the end we tire of all these facts and theories , so cumbrously do they hang about the gracious figure of Oscar Wilde .

		Let us remem - ber him an undergraduate , seated in
Magdalen Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, attended by the Alice-in-Wonderland por - ter , lazing away an Oxford afternoon .

		The bright-eyed commoners hurry through on willing feet to river and to playing-field .

		But the clever and the comely stay despite themselves .

		They collect about the heavy speaker of light words , a somewhat young and oily god of a new Sargasso Sea .

		Meanwhile the captain of the Eight is cursing that there should be no other less peril - ous exit from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's first rowing college .

		Those whom the world loves die hard and so we have more than one precious conflicting legend that Oscar Wilde yet lives .

		Because of his sacer - dotal physique I think he would prefer us to think of him as a monk in that
Carmelite Monas	PERSON	- tery in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Dear lover of the irresponsible , erstwhile so elaborately an idler , cherisher of the ardent nothingness of everyday , now he habits where only the vines are irresponsible and life is a carven jade .

		Perhaps he is seated even now on a warm stone bench and looking out across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps he sees the doughty figure of
Frank Harris	PERSON	astride his mustang plunging along over the blue backs of the waves , one hand easily controlling his remarkable mount while with the other he holds out before him , still wet from the printer , the sheets of this book ; for he is eager and liberal of his own as only a cowboy can be .

		The venerable Carme basking in the sunlight perceptibly smiles : he is aware that this world also has its compensations .

University	ORGANIZATION	, even the verb `` shews '' on the jacket advertisement -LRB- the author 's own compo - sition -RRB- ... Though the reading public is des - tined to become increasingly aware of him , and that very shortly , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	is still on the right side of thirty , and his biography therefore is not to be gathered from any of the usual works of reference .

		One might telephone some publish - ing office or other literary centre for his origins and his life thus far ; but somehow one rather enjoys one 's own surmises .

		I shall continue to figure
Christopher Morley	PERSON	as an English univer - sity man who has transferred himself to the
United States	LOCATION	early enough to undergo , will - ingly and quickly , the process of Americani - zation .

		Anyhow , he writes as cheerily and intimately of
New York	LOCATION	and
Long Island	LOCATION	as of
London	LOCATION	and
Suffolk	LOCATION	.

		There is no room for such uncertainty about `` Alpha of the Plough . ''

		He is unqualifiedly British through and through , and is a seasoned , practiced hand .

		His book is made up of papers reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	`` Star . ''

		He tosses these trifles off as deftly as the man in the front window of the restaurant tosses griddlecakes and almost as mechanically .

		Nor does he fail to contribute the obligatory piece to show how the trick is turned .

		`` On Writing an Article '' pleasantly gives the method away , telling how one may get to the end without reaching his subject at all .

		But the book is a reissue , and the text calls for less comment than the pictures .

		These , numerous and exceedingly apropos , are by
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	.

		One longs to write a book of essays , if only on the chance of getting Mr.
Brock	PERSON	to illustrate them .

		How he could ever be adequately paid for putting in so much invention , understanding , taste , and variety but that is between him and his publishers .

		Miss
Woodbridge	PERSON	's book is another matter .

		She relies wholly on her own good pen and unillustrated text .

		She too is deft , and she is zestfully original , in her trig
New England	LOCATION	way ; but `` Alpha '' has a richer reservoir to draw on and is steadied by long-established conventions .

		If you find `` Alpha '' a little stale and cut-and - dried , you will find
Elisabeth Woodbridge	PERSON	fresh and unhackneyed .

		The Anglo-Saxon world has room for both .

		It assuredly has room also for Mr.
Morley	PERSON	and a waiting niche , which he will doubtless adorn , if he does not allow certain second-rate phases of this new world to get the upper hand of him .

		He exhibits both sides of the shield , is on both sides of the water a straddle which he accomplishes with ease and spirit .

		His spirits , indeed , seem uniformly high , and one credits him with a good hearty young mental digestion .

		He is sprightly , alert , and various .

		He is skittish and informal too in the fashion , ofttimes , of the young Englishman who is away from home and home regulations .

		He can strike a high note , as in his observations on President
Wilson	PERSON	or on the German Emperor ; and he can fall , with facility , to the lower strata of ordinary American `` humor , '' as in `` Time to Light the Furnace , '' or in `` Febrifuge , '' where he handles unceremoniously , as elsewhere , certain of his brethren of the pen .

		He can dexterously blend English memories and American `` actualities '' in such a paper as `` The Art of Walking '' ; and he can go off on absolutely unique inventions , full .

		of `` thick-coming fancies , '' as in his guidebook pages descriptive of the town of `` Strychnine . ''

		If there is anywhere pattern and sanction for such a jeu d'esprit , I do n't know where it is .

		Morley is interesting to read and interesting to write about ; but I must go back to the others .

		He , as I have implied , can readily dip to the level of the shirt-sleeve feuilleton , and he is prompt to acknowledge that his personal asso - ciates are literary celebrities , and as such may be put to any informal use ; but
Miss Wood	LOCATION	- bridge , even at her lightest and most elastic , does not quite forget that she has appeared in the Contributors ' Club of `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Thought , usually ; fun , often ; but with decorum , whether in `` Manners and the Puritan '' or in `` Clubs among the Cubs . ''

		And `` Alpha '' is gen - teel without end .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's literary man - ners are variable .

		There was of course a time , THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6 forty or fifty years ago	DATE	, when the American reader under the spell of
Holmes	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and the rest assumed that litera - ture was primarily a vehicle for the self-expres - sion of the gentleman .

		We know better now , when the rough-and-ready is having its day as never before .

		But the essay still has a few old - time shreds of gqntility clinging to it .

		Perhaps it will be the last of the literary forms to be completely informalized and rowdified .

		Shirt sleeves , if swollen by the afflatus , might better pass the essay by and seek other accessible media .

		In the case of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	one inclines to appeal from a Christopher intoxicated by the novelties and freedom of a new world to a Christopher sobered by a consciousness of the fine things he can achieve if he will only settle down to the work .


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		Purpose and Flippancy His SECOND WIFE .

		By
Ernest Poole	PERSON	.

		Mac - raillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		THE
BOARDMAN	PERSON	FAMILY .

		By
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.


Ernest Poole	PERSON	's latest novel is of a pleasing brevity and of a sustained interest no small vir - tues among so many works of fiction in which bright and disconnected incident seems to be the one imagined artistic value .

		You scarcely expect him to have abandoned his well worn American theme of redemption , but you are pleasantly sur - prised to find that his sociological emphasis has been much mitigated .

		In his other books his social conscience led him always into `` problems , '' but his artistic sense seemed incapable of holding him back from pursuing them to an almost crank - like exaggeration .

		The great engineering project in `` The Harbor , '' the wonderful school in `` His Family '' swelled to an apocalyptic role that be - came slightly absurd even to the sense of the most inflamed `` social worker '' or youthful ideal - ist .

		And in the latter book the process of living on in our children 's lives received a damnable reiteration that fairly numbed our eugenic good will .

		Mr.
Poole	PERSON	did not purport to be writing large-mouthed allegories of i modern engineering and education .

		After all , he was telling a living story of the kind of people that we all know .

		But what chance had they in a sociological set - ting so heavily out of drawing ?

		How could anybody help being a prig , living in such a glare of institutional responsibility , or acting always so that the sociological scriptures might be fulfilled ?

		In the present novel that falseness of empha - sis has been much relieved , the sociology im - mensely deflated .

		We are given a straight story of personal redemption , the restoring of a young architect to his earlier ideals , back from the mad materialistic pursuit of money .

		There lingers an odor of the crank in that idea of an apartment house built up in receding tiers .

		But it is a long way ahead from the crazy dream of
Bruce	PERSON	's in `` His Family , '' the city of a thousand stories , with elevators and subways shooting about within it .

		When in the present book the devil takes Joe up into the high mountain , it is to show him , I admit , alternate red , white , and blue apartment houses on
Riverside Drive	ORGANIZATION	, named after the presi - dents .

		But `` His Second Wife '' shows , on the whole , the slow maturing of Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's imag - ination .

		To Mr.
Poole	PERSON	these ideas do not yet seem funny ; he is too much concerned with them as symbols of the struggle between mammon and the ideal .

		He does not feel a strain on our credu - lity that idealism should be so easily taken in by the grotesque , or express itself as determinedly in the grotesque .

		The idealism that Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's heroes usually embody is of a very inchoate and disturbingly inarticulate nature .

		But in this book we are on safer ground .

		The motif of
Ethel	PERSON	, the second wife , who brings about
Joe	PERSON	's redemption in a union with his unmammonized old associates , is the familiar culture-thirst .

		She is seeking the purposeful people who talk about Art and Music , and holding herself doggedly to the cultural line marked out by her fiercely feministic little professor in college .

		The solu - tion which restores her husband brings her to the cultural fountain of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	in the happiest kind of an ending for a serious story of redemption .

		And in the absence of the brooding institutional problem even Ethel seems so much less priggish than the characters in Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's other books that we are almost willing to excuse him his worn and faded theme .

		His people , it is true , still sound like persons whom we have never met ourselves , but whom we hear a friend talk about so much that we come finally to feel almost acquainted with them .

		The feeling of intimacy would be better con - veyed perhaps if Mr.
Poole	PERSON	were more detached from them .

		There is always too much evidence that he is sharing their immaturities and making out a case for his motifs .

		His tone is always more or less tight and protective , as if the ad - mission of any cynicism or even speculation about his ideals would undermine them .

		Life to him
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 541 seems too dangerous to be allowed to run around loose in a novel .

		It will not do to give the nat - ural man entrance unless the plot is prepared to knock him on the head the minute he en - ters .

		At one point in `` His Second Wife '' the word `` sensual '' is thus properly rebuked .

		I can hardly think that Mr.
Poole	PERSON	wants to write didactic novels .

		Yet no one is using fiction today more devotedly as a vehicle of old-fashioned moral purpose .

		And the strangest thing about Mr.
Poole	PERSON	is that it is all apparently done in the name of modern ideas .

		Yet after all ,
Ethel	PERSON	, who finds herself so unexpectedly stepping into her dead sister 's role , with the necessity to fight back the latter 's ambitious influence that had drawn the young husband away from his dreams , is a soundly and conscientiously conceived char - acter .

		There is a type of well-bred American girl who does exhibit just this combination of infantile desire and sophisticated introspection , of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc enthusiasm for feministic causes and cringing in the face of the concrete dominat - ing male , of extreme sexual timidity and curios - ity about `` modern '' notions .

		She is the girl from whose instincts the bloom of health has been rubbed by the sterile family life and education which have worked so hard over her .

		She is already beginning to seem a little old-fashioned , but her hesitating priggishness is worth preserv - ing in a novel .

		In
Sandra Boardman	PERSON	, Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	presents us with very much the same kind of girl , but the author 's imagination is unable to do anything else with her than turn her into a sort of mummified professional dancer .

		There is nothing inherently improbable about this pleasant girl 's leaving the admirable home of one of the best families in an
Ohio	LOCATION	city to make a career for herself in
New York	LOCATION	.

		But having got her there , Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	reduces this young person of good sense and taste to a sort of mechanical whirling dervish of mu - sical comedy , lets her become preposterously affi - anced to her unusually awful Jewish manager , and then extricates her only by the trick of send - ing them to
England	LOCATION	on the
Lusitania	LOCATION	, from which she rescues only
Sandra	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	fills her pages with so much vulgarity that I may perhaps be permitted the vulgarity of saying that at this perfectly obvious trickery I felt exactly as if my pursuit of the sincere and convincing in American fiction had been met by an unusually impudent thumbing of the nose .

		One is the more indignant because Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has so much talent .

		She writes with an intimacy , a fluency , a good humor that show her a competent dis - ciple of Thackeray .

		You are really acquainted with her characters .

		She has the jolly attitude towards life that Mr.
Poole	PERSON	lacks , and she is devoid of moralistic bias .

		But her glaring de - ficiencies of taste spoil one book after another .

		With her ease , humor , and astonishing feeling for the commonplaces of American existence , she can yet cheapen a book until she leaves you with a feeling of utter intellectual ribaldry .

		It is not only because she has the most hair-raising equipment of pseudo-current slang possessed by any American novelist , and slaps it on with a hand that knows no mercy .

		The air of flippancy which she always manages to reach comes from something deeper than that .

		I think it is that she lacks all sense of the value of her material , or at least of the proportionate values .

		The earlier chapters about the
Thatcher	PERSON	and the
Boardman	PERSON	families , the boy and girl life , are charming .

		This homely veracity is the thing that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	does best .

		Her easy careless style is suited to it .

		It is her metier .

		But the story of
Sandra	ORGANIZATION	's life in
New York	LOCATION	has not the least artistic relation with this early setting .

		It is another novel altogether , and only a feeble artistic sense could run it so placidly along after the broad and vivid picture of the
Boardman	PERSON	family .

		This family was her theme , and
Sandra	PERSON	's adventures are an irrelevance which could only be justified by some conscientious development that would put them in the key of the earlier picture .

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	however attempts no such development .

		The last touch of gaucherie is pro- vided by the recivilized
Sandra	PERSON	's appearance in an army camp , married to the honest sweetheart of her youth .

		`` The
Boardman	PERSON	Family , '' about whom the book is supposed to be , have long since evaporated from their biographer 's interest .

		Is this trickery and bad taste the result of Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's desire for an interesting plot ?

		Does she pad out with
Sandra	PERSON	because she feels that the light-minded reader is tired of the family ?

		Or is it just American artlessness to write inverte - brate novels ?

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	moves inorganically about with her slangy youth until you long for the prig again .

		Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's plot is at least an honest one , organically knit .

		An honest plot is better than a tricky one .

		But perhaps American novels would be better if the writers were less concerned with plot and incident , and more with the task of telling their story with all the length and depth and breadth of its significance .

		RANDOLPH BOURNE .

		542 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	DENMARK AND
SWEDEN	LOCATION	WITH
ICELAND	LOCATION	AND
FINLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Jon Stefansson	PERSON	.

		Put - nam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The most recent addition to the `` Story of the Nation Series '' is a history of the Scandinavian lands .

		The author , Dr.
Jon Stefansson	PERSON	of
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, is an Icelandic scholar of some eminence , perhaps best known for his study of Scandinavian place-names in
England	LOCATION	.

		In the present volume Dr.
Stefansson	PERSON	deals particularly with the history of modern times : his theme is the long and disastrous strife between the kings of
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	for the hegemony in the North and the control of the Baltic , the story of Danish power in the sixteenth century and of Swedish leadership in the seventeenth .

		The account is reasonably accurate and will prove helpful to all who would learn the main facts of Scandinavian history ; it is , however , thor - oughly conventional and possesses no outstanding excellences .

		The story of the middle ages in the North is told in the most meager detail ; the author apparently does not appreciate the fact that the development of literary culture in the earlier centuries was probably of more lasting importance than the struggle for empire in later days .

		Two good chapters relate the separate histories of
Iceland	LOCATION	and
Finland	LOCATION	; but there is no separate treatment of
Norway	LOCATION	.

		This kingdom was , it is true , under Danish rule for four cen - turies ; but in the middle ages
Norway	LOCATION	was , at times at least , the most important country in
Scandinavia	LOCATION	; and it has again enjoyed a century of honorable and independent history since
1814	DATE	.

		Dr.
Stefansson	PERSON	seems also to overestimate the role of the kings and scarcely appreciates the parts played by the great statesmen .

		On the whole his account is too much a history of the doings of courts and capitals ; the great popular move - ments that after all shape the life of a nation are not given the prominence and detailed treat - ment that they deserve .

		PICTURES OF WAR WORK IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 2	MONEY	.


Joseph Pennell	PERSON	has been at work supplying a substitute for the tremendous inventory of war - time achievement .

		In his new book `` Pictures of War Work in
America	LOCATION	'' he has given us thifty - six lithographs of the new
America	LOCATION	.

		Quite apart from their significance as images of our country today , they carry a new connotation of labor .

		One feels that Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	should have tried for a bigger title than `` War Work '' : in his preface there is a reference to the wonder of work , and perhape if the title had been changed to `` The Wonder of Production '' it would have been more in keeping with the remarkable lithographs it embraces .

		Work has never ceased through the ages .

		Men like Millet ,
Menzel	PERSON	, and
Daumier	PERSON	have shown us the workman and his sweat ; while
Pennell	PERSON	deals with work as arduous and as grim , he features the boundlessness and immensity of it .

		Where Millet dealt with the combat of hoe and weed ,
Pennell	PERSON	swings us in the immensity of pro- duction .

		He gives us man 's control of forces , where before we had a drawn battle between the two .

		Seen in retrospect
Pennell	PERSON	's early work , while always full of artistry and technical excel - lence , seems to have been inspired by a certain prompting of dilletantism , a certain facile grace which , though it made his cathedrals beautiful , hardly made them as significant monuments of their time as our munition works are of our own .

		In romantic days the hero was made the first swordsman of
France	LOCATION	.

		Today
Pennell	PERSON	makes steel transcendental .

		It is endowed on his lithographic stone with the same power and glory that the Greek gave to the human figure , that the quattrocento painter gave to God , that the landscapist gives to the sun .

		Where so many war artists have descended into cheap commer - cialism in their strain for novelty , it is interesting to note that
Pennell	PERSON	keeps his new strength within the bounds of art and also without any strain on his medium .

		His massing of blacks in `` The Prow '' and `` The Riveters '' is splendid .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	has shown discernment in deciding that Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	should be the one artist to see and record the newest wonders .

		THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION .

		By
Alexander Petrunkevitch	PERSON	,
Samuel N. Harper	PERSON	, and
Frank A. Goldberg	PERSON	.

		THE JUGO-SLAV MOVEMENT .

		By
Robert J. Kerner	PERSON	.

		Har -
vard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		It has taken us a year to realize how tragically important was the task of the special diplomatic mission sent to
Russia	LOCATION	to carry
America	LOCATION	's greeting to our younger sister in democracy .

		It then seemed eminently proper that
Elihu Root	PERSON	should be at the head of the mission ; he was our fore - most statesman and diplomatist .

		After all , his job was to keep
Russia	LOCATION	in the war and to capture its wavering good will for the Allies .

		Today , of course , we have the wisdom that comes after the event and can see that probably no more unfor - tunate choice could have been made .

		There is a pathetic staleness now in Mr.
Root	PERSON	's surmise that the Russian revolution was something more than a mere conventional political phenomenon , in his warning to the `` better classes '' that , unless due restraint were shown , the rights of property might be destroyed , along with opportunities for commercial development and profit .

		Yet Mr.
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 543 Root is careful never to mention Socialism by name at least not in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		He reserves his comment for a speech in
New York	LOCATION	on his return , when he makes an engaging analogy between those holding the doctrine of internationalism and our own hard-harried I. W. W .

		This book is a record of the spiritual obtuseness and lack of imaginative sympathy on the part of our chief messenger to the new
Russia	LOCATION	.

		And so we have to turn to the lesser luminaries who , if less bril - liant , are intellectually less stubborn .

		Their chance for understanding
Russia	LOCATION	is correspond - ingly greater .

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	in an essay called `` Forces Behind the Revolution '' sketches the changes following the overthrow of the Czar .

		These changes are noted in orderly manner ; he gives them their due weight .

		Perhaps he gives them a bit more .

		He would have strengthened his style and point if he had given more emphasis to the intense longing on the part of the Russian people for peace albeit a general democratic peace and for an opportunity to work out their revolution without external complications .

		Mr.
Petrunkevitch	PERSON	discovers that the intellectuals in
Russia	LOCATION	failed to understand the revolution .

		Mr.
Goldberg	PERSON	contributes an interesting account of the rottenness of the Russian court prior to the debacle .

		And Mr.
Kerner	PERSON	summarizes the strug - gle of the Jugo-Slavs for national unity .

		LETTERS OF
JOHN HOLMES	PERSON	TO JAMES RUS - SELL LOWELL AND OTHERS .

		Edited by
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	.

		With an introduc - tion by
Alice M. Longfellow	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Holmes ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Thayer	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	amply buttressed with great names and adorned with expensive illustrations , this somewhat fragile book is ushered into a warspent world .

		And on the whole , though
John Holmes	PERSON	seems to have achieved nothing in this life save character , the publication of his letters is justifiable maybe justified first , because his character is charm - ingly individual ; and secondly , because it is sig - nificantly typical .

		John `` There is but one
John	PERSON	, '' said
Lowell	PERSON	, who loved him was the younger brother of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	.

		He was born in
1812	DATE	in the old gambrel - roofed par - sonage near
Cambridge	LOCATION	Common , graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1832	DATE	, housed with his mother in the old house as long as she lived -LRB- which was very long -RRB- , and then moved across the Common to Appian Way No. 5 , where he remained peace - fully through his old age , more or less confined by a chronic lameness .

		Sometimes he could not walk at all ; but there were more times when he hobbled about in comparative freedom .

		His many friends agree as to his bright-mindedness and keen sense of the droll , his quaintness and courtesy .

		He knew everybody in the village , at least by sight , even unto the cats .

		One kind of population is plenty at No. 5
A.W.	LOCATION	,
viz.	LOCATION	, cats .

		They seem an
Ecumenical Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rose , a great favorite with Miss , disappeared from
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	till this forenoon , when she sauntered in at the front gate with that irrelevant air that cats have , and showed little emotion at the great joy she caused .


John Holmes	PERSON	's provincialism , which exceeded
Oliver Wendell	PERSON	's , was nearly as local as a cat 's .

		Playfully , but with underlying meaning , he wrote to a friend : I shall surprise you perhaps by telling you that I too am going to make an excursion ; and where do you suppose ?

		I am going across the water .

		What do you say to that ?

		I am going to leave my native home its solitudes , sweet though sad its associations its group of familiar friends and cross the dreary waste of waters to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He was a dear old courtly droll Brahmin , whose like we shall not see in the twentieth century .

		He died , appropriately , in
1899	DATE	.

		THE LESS FAMILIAR KIPLING AND KIP - LINGANA .

		By
G. F. Monkshood	PERSON	.

		Dut - ton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This book is a sufficient refutation of the claim that
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's reputation is extinct .

		No publisher would produce so wholly unnecessary a book about a forgotten man .

		There is probably no modern writer whose bibliography is so confusing as
Rudyard Kipling 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		No list even approxi - mately complete of his uncollected works , and of the original places of publication of the col - lected works , has ever been compiled .

		Mr.
Monkshood	PERSON	has done nothing to better our knowl - edge .

		He devotes about thirty pages to sum - marizing the sketches reprinted in `` Abaft the Funnel , '' a volume which , in
America	LOCATION	at any rate , is not so scarce as to justify such an expendi - ture of effort ; the remainder of the book is a hodgepodge of anecdotes , brief quotations from uncollected works , parodies , and bibliographic notes .

		Little of the material is new , and most is accessible in better form elsewhere .

		The most scathing parody ever written that by
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	in `` Caliban 's Guide to Letters '' is not given , and those which are given are not worth reprinting .

		The bibliographic notes add nothing to the information contained in the bibliographies of
Yorke Powell	PERSON	,
John Lane	PERSON	,
Luther Livingston	PERSON	, or the pretentious and unsatisfactory `` Kipling Dictionary '' published five or six years ago .

		Were Mr.
Monkshood	PERSON	's pursuit of
Kiplingana	LOCATION	as inde - fatigable as his publishers assert , he would have found the series of articles which appeared in `` Notes and Queries '' early in
1914	DATE	, and would thereby have corrected some of the errors which he repeats from the writers just named .

		Some day a complete biography and bibliography of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	will be written , but it is not likely that Mr.
Monkshood	PERSON	will be the author .

		544 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	NOTES ON NEW FICTION What quaint forms our new international idealism may take in an American mind is shown in an intellectual extravaganza like the anony - mous `` Professor
Latimer	PERSON	's Progress '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		The author is apparently relying on a certain smart frivolity of tone to charm the reader towards a serious moral and to comfort any skepticism the war may have given him about religion or society .

		Professor
Latimer	PERSON	is a kind of American Dr.
Pangloss	PERSON	who seeks relief from the intellectual oppressiveness of the war in a walking trip through the countryside , intent on restoring his faith in the best of all possible worlds .

		Movie actresses , amateur sociologists , experimental psychologists , tuberculosis experts , retired reporters liberate his mind ; and , talking all the while , he returns home cured , convinced that the evils of society are overrated .

		He demol - ishes a young puppy who has insulted Labor by picturing it as oppressed ; he exposes a psycholo - gist who wishes to destroy his soul with statis - tics ; .

		he has a dream fight with their father , the Devil ; he puts the modern woman in her place .

		Each person he meets becomes a means of his indignantly reestablishing for himself some par - ticular bright side of things .

		If the author were only a Voltaire all this might be excellent fun .

		But unfortunately he really wants us to believe in his God and to believe that in his process of setting the world straight
America	LOCATION	is really going to set the eternal verities back on the wall .

		So his entertaining , if somewhat spinsterly , satire ends in the exquisite banality of the Professor 's actually achieving comfort and consolation .

		Surely nothing is flatter than satire which ends in a moral .

		This book 's denouement makes the whimsicality of the style highly offensive .

		The whole thing is put off color .

		You suspect a provincial mind which has wrapped its naive conservative credulity in a smart sophisticated style .

		The mind of the author , which one might have taken as acute , betrays itself as essentially frivolous .

		With the best will in the world to be at home with the ideas he tosses so lightly , he x seems to lack even that sense of their significance which would justify him in ridiculing them .

		`` Flood Tide '' by
Daniel Chase	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is the kind of book one hesitates to varnish over with too high a gloss out of sheer liking for the honest grain of the thing as it is .

		Mr.
Chase	PERSON	surveys his hero 's progress from the small
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts town of his birth to college , through business in
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, to leisurely society and back again .

		A young man 's book , and no satire !

		Further marks of strength are the vividness of his vision and his unflinching style , though nowhere do you catch more than a profile of
John Coffin	ORGANIZATION	, the hero .

		But an amiably American work it is , hero or no hero .

		There are other signs of nationality , for as in its ances - tor ``
Silas Lapham	PERSON	'' the hero 's rise comes only after his financial downfall .

		Is it the puritanic story of the
Rich Young Man	ORGANIZATION	and the Kingdom of Heaven that makes us so self-conscious about money ?

		From
Whitehaven John Coffin	ORGANIZATION	went on to college very evidently
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	and in the chapters on undergraduate life Mr.
Chase	PERSON	really begins his story .

		Among the easily recog - nizable types is one
Langdon	PERSON	, editor of the col - lege paper , who incidentally gives an illuminating definition of college as `` catalysis . ''

		Coffin planned to return to college as an instructor , but was diplomatically thwarted by his father .

		He actually did start in a wholesale grocer 's in Bos - ton .

		From here , according to the monotonously and conventionally melodramatic way of busi - ness men , he rose to be head of a chain of retail stores in
New York	LOCATION	, in company with a Jew named Marks and his boyhood friend
Stowell	PERSON	.

		Quite as clearly as in the chapters on college life , the author sketches the commercial scenes and figures of this period : `` There was also an old ark of a typewriter , second cousin to a drop forge and related by sound to a
McCormick	ORGANIZATION	reaper .


Stowell	PERSON	used this as a gymna - sium ... In the yards below me a switching engine crept about , coughing apologetically but insistently , in search of some car which had fallen into bad company . ''

		But the business once established , Coffin neg - lected it for North Shore society and even a voyage of exploration to
South America	LOCATION	.

		This life , hardly more congenial than business , sent him back to his boyhood home and a love affair tardily renewed .

		Again in
Whitehaven	LOCATION	he begins life over after the simultaneous smashup of Marks and the Stores .

		The book leaves him free to pursue a latent interest in painting .

		Good in many ways , `` Flood Tide '' is exceptional in one respect : it improves .

		Not a few of our writers , Booth Tarkington for one , seem rather to tire of their work after the second third of it .

		Mr.
Chase	PERSON	lives up to his title .

		It is the early , and probably autobiographical , chapters which are the weakest of all .

		This will not be Mr.
Chase	PERSON	's first and only book .

		If
Joseph Anthony	PERSON	had ended `` Rekindled Fires '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- on page 219 he would have had a most charming novel .


Stanislav Zabransky Stanley Zabriskie	PERSON	for scholastic pur - poses is about to lead a strike in the tobacco works in
Creekville	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, when he is most amusingly and amazedly sent off to college under the patronage of his patriarchal Bohemian employer and the local Sons of
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		College is , of course , the inevitable sequel to those school days , so winningly portrayed , when
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	is the intellectual pride of the little immigrant com - munity , teaching his father to read and conduct -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 545 ing the literary affairs of union and saloon .

		Life can hardly be as idyllic and entertaining as this among the Bohemian and German factory work - ers of a
New Jersey	LOCATION	village , but we take the picture at its own valuation so long as Stanley stays strictly at home and the world is only as large as the village .

		The author 's humor plays delightfully about the local racial and political feuds , the union and the school , the shrewd old parents ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's adventures with his American boy friend .

		All this community life makes very novel material , which is treated by the author with a warm intimacy and charm that is alto - gether appealing .

		But the college life that fol - lows is neither novel nor interesting .

		The pointlessness of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's adventures betrays the amateur 's hand , which was concealed while the author stayed with us in
Creekville	LOCATION	.

		Our imag - inations could have done better with
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's progress than Mr.
Anthony	PERSON	has .

		And incarcera - tion in a
Missouri	LOCATION	college as instructor in philos - ophy seems a cruelly banal ending for so charming a boyhood as
Stanley Zabriskie 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Why the ` ell , '' one can imagine
Thomas Burke	PERSON	saying to himself , `` was n't I born where cinnamon and aconite , betel and bhang hang on the air , and luxurious , leisurely revenges are executed with poison and slender knives ? ''

		Why not indeed , except that then there would have been little in
London	LOCATION	's
Chinatown	LOCATION	to stimulate his interest .

		His senses would have been accus - tomed to the odors and sights that now permeate him with an exotic feeling of mystery and adventure , and every Mongol would not be so crammed with delightful dramatic possibilities .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's `` Limehouse Nights '' was melodrama carried to the nth degree : melodrama of the senses , of the imagination , of human events , of phrases even .

		There he was , in fact , such a passionate young melodramatist that one forgave him his crudities .

		But these stare one rudely in the eye from `` Twinkletoes '' -LRB- McBride ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		No matter how bad the company a story writer 's characters keep , they really ought not to harbor `` the light of love-madness '' in their eyes .

		Neither is it any longer fashionable for `` torrents of bright curls '' to `` foam '' about any young lady 's neck , nor for prize fighters to talk like a sick school - girl about love , however sentimental they become .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's melodramatic bent is betraying him .

		Twinkletoes , for example , the little dancing girl who is his adored heroine , is made intolerably good and sweet just to deepen the horror of what happens one night when she goes on a little party .

		How can anyone help disliking a heroine who had `` epigrammatic legs in their darned stockings , '' who is sentimental about her father and makes everyone including Mr.
Burke	PERSON	sentimental about herself ?

		He and she are both at their best when
Twinkletoes	ORGANIZATION	is living as well as talking the vernacular .

		But vernacular and local color do not make the man or the story .

		When Nemesis descends upon Twinkletoes , and
Chinatown	LOCATION	learns how her education was bought at the price of her father 's crime , when she weeps and gets drunk and goes to the bad , then Mr.
Burke	PERSON	repents him of some of his ways .

		Then too , even at the most tear-stained spot , he has the hardihood to observe that `` she was no longer a little girl , but a tortured organism . ''

		Perfervid critics have run up and down fame 's ladder plucking the busts of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	,
Robert Louis	PERSON	even , and
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	off their pedes - tals and setting Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's in the vacant niches .

		It wo n't do .

		He has flashes of poetry , imagina - tion , passion , humor .

		But he has not disciplined himself and he writes too often with the irre - sponsible excitement of a police court reporter or a builder of thrupenny thrillers .

		`` The Long Trick '' by `` Bartimeus '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- resembles nothing so much as a group of recruiting posters , drawn from life , presenting scenes on the
Great Fleet	ORGANIZATION	in the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		`` Groups of Droll Officers Chaffing in the
Ward	PERSON	- room , '' `` Group of Midshipmen Dining in the Gunroom , '' `` A Shore Picnic , '' `` Galley Races , Sparring Matches , and Other Diversions aboard Ship '' some might be called .

		The term novel , and the division of it into chapters successively numbered , is accordingly a bit misleading , for otherwise the author has made no particular effort toward continuity .

		`` The Long Trick , '' `` Bartimeus 's '' first `` novel , '' is a natural successor to `` Naval Occasions '' and `` The Tall Ship '' the one vivid in episode , the other keen in local color .

		Their virtues are the faults of `` The Long Trick '' as a novel ; and there seems to be no real reason for insisting that this is a novel .

		If it is less than that in some ways , it is on the whole a great deal more .

		A studied plan would weaken the natural effect of `` Bartimeus 's '' unadorned narrative .

		The decks of these ships are firm enough to walk on ; the characters have substan - tial hands to shake ; and the same ironic tang flavors the conversation of these enlisted men that marked that of Kipling 's heroes in
India	LOCATION	.

		Now and again , with a sweep like Conrad 's , `` Bartim - eus '' will turn such a descriptive phrase as : `` They passed each other thus .

		The waves that washed over the raft rolled the dead man 's head to and fro , as if he found the situation rather preposter - ous . ''

		With such chapters in mind as that re - counting the Battle of
Jutland	LOCATION	, one has no wish to disparage `` The Long Trick '' in calling it a series of war posters .

		Real artists with clear eye and firm hand are also making them .

		It would be difficult , also , to apply the term fiction to any of the six sketches comprising Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	's `` The Country Air '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		`` Farmer
Jeremy	PERSON	and His Ways , '' the first and 546 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	most creditable , is what a somewhat accelerated
Addison	PERSON	might do in
1917	DATE	; `` Farmer Ferryman 's Tall Hat '' is a distinctly rustic anecdote ; there is a flavor of the sixteenth century in `` A Grave - digger Scene '' ; `` Macbeth and Banquo '' seems , in spite of its address , of its tramps and smells and
South Africa	LOCATION	, and in spite of its title , to be some - thing after the way of the urbane and superficial eighteenth century ; in `` Mary '' Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	appears to be taking unchivairous British revenge on the New Woman ; `` That Sort of Thing , '' for all its banter , one suspects , is chiefly an editorial on the shocking state of British schools .

		There are many paragraphs and passages that would do distinct credit to a book of essays ; there is humor ; there is the grace of wit ; there is distinction in the writing ; there is evidence , even , that Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	easily lays his hands on the materials of fiction ; there is the dispatch so necessary to mod - ern stories .

		But when all is seen , it is clear that this volume lacks what most of us understand by fiction .

		One might say that `` Mary '' is a novel in the making if one thereupon hastened to add that the editor of `` The Hibbert Journal '' is not the man to make it .

		Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	, in spite of the length of these sketches , evidently lacks the `` breath '' requisite for a novel ; and he has the tone of a man too long committed to other oppor - tunities than those of fiction .

		The fifth and sixth pieces seem to reveal one who has rather more joy in the exploits of the essayist than in the successful mise-en-scene which makes fiction .

		Ladies between the ages of eighteen and twenty-eight would do well to move very pru - dently , these days , for they are being watched .

		Yet some of the heroines of printers ' ink are enjoying life more than sensible people can imag - ine .

		The rules of the game are few : an utter willingness , even a fanaticism , for taking a bath is the first .

		If there is not a bathtub around the corner at the end of an affecting scene , the whole business will go wrong .

		Then , it is evident that a Latin quotation in a crisis calms the nerves as nothing else can .

		Another requirement is the presence of a pittance , left by a dying dotard , of at least five , if not ten , thousand a year .

		And last , one must have , like all other paper dolls , an assortment of silk nightwear , for early morning walks in meadows and other appropriate occa - sions .

		Thus provided , the heroine proceeds to trip things up generally .

		The reader will see at once that any one of the novels of
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	and among them his newest one , `` The Restless Sex -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- complies with all requirements .

		It is a perfect Soda Clerk 's Paradise in its delightful details of ele - gance and aesthetics .

		The lady , gray-eyed and charming , makes a marriage of pity -LRB- although living in
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	she really need not have bothered -RRB- but lives icily chaste until the happy suicide of her gifted , but dowerless and starving , husband catapults her into the arms of the hero , the dark horse from the first , as every - one knew .

		At this point all those who are not already engaged follow the example of the happy pair ; those whose marriages are unhappy go back into the repentant and forgiving embraces of their mates -LRB- unless they have first tidily `` ended everything '' -RRB- ; and after a good bath everyone is ready for dinner .


Anne Warwick	PERSON	's story `` The Best People '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- offers just as much pure joy to the
Dressmaker	ORGANIZATION	's Apprentice .

		When a fascinating widow of twenty-seven takes the boat for
Japan	LOCATION	and determines to write her entire set of experiences in letters and diary , it is really only fair that most of the men should wind up by kissing her passionately , or otherwise showing their allegiance , in order that the quaintly beautiful settings should have some reason for appearing .

		Luckily the lady learns one of the oldest lessons that people are just the same whether you meet them in
Brinsville	LOCATION	, or
Japan	LOCATION	, or Timbuctoo .

		Sans hope , sans purse , sans wardrobe , she races back to find the long - neglected man at home .

		`` The Bag of Saffron , '' by
Bettina von Hutten	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , by reason of its fine work - manship and careful detail presents a more plausi - ble as well as a more interesting case .

		The story is that of a young girl , brought by a somewhat renegade and certainly dying father to be cared for by her maiden aunts .

		Her gift is charm , not beauty ; and her passion is that of acquisition .

		Her worldly sense rarely deserts her , and when it does , it is brought back again in haste .

		So strongly has she resolved upon a rich husband that when she has at last discovered herself to have been moved by an irresistible inclination one can not call it love and married to a man who has next to nothing , she takes advantage of circumstances and runs off with the magnificent heart-eater who can give her what she must have .

		There seems however to be a weak point .

		After the scandal has been quenched , and everyone in
London	LOCATION	is at the lady 's door , does it seem quite fair to suppose that upon hearing of the mortal illness of the unhappy youth who failed to satisfy her cravings , she should plunge into the
night	TIME	to reach his side and suddenly discover that she knows at last what love is ?

		Her former selfish - ness can hardly have been changed permanently , one would say .

		The result of her impulse is to settle everybody happily down in a warm climate , where the generous husband pays the bills , pre - sumably , and watches the two young creatures beginning over again .

		Granted he is given a former ladylove one of the aunts it is a little too much to imagine his acquiescence .

		The work - manship , as has been said , is delightful no clogging lists of tiresome details , yet a distinct
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 547 picture of the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	country .

		The characters of the aunts are exceedingly well done , without overdrawing , and the connections of the valley folk , their manners and speech , satisfy the reader .

		It is of course true that American soil is too new to have acquired a deep-rooted affiliation to its dwellers , but that is not the whole reason why so many English novels charm us by their rich - ness of detail and color of atmosphere .

		Con - vincing or not as the book may seem , there is so much beside the lady errant in it that it compels attention .

		It is rather unfortunate that the publishers of `` Days of Discovery , '' by
Bertram Smith	PERSON	-LRB-
Dut	PERSON	- ton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , should have made comparison to that delightful classic , `` The Golden Age . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's group of greedy vengeful little tyrants , unconnected save by an occasional gold-crossed palm with their remote elders , do indeed sug - gest mischievously distorted shadows of our friends in `` The Golden Age . ''

		Not that the book is unreal .

		There is adventure , and sur - prise ; the smell of bonfires , and the elvish experi - ments of curious childhood ; there is whimsical outlook clothed in fantastic description .

		But through all the detail `` deliberately literary , '' in spite of the publishers one can not hold these dogged discoverers to one 's bosom .

		In fact one can not give them a civil glance until the first four chapters have been forgotten .

		A swashbuckling romance in the setting of the time of the French Revolution , with enough scheming and plotting and hairbreadth ` scapes to meet the most exacting requirements , is `` Lord Tony 's Wife '' by the
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	-LRB-
Doran	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It is another successful adventure of The Scarlet Pimpernel , where that invincible hero defrauds the guillotine of its prey , and revenge of its accomplishment .

		The story pre - sents a very clear picture of the bloody days of
' 93	DATE	, but there is an unfortunate adeptness on the part of the French peasants and bourgeoisie to fall readily into the Elizabethan idiom in moments of stress .

		`` The Pawns Count , '' by
E. Phillips Oppen	PERSON	- heim -LRB- Little , Brown ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is a story of inter - national intrigue with the complications ingeni - ously managed in the author 's best manner .

		The plot seems a bit pallid however at a time when the daily press furnishes war news as dramatic as any romance .

		A beautiful American girl in the role of a secret service agent successfully matches her wits against pro-German plotters .


Japan	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	as well as
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are involved in a search for the formula of a new explosive which is juggled about mysteriously among the intrigants .

		There are thrilling incidents , a casual love interest , and a denouement which piques interest .

		CASUAL , COMMENT THE DIAL NATURALLY TAKES GREAT INTER - est in the dispatch from
London	LOCATION	of
May 21	DATE	, printed in our newspapers , stating that Mr.
Robert Dell	PERSON	, long correspondent of the `` Man - chester Guardian '' and since recently a contribut - ing editor of THE DIAL , had been asked to leave
France	LOCATION	.

		For a considerable period letters from Mr.
Dell	PERSON	on literary and political subjects have been appearing regularly every month in our columns , and the obvious displeasure of the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	towards a responsible and well known foreign correspondent comes as some - thing of a shock .

		It hardly accords with our conceptions of the generous attitude of
France	LOCATION	towards complete freedom of expression -LRB- an atti - tude in which Mme.
Fischbacher	PERSON	in her letter printed on another page takes a just pride -RRB- .

		Yet in view of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's expulsion , we are showing our respect for the desires of the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	, as we understand them , by with - holding from this current issue the political por - tion of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's
Paris	LOCATION	letter , written and mailed to us only a few days before the order for his expulsion was signed `` a purely political expulsion , '' the dispatches state .

		We wish to make it clear that our decision does not reflect on Mr.
Dell	PERSON	, who is in our judgment a true friend of
France	LOCATION	, desirous only of assisting her cause .

		Good relations between associated peoples are , we believe , best promoted by allowing every possible latitude to responsible foreign cor - respondents , and in general the more fearlessly they tell the truth , the better .

		Of course states - men may be sometimes annoyed at this frankness , but it is hardly necessary to balance the respective advantages of giving pleasure to statesmen as against the good which comes from a genuine understanding and rapprochement between peo - ples .

		In the final analysis , that understanding and rapprochement can come only from both countries ' knowing the truth about each other , and it is that task of fearless mediation which Mr.
Dell	ORGANIZATION	has in our opinion honestly and sin - cerely attempted to perform .

		IN NOT PUBLISHING THE POLITICAL PORTION of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's letter , we do not feel that we are dealing unfairly with our readers .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's attitude has been made clear in the `` Manchester Guardian , '' from which great organ of liberal opinion in
Britain	LOCATION	, the `` Evening Post '' of
New York	LOCATION	has reprinted ` the offending disclosures in extenso .

		The facts are thus known in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Since Mr.
Dell	PERSON	based his articles mainly on what has already appeared in the French press , it follows that he has said little , if anything , which is not equally well known in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		548 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	THE WHOLE QUESTION OF POLICY REVOLVING about the now famous Prince
Sixtus	PERSON	note will evoke as bitter controversies among future his - torians as among present-day publicists .

		For our part , we can not but feel that Mr.
Dell	PERSON	did a real service to the world in presenting all the facts to the open light of public opinion .

		Many will say that an honorable basis of peace was pre - sented and recklessly thrown away -LRB- as , for instance , the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' already says very plainly -RRB- ; others will assert that the offer was a mere insincere trap .

		.

		But we do know that President
Wilson	PERSON	himself tried to detach
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	from
Germany	LOCATION	: his failure for the moment so to do is of course attributed by dif - ferent people to different causes .

		Some claim that the thing was on the face of it impossible ; others , that the President did not receive adequate information or support from the three leading European Allies .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	was clearly among the skeptics .

		He turned down
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	, bluntly and with characteristic deci - sion .

		He may have been right he may have been wrong .

		It is obvious that not all French statesmen agreed with his procedure .

		It is equally obvious that his manner was not President Wil - son 's .

		All that we can presume to say at this distance is that the Prime Minister of
France	LOCATION	is a better judge than we can be of what was the best handling of French psychology .

		THE ISSUE REALLY NEED NOT BE PURSUED further because it has immeasurably broadened .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	has announced that he stands by
Russia	LOCATION	as well as by
France	LOCATION	which means that
Asia	LOCATION	is involved with
Europe	LOCATION	and that
America	LOCATION	is involved in
Asia	LOCATION	* The fate of
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	is properly an international and hence world - question , yet after all what convinced President
Wilson	PERSON	of Teutonic insincerity was less
Germany	LOCATION	's dubious proposals about the lost prov - inces than her open and flagrantly predatory and cynical treatment of the
Ukraine	LOCATION	,
Rumania	LOCATION	, and the Soviets .

		Against this background of avowed and cruel imperialism , the alleged desire by
France	LOCATION	to secure the left bank of the Rhine seems trivial .

		Yet with all due respect to
M. Clemen	PERSON	- ceau we are bound to say that we agree with President
Wilson	PERSON	and Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	.

		It seems to us that the formal or informal presentation of this demand was unfortunate , coming at the time it did .

		The Rhine boundary doubtless presents military advantages which appeal strongly to French strategists .

		Nevertheless there are French statesmen who hold , as Mr.
Dell	ORGANIZATION	holds , that such an annexation of German soil would leave two neighboring nations still at daggers drawn .

		Indeed , it is far from certain that on this par - ticular matter
France	LOCATION	is unanimously behind
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	.

		It is even less certain that the true interests of
France	LOCATION	would be served by annexa - tions of large German-speaking territories .

		Cer - tainly the answers of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	recently to the persistent question - ing of Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	gave the impression that such ambitions no longer constituted any part in the present war aims of
France	LOCATION	.

		THE FUTURE OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	is STILL IN PERIL .

		She can not live beside a power so treacherous and cruel as
Germany	LOCATION	without the security of some form of international organization .

		And the elements of that international organization are already rallying to her aid .

		Outside the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	and disorganized , helpless Rus - sia , the whole world is rushing to her help .

		May we , therefore , make one suggestion for the con - sideration of our French comrades ?

		Hitherto , nationalism in
France	LOCATION	has burned with a white heat .

		But is that the whole story today ?

		Can we ever forget
Edith Cavell	PERSON	's last words : `` Patriotism is not enough '' ?

		The real guarantee for all Republics in the future will be interna - tional a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will assuredly not be any secret treaty , a confidential scrap of paper , the writing on which fades , like certain inks , with daylight .

		Slowly but surely British diplomacy is facing West and escaping from nar - row entanglements .

		French diplomacy , so quick to appreciate a large and abstract principle , has nothing to lose and everything to gain by admit - ting the influence of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		With the particular relations between President
Poincare	PERSON	,
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	, and the
French Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and people we of course have nothing to do , although it is clear that there has never been a greater need than there is today for solidarity .

		But the entrance of the
United States	LOCATION	into the struggle as an unexhausted factor suggests that the orig - inal Allies , who have fought so gallantly , can safely take a broad view of their destinies .

		Hard bargains in advance of victory do no good .

		They may do harm and create misunderstanding .

		It is the armies of herself and her friends which secure a certainty of justice for
France	LOCATION	, not a private pact with a
Russia	LOCATION	that has collapsed .

		While , therefore , we much regret the loss of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's services as our
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent -LRB- he will continue to be one of our regular con - tributors -RRB- , we can not but think that the incident will do good in so far as it removes ignorance of what is really happening amid the mysteries of European statecraft .

		It helps clear the ground for a straight fight between the democratic and the autocratic principles .

spring of 1918	DATE	, as - suming that it will be understood that such lists are suggestive rather than final .

		550 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 6	DATE	COMMUNICATION `` LE DROIT DE REPONSE '' -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have several times been unhappily surprised at reading Mr.
Robert Dell	PERSON	's letters from
Paris	LOCATION	in THE DIAL and have been tempted to write , either to the author or the editor of these letters .

		I refrained from doing this with the thought that an intelli - gent and sincere American -LRB- as no doubt the cor - respondent of this magazine must be -RRB- could not live very long in
France	LOCATION	without learning to under - stand something of the character of our country and that he would soon escape from the little circle of `` defeatists '' which had quite evidently shut him in at first .

		And I would have thought myself pre - sumptuous to interpose , even by a letter , between this stranger who came to judge my country and the people and conditions he met here .

		However , his last letter , published in THE DIAL of
March 14	DATE	, which has just reached me , awakens in me such deep surprise and indignation that it seems impossible to keep silent any longer ; I can - not refrain from trying , in such measure as I can , to put you and your readers on guard against so wrong and unjust a picture of my country .

		Par - don me for this interference .

		You can not imagine what a blow it is , at the very hour when we hear the shells falling on
Paris	LOCATION	, at the very hour when we are in agony for our men at the Front , from whom in these last days we have had no word , to open an American magazine and find there depict - ing
Paris	LOCATION	this phrase : `` Four months ago I said that the war was nearly forgotten here .

		That is still more true now . ''

		I have not the faintest intention of discussing the details of this letter from Mr.
Dell	PERSON	.

		The `` affaire Caillaux '' forms the basis of it and whatever your correspondent may say , the `` affaire Caillaux '' has little interest either for French women or for the French men who are at war .

		They regret it , because of the shadow which some persons are try - ing , without much success , to cast over the country by its means , and they wait for the verdict which will be given .

		Those who are interested in it passionately , I admit are some politicians of the rear who hope to reap a profit from it and those men who , having lacked the courage to remain in active service , are truly very desirous to hear some - thing else talked of besides that which is happening in the army , in which they have no share whatever .

		These men make up a very small group rather despised by us but a strangei 1 who comes to
France	LOCATION	in war time can very easily be made their dupe .

		Our best men left
Paris	LOCATION
four years ago	DATE	.

		They went away in the first days of
August , 1914	DATE	and many , many of them sleep in the fields of the Marne and the Yser , of Champagne and
Verdun	LOCATION	.

		And those who survive are also far away in a land where Mr.
Dell	PERSON	will never meet them , for if he should ever risk himself there , it would be only as an amused stroller , on a carefully chosen day , in a `` quiet sector . ''

		So Mr.
Dell	PERSON	does not know the real French - man .

		And neither has he been able , since he is a stranger , to enter into the families where he would have found the wives , the sisters , the children , the fathers and mothers who no longer have sons , and where he would hear them speak not of
Caillaux	PERSON	and
Clemenceau	PERSON	, but sometimes of the spirit and always of the memory of those who are gone .


Evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently Mr.
Dell	PERSON	has not known how to see this ; so what is there left for him ?

		Only some little political circles where he finds , naturally , those who have nowhere else to go the `` defeatists '' and the `` embusques . ''

		It is a shame !

		And be sure ,
Monsieur	PERSON	, that you understand the meaning of my protest .

		I do not for a moment accuse Mr.
Dell	PERSON	of treachery -LRB- al - though there is sometimes a very disturbing resem - blance between his remarks and the arguments of the German and neutral pro-German journals -RRB- .

		I believe that up to a certain point he can give proofs and quote articles -LRB- more or less correctly understood -RRB- in support of each of his affirmations , but what he has written is much worse than a direct slander .

		It is , if you like , a hideous cari - cature instead of a portrait .

		The features which he has chosen belong to his subject and it is an honor to
France	LOCATION	that even in her most vital hours all types of opinion can be expressed here but he seems to have chosen the most unworthy and dis - cordant features to the exclusion of all others .

		We ourselves scarcely know them ; they are such a petty factor in the composition of our country .

		What he has given you is not the semblance , but the frightful distortion , of a beautiful face whose true nobility he has not wished , to see .

		If it were simply a question of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	himself , I would not be so insistent .

		Rather I would almost wish -LRB- if he is sincere -RRB- to try to meet him and teach him to know a little about the true
France	LOCATION	of which he is so ignorant not the
France	LOCATION	of cafes and halls which he seems to frequent exclusively , but the
France	LOCATION	of the soldiers and their families .

		But it is not simply a question of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	, whose opin - ions , after all , are of only secondary importance .

		It is a question of your readers , who form a part , and I believe an enlightened part , of the opinion of that great country ,
America	LOCATION	, which is in this tense hour the supreme hope of the world .

		That is why I write to you .

		We have in
France	LOCATION	a privi - lege called the `` right to respond , '' by virtue of which any one who considers himself slandered in a publication can compel the editor of the article to accept his t protest and to print it in the very place in which the slander appeared .

		Here it is , naturally , a question neither of right nor compulsion ; but I consider ,
Monsieur 1 ` Editeur	PERSON	, that it would be an act of high justice on your part to receive and make known to your readers , in whatever form you think best , this protest which comes from
France	LOCATION	.

		The person addressing you is neither a journalist nor a professional writer .

		She is just a woman whose only brother fell near
Rheims	LOCATION	; whose husband has been away since
August , 1914	DATE	; and who is bring - ing up her children alone , in memory of those who are fallen and with profound faith in the future
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 551 of her land .

		It is because she does not speak to you in her own name , but in the name of the thou - sands and thousands of French women who are living the same lives and thinking the same thoughts , that she does not despair of being heard .


MARGUERITE FISCHBACHER	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- EDITOR 'S NOTE : Mme.
Fischbacher	PERSON	should have observed that the date line of the particular letter of Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's which aroused her eloquent protest showed that Mr.
Dell	PERSON	was writing before the begin - ning of the German offensive of
March 21	DATE	.

		His next letter was cut for reasons of space , but its first sentence was to the effect that his own words now that
Paris	LOCATION	talked of nothing but the military situation had come as a blow in the face .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	is not a recent arrival in
Paris	LOCATION	; neither is he an American .

		For many years he has been the cori espondent of the Manchester `` Guardian '' in the French capital , and as such has had exceptional opportunities to learn conditions at first hand .

		He has personal friends among practically all of the re - cent Ministries .

		Mme.
Fischbacher	PERSON	may also be surprised to learn that no one has written with such bitterness towards the `` embusque '' as Mr.
Dell	PERSON	himself , who , whatever may be his faults of observa - tion , does know the French soldier and is well acquainted with his feelings .

		THE DIAL 'S confi - dence in Mr.
Dell	PERSON	is expressed at some length in the `` Casual Comment '' pages . -RSB-

		NOTES AND The index to the current volume is now ready and will be sent post paid to those readers who wish to receive it , provided they will send in their request within thirty days .

		This index is included in the library copies of THE DIAL , but it is the publisher 's impression that few others will be in - terested in receiving an index and he feels justified in saving white paper under existing conditions .


P. W. Wilson	PERSON	, author of `` Pilgrim Sons of
1920	DATE	'' in this issue of THE DIAL , is the American corre - spondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News , '' of which he was formerly the Parliamentary correspondent .
