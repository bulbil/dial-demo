		With the best will in the world , it is diffi - cult to take a hopeful view of the prospects of the art theatrical in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		That the play , rightly considered , may be reckoned among the most important of educative influ - ences , is a proposition to which no student of the history of culture will refuse his assent .

		It has been so in the past , it is so in some parts of the world at the present day , it may become so in the future even for those countries in which the most benighted and degrading con - ditions now obtain .

		As a school of manners , of propriety in speech , of historical portrayal , and of ethical ideal , its capabilities are as great as they ever were ; that these things should have been renounced , and that the art which might stand for them should be content to wallow in the slough of its present vulgarity and depravity as for the most part it un - doubtedly does wallow in the
United States	LOCATION	is one of the most saddening of facts .

		We are not , however , content to dismiss the fact with Mr.
Henry Fuller	PERSON	's airy assumption that
America	LOCATION	as a nation is incapable of artistic endeavor ; we believe , rather , that a people having the English language and Shakespeare for its inheritance is better furnished than any other with the fundamentals of dramatic art , and that the present degradation of our stage is remediable , although not without such reso - luteness of effort as has not thus far been ap - plied to the task .

		It has been a favorite theory with moralists that as our civilization became more settled its feverish commercialism would subside , that the class of those having enough leisure to take thought for the cultural aspects of life would grow ever larger , and that the demand for mere distraction and entertainment natural enough in a population where nervous energy is exhausted in the struggle for wealth would gradually give place to a demand for edification .

		This theory has not as yet been borne out by the event .

		As far as a leisure class has differentiated itself in our society , it affords a conspicuous example of the inju - dicious use of its freedom .

		It exalts athletics above art , it prefers horse-shows to literature , THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, and it dissipates its opportunities for culture in the pursuit of frivolous aims and worthless social ambitions .

		The still larger class of those whose circumstances are such as to admit of a considerable degree of relaxation from the cares of business does not avail itself of the freedom it might so easily enjoy ; so far from aiming at the old ideal of plain living and high thinking , it seeks rather to achieve greater luxury in its living , although at the cost of the lowering of its thinking to a plane upon which there is no room for serious literature , or music , or the dramatic presentation of the deeper workings of the human soul .

		A comparison between
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, as respects the current production of dramatic literature intended for actual performance , offers results which reflect upon us a striking national discredit .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, the two fore - most writers among those now living are writers for the stage .

		The two greatest of living Scan - dinavians are likewise dramatists .

		In
France	LOCATION	there is at least the poet of '' Cyrano '' to reckon with , besides the men who have passed away during the closing quarter of the century .

		Italy offers one contemporary name of much significance , and the like statement is true of
Spain	LOCATION	and of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Even
England	LOCATION	has her present-day group of highly respectable play - wrights , men of serious purpose and substan - tial performance , if not exactly writers of genius .

		The works of all the men here men - tioned belong distinctly to the literatures of their respective countries , and in some cases they constitute the best literature that is now being produced in those countries .

		Has Amer - ica anything of the sort to show ?

		Well , we have Mr.
Bronson Howard	PERSON	, and Mr.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	, and Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	.

		But who would think of reckoning the productions of these men among the noteworthy things of our mod - ern literature ?

		The mere suggestion is an ab - surdity .

		We have poets and novelists and essayists fairly comparable with those of the European countries ; but of dramatic writers , in the European sense , we have not one , nor have we ever produced one .

		The reasons for our national poverty in the production of good dramatic literature are not difficult to point out , but the task lies outside of our present purpose , which is rather that of calling attention to a recent development of our theatrical life which can not help casting a blight upon any possible upgrowth of this species of composition in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A good deal has been said of recent years , chiefly in the newspapers , concerning the or - ganization of a '' theatrical trust '' for the pur - pose of controlling our playhouses , and of practically monopolizing the supply of our theatrical entertainment .

		In the opening num - ber of the new '' International Monthly '' there is an article by Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	entitled `` The Theatrical Syndicate , '' which presents the most circumstantial account of that organi - zation which has come to our attention .

		It is an article deserving of wide circulation and close attention , for it reveals a grave menace to the best interests of American play - writing and the American stage .

		About four years ago , it seems , half a dozen theatrical managers joined themselves together for the purpose of acquiring control of the leading actors and the leading theatres of the country .

		Within a few months the work of organization had become so effective that thirty - seven first-class theatres had been secured , and the cooperation enlisted of a large proportion of the best companies and individual actors . ''

		The essence of the system , from that day to this , with constantly increasing scope and power , has been that the theatres take only such plays as the syndicate desires , on the dates which it desires , and receive in return an unbroken succession of companies , with none of the old-time idle weeks . ''

		To the actor , on the other hand , the system offers an un - broken succession of engagements in the most desirable places , so arranged as to secure the greatest economy in transportation .

		The con - trol thus gained was almost absolute , both in the large cities and in many of the smaller ones . ''

		There is not even a barn free in
Cleve	LOCATION	- land , '' says Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	significantly .

		To the theatre owner the syndicate could say , and does say in substance : `` If you do not do busi - ness with us , on our own terms , we will not let you have first-rate attractions .

		If you do , we will destroy your rival , or force him to the same terms .

		For the bookings we will take a share of the profits . ''

		It was inevitable that , having once acquired the needed initial head - way , the power of this combination should be - come almost irresistible , and that the desired play-houses should one by one succumb , until the present monopoly was constituted .

		Again , the power of such a combination to force the actor to terms was equally irresist - ible .

		The alternative became a precarious se - ries of bookings , largely in undesirable houses , and arranged along an expensive route .

		But for a time many actors held out against the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL combination .

		Among these were Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son , Mr.
Goodwin	PERSON	, Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	, Mr.
Daly	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	.

		The most melancholy feature of Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's article is the account of the weak fashion in which nearly all of these op - ponents of monopoly succumbed , one after another , to the combined threats and allure - ments of the system , and exchanged their sturdy-seeming independence for a supine ac - ceptance of the syndicate yoke .

		The death of Mr.
Daly	PERSON	, who was the most dangerous foe of the syndicate , left Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	to oppose its aims almost single-handed .

		What this means is that '' she may be able to play but a few weeks each season in
America	LOCATION	, or not at all . ''

		But she will have the respect and active sup - port of all true friends of the stage because she represents the most vital principle now at stake in her profession , a principle so important that , if it failed , the condition of theatrical art in
America	LOCATION	will become even more hopeless than it has ever been before .

		For concerning the malign influence of the syndicate upon our dramatic art there must be no delusion .

		Its predominance means com - mercialism , and nothing else .

		It means the same thing for the theatre that the most dis - reputable of our sensational newspapers mean for journalism .

		It means simply that all artistic considerations will be swept away in the mad purpose of coining money from the stage .

		But we do not need to theorize as to what it means .

		The last two years have brought the matter out of the region of theory into that of fact .

		Never before have we had so large a proportion of trivial , empty , and vulgar productions among the entertainments offered our public .

		Decency has never before been defied in so wanton and brutal a fashion .

		Intelligence has never be - fore been flouted by such a parade of what is inane and imbecile .

		Never in recent years has the outlook seemed so dark as it has been made by the conscienceless activity of this league of speculators , with their two-fold appeal , on the one hand to the greed of actors and managers , on the other to the least worthy , if not actually the lowest , instincts of the theatre-going public .

		Is there no remedy for this desperate condi - tion of affairs ?

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	seems to think that the syndicate will run its course and soon suffer disintegration .

		He anticipates having to relate , within a few years , the story of its decline and
fall	DATE	.

		But as long as actors and managers are money-makers first of all , the conditions will remain which make possible our present plight .

		It is not too much to assume that among our actors there will always be some who will elect to be artists as their primary aim , although the number of these is at present small .

		But theatrical management will con - tinue to be essentially commercial until the municipal theatre appears , or at least the thea - tre dedicated , either by endowment or by the disinterested activities of cultivated people , to higher aims than those comprised in the idea of commercial success .

		When such theatres come , as we believe they will in the near future , we may hope for a fair beginning of the educative work , necessarily slow at best , whereby in the next generation there shall be provided a public seeking from the stage something more than diversion , and whereby men of literary talent may be encouraged to write plays , as they now write poems and novels , with the reasonable certainty of reward for meritorious work .

		We have no dramatic literature at present , for the simple reason that a play possessing literary quality has practically no chance of reaching the public at all .

		The avenues of approach are so guarded by sordid and uncultivated interest * that it would be wasted effort to seek them with any work of high character .

		The pass - words are now sensationalism and vulgarity rather than literary art or idealism of any sort .

		WORDSWORTH AND
MR. MARKHAM	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Among the recent notices of Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's poem on The Man with the Hoe , '' I have found that in THE DIAL somewhat disturbing .

		Perhaps the reviewer had not Mr.
Markham	PERSON	so much in view as some of the lat - ter 's commentators ; but the bald assertion that men make themselves instead of being moulded from with - out is too summary , and raises the question whether the necessary qualifications are not of such burning im - portance that they can not be ignored in the references of a leader of thought without mischief being done .

		The issue is not so easily downed .

		Animal content so runs the argument of the quotation from
Stevenson	PERSON	is better than whining , or animal discontent ; animal content can not change to spiritual without passing through the stage of animal discontent -LRB- true enough , possibly -RRB- ; animal discontent is understood to be very disagreeable indeed ; therefore , let animal content re - main as it is , and spiritual content remain confined to the few that possess it : t. e. , let progression stop .

		Difficulties arise here .

		How shall the bodily con - tented be classified as animals , or men ?

		If they are only a clever sort of animals at present , need we be so very much concerned at such wrenching of animal sen - sibilities for a few generations as is necessary for that humanization which shall last through countless ages ?

		But if men , what does all this mean ?

		8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, '' Thou may ` st not rest in any lovely thing ,
Thou	LOCATION	, who wert formed to seek and to aspire ; For no fulfilment of thy dreams can bring The answer to thy measureless desire . '' ''

		Whether we be young or old , Our destiny , our being 's heart and home , Is with infinitude , and only there ; With hope it is , hope that can never die , Effort , and expectation , and desire , And something evermore about to be . '' ''

		Not a having and a resting , but a growing and a becoming . ''

		In the interest of fair play , let us acknowledge that Mr.
Markbam	PERSON	is in good company .

		It will be found interesting to compare portions of the eighth and ninth books of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Excursion . ''

		I make a few pertinent quotations .

		After a personal description which anticipates Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's , the Solitary says : '' This torpor is no pitiable work Of modern ingenuity : no town Nor crowded city can be taxed with aught Of sottish vice or desperate breach of law To which -LRB- and who can tell where or how soon ? -RRB-

		He may be roused .

		This Boy the fields produce ; His spade and hoe , mattock and glittering scythe , The carter 's whip that on his shoulder rests In air high-towering , with a boorish pomp , The sceptre of his sway ; his country 's name , Her equal rights , her churches and her schools What have they done for him ?

		And , let me ask , For tens of thousands uninformed as he ?

		In brief , what liberty of mind is here ? ''

		And the Wanderer replies , in part : `` To every Form of being is assigned An active principle ... This is the freedom of the universe ; Unfolded still the more , more visible , The more we know ; and yet is reverenced least , And least respected in the human Mind , Its most apparent home .

		The food of hope Is meditated action ; robbed of this Her whole support , she languishes and dies .

		We perish also ; for we live by hope And by desire ; we see by the glad light And breathe the sweet air of futurity ; And so we live , or else we have no life . '' ''

		No one takes delight In this oppression ; none are proud of it ; It bears no sounding name , nor ever bore ; A standing grievance , an indigenous vice Of every country under heaven . ''

		If
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Mr.
Markham	PERSON	really beg the whole question , culture is a failure , educational work -LRB- among the non-elect -RRB- quixotic , and , among other mo - mentous consequences , literary journals can not increase their subscription lists faster than the ratio of increase of population among the aristocracy of mind .

		More : republican imperialism , inflated currency , and the like , should in consistency be suffered to flourish as green bay trees ; for these exist largely by sufferance of the ale-and-tobacco consuming class , and to dower it with political or other wisdom means also to inflict the ca - pacity and inclination for whining which will never do .

		-LRB- To the Editor of

		Will you permit one who has read Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, The Man of the People '' with great interest and approval to comment on the notice of that book in your issue of
Nov. 16	DATE	.

		The reviewer expresses himself moderately and courteously , but has evidently found the book deficient in emphasis of the ideal ele ment in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's character .

		Now , it has seemed to others that one of the special attractions of the book is that Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	, while quite as willing to look facts in the eye as
Herndon	LOCATION	, has yet a feeling for the greatness and grandeur of the man which Herndou lacked , or at least failed to express in his biography of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	dwells much upon Lincoln 's humble origin and his close sympathy with the people ; and he rightly makes the power of comprehending the people an impor - tant element of the President 's greatness .

		This power Lincoln shared with innumerable successful politicians .

		But what in the latter was mere cleverness , in
Lincoln	LOCATION	was genius .

		There are hundreds of thousands of '' men of the people . ''

		But
Lincoln	PERSON	was a great '' man of the people . ''

		It is hard to understand how anybody can read Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's book through without feeling that it is pervaded by a noble seriousness , and that it ends in a note that is at once lofty and genuine .

		A BUSSIAX REVOLTJTIOXIST .

		* It is easy to understand how a man who has passed his most impressionable years under an extremely harsh and extremely arbitrary gov - ernment should be predisposed , when the time came for adopting a definite political creed , to favor the views of that school of political thought -LRB- if one may so term it -RRB- which preaches the abolition of all government and all govern - ors whatsoever .

		Thus , a youth bred in the doleful seclusion of
Dotheboys Hall	PERSON	, under the knout of Mr.
Squeers	PERSON	and the brimstone-and - treacle despotism of his terrible spouse , might likewise find nothing especially startling or preposterous in a formal proposal for the doing away with all schools and the summary execu - tion of all schoolmasters .

		On the other hand , people who have passed through a long and san - guinary period of mob-rule will commonly not only warmly agree with
M. Taine	PERSON	that '' how - ever bad a particular government may be , there is something still worse , namely , the suppres - sion of all government , '' but will be prepared to welcome the iron rule of some despotic saviour of society as the realization of the ideal polity .

		In short , the
Russia	LOCATION	of
Nicholas I.	PERSON	bred
Nihil	PERSON	- ists as naturally and inevitably as the
Paris	LOCATION	of
Hebert	PERSON	and
Robespierre	LOCATION	bred absolutists .

		The vastly interesting portion of Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	's memoir which tells the story of his life in
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- embracing about three-fourths of the volume -RRB- renders his conversion to an - archism sufficiently intelligible .

		Just why his anarchism was not subsequently tempered through his long sojourn in free and well gov - erned countries like
England	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and just why he should have gone on dreaming the dreams of Anacharsis Clootz in a British and a Swiss atmosphere of common-sense , does not appear , and we shall not try to explain .

		There is a certain unconscious humor in
Kro	ORGANIZATION	- potkin 's account of his discouraging encounters , as a propagandist , with that same British common-sense which persisted in asking embar - rassing questions as to practical ways and means , and in forcing discussion out of the region of flattering generalities and air-castle building into the region of hard facts and feasible ex - pedients .

Kropotkin	PERSON	's account of how his father , dur - ing the Turkish compaign of
1828	DATE	, won the cross of Saint Anne '' for gallantry '' is most amusing , and explains in a line the status of the Russian serf . ''

		The officers of the general staff were lodged in a Turkish village , when it took fire .

		In a moment the houses were enveloped in flames , and in one of them a child had been left behind .

		Its mother uttered despair - ing cries .

		Thereupon ,
Frol	PERSON	-LRB- a faithful serf -RRB- , who always accompanied his master , rushed into the flames and saved the child .

		The chief commander , who saw the act , at once gave father the cross for gallantry . '

		But , father , ' we exclaimed , ' it was Frol who saved the child ! '

		What of that ? '

		he replied , in the most naive way .

		Was he not my man ?

		It is all the same . ' ''

		Wealth , in the time of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's father , was measured in
Russia	LOCATION	by the number of '' souls '' a landed proprietor owned . ''

		Souls '' meant male serfs -LRB- women did not count -RRB- , and the elder
Kropotkin	PERSON	, as the owner of some twelve hundred '' souls , '' was accounted a rich man .

		He was , as things went then , a humane master decidedly '' not among the worst of landowners . ''

		What , in this relation , one of these '' worst of landowners '' may have been can be surmised from the author 's reminiscence of his childhood , in which , he says , he seeks to recall the conditions of serfdom by telling , not what he heard of , but what he saw . ''

		A landowner once made the remark to another , < Why is it that the number of souls on your estate in - creases so slowly ?

		You probably do not look after their marriages . '

		A few days later the general returned to his estate .

		He had a list of all the inhabitants brought him , and picked out from it the names of the boys who had attained the age of eighteen , and the girls just past sixteen , these are the legal ages for marriage in Rus - sia .

		Then he wrote , '
John	PERSON	to marry
Anna	PERSON	,
Paul	PERSON	to marry Parashka , ' and so on with five couples . '

		The five weddings , ' he added , must take place in ten days , the next
Sunday	DATE	but one . '

		A general cry of despair rose from the village .

		Women , young and old , wept in every house .

		Anna had hoped to marry
Gregory	LOCATION	;
Paul	PERSON	's parents had already had a talk with the Fedo - toffs about their girl , who would soon be of age ... Dozens of peasants came to see the landowner ; peasant women stood in groups at the back entrance of the es - tate , with pieces of fine linen for the landowner 's spouse 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, to secure her intervention .

		All in vain .

		The master had said that the weddings should take place at such a date , and so it must be .

		At the appointed time , the nuptial processions , in this case more like burial pro- cessions , went to the church .

		The women cried out with loud voices , as they are wont to cry during buri - als ... Half an hour later , the small bells of the nuptial processions resounded at the gate of the man - sion .

		The five couples alighted from the cars , crossed the yard , and entered the hall .

		The landlord received them , offering them glasses of wine , while the parents , standing behind the crying daughters , ordered them to bow to the earth before their lord . ''

		The barbarous social system which such stories but faintly serve to illustrate could not long withstand the rising tide of popular en - lightenment .

		A sense of the dignity of hu - manity , long latent in
Russia	LOCATION	, was quickened into lively resentment of the daily spectacle of human beings held and driven as cattle , before the middle of the century .

		The French popular movements of
1789	DATE	and
1830	DATE	were not without a responsive echo in the upper strata of Rus - sian society ; even the dull ear of the Russian peasant caught the sound of the explosion of
1848	DATE	.

		The years 1857-60 were years of rich and comparatively general intellectual growth .

		The ideas that permeate the pages of Turgue - nieff ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Herzen	ORGANIZATION	,
Bakunin	PERSON	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, and that before had been canvassed with bated breath in the secrecy of friendly meetings , be - gan now to leak out in the press and to find advocacy in places where such ideas were as sparks among tinder .

		The abolition of serfdom became the question of the hour .

		Alexander II. , not at heart averse to the measure , saw its necessity , and in
1856	DATE	spoke to the reactionary nobility of
Moscow	LOCATION	the memorable words -LRB- bor - rowed perhaps from Herzen -RRB- : '' It is better , gentlemen , that it should come from above than to wait till it comes from beneath . ''

		The law was passed in
1861	DATE	.

		What the abolition of serfdom meant to the peasant is prettily illustrated by the author in the following story .

		Eleven years after the passage of the law he visited an estate of his father 's , and found a middle-aged man , an ex-serf , `` sitting on a small eminence outside the village and reading a book of psalms . '' ''

		He was reading now a psalm of which each verse began with the word ' rejoice . ' '

		What are you read - ing ? '

		he was asked . '

		Well , father , I will tell you , ' was his reply .

		Fourteen years ago the old prince came here .

		It was in the
winter	DATE	.

		I had just returned home , almost frozen .

		A snow-storm was raging .

		I had scarcely begun undressing , when we heard a knock at the window : it was the elder , who was shouting , ' Go to the prince !

		He wants you ! '

		We all my wife and our children were thunderstruck .

		What can he want of you ? '

		my wife cried in alarm .

		I signed my - self with the cross and went ; the snowstorm almost blinded me as I crossed the bridge .

		Well , it ended all right .

		The old prince was taking his afternoon nap , and when he woke up he asked me if I knew plaster - ing work , and only told me , ' Come to-morrow to repair the plaster in that room . '

		So I went home quite happy , and when I got to the bridge I found my wife standing there .

		What has happened , Savelich ? '

		she cried .

		Well , ' I said , ' no harm ; he only asked me to make some repairs . '

		That , father , was under the old prince .

		And now , the young prince came here the other day .

		I went to see him , and found him in the garden , at the tea - table , in the shadow of the house ; you , father , sat with him , and the elder of the canton , with his mayor 's chain upon his breast .

		Will you have tea , Savelich ? '

		he asks me . '

		Take a chair . '


Petr Grigdrieff	PERSON	, ' he says that to the old one , ' give us one more chair . '

		And
Petr	PERSON	you know what a terror he was for us when he was the manager for the old prince brought the chair , and we all sat round the tea-table , talking , and he poured out tea for all of us .

		Well , now , father , the evening is so beautiful , the balm comes from the prairies , and I sit and read ' Rejoice !

		Rejoice ! ' ''

		Herzen was right , says
Kropotkin	PERSON	, when , two years after the emancipation of the serfs , while the emancipator was drowning the Polish insurrection in blood , he wrote : ''
Alexander Nikolaevich	PERSON	, why did you not die on that day ?

		Your name would have been transmitted in history as that of a hero . ''

		For the tragic fate of Alexander II. ,
Kropotkin	PERSON	expresses no sor - row .

		From the beginning of
1862	DATE	, he thinks , the ill-starred Tsar commenced to show himself capable of reviving the worst practices of his father 's reign . ''

		To me , who had the chance of witnessing the first reactionary steps of Alexander II. , and his gradual de - terioration , who had caught a glimpse of his complex personality that of a born autocrat , whose violence was but partially mitigated by education , of a man pos - sessed of military gallantry , but devoid of the courage of the statesman , of a man of strong passions and weak will , it seemed that the tragedy developed with the unavoidable fatality of one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dramas . ''


Kropotkin	PERSON	's story is a singularly rich , diver - sified , and romantic one , and it is attractively told .

		Nothing more interesting in its way has ever been written than the chapters relating his prison life and his dramatic escape .

		The book abounds in instructive pictures of Russian life and character , done with unconscious art .

		From every page shines the bright humanity , the sincere conviction , the simple earnestness , the sweet unselfishness of a character which we must admire , however much we shrink from the creed it stands for .

		And how few of us have taken the trouble to look into that creed , and to try to discover what there is in it that can possibly recommend it to a good and an intelligent man !

		SOME NEW CONTRIBUTIONS TO
QUAKER HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* President
Isaac Sharpless	PERSON	' first volume , '' A Quaker Experiment in Government , '' when published last year , was recognized by com - petent authorities as a distinct contribution to historical knowledge .

		The same recognition will be extended to his new volume , '' The Quakers in the Revolution . ''

		Together , the two volumes present a clear outline of what may be called the political history of the Quakers in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	from the founding of the colony to the close of the Revolutionary war , and , in one respect , to a still later time .

		Their value lies principally in the fact that their author , instead of following the old beaten path , merely using over again hackneyed authorities , opens up new and valuable sources of information .

		These sources are clearly de - scribed in the preface to Volume I. '' The purpose of the book is to include , with other sources of information , the contemporary
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	view .

		This has been gained by a careful examination of Meet -
ing Records	ORGANIZATION	and private letters of the times , and a fairly intimate personal acquaintance with many who probably represent , in this generation , in their mental and moral characteristics , the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	Governing Class of the first century of the Province . ''

		The number of extracts from records and letters is unusual in historical writings , but their presence , while they constantly break the current of the narrative , will not be regret - ted by historical scholars .

		They are clearly justified by the facts that they have not , as a body , been published before , and that the author has not a work of the traditional type before him , and by their intrinsic interest and value .

		While both volumes are so good , it may seem invidious to discriminate between them ; however , we must confess to finding the first one the more interesting and informing .

Caroline Hazard	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		one thing , it contains a general view of the ecclesiastical machinery of the Quakers , as well as of the way in which they used it to carry on their peculiar work .

		On these points the general reader is much less well informed than he is on the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	doctrines or prin - ciples , and the general tenor of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	history .

		In Chapter III .

		Mr.
Sharpless	PERSON	describes the main features of the organization , produced in
England	LOCATION	and reproduced in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, which was '' due to the good sense and practical genius of
George Fox	PERSON	, and was probably worked out during his cruel imprisonment of nearly three years in
Lancaster	LOCATION	and
Scarboro	PERSON	jails . ''

		The Yearly Meeting , which was the highest organ in the system , was at first a representa - tive body , but '' ultimately became an assembly of all members of the society , the men and women meeting together as different bodies . ''

		To the Yearly Meeting the Quarterly Meet - ings reported , and were in turn divided into Monthly Meetings , the real working bodies of the organization in matters relating to the in - dividual members .

		Next and last came the Preparative Meetings .

		There was also the Meeting for Sufferings , the name of which suggests its function , lying apparently outside of the original system .

		The general functions of the real working bodies are thus described : '' The Monthly Meeting undertook to see that justice was done between man and man , that disputes were settled , that the poor were supported , that delinquents , whether as to the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's own rules or those of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, were reformed , or , if reformation seemed im - possible , were ' disowned ' by the Society , that appli - cants for membership were tested , and finally , if satis - factory , received ; that all the children were educated , that certificates of good standing were granted to mem - bers changing their abodes , that marriages and burials were simply and properly performed , and that records were fully and accurately kept . ''

		We are told further that '' the business mat - ters of Friends were looked into , where any possibility of danger existed , '' since it `` was felt that the body was responsible for the con - duct of each individual . ''

		Advice was first offered by '' concerned friends , '' and if this did not prove acceptable , '' the power of the meet - ing was invoked , and only after months of earnest labor in the case of a refractory mem - ber was ' disownment ' resorted to . '' ''

		The ad - vice of the higher meetings finally crystallized into a requirement for each Monthly Meeting to answer three times a year , plainly and hon - estly , the query , ' Are Friends punctual in their promises and just in the payment of their debts ? ' '

		When we remember the breadth of this jurisdiction , the spirit in which it was ad - 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ministered , the character of the people , and the thoroughness of the regimen , we are not surprised to find President
Sharpless	PERSON	saying : '' Had all the inhabitants been Friends and amenable to their discipline , very little civil government would have been needed in internal affairs .

		The work of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	might have been devoted mainly to ques - tions involving titles , etc. , to property , and courts of law would have been shorn of nearly all their criminal and much of their civil business , while sheriffs and policemen , jails and punishments , might almost have been omitted as unnecessary .

		Indeed , this was prac - tically the case for some decades in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in country districts where the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	element constituted nearly the whole population . ''

		We should have been glad if the author had gone into more detail relative to the territorial bases or areas of the several Meetings in
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania .

		He tells us that the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Yearly Meeting , which dates back to
1681	DATE	, embraced monthly meetings on both sides of the
Delaware	LOCATION	, in
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	, and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and later some in
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		If any reader infers from what we have written that these volumes are mainly didactic , constituting an exposition of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	sys - tem , we hasten to reassure him : they rather deal , for the most part , with the livest ques - tions of the time .

		Moreover , when their time limits are recalled , it will be seen that such questions were of constant occurrence .

		Besides those growing out of planting the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	body in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and the later ones of a strictly internal or domestic sort , there were what may be called the foreign relations of the body relations to the Indians and to the non-Quaker populations that flowed into the Province ; rela - tions to neighboring colonies and to the home government down to the close of the Colonial period , and finally the relations to the govern - ment of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	itself after it passed wholly out of their hands , and to the revolu - tionary government when that came to be con - stituted .

		In some form or other , this question pressed almost constantly for an answer : '' How shall the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	live in a world of which , in some important sense , he is not , and proclaims himself not to be , a part ? ''

		Or , changing the form of question , '' How shall he adjust himself to the society that is about him in a manner that is even comfortable or even endurable , and still remain a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	? ''

		It was a difficult adjustment to effect ; there are few more diffi - cult ones of the kind , all things considered , in history .

		It can not be claimed that the body as a whole solved the problem ; it is easy to dis - cover and to parade their inconsistencies ; but it must be admitted that , when all is taken into the account , their success was something be - yond reasonable expectation .

		A large majority of them , in the most trying times , bore a noble and a costly testimony to what they held to be the truth .

		Naturally , they resorted to some practical casuistry , but fortunately they pro- duced no casuistical system , while the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	conscience retained its simple honesty .

		The most trying period that the
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania Quakers passed through was the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Revolution , which Mr.
Sharpless	PERSON	treats in his second volume .

		To a great extent , the Revolution involved principles that they held most dear ; but it was rebellion against legally constituted authority , it was war , and for both reasons , if there be not only one , they could not give it aid or comfort .

		Touching the trend of their sympathies , the author writes : '' It is impossible to give a definite answer , but there are several guides on which something of a judgment may be based .

		About 400 , perhaps , actively espoused the American side by joining the army , accepting posi - tions under the Revolutionary government , or taking an affirmation of allegience to it , and lost their birthright among Friends as a result .

		Perhaps a score in a similar way openly espoused the British cause , and also were disowned by their brethren .

		These members very likely represented two portions of silent sympathizers .

		The official position was one of neutrality , but individually the Friends could hardly be neutral .

		It seems almost certain that the men of property and social standing in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the
Virginia	LOCATION	exiles and their close asso - ciates , like the wealthy merchants of
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, were Loyalists , though in their case passively so .

		... Many of the country Friends were probably American in their sympathies .

		It is very difficult to show this in history , and only by slight allusions here and there is the idea gained ... There were , there - fore , a few radical Tories , a much larger number of radical friends of the Revolution , and the rest were quiet sympathizers with one or the other party .

		In this diversity all the moderate men who were really desirous to be faithful to the traditional beliefs of their fathers could unite on a platform of perfect neutrality of action for conscience ' sake . ''

		If the Quakers in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	really num - bered 40,000 souls in
1760	DATE	, it seems almost incredible that so few should have overtly taken sides with one party or the other , but Mr.
Sharpless	PERSON	' opinion is entitled to great respect .

		It will be remembered that the body gave to the country two such soldiers as
Mifflin	LOCATION	and
Greene	PERSON	, and such a statesman as
John Dickinson	PERSON	.

		The last chapter is a consise but luminous account of the long war that the Quakers waged against slavery , until , by force of moral sua - sion , they rooted it out of their own community , and did much to indoctrinate the nation with anti-slavery principles .

		There is no nobler chapter in their history .

		1900 .

		J THE DIAL 13 All in all , the story of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is the most pathetic of all of the English colonial stories .

		There is
Penn	LOCATION	's own personal story . ''

		In one sense , '' says our author , '' a sadder life than his we seldom know .

		His letters again and again , sometimes pathetic , sometimes indig - nant , portray the keen disappointment of an earnest , conscientious , and sensitive soul . ''

		He quotes the familiar lamentation : `` O
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, what hast thou cost me !

		About 30,000 more than I ever got by it , two hazardous and most fatiguing voyages , my straits and slavery here -LSB- in
London	LOCATION	-RSB- , and my child 's soul , almost . ''

		But a still broader view may be taken of the matter .

		Great as the colony became , what a contrast the beginning and the end of the '' Holy Experiment '' presents !

		For instance , if
Penn	LOCATION	could have foreseen the day when a governor under his charter , and that governor his own grandson , would offer prizes for Indian scalps , male or female , his heart might well have burst .

		The commonwealth bears two lessons on its face ; one to the practical time-server , desti - tute of all idealism , the other to the utopist , equally destitute of common sense .

		Miss Hazard 's book moves in a much smaller circle than Mr.
Sharpless	PERSON	' two volumes .

		Of its kind , however , it is a book of even greater interest .

		Passing by the chapter devoted to
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	beginnings in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, we have a series of chapters dealing almost wholly with the organization and economy of the Quakers of
Narragansett Bay	LOCATION	.

		It is distinctly an inte - rior study of church history .

		The writer brings a small section of a large subject under her microscope , revealing the minutest facts of ecclesiastical life .

		Much of the matter is curi - ous in the extreme .

		One not familiar with similar facts will here see with surprise , if not with astonishment , the ceaseless vigilance with which the organization regarded the lives and conduct of its members .

		While this supervision was exercised in the name of good morals and sound teaching , it often embraced matters that free communities generally relegate to the sphere of individual action .

		If any reader is in quest of facts with which to prove that the Quakers were essentially destitute of the sense of humor , we recommend him to read Miss
Haz	PERSON	- ard 's book .

		For instance , after
1758	DATE	all mar - riages not among Friends were forbidden by the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, and , as far as possible , the rule was strictly enforced .

		When a brother disobeyed the law , and married outside of the body , he was required to make '' acknowledgement '' and to '' condemn '' his action , or be '' disowned '' in the end ; but this does not appear in any way to have interfered with his married life .

		Miss Hazard quotes several such acknowledgements , and among others the following , which as she says , '' makes one wonder what kind of a woman this man 's wife was . '' ''

		I do hereby acknowledge that I have wilfully and knowingly transgressed the good Order and Rules of the Society in proceeding in marriage with a woman not of the Society nor according to the Method allowed of amongst Friends for which Transgression I am heartily sorry and do desire Friends to forgive and pass by and hope that I shall by the Lord 's assistance be preserved not only from Transgression of so willful a crime but also of all others . ''

		It must indeed have been `` rather a bitter thing '' for a man to present to the meeting such a paper as this , but perhaps it was looked upon more as a matter of form than anything else .

		Still Miss Hazard is gracious enough to jus - tify this great care for the proper solemnization of marriage , on the ground that the looseness of the times required it .

		She says the day of marrying in shifts was not long past , and quotes two instances of this curious custom found in the
South Kingstown	LOCATION	Records .

		One of these was in
1719	DATE	, when the man took the woman in mar - riage '' after she had gone four times across the highway in only her shift and hair-lace and no other clothing . ''

		In the other case ,
1724	DATE	, '' the woman had her shift and hair-lace and no other clothing on that I see , '' remarked the justice who performed the ceremony .

		These weddings were in the months of
February	DATE	and
December	DATE	.

		But , after all , most usages have some reason behind them , and this was the reason in the present case : '' For the object of the curious ceremony was the evasion of debt .

		If the wife brought her husband nothing , she could not even bring her debts , and he was free from paying them , which he would otherwise have to do . ''

		Few religious bodies of equal intelligence and character present more curious contradictions and anomalies than the Quakers .

		The doctrine of the Inner Light , carried to the length to which they first went , is absolutely irreconcilable with all organization and formalism in the re - ligious sphere .

		The inspired prophet is supe - rior to law , custom , and authority .

		He has no need of rule or canon , bishop or church , forms or ceremonies .

		Fox and his co-laborers denounced all such things in the severest terms .

		Of course the end , if it had been reached , would have been fatal to all religious organization , 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, control , and permanence .

		But what was the result ?

		First , an efficient system of ecclesias - tical organization , that , as the reader of these books will see , obtruded itself into matters that are essentially personal and private , though without the use of other than moral force ; and secondly , a formalism that so distinctly marked the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	in attire , speech , and manners that he was known to be a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	wherever he went .

		Fox did show his good sense and practical genius in setting up this organization , thus proving that he was something very different from the ignorant fanatic that most men took him to be ; but he did not show either logical consistency or fidelity to his great principle .

		As is well known , the system was not im - posed upon the body without much resistance on the part of other '' prophets '' who claimed the same right to have '' openings '' and '' to bring men off '' that Fox had so freely asserted for himself .

		It was indeed fortunate that Fox was not a logical man , for had it not been for the system of '' meetings '' that he devised , to take the place of churches , synods , assemblies , and the like , it seems plain that the Quakers would have accomplished little in the long run , and would even have come to an early end .

		We know of no proof more convincing than that furnished by the history of the Quakers of the ancient saying , '' If you drive out nature with a fork , she will return again . ''

		PROBLEMS OF COLONIAL , GOVERNMENT .

		* Mr.
Alleyne	PERSON
Ireland	LOCATION	, known through his articles in recent magazines on various prob - lems of colonial government , now appears with a more systematic treatise under the title of '' Tropical Colonization . ''

		It is perhaps need - less to say that the subject is treated in its practical economic and political bearings , and not in its ethical relations : a treatment for which the author has the qualification of sev - eral years ' experience in the British colonies and dependencies in various parts of the world .

		He modestly calls his work '' an introduction to the study of the subject . ''

		sion of trade and the labor problem .

		Valuable original tables elucidate his statements .

		Two principal conclusions must be forced upon the student from this cool array of facts and figures .

		The first of these is that all col - onization which has resulted in the development of a stable liberal government , absolutely or partially independent of the mother country , has been in the
Temperate Zones	ORGANIZATION	and under the control of the Anglo-Saxon race , guided and always influenced by the Anglo-Saxon system of political and social morality .

		The astonish - ing feature of the times is the curious notion which to-day permeates the English as well as the French and German mind , that in the pres - ent madness for territory these nations expect to see a development of their new tropical pos - sessions in
Africa	LOCATION	along these same lines and to reproduce the same vigorous growth in the
Tropics	ORGANIZATION	which has characterized that of the
Temperate Zones	ORGANIZATION	, and all this with full knowledge of the experience of the past .

		Four hundred years of tropical colonization controlled by these four great nations has re - sulted in the apparent necessity for policies of administration varying but slightly in auto - cratic character , as a governor is always ap - pointed by the home power , with more or less representation of the native races through suffrage .

		There has been no permanent col - onization of the white races in the
Tropics	ORGANIZATION	, and the always limited and unstable charac - ter of this colonization has affected the possi - bility of the growth of an educated spirit and of any desire or attempt on the part of native races to secure any independence of gov - ernment .

		Sufficient representation in local administration has been granted to satisfy an indolent people of a low grade of intelligence and limited education , and the sordid com - mercial spirit has been the controlling influ - ence in the past , with its unspeakable outrages , and of the present , with its reforms , because of the growth among the people of the home government of the feeling of the moral ne - cessity for a more enlightened policy .

		During these centuries there has always existed the necessity of a standing military force of the white races , with a small proportion of the native or mixed elements , to swell the roll of private soldiers .

		Incipient war has generally existed , and the colonies where it has figured least aggressively have been those in which there has been a shrewd recognition of the wiser policy of providing the semi-civilized rulers of the illiterate native tribes with an
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 assured income as a return for the recognition of the sovereignty of the power in control .

		In view of this experience of the past , Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	approaches the treatment of the colo - nial problems in the
United States	LOCATION	with some diffidence .

		After a recapitulation of condi - tions as they exist to-day , he sees little material for representative institutions at present among the people of our new possessions , with the exception of those of
Hawaii	LOCATION	; and even here , with true British caution , he talks about that constitutional impossibility to the American mind a judicious limitation of the franchise .

		In consideration of the fact that in the matter of education
Hawaii	LOCATION	might serve as a model for the world , and that in few countries is the percentage of illiterates so small that the inhabitants have largely adopted American manners and customs , and -LRB- almost of greater importance -RRB- no foreign nation has established a commercial connection to rival that of the
United States	LOCATION	he can see no difficulties in the way of self-government with limited represen - tative institutions but without that responsible government which must lie with the national authority .

		He quite fails to understand our dis - tinction between state and national authority .

		He doubts the possibility of any hasty attempt to carry out this idea in
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	, where , with a population of 806,000 , eighty-five per cent or more of whom can neither read nor write , the mixed blood and Spanish methods , together with custom and heredity , have produced a peasantry antagonistic to American civilization .

		When the situation in
the Philippines	LOCATION	is to be treated , the difficulties become enormous .

		With a population of near 9,000,000 , where not even five per cent can read or write , and where ninety-nine hundredths are profoundly igno - rant , superstitious , and quite amenable to the control of the remaining hundredth , he just refrains from predicting ultimate failure for the
United States	LOCATION	when he acknowledges the shrewdness of this educated remnant , who are familiar with native dialects and customs .

		Mr.
Ireland	LOCATION	tells us he has met with a cer - tain feeling in the
United States	LOCATION	, which he predicts will postpone success ; namely , a pub - lic sentiment that the experience of other na - tions in the tropics is of no value to us .

		Thereupon he declares the commercial prob - lem , or the question of labor , to be the second vital difficulty in the case .

		He recognizes the fact that the products of the tropics are , next to the breadstuffs of the temperate zones , of greatest importance to the human race ; these tropical products are sugar , coffee , tea , cocoa , spices , and fruits , most of which require , dur - ing the important season , continuous labor .

		The ease of life where necessities are obtained with but little effort , together with the climatic conditions which discourage energy , have made it impossible to cultivate profitably any of these products without the maintenance of slavery or an indentured or coolie system , ab - horrent to the American mind .

		This inden - tured system , which prevails in
Hawaii	LOCATION	, is the main problem confronting us there , and every day 's delay in fixing the status of that island allows the increased importation of contract laborers from
China	LOCATION	or
Japan	LOCATION	to complicate the situation .

		In short , he recognizes the fact that if the sordid commercial spirit is to con - trol the management of our tropical posses - sions , as it does that of all other nations of the world , it would be well to disabuse the public mind of some popular fallacies .

		Of these , the most melodious to the public ear is the asser - tion that trade follows the flag , and that trop - ical colonies deal primarily with the sovereign country .

		England , with her supreme advan - tages , can only sell to her tropical subjects ''
seventy-one cents	MONEY	' worth of goods each a year , and she draws from each only
sixty-six cents	MONEY	' worth of supplies .

		This is the result of a century 's work in increasing the purchasing and the productive power of the people of the British colonies ... The
United States	LOCATION	is of more value as a source of supply to the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	than the whole of the British Em - pire . ''

		The trade between the
United King	ORGANIZATION	- dom and her colonies is not increasing , but assumes a smaller relative proportion year by year ; the colony , as it developes , seeking the open market more and more .

		So far as it is possible to judge from the valuable tables presented in the book , Mr.
Ire	PERSON	- land concludes that it may safely be asserted that the flag has very little influence upon trade ; that in non-tropical colonies whatever advantage might once be attributable to the flag is fast disappearing , and in tropical colonies the trade is so small relatively that an increase of thirty persons in their population is less profitable to the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	than an increase of one person in the population of
Australia	LOCATION	or
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The politician and the statesman of the
United States	LOCATION	can not ignore the experience of the enlightened nations of the world .

		If we enter the sordid contest for supremacy in trade , ignoring the great moral principles which we have claimed to dominate 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, our national economic and social system , we will be compelled to follow in great measure the methods of these nations .

		There can not longer logically exist those restrictions upon trade which are the foundation of the destruc - tion of the permanent peace of nations ; and in the great rivalry , compulsory labor can alone be counted upon .

Francis A. Walker	PERSON	's miscellaneous articles and ad - dresses which would otherwise be comparatively inaccessible to the general reader ; and in so doing he has performed a real service to the public , as well as to the memory of his late chief .

		General
Walker	PERSON	was a fluent and pro- lific writer .

		Besides serving in the army dur - ing the war , teaching in seminary and univer - sity , administering the
Bureau of Statistics	ORGANIZATION	and the
Indian Office	ORGANIZATION	for short periods , man - aging two censuses , representing his country at an international monetary conference , and , finally , administering the great
Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, he found time in the intervals of writing nearly a dozen books to contribute fre - quently to periodical literature , from the scien - tific quarterlies to the religious weeklies , and for a time to the daily press , but more especially to the popular monthlies ; and also to prepare addresses for delivery before various bodies of which he was either the president or the hon - ored guest .

		In the present collection the editor has not included everything General
Walker	PERSON	ever wrote , but has aimed , so far as possible , to avoid repetitions of thought .

		The papers composing these two volumes are divided into six groups , dealing respect - ively with
Finance	ORGANIZATION	and Taxation , Money and Bimetallism , Economic Theory , Statistics , Na - tional Growth , and

		Under the first head there are some discussions of the national finances in the period following the Civil War , which have a timely as well as his - torical interest at the present time .

		tain corporations , on legacies and successions , on banks , insurance companies and gas com - panies , together with the documentary stamp duties , the writer considered ought to be re - tained '' in justice alike to the treasury and to individual taxpayers . ''

		On the other hand , he advised giving up the licenses on occupations , the proprietary stamp taxes , the taxes on sales and on private carriages and family silver .

		The income tax he properly called a war tax , but he advised retaining it in time of peace at a reduced rate .

		At the same time , he urged the abolition of certain unimportant customs duties which produced more annoyance than revenue .

		When writing of the census ,
General Walker	ORGANIZATION	was to a large extent virtually writing his auto - biography as a statistician ; but he subordinated the personal to the scientific interest , and was disposed to give almost too much of the credit to others .

		Yet , both before and after taking charge of the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	, he seemed to take especial satisfaction in exposing the crudities and adsurdities of the census of
1860	DATE	, especially in so far as it related to manufac - tures and to occupations .

		There seems to have been no attempt at that census to secure uni - formity of nomenclature ; the same occupation would be reported under a variety of names , and divided up accordingly in the published report .

		For example , those necessary evils known as '' domestics '' in certain states were elsewhere enumerated simply as '' servants '' ; while several thousands in certain sections pre - ferred to describe themselves as '' housekeep - ers , '' and a much smaller number of specialists in domestic manufacture were reported as '' cooks . ''

		But , we are told , '' the considerable States of
New York	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Illi	PERSON	- nois ,
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, and
Massachusets	LOCATION	, had , if we may trust this account , no cooks in
1860	DATE	.

		The universal consumption of raw food by such large communities can not fail to excite the as - tonishment of the future historian . ''

		To improve the census was General
Walker	PERSON	's work for many years , and his experience can - not fail to be of interest to the present genera - tion .

		Some of his suggestions were carried out while he himself was in charge , but not all of them .

		In
1870	DATE	he found it highly unsatis - factory to have the census taken by assistant marshals appointed with partisan motives and subject to no control by the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	, and reporting to marshals already overburdened with duties of an entirely different character .

		In
1880	DATE	, under an improved law , enumerators and supervisors were appointed specially for

		THE DIAL 17 census work , with some reference to their qual - ifications for that work , and from either polit - ical party ; while expert special agents were commissioned to collect information concerning manufactures and various other matters not included in the population schedule .

		The re - sult was a vast gain in both the quantity and quality of the work done , with an increase of cost amounting to less than
one cent	MONEY	per capita .

		At first , jndeed , General
Walker	PERSON	made the mistake of undertaking the very elaborate cen - sus of
1880	DATE	with actually smaller appropria - tions than had been made for the much simpler census of
1870	DATE	; but he concluded that the million or two of dollars which he attempted to save to the treasury would have been a very poor compensation to him personally for the additional labors and distress he thus brought upon himself .

		The impossibility of tabulating , analyzing , and publishing the results of all the investiga - tions undertaken by the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	within a reasonable time led General
Walker	PERSON	to pro- pose that the census proper should be confined to the statistics of population and agriculture , to be collected , preferably , once in five years ; and that all the other inquiries should be car - ried on during the intervals of the quinquen - nial or decennial censuses .

		This would involve , instead of periodical disorganizations and re - organizations , a permanent
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	, which he proposed to create by simply intrust - ing the census work to the existing
Department	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- then
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Labor .

		He was of the opin - ion that a census of the
United States	LOCATION	, being a necessary condition of the federal form of gov - ernment , and depending for its success upon the interest and cooperation of the whole peo - ple , was of sufficient importance to be an - nounced by executive proclamation ; and when first appointed to the head of the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	he asked the President to open the enumera - tion in that auspicious manner . ''

		General Grant was not indisposed to do so , but the inexorable
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	interposed its objection .

		There never had been such a proceeding , and therefore there never could be .

		Reasons were nothing as against precedents ; and so the great national canvass was allowed to begin with as little of ceremony and of ob - servation as the annual peregrinations of a village assessor . ''

		In economics ,
General Walker	ORGANIZATION	was never an extremist .

		He was a free-trader ; but he care - fully distinguished between different kinds and degrees of protection , and recognized the evils of sudden changes affecting the employment of labor and capital ; he was a bimetallist , but he held that no government was powerful enough to establish bimetallism alone ; he was an un - compromising opponent of socialism , but he was almost as severe in his criticisms of the laissez - faire doctrine of the classical economists .

		He recognized that in some cases immense advan - tages had resulted from socialistic measures , and he was enough of a socialist himself to be decidedly in favor of certain extensions of gov - ernmental action for the common benefit .

		Thus , he suggested that a little direction and assist - ance from government would have carried hun - dreds of thousands of immigrants from
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	ports , where their presence was a misfortune to themselves and to the community , to sections where they would have added to the strength and wealth of the nation .

		He was not afraid of the mere word '' socialism '' ; for though he once wrote of the '' frightfully socialistic char - acter '' of a certain theory of taxation , he inti - mated that he would not hesitate to approve of sanitary inspection and regulation if they were as socialistic as anything ever dreamed of by
Marx	ORGANIZATION	or Lasalle . ''

		For such good as I see coming from this source , '' he said , '' I would , were it needful , join one of
Fourier	ORGANIZATION	's ' pha - lanxes , ' go to the barricades with
Louis Blanc	PERSON	, or be sworn into a nihilistic circle . ''

		To the objection against the regulation of industrial corporations as a violation of the laissez-faire principle , he replied that the very institution of the industrial corporation was for the pur - pose of avoiding that primary condition upon which alone true and effective competition could exist ; that combination was directly in contra - vention of competition .

		He agreed with the French socialists that the state might rightfully interfere with freedom of contract to secure a reduction in the hours of labor , improvement in the sanitary conditions of workshops , proper limits to the work required of women and minors , and prohibition of child-labor .

		When he wrote of '' this precious Constitution of ours , which is never heard of except to prevent some good thing from being done , '' he had reference to a progressive income tax ; but he might easily have said the same thing about attempts to have eight-hour laws declared unconstitu - tional .

		His article on '' Socialism '' would be a good starting-point from which to develope a a science of public economy .

		He was not above discussing such subjects with fairness and can - dor , any more than he was above pointing out the errors of newly-fledged doctors of philos - ophy .

		It was only when he wrote of Mr.
Bel	PERSON	- lamy 's '' Looking Backward '' that he resorted 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, much to ridicule , and even in that case he gave sound reasons as well .

		Economics in the hands of this master was no dismal science , because of his broad sympa - thies , his healthy , conservative optimism , his belief in the efficacy of effort ; and in a more superficial sense , because of his saving sense of humor and his happy way of putting things .

		Unlike many economists , he was the fortunate possessor of a very pleasing literary style ; and he had the rare faculty of making even such difficult subjects as public indebtedness and the money question clear and interesting to the general reader , as well as instructive to the careful student .

		There could have been no more fitting monument to his memory than these two volumes , together with the other vol - ume of '' Discussions in Education . ''

		The ed - itor has supplied brief explanatory notes con - cerning many of the papers , besides giving the place and date of publication ; and the whole is accompanied by an excellent portrait .

		THE COMPLEXITY OP RELIGIOUS BELIEFS .

		* One may readily be puzzled by the diversity of beliefs shown in the scores of books appearing on religious topics .

		A rationalizing tendency has found its way , feebly or powerfully , into most of them ; and yet the greatest variety of conflicting conclu - sions is reached .

		One might easily infer from this result that hopeless confusion and inadequacy are associated with all statements of faith .

		We believe a sounder conclusion is to be found in the undying energy of this class of convictions .

		The complexity of the data involved in the exposition of the spirit - ual world is exceedingly great .

		and interpretation of the world about him , both physical and spiritual ; the entire sweep of historic facts and hereditary tendencies which are either buoying up or submerging his thoughts , these constitute the basis of his opinions .

		Faith is the very last region in which we ought to expect con - current or final conclusions .

		The constant return of the mind to the task shows how vital and inevit - able are the forces which underlie all religious beliefs .

		The book entitled '' Sursum Corda '' will be found by many very enjoyable .

		It is a vigorous reasser - tion of the primary truths of our spiritual nature , with a scornful exposure of the superficial convic - tions associated with prevalent empirical philosophy .

		It is characterized by freshness and insight , and will impart new courage to those whose hope is suf - fering relapse .

		It is not to be expected , however , that its presence will make even an eddy in the current of materialism .

		That movement must fulfil itself and disprove itself in the spiritual sterility associated with it .

		As implied just now , each ten - dency is too complex , and , to the opposed tendency , too obscure , to be very directly operative , either in restraint or guidance .

		That to which the author would have us lift our hearts is the fulness and gladness and genetic force of the life which envelops us .

		The flood is likely to leave at least this slight fertilizing residuum a renewed sense of the phys - ical as the most adequate and direct expression of the spiritual .

		The volume on '' Morality as a Religion '' im - presses us anew with the strangeness and the unwar - rantable nature of the fact that men 's religious thoughts and ethical thoughts separate themselves from each other , and are even brought at times into violent collision .

		The ethical law is the spiritual law of the world , and nothing more affirms and defines a
Supreme Spiritual Presence	ORGANIZATION	in the world than this same law .

		Ethics , therefore , should be the support of religion , and religion the ripe fruit - age of ethics .

		While we are astonished at the folly of the religious faith which turns away from ethics , we are also disturbed at any ethical presentation , clear and forceful and needful as it may otherwise be , which is not made to lead directly to a personal belief in God .

		The volume before us has a good share of that discrimination and fundamental va - lidity of thought which characterize the ethical school .

		It is made up of seventeen discourses , de - livered in
London	LOCATION	to the
Ethical Religion Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is much more in these discourses to which the liberal reader will be inclined to assent than there is to which he will dissent ; and it is put in so vigorous a way as to command his attention . '

		l The Great Affirmations of Religion '' is a vol - ume of sermons preached in a Unitarian pulpit in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Sermons ought to be held to a high standard of criticism .

		The supply is large , and the market for truly stimulating discourses is unfavor - ably affected by the presence of inferior ones .

		The present sermons show an earnest and independent 19,00 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL spirit , and that speculative and aggressive temper which is so often present in the Unitarian pulpit .

		The thought , however , is more crude , the expres - sion less exact , the knowledge less digested , than we have a right to expect in published discourses . ''

		The Gospel of Joy '' indicates by its title the prevailing temper of the sermons the volume con - tains .

		Mr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	has , in unusual degree , the essential characteristic of a good preacher unwavering belief .

		When this is united , as in his case , to a liberal creed and to insight and taste , it pre - eminently fits the preacher for persuasive discourse .

		He descends to the sluggish or distrustful listener from an altitude of invincible faith .

		One might offer this criticism that the author more frequently awakens spiritual emotion and brings it to life , than so interprets life as to make it the direct occasion and support of spiritual emotion .

		We need , as far as possible , to turn to those lines of action which call out and interweave the thoughts and feelings in the most self-sustained and living products . ''

		Christian Rationalism '' is a well-balanced and effective presentation , in a half dozen essays , of the points of contention and difficulty which lie be - tween belief and unbelief .

		The work is done from the standpoint of liberal faith , and shows , on the part of the author , a clear and discriminating pos - session of the topic .

		It can be cordially commended to those who are disturbed by current unbelief , and do not apprehend its ultimate drift .

		`` The Divine Drama '' is an effort to bring the parts of man 's spiritual life into a coherent dra - matic whole under the idea of the immanency of the
Divine Spirit	ORGANIZATION	.

		The conception is a good one , but it is pursued in a method so abstract in thought and terminology as to make the perusal laborious and to many unfruitful .

		This is the more observ - able as a fervor pervades the work which would naturally seek concrete expression .

		The spirit of the book is every way commendable , and there are portions of it to which the above criticism is less applicable .

		Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's '' Gospel for a World of Sin '' is an impassioned rendering of the orthodox dogma of sin , the mission of
Christ	LOCATION	, the atonement .

		The author escapes all intellectual difficulties by denying that any final definition of our relation to God in
Christ	LOCATION	is possible . ''

		Its fulness makes it inde - finable . ''

		It is a mystery of life .

		Those are most helpful who waive the logical relation , and give us their own experience of the saving power of Christ .

		It is quite true that the most valued and significant element in the doctrine of the atonement has been the spiritual life that has oftentimes gone with it and been nourished by it .

		The dogma has been the frame-work over which the emotional experi - ences of men 's souls have spread themselves in lux - urious growth .

		There are those still ready to infer the intellectual validity of the underlying assertions because of the force and redemptive power of the feelings which have gone with them .

		This is the significance of the present volume .

		A truly pro- found and life-giving experience is once more spread along these lines of technical faith , hiding beneath it the naked statements which can no longer bear the light .

		The book will give satisfaction to many , and much satisfaction to those who will trace under it their own favorite dogma . ''

		The Christian Teaching , '' by
Count Tolstoi	PERSON	, is the skeleton of a book rather than a book ; a sketch of what the author proposed , rather than the ful - fillment of that purpose .

		The assertions follow each other in close interdependence , but with no effort to illustrate them , enforce them , or make them plausible .

		The temper of the book is one of vigorous self-abnegation .

		It seems to be the pro- duct of a violent reaction against the indulgences and vices of the world .

		Many things are thrust aside which we are accustomed to regard , not merely as sources of physical pleasure , but as an expression of spiritual life and as aids to it .

		Count Tolstoi at times implies that priests mislead the people by deceptive doctrines and rites .

		Whatever may be true of individuals , it is never true of a great system of faith that it rests on an organized effort to mislead the masses .

		What is deception in reference to the people is first darkness in the mind of the teacher .

		Like priest , like people ; like people , like priest .

		If the blind lead the blind , both will fall into the ditch .

		The point is import - ant , for if we regard the error as purely voluntary we shall think the remedy correspondingly direct and speedy .

		The book is one of a noble purpose , and oftentimes of things soberly put with much force .

		Through Nature to God , '' by Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	, is made up of three discussions : '' The Mystery of Evil , '' `` The Cosmic Roots of Love and Self - Sacrifice , '' '' The Everlasting Reality of Religion . ''

		The conclusion is strongly theistic .

		In the line of argument , and in its issue , we warmly concur .

		The work is characterized by that clear and coherent thought which we have come to associate with the writings of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	.

		We are not equally satis - fied with his premises .

		These seem to us to remain too narrow for the superstructure he builds upon them .

		Natural selection , the survival of the fittest , the cosmic process , efficient causes , retain precisely their old relation .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	drank at the begin - ning from the fountains of empirical philosophy so freely that he still shows something of the paralysis incident to such draughts .

		We must feel that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	as opposed to Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	, and Pro- fessor Huxley as opposed to Professor
Fiske	PERSON	, have had the keener sense of what is and what is not , involved in rigidly evolutionary premises .

		The immanence of God demands as much a modification of the notion of efficient causes as it does of the notion of God .

		In strictly eternal and efficient causes , there is no room left for
Deity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Immanence in such causes means nothing .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	seems to admit freely final causes ; but final causes exclude efficient causes , and efficient causes exclude final causes as absolute terms .

		The two , as in human 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, liberty , must blend along a line of perpetual inter - action .

		It is amusing to see with what heartiness the orthodox are wont to pat Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	on the shoulder as a doughty champion from the camp of the enemy whose dictum finishes discussion .

		We think Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	is hardly entitled to the assumption that '' his argument is advanced for the first time . '' ''

		Religion '' is the first volume of the '' Oxford Library of Practical Theology . ''

		The purpose of this library is '' to supply some carefully considered teaching on matters of religion to that large body of devout laymen who desire instruction but are not attracted by the learned treatises which appeal to the theologian . ''

		Its notion of '' carefully considered teaching '' is somewhat rigid . ''

		Christianity , ... as enshrined in a teaching and dogmatic Church , is so precise and clear in its definition and outline that it does not hesitate to state that a right faith is nec - essary to salvation . ''

		The purpose of this opening volume may be concisely defined as a statement of the claims of religion , its forms , dangers , and aids .

		It is the fulfilment of this purpose , rather than the purpose itself , that we are inclined to criticise .

		The style of the book lacks clearness and elegance , and , still more , a warm personal sympathy .

		It seems like the effort of one whose conceptions are natu - rally dogmatic and abstract , to approach the com - mon mind , when not really sharing its experiences .

		There is no want of conviction and fervor , but they have been begotten in a narrow theological realm , not in the large and manifold life of the world .

		The old antithesis remains between the processes of daily life and the divinely ordained product offered for their correction . ''

		Between
Caesar	PERSON	and Jesus '' is the title of a vol - ume containing the condensed expression of much writing and speaking by Prof.
George D. Herron	PERSON	.

		One can be in very close sympathy with the general purpose aimed at , and still dissent decidedly from the manner in which it is pursued .

		Professor
Herron	PERSON	has an ardent but not a sober mind .

		His state - ments are not true , in the impression they make , to the facts .

		He relates the evil , and that in a some - what extreme form , and omits for the most part the vast amount of good associated with it .

		His discourses are pervaded with the idea that the world can be precipitated into the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	by a sudden and radical change of methods . ''

		When Christian experience becomes elemental , individual ownership becomes sacrilegious '' -LRB- p. 135 -RRB- .

		Now , giving can only depend on having .

		If we own nothing , we can confer nothing .

		We can render no service if we have no right to withhold service .

		We are slaves .

		Our service must be the freedom of a spiritual nature which the recipient can not over - ride .

		But if we own service , if we own our own powers , we may own property , which is , or may be , only a tangible expression of those powers .

		Our goodness , our love , can only find play in a world not altogether unlike our own , in which the limits of ownership are one thing and the uses of ownership another .

		We have , in the three books last noticed , a very diverse conception of the world .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	is wait - ing patiently , perhaps too patiently -LRB- are we not our - selves a part of Nature ? -RRB-

		, on natural forces for renovation .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	is urging a new enforce - ment of dogma .

		Mr.
Herron	PERSON	wishes to enter into life by a violent change of its forms .

		What the last method gains in intention , it loses in wisdom .

		We are to work with God , not outwork Him .

		When one 's changes become immediate and radical we - much prefer to wait on natural law .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		One easily forgives the somewhat too constant an d high-pitched strain of eulogium in Miss
Helen M. Knowl	PERSON	- ton 's lively and sympathetic sketch of the '' Art - Life of
William Morris	PERSON	Hunt '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author is a former pupil of this capable and for a long time not duly appreciated American painter , and her vigorous advocacy of his artistic merits seems a little belated now that those merits have had ample recognition .

		Hunt 's diversified life , striking personality , and interesting list of clients and acquaintances made him a promising subject for the biographer , and
Miss Knowlton	ORGANIZATION	has produced a decidedly readable book .

		Hunt studied abroad , and was for some time a pupil of the then reigning
Paris	LOCATION	favorite , Couture , who finally de - clared that his diligent and enthusiastic American pupil had so absorbed his manner of painting that he had carried it as far as it could go .

		Couture was presently supplanted in Hunt 's admiration by
Millet	LOCATION	, then comparatively a pictor ignotus , whose devoted admirer and intimate Hunt became , and whose now priceless canvasses he bought for a song .

		He acquired , for instance , that masterpiece `` The Sower '' for sixty dollars , and `` The Sheep-Shear - ers '' for the amount of an outstanding color-bill of the master 's -LRB- about ninety dollars -RRB- .

		`` I bought , '' he says , '' as much of
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's work as I could , and after a while the idea was started that a rich En - glishman was buying up all his pictures . ''

		The effect upon the '' peasant-painter 's '' fortunes of this rumor may be imagined .

		Millet , said Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	, '' had so little money in his life that he never owned a hundred-dollar bill until I gave him the money for one of his pictures ... When I handed it to him he did not say much ; but he told me next day that he could not try to thank me , but I might like to know that he had never before had a hundred - dollar bill . ''

		It is amusing to know that Hunt 's purchases of Millet 's pictures gained him at
Paris	LOCATION	the sobriquet of '' the mad American . ''

		Hunt 's subsequent career in
America	LOCATION	, especially as por - trait-painter , brought him in contact with many celebrities .

		Lincoln ,
Justice Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Whittier	LOCATION	, Sumner , Governor
Andrew	PERSON	, Dr.
J. F. Clarke	PERSON	, and many others known to fame , sat to

		THE DIAL 21 him ; and his intercourse with the leading lights of his day and place gave rise to a fund of anecdotage of which his biographer has duly availed herself .

		The story of Hunt 's active and checkered life is told graphically and in due detail down to the tragic finale at Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	's retreat , '' Apple - dore , '' in
1879	DATE	; and supplementary chapters re - lating to the Hunt exhibitions of
1879	DATE	,
1880	DATE	, and
1881	DATE	-LRB- at
London	LOCATION	-RRB- are added .

		The illustrations form an attractive feature of the book , and show conclusively that Hunt 's forte lay in portraits , rather than in the ambitious compositions he often essayed .

		Chapters in ^ n ^ * s l earne d aQ d elaborate volume the history of entitled '' The Cathedral Builders '' architecture .

		-LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's importation -RRB- , Mr.
Leader Scott	PERSON	tells the story of a great mediaeval guild of Freemasons -LRB- Liberi Muratori -RRB- , and essays to show that this guild , the
Comacine Masters	ORGANIZATION	, formed a link between Classic and Renaissance art .

		In most his - tories of Italian art there is a hiatus of several cen - turies between the ancient classic art of
Rome	LOCATION	which was in its decadence when the Western Em - pire ceased in the fifth century after Christ and that early rise of art in the twelfth century which led to the Renaissance .

		During this period of sub - mergence of the ancient civilization of
Rome	LOCATION	, classic architectural and sculptural art has been generally supposed to have utterly vanished and died out , its corpse lying entombed , so to speak , in its Byzan - tine cerements at
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		This suspicious break in the unity and continuity of European architectu - ral history has inspired Mr.
Scott	PERSON	to the researches and speculations which have led to his very plausi - ble if not conclusively established theory that classic structural art , in point of fact , was at no time ex - tinct , but was continuously conserved and practised , however obscurely , by the
Magistri Comacini	PERSON	, and really passed without break through Romanesque forms up to the Gothic , and hence to the full Ren - aissance .

		In fine , the productions of the
Comacine Masters	ORGANIZATION	must be regarded , if we accept Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's view , as linking the art of the Classic schools to that of the Renaissance , just as the transitional Ro - mance languages of
Provence	LOCATION	and
Languedoc	LOCATION	link the Latin of classic times to modern languages .

		All the different Italian styles , argues Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, are nothing more than the different developments in differing climates and ages of the art of one power - ful guild of sculptor-builders , who nursed the seed of Roman art on the border-land of the falling Ro - man Empire , and spread the growth in far-off countries .

		All that was architecturally good in
Italy	LOCATION	between 500 and
1200	DATE
A. D.	ORGANIZATION	was due to this society which sprang from a small island in the
Lake Como	LOCATION	, and ramified , under the patronage of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, throughout
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Through this means , architecture and sculpture were carried into
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, and were there adapted and developed in accordance with the new environment . ''

		The flat roofs , horizontal archi - traves , and low arches of the Romanesque , which suited a warm climate , gradually changed as they went northward into the pointed arches and sharp arches of the Gothic ; the steep sloping lines being a necessity in a land where snow and rain were fre - quent . ''

		The well-based and ingenious speculations of Mr.
Scott	PERSON	merit the attention of all serious stu - dents of the history of architecture , and his account of the hitherto neglected
Maestri Comacini	PERSON	-LRB- ne - glected , at least , by most English authorities -RRB- is most interesting .

		Professor
Merzario	PERSON	's voluminous work , '' I
Maestri Comacini	PERSON	, '' has been freely drawn upon as a storehouse of facts , by Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, who is also to be credited with much painstaking independent research .

		A table of the authorities consulted is appended .

		The volume is handsomely and liberally illustrated , and is soundly and elegantly manufac - tured throughout .

		In '' Searchlight Letters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- we ou s ht to ha the most p erful light known to science cast upon dark places , with the result that we see what is to be avoided .

		That , in a way , we do have in Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	's latest book .

		Mr.
Grant	PERSON	writes of the ideal possible to young men and women , of the career .

		open to women of society , of the true American , of evils in our politics .

		In every case he plays the usual part of the searchlight , as we have stated it .

		There is , however , another use for the searchlight which Mr.
Grant	PERSON	has also had in mind ; namely , the discovery of the right channel , when it is otherwise hard to find .

		Here we incline to think him less successful .

		Mr.
Grant	PERSON	first became known in the world of letters as a satirist .

		Time has mellowed what once was almost maliciousness , but it has not wholly changed his spirit .

		He is still the observer of society , who can make its errors ridiculous .

		In his earlier works , however , Mr.
Grant	PERSON	was content with the more usual office of the searchlight ; while now he is possessed with a further ambition .

		He would be not only a warning but a guide .

		Hence his '' Art of Living , '' which is just now republished in the same form as the above , making a very pretty pair of books .

		The earlier volume was one of ad - vice on the subject of how best to live on an income of ten thousand dollars .

		The later book is more generally directed .

		Yet , its critical value is greater than its power of suggestion .

		The sketches of peo - ple who have missed their aim are excellent ; such has often been the case with those who seek to lead toward virtue by an exhibition of vice .

		Mr.
Grant	PERSON	is as clever as ever in his delineation of error , of the city politician , of the society woman .

		But we do not warm up at his propositions for a better life .

		They are very earnest , but , like many other ser - mons , they are dull .

		`` The noblest aims of the aspiring past , '' '' a keener appreciation of the con - ditions of human life , '' '' a compound of independ - ence and energy , '' '' allegiance to the eternal femi - nine , '' `` broader and wiser humanity , '' are not these phrases that we have heard before , and not 22 THE DIAL -LSB-

		They have a familiar sound .

		They are good ideas : we approve of them .

		But we needed no searchlight to know how to find them .

		Even with them , indeed , we may still feel that we would like one word more , a word just a bit more insist - ent on reality .

		Anything of this sort is quite lack - ing here .

		But Mr.
Grant	PERSON	is a well-known writer , and everybody who reads his latest book will have a fair idea of what is to be found within its covers ; we fancy that no one will be more disappointed than we have been , and we hope everyone will gain as much pleasure .

		Miss
Frances Gerard	PERSON	picturesquely The mad King recapitulates , in an attractive volume of
Havana	LOCATION	.

		* '' of oOO odd pages , the grimly fasci - nating '' Romance of Ludwig II .

		of
Bavaria	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is an introductory chapter on the `` Heredity of the King , '' after which the author proceeds to give an account of
Ludwig	PERSON	's rather schwarmarisch character and occasional wild outbreaks as a boy , which prepares the reader for the strangest of all strange historical stories that follows , and incidentally makes him wonder at the survival , in our unimaginative era of hard sense , of a political superstition which makes it possible for a great civilized people to be under the rule and at the mercy of a known madman for a couple of de - cades .

		The devoted , king-worshipping way in which the honest Bavarians endured and even applauded the Bedlamite follies and wild expenditures of this poor lunatic would almost surpass belief in
America	LOCATION	, were it not for our own almost passive endurance of the yoke of such rulers as
Platt	PERSON	and
Croker	PERSON	.

		But the Bavarians never thought of protesting against the political crime and anomaly ; we do protest , loudly and bitterly , and at intervals effect - ively .

		The mad career of the unhappy
Ludwig	PERSON	began early .

		While a boy of twelve he was found by ' a tutor endeavoring , in the exercise of his pre - rogative as Crown Prince , to choke to death with a knotted pocket-handkerchief his younger brother Otto .

		Young
Otto	PERSON	was discovered in a fainting condition , lying upon the grass , gagged , and bound hand and foot , while the Prince was twisting the handkerchief with a piece of stick , in the approved Chinese and Turkish fashion .

		When interfered with by the officious tutor , this precious sprig of mediaeval royalty imperiously bawled : '' This is no business of yours ; this is my vassal , and he has dared to resist my will .

		He must be executed ! ''

		The
Potsdam	LOCATION	form or phase of megalomania has scarcely reached this pitch .

		The author tells her story interestingly , with many anecdotes , strange , tragic , and tragico-comic , down to the final and ter - rible finale by
Starnberg Lake	ORGANIZATION	.

		An interesting chapter is devoted to the mad king 's building mania and the gorgeous structures he erected , and all in all the book must be pronounced a very read - able one of its kind .

		It is profusely and hand - somely illustrated , and should prove a good satchel companion for the tourist to
Munich	LOCATION	.

		Reissue of Thirty-five years have elapsed since Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's the appearance of the first edition of `` Biology . ''

		Mr
Spencer	PERSON	's '' Principles of Biol - ogy '' years that have witnessed an unparalleled development of the biological sciences both in the discovery of data and in the elaboration of theory .

		They have seen the application of these discoveries to the detection of the factors of organic evolution and to the fuller correlation of biology with the physical sciences .

		The comprehensiveness and pre - vision of the earlier work of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	in this field is evidenced by the fact that the author finds but little to modify in the new edition -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , the principal changes taking the form pf additions and supplementary discussions .

		Thus , we find a chapter on metabolism in which the relation of or - ganic chemistry to vital processes is treated at length .

		Under the caption , '' The Dynamic Element in Life , '' the author introduces a discussion of the essential element in vital phenomena '' a certain unspeci - fied principle of activity '' which can not be conceived in physico-chemical terms .

		It is not an independent vital principle , nor can it be represented as a prin - ciple inherent in living matter .

		The ultimate reality behind vital phenomena , as behind all manifesta - tions , transcends conception .

		A chapter upon struc - ture has been added ; and another all too brief upon cell-life and cell-multiplication lays under tribute the marvellous discoveries of the past decade .

		The accumulation of facts has necessitated an entire revision of the chapter on the embryological evi - dences of organic evolution .

		The author 's theory of physiological units is extended and more fully applied to the problems of heredity and variation in a supplementary discussion introduced in this edition ; while a few pages at the close of the book are devoted to answers to recent criticisms and to a brief consideration of new theories .

		Among the appendices we find reprinted from '' The Contem - porary Review '' a series of four controversial essays on Weismannism , a discussion of animal fertility , and a summary of the evidence favoring the inher - itance of acquired characters .

		This new edition is indispensable for all who wish information on cur - rent themes of biological discussion .

		It is a matter for regret that the health of the author did not per - mit a fuller treatment and a more complete incor - poration of his views on the controverted questions of the day . ''

		A History of the Jewish People '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , covering the Babylonian , Persian , and Greek periods , is the third volume in a series especially intended for Bible students and scholars , and hence can not justly be reviewed as a work for popular reading , or indeed for any who have not already gone far in modern higher criticism .

		It is distinctly a scholar 's book for scholars of Bible history and interpretation .

		In his preface , the author , Mr.
Charles Foster Kent	PERSON	, of the chair of
Biblical History	ORGANIZATION	and Literature in
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, states that the period covered in The story of the Jews in exile .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 the work has until recently been regarded as the least important and most uninteresting of any con - stituting the background of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Yet , if action is lacking in Jewish history for the four centuries that followed the destruction of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, modern interest and study have been stimulated by the rec - ognition that it was in this period , more than in any other , that the leaders of the Jewish race meditated and wrote .

		The author does not claim that his findings are in any sense final , for upon many points material is as yet too scarce to warrant more than a supposititious conclusion .

		His analyses of his - torical conditions influencing the writing of various portions of the Old Testament are , however , most lucid ; and his arguments everywhere indicate fair - mindedness and scholarship .

		The biblical litera - ture of the period is interpreted in the light of history , with just enough of the latter to present the setting , and without unnecessary recapitulation .

		In addition to the customary index , special refer - ences are inserted for the use of the student .

		Of these , the most valuable are the list , with criticisms by the author , of books of reference upon Jewish history , and the Bible references , by chapter and verse , to historical events of the period covered .

		History and ^ n * ne P etr y an d fiction for which romance of
Scotland	LOCATION	long has been so famous , Scottish abbeys .

		her abbey8 cla ; m no gmall share of the romantic interest .

		It is not enough to know the history and the architectural motives of these ecclesiastical structures : one must also be somewhat familiar with their traditional and romantic lore , before one can feel the full charm of these pict - uresque ruins of
North Britain	LOCATION	.

		Each has its own peculiar point of interest , some feature or detail which the others do not possess , or at least do not present in an equally interesting way .

		In one case it may be the vaulting ; in another , the majestic Norman work ; in another , the recollection of some poetic halo , as at Melrose '' by the pale moonlight '' ; in another , the site , or the precious bones entombed within , as at
Dryburgh	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dealing with such matters as these , skilfully blending the architectural , the historic , and the poetic interest , Mr.
Howard Crosby Butler	PERSON	has made of ''
Scotland	LOCATION	's Ruined Abbeys '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an exceedingly fascinating book .

		Added to the discriminating and compact text are copious illustrations , mostly drawn by him - self on the spot , together with plans of the original structures .

		Eighteen of these ruins are thus de - scribed and illustrated with a completeness and brilliancy that is very welcome in a field where the material hitherto has existed only in a form too bulky and technical for general use .

		The original Bluebeard .

		Gillas de Retz must have been much worse than
Bluebeard	LOCATION	, if we rightly estimate the evidence presented by Mr.
Thomas Wilson	PERSON	in his monograph on the his - tory of that worthy , ''
Bluebeard	ORGANIZATION	, a Contribution to History and Folklore '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		We have never heard anything worse of Bluebeard than that he had many wives and killed them .

		Of course this is not a good thing to do , but even
Perrault	PERSON	shows that
Bluebeard	LOCATION	had provocation : his wives were disobedient .


Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		does not seem always to have had this excuse .


Gilles de Retz	PERSON	killed no wives : his specialty was the murder of young men and wo - men , and he appears to have done more killing than
Bluebeard	ORGANIZATION	did .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, in giving a careful historical account of his subject , gives no notion of how it came to pass that the mediaeval baron who decoyed children to his castle , and murdered them for his experiments on the philosopher 's stone or the elixir of life , became the fearful personage with the blue beard who had that closet with the horrible contents .

		It is a good deal of a change .

		Taking the book for what it is , however , we may read with interest this study of one of the dark and horrible episodes of the Middle Ages , one of the strange ele - ments in a history that we sometimes pass over too lightly , sometimes indue with too great a glamor , but rarely appreciate for just what it was .

		The founder of
Medicean Florence	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cosimo de Medici is the subject of the latest addition to the '' Foreign Statesmen `` series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author ,
Miss K. Dorothea Ewart	PERSON	, in a scholarly monograph maintains the high standard previously fixed by other contributors to this series .

		Miss
Ewart	PERSON	's portrait of the Florentine statesman shows him as the ruler of the city , not by virtue of hold - ing an important office , nor by assumed or inherited authority .

		Cosimo 's power and influence were due to political sagacity in the use of his great wealth , to a steady purpose , an even temper , and a not too scrupulous conscience .

		He was the real government of the city of
Florence	LOCATION	, controlling all branches of administration , yet holding no office of importance .

		He was called vindictive , was accused of all manner of corruption , of interference with justice , of the manipulation of public funds .

		Yet when the worst has been said , it remains true that
Florence	LOCATION	owed to his wisdom and diplomatic skill all her import - ance in foreign relations , and that the great mass of the people of the city regarded him with admir - ation and had confidence in his ability .

		While there is no attempt to veil the shortcomings nor to con - done the evils in the life of the founder of Medi - cean
Florence	LOCATION	, the work , taken all in all , presents the better side of his character .

		The historian In the
Reverend H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	, of the
English Honorary Canon of Carlisle	ORGANIZATION	, the
Lake Country	ORGANIZATION	.


Lake Country of England	ORGANIZATION	has its historian , its eulogist , and its literary and descrip - tive expounder .

		The latest of his series of books on this subject is called '' Life and Nature at the English Lakes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As in his preced - ing books , a thorough and intimate personal ac - quaintance with his subject is everywhere evident .

		The present volume deals rather with the simple and everyday life of the humble folk living than 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, with the illustrious dead .

		We have here chapters on ''
May Day	DATE	by
Greta Side	PERSON	, '' '' At the Grasmere Sports , '' '' The Sheep - Dog Trials at
Troutbeck	LOCATION	, '' '' A North Country Eisteddfod , '' '' Daffodil Day at Cockermouth , '' etc. .

		But familiarity has bred no contempt in our author 's case , and it is with the utmost sensitiveness and enthusiasm that he deals with such subjects as '' Purple and Ivory at the Lakes , '' '' The Rainbow Wonders of
Windermere	LOCATION	, '' '' St.
Luke	PERSON	's Summer at the Lakes , '' and '' A Sun - rise over Helvellyn . ''

		It is a matter for gratitude that this beautiful region , beloved by the poets , has escaped the fate that often befalls literary shrines , and remains for the most part still undespoiled and uncontaminated by greedy and unscrupulous money - makers .

		The tourist finds the natural surroundings remaining much the same as when the great dead here wrote and sang ; the dust of two Laureates hallows its soil ; and everywhere the genius loci puts him in touch with the thoughts and visions of its glorious past .

		The second part of Dr.
Davenport	PERSON	's '' Experimental Morphology '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is devoted to the effect of chemical and physical agents upon growth .

		The author has compiled from original sources a well developed and skilfully arranged summary of the results of scientific investigation in this field of widening interest .

		The general reader will find in its pages a concise but lucid discussion of the phe - nomena of normal growth , of the effect of chemical agents upon the rate and the direction of growth , of the effect of water , of the density of the surround - ing medium , of molar agents , of gravity , of elec - tricity , of light , and of heat .

		The work is timely and has been much needed , occupying as it does a field common to botany , zoology , and physiology .

		Students and specialists will appreciate this dis - criminating resume drawn from widely scattered sources which are fully indicated in the extensive bibliographies appended to the various chapters .

		The critical analysis of the results is supplemented at times from the author 's own work , and suggest - ions of lines for the future development of the science are freely given .

		The book is thus a mine of information , an inspiration to the student , and an incentive to the investigator .

		The publication of the plays of Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	continues , and we have in '' Carnac Sahib '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- a play which we believe is little known , and which , if it become known more widely , we think will raise the reputation of its author .

		We have several times had occasion to say that the plays of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, however well fitted for the stage , do not impress one who reads them as being excellent .

		They usually seem earnest and conventional . ''

		Car - nac Sahib '' is not a great play , but it has in it pas - sages which are more real than anything of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's that we have previously read .

		That is not much , perhaps , but still it is something .

		To come on a passage or two that give you a real thrill , an opening , as it were , into wider vistas , a feeling dif - ferent from that inspired by the common run of dramatic situations , that is something worth hav - ing .

		One who reads much nowadays is apt not to get this feeling too often ; or , perhaps we should say , is apt to be a little hardened to the usual means of producing it .

		In reading '' Carnac Sahib '' you miss the red coats and Indian scenery and firing of guns that would have been exciting on the stage , so that it is well to have something to make it up .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Those who are looking for an account of the enlarge - ment of American territory , told in a brief and plain way , will find what they want in Mr.
Edward Bicknell	PERSON	's '' Territorial Acquisitions of the United States '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The general reader and the teacher of the history of the
United States	LOCATION	in the common schools should find the little book useful , and will no doubt do so .

		The ground covered is from
Louisiana	LOCATION	to
Hawaii	LOCATION	.

		The results of the Spanish war seem not to be regarded by the author as coming within the scope of his book . ''

		A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry , '' prepared by Mr.
C. C. James	PERSON	, is a pamphlet publication of the
Vic	PERSON	- toria
University Library	ORGANIZATION	, and is printed by Mr.
William Briggs	PERSON	of
Toronto	LOCATION	.

		Although only English verse is considered , the titles run up to something like five or six hundred , arranged alphabetically under the names of their authors , and the notes supplied in each case make the work a valuable one for purposes of reference .

		The total showing is such as to occasion no little surprise at the amount of Canadian verse , and at the number of names that stand for a more than local reputation .

		The 300th anniversary of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	's birth -LRB-
April 25 , 1599	DATE	-RRB- has given opportunity for many pub - lications treating of the man or of his times .

		Among the less ambitious works of this character , Mr.
G. H. Pike	PERSON	's `` Cromwell and his Times '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- fur - nishes the reader with a brief sketch of the political and military life of the hero .

		The book is chatty and read - able , without any attempt at argumentation or novelty .

		The author has selected from various authorities the customary view of
Cromwell	PERSON	, his associates , arid his op - ponents , and has presented this view in pleasant form .

		The second volume , dated
September	DATE	, of '' The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxon Review '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- has a binding after an example by
Derome	PERSON	, dated about 1770-80 .

		The portraits include
Zuccaro	PERSON	's
Elizabeth	LOCATION	,
Van Dyck	LOCATION	's Countess of Sunder - land ,
Antonio Moro	PERSON	's William the Silent , Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, and others .

		While the liter - ary contents of the volume hardly equal the menu of its predecessor , they offer excellent and substantial fare .

		There are stories by Miss
Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler	PERSON	and Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	, poems by Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	and Mr.
F. B. Money Coutts	PERSON	, and essays by Mr.
Silvanus P. Thompson	PERSON	, Mr.

Earl of Crewe	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a review of the affaire

Devon	LOCATION	- shire , the latter an altogether disproportionate feature of the volume .

Mademoiselle Blanche	PERSON	, '' a novel by Mr.
J. D. Barry	PERSON	. ''

		Moments with Art , '' published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an anthology of brief descriptive bits , mostly in verse , about the great painters and sculptors .

		It is a companion volume to the '' Musical Moments '' of the same publishers .

		The first part of
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's new historical romance , `` The Knights of the Cross , '' is announced for immediate publication by Messrs. Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is now appearing as a serial in
Poland	LOCATION	, and the second part is still unfinished .

		FitzGerald 's translations of ''
Salaman	PERSON	and Absal '' and the '' Bird Parliament '' have just been republished in a neat volume by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is issued under the editorial care of Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, who contributes an introduction .

		The family of the late Dr.
Daniel Garrison Brinton	PERSON	have requested Mr.
Stewart Culin	PERSON	of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	to prepare a memoir of the distinguished Americanist .

		Mr.
Culin	PERSON	is desirous of obtaining copies of Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	's letters and other literary materials , which may be sent to him at the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania .

		The '' Book of Seventeenth Century Lyrics '' which Professor
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	has edited for
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	brings together upwards of two hundred examples of the English lyric from
1625	DATE	to
1700	DATE	, pro- viding them with notes and an elaborate introductory essay .

		The work is very well done , and will prove a boon to students of the subject .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's new play was announced for publication in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	on the nineteenth of
December	DATE	, and will soon be obtainable in this country .

		The title is '
Naar Vi Dode Vaagner	PERSON	'' -LRB- When We Dead Awaken -RRB- , which excites much curiosity .

		It is now three years , instead of the usual two , since there has been a new Ibsen play , which whets our appetite all the more .

		A new issue of the Ingram edition of '' The Works of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, '' in four volumes , has been pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		While this edition has been completely superseded for critical purposes by the work of Messrs.
Woodberry	PERSON	and
Stedman	PERSON	, its low price and neatness of execution will no doubt continue to secure for it the favor of the uncritical general reader .

		The Romanes Lecture for
1899	DATE	was given by Pro- fessor
R. C. Jebb	PERSON	, who chose for his subject '' Human - ism in Education . ''

		After a brief historical survey , the author sets forth in admirable language the reasons why classical studies still continue to provide the best type of education for the modern world , and discourses hopefully of their future .

		The lecture is published in .

		pamphlet form by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Journal of Theological Studies '' is the name of a new quarterly periodical published by the
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is dignified in appearance , and the names of the contributors inspire confidence .

		They include , for example ,
Canon Sanday	ORGANIZATION	, the
Master of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	.

		If it be asked what the latter is doing in that galley , we reply that he is discoursing most sensibly and instructively upon the principles of hymn-singing , of which subject so true a singer surely ought to know something .

		The '' Cupid Calendar '' for
1900	DATE	, published by Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	, is an imposing affair , consisting of twelve large reproductions , about 16 x 23 inches in size , of pen-and-ink drawings by Mr.
J. Campbell Phillips	PERSON	.

		As may be inferred from the title , each of the drawings represents a scene in which '' Dan Cupid '' plays a lead - ing part .

		Another attractive calendar issued by the same publisher is Mr.
Frank Ver Beck	PERSON	's '' Animal Calendar , '' made up of a dozen drawings in Mr.
Ver Beck	PERSON	's well - known and inimitable manner , with accompanying verses .

		The first number of `` The International Monthly , '' edited by Mr.
F. A. Richardson	PERSON	, and published by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, has just made its appearance , and offers a substantial table of contents .

		The Kipling Birthday Book '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , com - piled by Mr.
Joseph Finn	PERSON	and illustrated by Mr.
J. Lockwood Kipling	PERSON	, presents the collection of tags in verse and prose usually found in books of this sort , and has the usual blank spaces designed to entrap the un - wary into confessing their ages . ''

		A Kipling Primer '' -LRB-
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Frederick Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	, includes a biography , a critical appreciation , some bib - liographical matter , and a rather useful '' index to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's principal writings , '' the latter alphabetically arranged , and provided with descriptive notes .

		But the notion of making Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	the subject of a primer indi - cates an altogether exaggerated view of his importance .

		Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	, who died at
Baltimore	LOCATION	on Christ - mas evening , was one of the most distinguished of Amer - ican scientists .

		Born in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, in
1842	DATE	, he crowded into his life of fifty-seven years a great variety of activities , and died with more work to his credit than may be claimed by many scholars even at the most advanced age .

		He was first and foremost an ornithologist , but several other branches of science oc - cupied a share of his attention , and in later life he took up the subject of early Western history , applying to it the energy that characterized all of his undertakings .

		His scientific reputation was for a time somewhat clouded by his espousal of certain vagaries connected with '' psychical research , '' but the solidity and value of his true scientific work remains unquestionable .

		As an old-time contributor to this journal , we have special reason to mourn his death .

		From Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	we have received , too late for consideration among the notices of Holiday publica - tions in our last issue , three books of the pronounced '' Holiday '' type which should not go without a word of mention . ''

		In Summertime , '' the most imposing volume of the trio , is a collection of carefully-printed reproduc - tions of Mr.
Robert Reid	PERSON	's beautiful paintings of young girls and out-door life .

		Next in importance is a sump - tuous edition of
Bunyan	PERSON	's little-known '' Life and Death of Mr.
Badman	PERSON	, '' with twelve full-page illustrations and numerous decorations by Messrs.
George	PERSON	and
Louis Rhead	PERSON	, whose edition of '' The Pilgrim 's Progress '' met with much favor last year .

		Finally , we have a hand - some volume entitled '' Hits at Politics , '' containing a collection of seventy-one of the best of Mr.
W. A. Rogers	PERSON	's well-known cartoons , most of which have ap - peared on the front cover of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' dur - ing the past few years .

Kimberley	LOCATION	,
Mafeking	LOCATION	, and other places in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and having had interviews with President
Kruger	PERSON	, President

		Every word in Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's ' On the South African Frontier ' is the simple , straightforward word of a frontiersman who has a tale to tell , and tells it without too much varnish . '

		T is an active , courageous American boy , who has gone out into God 's Wilderness to try his fortune .

		He should have a hearing .

		As a mere narrative of stirring adventures , the book can be recommended to the general reader ; but it is of especial value just now on account of the interesting side light it throws upon the British method of governing savages . ''

SIDNEY COLVIN	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		2 vols. , 8vo ,
$ 5.00	MONEY	net . ''

		They are , in the first place , saturated with the spirit of literature ... One is continually aware , in reading these letters , of felicities of style , charming turns of phrase , of the play , variety , and freshness of an artistic mind ; and these , it is hardly necessary to say , combined with that sense of form which was almost a passion with
Stevenson	PERSON	, are the qual - ities which ruake literature .

		CHARLES SCRIBNER 'S SONS , Publishers ,
New York	LOCATION	34 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, NEVER before , perhaps , in the history of this country has it been possible to reach with a popular novel such tremendous figures of circulation .

		The quantity of cheap magazines has apparently created an army of new readers , and a successful book to-day is probably more widely circulated than at any time in the history of this country .

		The notable books in point of circulation to-day are : ''
David Harum	PERSON	, '' ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' and ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	. ''

		The surprising number of 400,000 was reached by ''
David Harum	PERSON	'' in a little over a year . ''


Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' in seven months reached about 300,000 ; but perhaps the most remarkable record is that of ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' which in three mouths has reached 200,000 copies .

		Three months after publication ''
David Harum	PERSON	'' had hardly been recognized at all , while of ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' about 100,000 had been announced in that space of time .

		It is proba - bly the case that the record of ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' -LRB- 200,000 in three months -RRB- is the most remarkable one achieved in this country by any novel during the past generation , not even excepting such remarkable '' sellers '' as '' Trilby , '' '' Ben-Hur , '' '' The Choir Invisible , '' '' Little Lord
Fauntleroy	PERSON	, '' ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	, '' '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' '' Quo Vadis , '' '' Beside the
Bonnie Brier Bush	PERSON	, '' '' The Little Minister , '' '' The Christian , '' and '' Looking Backward . ''

		The retirement of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	from the ed - itorship of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' and '' Nation '' has occasioned deep regret on the part of those who know how valiantly he has been fighting , for forty years or more , in de - fence of pure government , intellectual sanity , worthy ideals of life and character , and those principles of public policy which made our na - tion great and may yet save it from the moral disintegration with which it is now threatened .

		While we must admit that the veteran editor has earned his rest , it is none the less a mis - fortune that his voice should be silenced , since the struggle to preserve these things which are lovely and of good report in our public life bids fair to become fiercer than ever before , and such inspiration as he has so long given us is needed more than ever in the present dark hour of the Republic .

		We are not of those who would say that '' the struggle nought avail - eth , '' for our faith is still firm in the potency of moral ideas , and in the certainty of their ultimate triumph ; but we should be blind to all the signs of the times did we not realize that the nineteenth hundred of Christian years , so fair to us in the promise of its dawn , is going out in clouded skies .

		Never were we in such need of soldiers , of leaders
Ritter vom Geiste	PERSON	as at this century - end , when the '' forts of folly '' loom more grimly than ever upon the view . ''

		When was age so crammed with menace ?

		madness ?

		written , spoken lies ? ''

		These are the questions asked a few years ago by the wisest poet of our English race , and what he further said of
England	LOCATION	is still more applicable to
America	LOCATION	: '' Step by step we gain 'd a freedom known to
Europe	LOCATION	, known to all ; Step by step we rose to greatness , thro ' the tongue - sters we may
fall	DATE	. ''

		We have been impelled to these reflections by reading the intensely interesting chapter of personal reminiscences which Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	con - tributed a few days ago to the newspaper of which he was so recently the editor .

		Reading these random jottings , there is brought before 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, us the contrast between the old and the new , not in journalism alone , but in several other matters which throw light upon the psychology of public opinion .

		For example , that amazing illustration of the new diplomacy which was offered by Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's Venezuelan mani - festo will be fresh in the minds of most readers , and it will be remembered how courageously '' The Evening Post '' faced the hysterical jin - goism evoked by that indefensible act , voicing with no uncertain sound the sober sense of the intelligent in that hour of popular madness .

		Here is a part of what Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	writes of that unfortunate episode : '' I was curious to know what was to be said for this extraordinary step , and , on the chance of finding some argument in its favor in the newspapers , I directed cut - tings to be sent to me by
Romeike	PERSON	for a month after the explosion .

		I can say , with literal truth , that , among the hundreds of extracts I received , I did not find a single discussion of the matter .

		What I did find was principally personal abuse of myself , and abuse of the kind which one usually hears in bar-rooms or on tenement - house stairs .

		About the highest point reached in it was a story that , every day after the work of the ' Evening Post ' office was over , I called the staff together , and we sang ' God Save the Queen ' in chorus .

		It was startling to fiad that , in a grave crisis , this was the way the American press discharged its duties to its public . ''

		The humor of this discussion for it has a humorous aspect is supplied by the fact that only a few years previously the same editor had been assailed with equal violence because he sympathized with the Parnellite agitation , and for that reason had been roundly denounced as a Fenian and '' an enemy of the British Empire . ''

		The one thing which our modern politicians can not understand is the attitude of a man whose activities are based upon fixed principles , which he is unwilling to change at the behest of a frantic popular demand .

		The shifty pol - itician , with his '' ear-to-the-ground '' princi - ple of action , has become so predominant a type in our own day that the statesman who really means what he says , dealing sincerely and manfully with his constituents , is com - monly regarded with curiosity , as a survival of an outworn way of thinking .

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	says : '' I have never become reconciled to the practice of telling your constituents that if they do not like your sentiments they can be changed .

		The change , for instance , with regard to
England	LOCATION	has been startling in its suddenness .

		It occurred about ten o'clock on a sum - mer morning .

		As a good American , it had for many years been my duty to bring on a war with
England	LOCATION	if I could , and kill as many Englishmen and damage as much property as possible .

		On the day in question I received notice to be friendly with
England	LOCATION	, without being told why .

		Even war , which I had been abhorring for twenty years as the amusement of pampered nobles , I now found myself obliged to cherish and foster , as the mother 's best friend .

		I also learned from my friend Capt.
Mahan	PERSON	that without a few forts and islands and strong places , which somebody else wanted to take away from us , our old men would go down in sorrow to the grave .

		I sincerely hope that there may not be many more changes in my lifetime .

		Few persons are able to stand the rack which this nation has gone through within thirty years , without damage to their moral con - stitution .

		No man can maintain that black is white without straining some vital organ . ''

		And yet there must still be many serious men to whom our modern chameleon-statesmanship , which subdues every honest instinct to the base uses of partisanship , remains a thing of horror , and who would rally eagerly about any leader who could be trusted to think for himself , and act in accordance with his convictions .

		And from many souls in this opportunist age must be reechoed the Tennysonian call : '' For a man with heart , head , hand , Like some of the simple great ones gone For ever and ever by , One still strong man in a blatant land , Whatever they call him , what care I , Aristocrat , democrat , autocrat one Who can rule and dare not lie . ''

		Concerning the great change that has come over American journalism during the past generation , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	is in a position to offer expert testimony .

		The original offender seems to have been the elder
Bennett	PERSON	, and we are given this convincing diagnosis of his case : ''
Bennett	PERSON	found there was more journalistic money to be made in recording the gossip that interested bar - rooms , work-shops , race-courses , and tenement-houses , than in consulting the tastes of drawing-rooms and libraries .

		He introduced , too , an absolutely new fea - ture , which has had , perhaps , the greatest success of all .

		I mean the plan of treating everything and every - body as somewhat of a joke , and the knowledge of every - thing about him , including his family affairs , as some - thing to which the public is entitled .

		This was immensely taking in the world in which he sought to make his way .

		It has since been adopted by other papers , and it always pays ... Even crime and pun - ishment have received a touch of the comic .

		I used to hear , at the time of which I write , that
Bennett	PERSON	's editors all sat in stalls , in one large room , while he walked up and down in the morning distributing their parts for the day .

		To one he would say , ` Pitch into
Greeley	PERSON	' ; to another , ` Give Raymond hell ' ; and so on .

		The re - sult probably was that the efforts of
Greeley	LOCATION	and
Ray	PERSON	- mond for the elevation of mankind on that particular day were made futile . ''

		There is much food for reflection in the jnore general paragraph that follows : '' The steady growth of the
Bennett	PERSON	type of journal - ism , which has ever since continued , and its effects on
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL politics and morals , are now at last patent .

		In all the free countries of the world ,
France	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, though in a less degree in
England	LOCATION	, it constitutes the great puzzle of contemporary political philosophy .

		It is ever substituting fleeting popular passion for sound policy and wise statesmanship .

		Democratic philosophers and optimistic clergymen are naturally unwilling to admit that the modern press is what the modern demo - cratic peoples call for , and try to make out that it is the work of a few wicked newspaper publishers .

		But the solemn truth is that it is a display of the ordinary working of supply and demand .

		Consequently , all dis - cussions of the evils of the press usually end either in a call for more
Bible	LOCATION	- reading in the schools , or in general despair . ''

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	tells us how lie imbibed his political philosophy from the English liberalism of the fifties , when Mill and
Grote	PERSON	and
Ben	PERSON	- tham were names with which to conjure . ''

		At that period , in
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, at least , political economy was taught as a real science , which consisted simply in the knowledge of what man , as an exchanging and producing animal , would do , if let alone .

		On that you can base a science , for the mark of a sci - ence is , that it enables you to predict .

		Since then , what is called political economy has become something en - tirely different .

		It has assumed the role of an adviser , who teaches man to make himself more comfortable through the help of his government , and has no more claim to be a science than philanthropy , or what is called sociology . ''

		His constant warfare against war , which has been so conspicuous a feature of his editorial activity , received its impulse from actual con - tact with the fighting of the fifties on the
Danube	LOCATION	and in the
Crimea	LOCATION	.

		It does not take the sight of many battlefields to range a man of ordinary sensibilities against warfare , or to put him in a position to make effective protest against the sophistries by which the practice is defended .

		One battlefield is described for us , and the description leads to the following com - ment : '' This , and the scenes in the trenches through which I passed that day , gave me a disgust for war which , during the forty years that have since elapsed , I have never ceased to express whenever an opportunity offered .

		The doctrine of the inheritance of qualities , which now plays so large a part in the discussions of modern pub - licists concerning the course of history , inevitably sug - gests that the fighting instinct which lies latent in the breasts of even the most civilized peoples , must be a legacy from countless generations of remote ancestors , who , even after the dawn of consciousness , must have followed rapine and the murder of strangers as their daily occupation .

		It is in these things in reality that war consists , in spite of the efforts of the more civilized nations to disguise it by fine names , and to get God mixed up in it .

		The passion for it , and interest in it , felt by even the more cultivated members of the human race , could hardly be as strong as they still are had they not been infused into the blood by countless generations of savage forefathers .

		It is a most humiliating thought that man is the only animal that rejoices in the destruc - tion of its fellows . ''

		This is plain sober truth , and against it no hot - blooded orator , pleading with whatever rhetor - ical skill he may for the claims of the '' stren - uous '' life , can possibly win his cause in the forum of morals .

		We have done little more than hint at the extraordinary interest of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's auto - biographical notes .

		They ought to be repub - lished in some less ephemeral form , and if the writer could be persuaded to expand them into a running commentary upon the history of the
last half-century	DATE	, while preserving the personal flavor which gives them so peculiar an interest , we have no hesitation in saying that the book thus produced would be one of the most val - uable that could possibly be written .

		It would be a book of sound economics , of acute politi - cal criticism , and of ethical weight .

		It would , moreover , preserve for the next generation the image of a man who has done much for his own , and who deserves the most grateful re - membrance from the citizens of his adopted country .

		MISSPELLING AND MORALS .

		We learn with much regret that the
Congregation of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, a semi-legislative body , has cast a small majority of votes in favor of the adoption , in the
University	ORGANIZATION	publications , of cer - tain eccentric spellings among which '' thru '' and '' program '' are typically objectionable examples .

		This sort of petty tinkering with the English lan - guage is absolutely futile , to begin with , and it creates an amount of irritation among cultivated persons which seems altogether out of proportion to the exciting cause , yet which is real enough to react harmfully upon those responsible for the ill-advised innovation .

		A university is supposed to be a centre of good taste and ripe culture ; this exhibition of bad taste and crude culture , as far as it becomes known to the general public , can not fail to injure the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		As an example of a good jest forever , we note that the argument made by the leading advocate of this '' reform '' was based chiefly upon a quite original theory of the sinister effect which the practice of our historical spelling has upon the character .

		In other words , the habit of writing '' through , '' for example , creates a pre - disposition to moral obliquity which may result in making burglars and confidence men of children who would otherwise lead upright lives .

		To such straits are the advocates of '' spelling reform '' re - duced when called upon to give reasons for the faith that is in them .

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, THE RISE AXD FALL , or MAHDISM .

		* We have been agreeably disappointed in Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's rather bulky volumes on the reconquest of the Soudan .

		Knowing that the author had accompanied the Sirdar 's expe - dition to
Khartoum	LOCATION	partly as a press corre - spondent , we were prepared to find in them merely an elaborately garnished rechauffe of his letters from the front .

		Passages from those letters , it is true , are reproduced passim in the chapters detailing military operations which the writer saw and shared in as an officer in the Twenty-first Lancers , and these have the merit which the writer claims for them of re - flecting the actual impressions of exciting scenes and events .

		But the letters by no means form the substance or the more valuable portion of the text .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's book is a sober and pains - taking attempt to write , fully and impartially , and in the light of the best information obtain - able , the history of the rise , decline , and fall of Mahdism .

		In order that the reader may understand and fairly judge this singular and by no means indefensible and purely fanatical movement , and grasp the significance of the more recent and familiar events flowing from it , the author has prefixed to his main narra - tive a general survey of the history , population , and geography of the Egyptian Soudan .

		This summary , which contains a sketch of the Prophet and his lieutenant and successor the
Khalifa Abdullahi	PERSON	, an account of the origin , spread , character , and triumph of Mahdism , of the Dervish - Abyssinian war , of
Gordon	PERSON	's ill - starred mission to
Khartoum	LOCATION	, etc. , occupies five chapters , which we venture to say the un - military reader will regard as the most inter - esting in the book .

		At any rate , we must warmly commend the liberal and impartial spirit , and the dignified yet spirited style , in which they are written .

		Chapter V. is devoted to the years of Anglo-Egyptian preparation which resulted in the transformation of the once worthless and derided Egyptian '' army '' into an effective sword of reconquest which , in the iron hand of
Lord Kitchener	LOCATION	, was to do such awful , if perhaps in the long run not insalutary , work at
Omdurman	LOCATION	.

		Chapters VI. , VII. , and
VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		relate the beginnings of hostilities , the demonstrations on the frontier , the taking of Firket , the recovery of the
Dongola	LOCATION	province .

		With chapter IX .

		the main thread of the narrative of the River War proper is taken up .

		We are , of course , unable to vouch for the technical accuracy of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's account of the Soudan campaign , but that he has been at great pains to secure it is evident .

		The graphic force of his descriptions of the several engagements with the Dervishes is undeniable ; and we take pleasure in saying that his brilliant account of the battle -LRB- if one may so term it -RRB- of Omdur - man is commendably free from the spirit of national vainglory , and from the jaunty affec - tation of soldierly callousness to the horrors and perils of the battlefield that disfigures the pages of several of his literary predecessors .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	recognizes the fact that it was with the vanquished , rather than with the victors , at
Omdurman	LOCATION	that the palm of valor lay ; and he concludes : '' But when all this has been said , the mind turns with disgust from the spectacle of unequal slaughter .

		The name of the battle , blazoned on the colors , preserves for future generations the memory of a successful expedi - tion .

		Regiments may exult in the part they played .

		Military experts may draw instruction from the sur - prising demonstration of the power of modern weapons .

		But the individual soldier will carry from the field only a very transient satisfaction , and the ' glory of Omdur - man ' will seem to anyone who may five years hence read this book a very absurd expression . ''

		Such moderation as this may well mollify the critic who might otherwise take a malicious satisfaction in pointing out how signally the bubble of British military prestige blown in the Soudan has now been pricked by the em - battled farmers of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		To the Fashoda incident the author devotes a temperate and well-considered chapter .

		The work concludes with a thoughtful general view of the field already traversed in detail , and some interesting observations are offered touch - ing the present condition and needs of the Soudan , and its possible future .

		The several Appendices will chiefly interest the military reader .

		A word now as to
Mahdism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Soudanese are of many tribes , but there are two main races : the aboriginal natives , or negroes as black as coal , and the Arab immigrants , who
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 since the military invasion of the second cen - tury of the
Mohammedan	DATE	era have been filter - ing into the country , and spreading everywhere their blood , religion , language , and ideas .

		The negroes are the more numerous , but the Arabs form the dominant race .

		Between these ex - treme types every degree of mixture is to be found ; and in the districts to the north a long period of interbreeding has formed a mongrel but distinct race , which is neither negro nor Arab , but a debased blend of the racial char - acteristics of both .

		It is needless to say that the Arab not only thus commingled with his black neighbors and turned them to the faith of Islam , but hunted and harried them and sold them into slavery .

		Slave-hunting was the great curse of the Soudan , the source of the wealth of the rich and powerful Sheikhs of men like Zubair ,
Africa	LOCATION	's premier slave-dealer , the '' abandoned ruffian '' whose aid in
1884	DATE	the '' Christian hero ''
Gordon	PERSON	, backed by the British representative in
Egypt	LOCATION	and by every - body else with a competent knowledge of local conditions , craved , and the
Gladstone Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, with a fatal and short-sighted purism , spurned .

		To the curse of slave-hunting was added that of ceaseless intertribal war ; and in
1819 Egypt	LOCATION	, determining to avail herself of the dis - orders in the regions to the south , sent an army of conquest up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, under
Mahomet Ali	ORGANIZATION	.

		Organized resistance to the invader was impos - sible ; and to the old darkness of barbarism and internal chaos succeeded the black night of Egyptian misrule .

		The rapacious Pashas and their cruel and worthless army of forty thousand men settled like locusts upon the already impoverished land , and its few green oases speedily became bare and desolate places like the rest .

		The substance of the country was drained away to support the imperial pleas - ures of the Khedives and their corrupt procon - suls . ''

		The government of the Egyptians , '' wrote
Gordon	PERSON	in
1879	DATE	, '' in those far-off coun - tries is nothing else but one of brigandage of the very worst description . ''

		The ability of the tribes to meet fiscal extortion depended mainly on their success as slave-hunters .

		When there had been a good '' catch , '' they could pay ; when not , they were harried by the Imperial troops , their scanty means of subsistance were wrung from them , and their women were drafted away to the harems of the Pashas .

		* The fact that the Egyptian government , nom - * '' In one district the commander of the troops was carry - ing off not only the flocks and herds of the natives , but their young girls . ''

		inally a member of the
International League	ORGANIZATION	against the slave trade , was indirectly its main supporter and beneficiary , dawned upon the European Powers ; and in
1874	DATE	the
Khedive Ismail	LOCATION	was forced to appoint
Gordon Governor	PERSON	of the
Equatorial Province	LOCATION	.

		Then for the first time the Soudanese saw the face of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gordon broke the league of the slave-dealers , and at the end of
1879	DATE	left the Soudan .

		His reforms had sown the seed of revolution .

		The Soudanese , embittered by the abominations of Egyptian misrule , had now caught a glimpse of the possibility of better things .

		Perhaps they had an inkling , too , of the inherent feeble - ness of the force '' that had so long held them down .

		As separate tribal units , they were ripe for revolt ; but to the success of a revolt some principle of general cohesion , some common enthusiasm , some dominant cynosural personal - ity to whom all would spontaneously look for light and leadership , was essential .

		With the necessity came the idea , and the man .

		The Shuki belief , prevalent in
Nubia	LOCATION	, fore - told the advent , in a day of special shame and trouble , of a second great Prophet a
Mahdi	PERSON	who should lead the people nearer God and restore the ghostly and temporal empire of Islam .

		Thus , the tribes of the Soudan had been long used to look in anxious inquiry to any ascetic of special repute for sanctity , as to the Promised One , when the fame of a certain holy man , Mohammed Ahmed of
Dongola	LOCATION	, began , about the period of
Gordon	PERSON	's departure , to fill the land .

		Men spoke of his pious aus - terities , of his reforming zeal , of his fiery ex - hortations to the faithful and his bold denun - ciation of the lax practice of his spiritual chief , of his gifts to the poor , who loudly acclaimed him as '' Zahed , '' or renouncer of carnal joys and material cravings .

		Pilgrims from afar began to resort to his sequestered retreat , a cave hollowed out in the mud bank of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	where he spent his days in prayer and fasting .

		As his fame grew , and the possibilities of his hold upon the imagination of his countrymen dawned upon him , Mohammed Ahmed emerged from his seclusion and began his apostolate among the more distant tribes .

		He journeyed preaching through
Kordofan	LOCATION	, and received the homage of priesthood and people .

		In fine , by the year
1881	DATE	the high repute of Mohammed Ahmed had ripened into a widespread popular conviction -LRB- which he took care to foster and which he may even have partially shared -RRB- that he was none other than the mystic Expected One , the inspired
Mahdi	PERSON	whose mission it was 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, to purify Islam and lift the Egyptian yoke from the neck of the people .

		To Mohammed Ahmed there latterly joined himself a crafty and experienced secular adherent and shrewd political adviser ,
Abdullahi	PERSON	, the future Khalifa . ''

		The two formed a strong combination .

		The Maluli for such Mohammed Ahmed had already announced himself brought the wild enthusiasm of religion , the glamor of a stainless life , and the influence of supersti - tion into the movement .

		But if he was the soul of the plot ,
Abdullahi	PERSON	was the brain .

		He was the man of the world , the practical politician , the general . ''

		Then began and ripened apace the great conspiracy which resulted in defeat after defeat of the effete soldiery of the Khedive at the hands of the devoted tribesmen , and eventually in the Egyptian evacuation of the Soudan .

		With such dramatic and bloody intervening episodes as the rout of
Hicks Pasha	PERSON	and the fate of
Gordon	LOCATION	, every reader is familiar .

		What is now important to note is that the often mis - judged and misrepresented movement called Mahdism was not essentially and originally a mere wild wave of religious fanaticism worked up by an impostor , but the righteous revolt of an oppressed people of `` a people rightly struggling to be free '' against the corrupt rule of an alien tyrant .

		Says Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	: '' Looking at the question from a purely political standpoint , we may say that upon the whole there ex - ists no record of a better case for rebellion than that which presented itself to the Soudanese . ''

		There was , it is plain , a blend of wild and cruel religious fanaticism in the Mahdist up - rising , a tincture of imposture in the ways of its Prophet .

		But the revolt was primarily a political and perfectly justifiable one , and its leader was , as we believe , essentially a patriot .

		Let us be just to
Mohammed Ahmed	PERSON	, who acted in the main conscientiously according to his lights , and who in the day of sore national need and distress lit in the breasts of his scat - tered and discordant fellow-countrymen a com - mon flame of patriotic and religious enthusiasm that swept them as a resistless unit against the general foe .

		We find little difficulty in agree - ing with Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	that , '' If in future years prosperity should come to the peo - ples of the
Upper Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and learning and happiness fol - low in its train , then the first Arab historian who shall investigate the annals of that new nation will not forget , foremost among the heroes of his race , to write the name of Mohammed Ahmed . ''

		The
Mahdi	PERSON	did not long live to enjoy his tri - umphs .

		A few months after the completion of his campaigns , the God , as Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	poetic - ally puts it , '' whom he had served , not unfaith - fully , and who had given him whatever he asked , required of Mohammed Ahmed his soul . ''

		Then ensued in the land he had purged of the Egyptians the grinding tyranny of the
Khalifa	LOCATION	, of all the military dominations which have cursed the earth probably , the author thinks , '' the worst . ''

		For nearly thirteen years the country endured an oppression as grievous as that of the Pashas ; but the despotism was indi - genous , it had a color of legitimacy , and the people , while they suffered and dwindled , ac - quiesced .

		Left to themselves , they might in time have evolved a semblance of a well-ordered state .

		It is optimistic to think so .

		But the process of evolution must have been a slow and painful one .

		As fate willed it , they were roughly thrust by an alien hand into a short cut to the ways of civilization .

		The Peace of
England	LOCATION	reigns in the Soudan ; as in the days of
Gordon	LOCATION	, the Soudanese sees the face of Jus - tice .

		Deploring the necessity of a cruel means to a good end , one may still find it for the best that the Dervish Empire went down in blood and irretrievable ruin at
Omdurman	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 43 republics and the great British Empire .

		The second subject for thought lies in the unsus - pected points of contact revealed between the history of these republics in
Africa	LOCATION	and the his - tory of the republic to which we owe our duty in
America	LOCATION	.

		The Dutch in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	are the Dutch of the
New Netherland	LOCATION	, and the French of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	are the Huguenots of the Jerseys ; their religion is the Puritanism of
New England	LOCATION	and of the Dutch Reformed Churches of
New York	LOCATION	; their government is avowedly based upon the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	; even the war of
1778	DATE	, in which the Dutch lost their title to the
Cape	LOCATION	, was brought on largely by the treaty of amity entered into between
Amsterdam	LOCATION	and the revolted provinces of
North America	LOCATION	, and the British occupation of
Natal	ORGANIZATION	in
1842	DATE	was in part due to the rumored occupation of the port of
Durban	LOCATION	by the Amer - icans .

		The third reflection is the sorrowful one that
England	LOCATION	's success here , inevitable when the potentialities of the two republics and the great empire are considered , is to be brought about through a war which was the sole result of greed and criminal aggression , and when attained will be such a blow to the civilization which demands Christian morality and right - dealing between nations as between individuals , such a striking down of government by consent and the rearing in its stead of government by force , as the modern world has not seen since the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		And , finally , since the Dutch are in the great majority in
South Africa	LOCATION	and are increasing relatively , while the British are in the minority and are decreasing , when victory is at last attained it must stand for one of two things : either
Great Britain	LOCATION	must grant constitutional government to coun - tries in which the Dutch are dominant , which means that her victory is fruitless ; or
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the exponent of popular freedom , must rule an unwilling white majority by force , with the object-lesson of
Ireland	LOCATION	before her eyes .

		In either event civilization suffers , as
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons ought to understand the word .

		The first and most inclusive of these recent books is the fourth volume of '' A Historical Geography of the British Colonies , '' by Mr.
C. P. Lucas	PERSON	, devoted to South and
East Africa	LOCATION	.

		It is a brief academic treatment of the subject , written from a strictly British point of view , but with great impartiality .

		There is little re - flection , and that in the nature of a formal com - parison between the British and the ancient Roman empires ; while the space devoted to the historical section does not permit any en - tering into minute detail .

		A second part of the book is geographical , useful for the statis - tician and student of current events in British territory , but limited to the colonies under the British flag .

		Writing fully three years ago , Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	proves himself wiser than his gov - ernment and its military authorities , in such sentences as this : '' To students of military history ,
South Africa	LOCATION	has something to tell .

		The moral to be drawn from the record of South African fighting is that it is not well to go out in all the approved panoply of European war - fare against those who are armed with simple or with savage weapons .

		We read anew in
South Africa	LOCATION	the story of
David	PERSON	and Goliath , and learn that if Goliath had gone out with something akin to the sling and the stone , he would have done better than when clad in his full suit of armour . ''

		And the essence of the matter is in this , bear - ing in mind that
Britain	LOCATION	has involved herself in all her present difficulties in the face of re - peated warnings from the loyal people of the
Cape	LOCATION	and of Natal : '' Where there are still the remains of savagery , where the old is very tenacious and the new very ag - gressive , where a great dominion and a nation are in making , with diverse elements in diverse stages , it is not only foolish to interpret men and events in the light of our own firesides , it is untrue to the facts and there - fore wrong .

		It is not so much
England	LOCATION	or the English Government that has made
South Africa	LOCATION	, as the men on the spot , the English and the Dutch , who have lived and worked in and for the land , who have seen the things whereof we read in Blue Books or newspapers , not in a glass darkly but face to face . ''

		The author of '' The Story of the Great Boer Trek , '' the late Hon.
Henry Cloete	PERSON	, was
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's High Commissioner to
Natal	ORGANIZATION	, and the latter part of his book tells of the manner in which the British took possession of that territory after distinctly refusing it , and after the
Boers	PERSON	had made existence in it possible by conquest of the savage blacks who had kept the present owners of the country out .

		The first three of the five chapters of the book , however , are devoted to the causes which led to the general emigration of the Dutch , gener - ally known as the Great Trek , and the conse - quent foundation of the South African Repub - lic and the
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	.

		They gain in importance from being lectures delivered soon after the event before a mixed audience of Dutch and English in
South Africa	LOCATION	, by a per - son who had official connection with the sub - jects on which he discoursed .

		It is hardly necessary to go into the details of a matter already sixty-four years old , but it may be said that
Cloete	PERSON	has no scruple in holding the Brit - ish
Colonial Office	ORGANIZATION	guilty of stupendous blun - 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ders , in -LRB- 1 -RRB- depriving the settlers of their Hottentot servants , to the detriment of both themselves , the Hottentots , and the country ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- in taking away their slaves without any pretense at adequate compensation though that had been promised and at the beginning of harvest , throwing many families into abject poverty ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- in actually upholding the savage blacks in their repeated forays upon the Dutch farmers on the frontier .

		Dr.
Scholes	PERSON	's large book , '' The British Em - pire and Alliances , '' is far better described by its sub-title , ''
Britain	LOCATION	's Duty to Her Colonies and Subject Races . ''

		Indeed , the only '' alli - ances '' mentioned are the natural ties of a common language and a common tradition ex - isting between the various branches of the so - called English-speaking race .

		This occupies the first chapter of the large octavo .

		After this , the colonies of the British empire are taken up and described successfully , with con - siderations of the wars and the commerce and industries which have led to their establish - ment .


Russia	LOCATION	, as
England	LOCATION	's one rival , is dealt with , and with unusual sympathy and discrimin - ation .


China	LOCATION	follows , as a field wherein
Britain	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are to display their various talents for organization , with a long essay upon the possibilities of the situation .

		This brings Dr.
Scholes	PERSON	to a fearless and much needed denun - ciation of the white people in the lands where they come in contact with peoples of a darker skin , the Americans of the
Southern United States	LOCATION	as well as the English in
India	LOCATION	and
South Africa	LOCATION	, for what he asserts to be nothing less than a preposterous assumption of supe - riority .

		He arrays the long line of races dom - inant in the civilization of the earth to show that some of these were African , when
Europe	LOCATION	was still savage , and to call attention to the brief time which has gone by since barbarians burst forth from the northern forests , to become , by contact with older and cultured peoples , the dominant race of
Europe	LOCATION	and themselves cul - tured in their turn .

		He argues that there is nothing in the present status of the African Negro , as compared with his Caucasian neigh - bor and fellow-countryman in
America	LOCATION	or the British colonies , which differentiates him from the German as compared with the Roman of Tacitus ; and in the Anglo-Saxon supercilious - ness and lack of human sympathy he sees an element of weakness which must lead to event - ual overthrow .

		Dr.
Scholes	PERSON	goes even further than this , at one point and another in his book , and demands of
Europe	LOCATION	and
Europeanized America	LOCATION	what it is that they have to offer to these nations of a darker skin .

		He draws a picture in lurid colors , but without exaggera - tion , when he describes the present situation thus : '' But amid the precepts of peace and love inculcated by theology ; the justice and self-sacrifice produced by it in the character of European nations ; the security of law ; the refinement of art ; the culture of literature ; the victories of science ; and the ease , the comfort , and the splendor of commerce ; it remains an indisputable fact that , in jealousy , in avarice , in enmity , in the prod - igal waste of treasure , and in the still more appalling waste of life , through bitter and incessant war ,
Chris	PERSON	- tian and cultured
Europe	LOCATION	is not one whit behind the darkest and bloodiest of the other continents .

		Nor was human blood through war shed more freely under
Europe	LOCATION	heathen , than under
Europe	LOCATION	Christian ; neither has it been shed less in the name of religion than in the name of politics ; nor does the present promise less of these calamities in the future , than has been contributed by the past ; for , as the promoters and abettors , leaders in science , in art , in merchandise , and in politics ; men of birth , men of distinction , men of affluence , all give their wealth , their skill , and their influence , to equip and to support millions of men , to build thousands of battleships , to manufacture terrible missiles and horrible explosives , all for the slaughter of one another . ''

		In conclusion , the author begs
America	LOCATION	to ab - stain from joining herself to these powers which are thus rushing on to inevitable destruction ; and implores
England	LOCATION	to abjure further expan - sion , and find peace and room for all her ener - gies in concentration and consolidation .

		Removed from this earnest and philosophical work by a whole heaven , Mrs.
Lionel Phillips	PERSON	, wife of the leader of that
Reform Committee	ORGANIZATION	in
Johannesburg	LOCATION	which is so largely responsible for much of the present horrors of war , sets down her '' South African Recollections '' with a candor which is little less than libellous in places and wholly refreshing at all times .

		She writes of the exploit of t -RRB- r.
Jameson	PERSON	as the foolhardy insubordination of a reckless and culpably ignorant adventurer , guilty , among other surprising follies , of carrying with him the proofs of his own guilt and the guilt of his fellow-conspirators , among whom her husband was chief .

		She shows that
Jameson	PERSON	deliber - ately suppressed the orders from the
Reform Committee	ORGANIZATION	not to advance , in order to shift the consequences of his disobedience from his shoulders to theirs .

		And she does a great deal more when she openly states that the English - men in the Rand who were claiming the right of expatriation were doing it at the behest of the British authorities , though the armed revo - lution in
Johannesburg	LOCATION	was to be effected under the
Transvaal	LOCATION	flag !

		When Mr.
Lionel Phillips	PERSON	,
Colonel Rhodes	PERSON	-LRB- brother to the Right Hon.
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	-RRB- , and the others of the
Beform Committee	ORGANIZATION	, were arrested for treason and con - demned to death , it is small wonder that the burghers felt that the tragedy of
Slachters Nek	ORGANIZATION	in
1816	DATE	was being repeated with the nationali - ties of the actors reversed , and brought forward the very beam upon which their countrymen had been hanged for the very same offence against British authority .

		But President
Krueger	PERSON	was more merciful , and the tragedy would have ended as a comedy had
England	LOCATION	not failed in her duty to the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, to her - self , and to civilization , in the
Jameson	PERSON	verdict .

		No one can be in doubt , after reading Mrs.
Phillip	PERSON	's entertaining book , that the Boer is not the pleasantest person for the Briton to deal with .

		Thoroughly convinced that the wife of one of the chief sufferers from Dutch obsti - nacy can be quite dispassionate in her estimate of the burgher character , she inadvertently points out that the present trouble , the trouble in which her husband was involved , and all the other troubles between the British and Dutch in
South Africa	LOCATION	, are due to a single cause the very Anglo-Saxon superciliousness of which Dr.
Scholes	PERSON	makes complaint in respect of the dark-skinned races .

		No one , after reading all that Mrs.
Phillips	PERSON	has to say , can doubt that the whole case against the
Transvaal	ORGANIZATION	is bound up in the English taking the desperate efforts which the
Transvaal	LOCATION	was making for national existence , and the unusual measures she was compelled to adopt for self-protection , to repre - sent the real national life of the republic .

		Lack of sympathy and comprehension is only too common between diverse nationalities , and both the British and Dutch are reprehensible ; but assuredly the chief blame does not fall upon the shoulders of the weaker , the less cultured , and the aggrieved .

		If the civilization of the English - speaking peoples stands for anything , it should have for its motto some such sentiment as civ - ilisation oblige .

		Of the same sort is the book , '' Side Lights on
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' from the pen of Miss
Roy Devereux	PERSON	.

		The author , though falling within the sphere of influence of the Right Hon.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, to whom she accords an ungrudging hero-worship throughout the volume , is sincere enough to disclose many of the facts that are not usually brought forward , notwithstanding her intensely British point of view .

		The dyna - mite concession , of which so much has been said , is in the hands of the great Nobel trust , for example .

		The heavy taxation on food pro- ducts , which is so large a cause of dissatisfac - tion among the Uitlanders in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, is also customary in
Rhodesia	LOCATION	: Miss
Devereux	PERSON	might have added , too , that the taxation upon the gold mines of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	is no higher than the taxation in
Rhodesia	LOCATION	.

		Nor does she mention the fact that the high cost of European provisions in
Johannesburg	LOCATION	is due quite as much to the tariff exactions of
Natal	ORGANIZATION	and the
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	as to those of the South African Re - public .

		But we can not be too grateful for the quotations from the leaders among the
Reform Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, which prove that the Englishmen , after all , had no desire for the franchise , quoting , with the rest , Mr.
Lionel Phillips	PERSON	to Mr.
Beit	PERSON	, when he writes : '' I may say that , as you of course know , I have no de - sire for political rights , and believe as a whole that the community -LSB- of
Johannesburg	LOCATION	-RSB- is not ambitious in this respect . ''

		Most of Miss
Devereux	PERSON	's proofs that government is impos - sible to the Boer , have a curiously familiar sound to American ears .

		Johannesburg appears to be badly misgoverned , especially in respect of the liquor laws : for all the world like
New York	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		There is a denial of political rights to foreigners which can be matched by our conduct toward the Chinese or our colored fellow-citizens in the South .

		There are African outrages to add to the similarity .

		The Trans - vaal legislature appears to be amenable to bribery , which brings to mind several of the
Northern Senators	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, the respectable bribers being , of course , there as here , quite free from the stigma of blame which attaches to the less culpable bribed .

		Every third burgher is said to receive aid from the state , remindful of the American pension sys - tem and the assertions of the protectionists .

		Miss
Devereux	PERSON	does not go into the question of military efficiency as proof or disproof of Boer civilization , though Dr.
Scholes	PERSON	shows that to be the most highly developed phase of it in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Nor does she point out that the attitude of
England	LOCATION	stands without approval from any party in any civilized country in the world , with the exception of the American imperialists , who find in it the best justifica - tion of our attitude in
the Philippines	LOCATION	: a bit of international brotherliness which the British Tory cordially reciprocates .

		Her book abounds in information , set forth in the sprightly style which the name of '' lady - journalist '' suggests .

		For the American desirous of familiarizing himself with the merits of the two parties in the present war , the essays which make up the 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, small book called , '' Briton and Boer , Both Sides of the South African Question , '' reprinted from the '' North American Review , '' may be recommended , with the preliminary statement that the case made out in the book is convinc - ingly strong against the Briton .

		Whether the historian and publicist , the Right Hon.
James Bryce	PERSON	, is talking of matters in which he has a peculiar right to be heard as the leading au - thority upon a question to which he gave his distinguished consideration several years ago ; whether Mr.
Sydney Brooks	PERSON	is setting forth with some attempt at dispassion the elements in the controversy from both points of view ; whether '' A Diplomat '' is calling Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	to account for what he points out to be over - statements in favor of
Great Britain	LOCATION	; whether Dr.
F. V. Engelenburg	PERSON	is summing up the arguments of his countrymen in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, or Mr.
Karl Blind	PERSON	is speaking as the devoted friend of the
England	LOCATION	to which he owes so much ; whether Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	voices the thoughts of the American \ n
England	LOCATION	, or Mr.
Francis Charmes	PERSON	the thought of a
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean on the Continent , or Mr.
Demetrius C. Boulger	PERSON	the thought of the Continent as inter - preted by an Englishman long resident there , or
M. Max Nordau	PERSON	speaks as a disinterested cosmopolitan , all unite in calling this war an act of colossal folly on
England	LOCATION	's part , of bad faith and worse management , of criminal ag - gression in a word , a high crime against civilization .

		Some quotations from these dis - tinguished gentlemen will prove instructive .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, whose attitude as a member of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	is necessarily one of re - serve , says : '' There is not , so far as one can ascertain from any evidence yet produced , the slightest foundation for the allegation , so assiduously propagated in
England	LOCATION	, that there was any general conspiracy of the Colonial Dutch , or that there existed the smallest risk of any unpro - voked attack by them , or by the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	, or by the
Transvaal	LOCATION	itself , upon the powers of
England	LOCATION	. '' ''

		The
Boers	PERSON	very naturally felt that if they had re - mained quiet till the British forces had been raised to a strength they could not hope to resist , they would lose the only military advantage they possessed .

		Accord - ingly , when they knew that the Reserves were being called out in
England	LOCATION	, and that an army corps was to be sent to
South Africa	LOCATION	, they declared war , having been for some time previously convinced , wrongly or rightly , that the British government had resolved to coerce them .

		They were in a sore strait , and they took the course which must have been expected from them , and indeed the only course which brave men , who were not going to make any further concessions , could have taken . '' ''

		No one , of course , denies that the war iu which
England	ORGANIZATION	will , of course , prevail , is a terrible calamity for
South Africa	LOCATION	, and will permanently embitter the relations of Dutch and English there .

		To some of us it appears a calamity for
England	LOCATION	also , since it is likely to alienate , perhaps for generations to come , the bulk of the white population in one of her most important self-governing colonies .

		It may , indeed , possibly mean for her the ultimate loss of
South Africa	LOCATION	. '' ''

		A Diplomat '' raises some interesting ques - tions in the direction of national righteousness .

		He says , among other things : `` The whole
Transvaal	LOCATION	issue hinges on one question : Have the Boers the right to govern themselves as they choose ; or , rather , have the English the right to inter - fere with the form of government , administration , and life that the
Boers	PERSON	have chosen for themselves ?

		... From being applied only to the savage populations of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	, the principle of the rights of superior races and civilizations has come , by a steep incline , to mean also that it has reference to countries like the
Celestial Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the
Boer Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Between the Zulus and the
Boers	LOCATION	, what is the difference ?

		Ouly one of degree .

		Fine reasoning clears the way for the per - petration of any outrage on the liberty and sovereignty of minor or weak States . '' ''

		If the
Transvaal State	ORGANIZATION	is against the development of commerce and industry on principle , it is within its rights to be so , as much as the
United States	LOCATION	iu adopt - ing the
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	and Diugley tariffs ... The so - called prostitution of the law courts to the whims of the legislature , does not apply to the ordinary dealings of justice in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, but to the political situa - tion , which , as we have explained , must be governed by the principle of the safety of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		And Mr.
Karl Blind	PERSON	strikes at a blunder which has given to many Americans a wrong concep - tion of the entire rights of the case , when he says : '' And here I feel compelled to declare that violence is capped by unbearable cant when the hard-driven Republics , around whom the steel net was daily drawn tighter , are charged with having brought on this hideous war .

		You drive a man , forsooth , into a corner .

		You hold your fist before his face .

		You threaten him by saying that the sand of the hour-glass is running out , and that , unless he makes haste to kneel down , you will use other measures against him .

		You hold your sword and gun ready to attack him ; and then when he strikes a blow , he is , of course , the guilty party ! ''

		It only remains to add , for those who hold that
England	LOCATION	here stands for civilization , that she is acting neither for her own good nor for the good of those whom she attacks , which divests her act of all semblance of righteous - ness , but is rather impelled by that mammon which can not be served and God be served ; while the war itself is a denial of the rights of arbitration as of all rights of the weak against the strong , and is notice to the world that
Great Britain	LOCATION	, having failed to rule through love , is determined to rule by force .

		If this is
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	civilization , the less the world has of it the better .

		Fiction being increasingly the medium of amusement and instruction , the great poets and essayists having become the prophets of a new social order , the preacher takes up in turn some of the modern writers in these fields , to show that they are consciously or unconsciously teachers of morals , that their books are essen - tially books of aspiration and spiritual culture .


John Ruskin	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	are some of the authors to whom Mr.
Hillis	PERSON	turns to find help for those who would live in the spirit .

		There is no great degree of originality in the line of thought or in the conclusions of these essays ; but the author has a pleasant and pic - turesque style , and a happy gift in the use of illustration and comparison that save the book from triteness and make it '' popular '' without being trivial .

		Nearly every subject is treated with regard to its relation to other subjects , the niches being assigned with ingenuity and often with much fitness .

		For example , a study of '' Romola '' begins thus : '' After eighteen centuries , the most popular story in literature is
Christ	LOCATION	's story of the prodigal son , a story that has fascinated the generations , softened the races , and will yet win a wandering world back to its Father 's side .

		If the
Bible	LOCATION	, with its parables , is the book best loved by men , next to it stands Pilgrim 's Progress , ' more widely read than any other human book .

		If 1 Les Miserables ' exhibits the evolution of conscience , '
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	' the evolution of intellect , and The Scarlet Letter ' the evolution of pain and penalty , the theme of Romola ' is the evolution of sin , the peril of tampering with conscience and the gradual deterioration of character . ''

		Books like the two foregoing show how far the modern sermon departs from the old type .

		The earnest and devout preacher to-day keeps himself in touch with the interests and thoughts of the passing hour .

		The old-time sermon commonly was either an exposition of dogma or an exhortation to prepare for the life beyond the grave .

		The modern sermon concerns itself with the purpose to make the most of life here and now , for ourselves and for others .

		To this 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, end , the texts are taken not from one book alone but from any great book , not from some one miraculous event in the long past , but from the daily miracle of nature and the universe that is visible everywhere to him who has eyes to see .

		RECENT POETRY .

		* Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	breaks a longer silence than usual with the publication of his new tragedy in verse .

		It is now three years since his last volume , '' The Tale of Balen , '' was given to the world , and the fact is painfully suggestive of that slackening of the energies that comes with advancing years .

		For this poet , the greatest that remains to us , is fast becoming the most venerable also , and we are re - minded that his song will not again gush forth with the opulent flow of the past .

		There already stand to his account upwards of a score of volumes of the noblest poetry to which the English tongue has given utterance ; the singer now may well rest con - tent with his renown , and with the solitary eminence which he has achieved .

		Whatever further gifts he may bestow upon us can add little to the fresh ver - dure of his laurel-crown .

		Yet such a gift as ''
Rosa	PERSON	- mund , Queen of the Lombards '' is no mean addi - tion to our treasury .

		It is a creation of beauty far beyond the reach of any other man now living , and provides the year just ended with its one book which we may be certain will remain a permanent addition to our literature .

		The framework of this tragedy may be found in
Gibbon	LOCATION	.

		It is the story of that

		espoused
Alboin	PERSON	, the slayer of her father .

		This founder of the Lombard kingdom fell by the hand of an assassin , whose deed was instigated by the treachery of the queen , taking thus a long-delayed vengeance for her father 's death .

		The grim tale was peculiarly fitted to be dealt with by Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne , who has invested it with all the pity , terror , and tragic irony which it demands .

		One can not help recalling that another
Rosamund	PERSON	was the heroine of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's first dramatic work of what was practically his first poem .

		The two pieces are thus separated by nearly forty years , and a comparison between them would prove highly in - structive concerning the development of the poet 's style .

		This we may not here attempt in full , but certain points of contrast should be indicated , for which purpose the following extracts will suffice .

		Here speaks the '' Rosamund '' of
1861	DATE	: '' Fear is a cushion for the feet of love , Painted with colors for his ease-taking ; Sweet red , and white with wasted blood , and blue Most flower-like , and the summer-spoused green And sea-betrothed soft purple and burnt black .

		All colored forms of fear , omen , and change , Sick prophecy and rumors lame at heel , Anticipations and astrologies , Perilous inscription and recorded note , All these are covered in the skirt of love , And when he shakes it these are tumbled forth , Beaten and blown i ' the dusty face of the air . ''

		From the ''
Rosamund	PERSON	'' of
1899	DATE	we select this pas -
ROSAMUND	PERSON	. ''

		Kiss me .

		Who knows how long the lord of life
May	DATE	spare us time for kissing ?

		Life and love Are less than change and death .

		ALBOVINE . ''

		What ghosts are they ?

		So sweet thou never wast to me before .

		The woman that is God the God that is Woman the sovereign of the soul of man , Our father 's Freia , Venus crowned in
Rome	LOCATION	, Has lent my love her girdle ; but her lips Have robbed the red rose of its heart , and left No glory for the flower beyond all flowers To bid the
spring	DATE	be glad of . ''

		Here is a contrast indeed !

		The exuberance , the color , the overwrought imagery , the verbal afflu - ence , the Shakespearian diction , of the earlier work have vanished , and in their place we have sheer simplicity of vocabulary , passion intimated rather than expressed , imagery reduced to bare metaphor , and a diction wellnigh shorn of all mannerisms .

		Noting the vocabulary alone , we find in the later passage only half as many words of more than one syllable as are found in the earlier extract .

		Here is a still more striking example of the reduction of vocabulary to its lowest terms : '' I take thine oath .

		I bid not thee take heed That I or thou or each of us at once , Couldst thou play false , may die : I bid thee think Thy bride will die , shamed .

		Swear me not again She shall not : all our trust is set on thee .

		What eyes and ears are keen about us here Thou knowest not .

		Love , my love and thine for her , Shall deafen and shall blind them . ''

		Here are seventy-four words , of which seventy-one
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL are monosyllables .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has often been charged with a lack of restraint .

		There is some justice in the charge , although far too much has been made of it .

		But whatever may be said of his early exuberance , the poem now before us gives evidence that he can upon occasion carry restraint to its extreme .

		The new '' Rosamund '' does not readily lend itself to quotation .

		It is too com - pressed , too tense , too dependent upon the dramatic situation for illustration by detached fragments .

		The following passage is as quotable as any : `` Thy voice was honey-hearted music , sweet As wine and glad as clarions : not in battle Might men have more of joy than I to hear it And feel delight dance in my heart and laugh Too loud for hearing save its own .

		Thou rose , Why did God give thee more than all thy kin Whose pride is perfume only and colour , this ?

		Music ?

		No rose hut mine sings , and the birds Hush all their hearts to hearken . ''

		The high restraint which characterizes the diction of this drama extends also , by implication , to the demeanor , to the very gesture , of the actors con - cerned .

		The brooding storm of passion is felt , rather than heard or seen , but we are not unpre - pared for the supreme moment in which it breaks .

		The inevitable fate of both king and queen is so foreshadowed that when it comes upon them in one swift last moment of the action , the spirit is not so much aroused as calmed , and we echo the words with which , as with the final chorus of a Greek tragedy , the outcome is characterized in this single verse , '' Let none make moan .

		This doom is none of man 's . ''

		Among the younger English poets whose ranks we scan when we would know if there be any to take the places of the great Victorian singers Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	seems to hold out a greater prom - ise than any of his compeers .

		There are some critics who , should the poet of '' Rosamund '' be taken from us , would at once raise the cry , '' Le roy est mort .

		Vive le roy ! ''

		and would mean by that the transferrence of their allegiance to the poet of `` Paolo and Francesca . ''

		It is something of a coincidence that these two noteworthy pieces of dra - matic verse should have appeared almost simulta - neously , and that the youngest of our poets should find his name linked thus fortuitously with that of our oldest .

		There is something pleasant to con - template in the generous enthusiasm which has greeted the work of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, but a new poet is proclaimed in similar fashion every year or two , and , remembering many other cases of the same sort , the critic who looks before and after will not allow his judgment to be stampeded .

		We have a high opinion of the quality of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's work ; parts of it are very fine indeed , and none of the younger men exhibit greater promise than is exhib - ited by the author of ''
Marpessa	LOCATION	'' and '' Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	. ''

		But Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has thus far failed to strike a new note .

		The initial volumes of Ten - nyson and
Browning	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Morris	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	did strike new notes , and forced a read - justment of ideals .

		The first volume of the '' Poems and Ballads '' struck a new note so startling in its sonority that those who heard it have hardly yet recovered from the shock .

		But Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has thus far done excellent things only in the manner of other poets who have preceded him .

		His '' Paolo and Francesca '' is a beautiful piece of workman - ship , but its beauty comes to us enforced by its asso - ciations with the most exquisite episodes of the '' Divine Comedy , '' and even with the reflection of that episode in the tragedy of
Silvio Pellico	LOCATION	.

		The poem does not possess a new beauty of its very own .

		It reaches its climax in the scene which approaches most closely to its original , the scene of the lovers seated together , and reading of '' Launcelot how love constrained him . ''

		It runs as follows : PAOLO -LRB- reading -RRB- . ''

		` Now on that day it chanced that
Launcelot	PERSON	, Thinking to find the King , found Guenevere Alone ; and when he saw her whom he loved ; Whom he had met too late , yet loved the more ; Such was the tumult at his heart that he Could speak not , for her husband was his friend , His dear familiar friend : and they two held No secret from each other until now ; But were like brothers born ' my voice breaks off .

		Read you a little on .

		FKANCESCA -LRB- reading -RRB- . '

		And Guenevere , Turning , beheld him suddenly whom she Loved in her thought , and even from that hour When first she saw him ; for by day , by night , Though lying by her husband 's side , did she Weary for Launcelot , and knew full well How ill that love , and yet that love how deep ! '

		I can not see the page is dim : read you .

		PAOLO -LRB- reading -RRB- .

		* Now they two were alone , yet could not speak ; But heard the beating of each other 's hearts .

		He knew himself a traitor but to stay , Yet could not stir : she pale and yet more pale Grew till she could no more , but smiled on him .

		Then when he saw that wished smile , he came Near to her and still near , and trembled ; then Her lips all trembling kissed . '

		FBANCESCA -LRB- drooping towards him -RRB- .

		Ah , Launcelot ! ''

		-LRB- He kisses her on the lips . -RRB-

		The above is only a diluted restatement of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the following words , placed upon the lips of Paolo , Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	comes as near to speaking in his own voice as the subject will permit . ''

		What can we fear , we two ?

		God , Thou seest us Thy creatures bound Together by that law which holds the stars In palpitating cosmic passion bright ; By which the very sun enthrals the earth , And all the waves of the world faint to the moon .

		Even by such attraction we two rush Together through the everlasting years .

		Us , then , whose only pain can be to part , How wilt Thou punish ?

		For what ecstasy Together to be blown about the globe !

		What rapture in perpetual fire to burn Together !

		where we are is endless fire .

		There centuries shall in a moment pass , And all the cycles in one hour elapse !

		Still , still together , even when faints Thy sun , And past our souls Thy stars like ashes fall , How wilt Thou punish us who can not part ? ''

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, It remains to state that the drama by Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is intended for actual performance , and will be pro- duced at an early date by Mr.
George Alexander	PERSON	.

		It is a promising sign of the times when a literary production of this high order of merit finds accept - ance at the hands of practically minded theatrical folk .

		In turning from these noble works to ''
Deluscar	PERSON	's Merris and Other Poems '' we turn from poetry to bathos and from the exalted to the commonplace .

		The volume is a stout one , but a dreary waste to the seeker after beauty .

		To this writer the modern world is decidedly out of joint .

		He discourses of it through many pages in the following strain : '' Oh !

		how it sickens me to read the rot About those ancient Greek and Eoman frauds !

		One of our men could tie ten in a knot , Out-art their cleverest , choicest sculptured gauds .

		Here , if it paid , new Shakespeares would arise In his time fortunes were by poets made ; Now individual merit starving lies , Nothing goes down but sordid , swindling trade . ''

		Although our writer affects the form of the Shake - spearian sonnet , it is quite clear that he is no new Shakespeare arisen .

		There are noticeable technical defects in the '' Laurel Leaves '' of Mr.
Robert Wilson	PERSON	.

		The entire octave of one sonnet is built upon the theory that the second syllable of Beethoven bears the accent ; quantity is ignored in `` The grand matutinal anthem when the sphere Was first upon its orbit hurled along , '' and an excellent memorial tribute is ruined by the closing verse , `` Thou noble type of Christian ladyhood . ''

		But in spite of such faults as these , the total im - pression is pleasing , although the verse is of a sort that almost any cultivated person might have writ - ten .

		The following sonnet ' To My Wife '' may be selected for our quotation . ''

		There came upon my soul a sacred awe When first I won thy maiden tenderness ; My very heart arose in me to bless All that on earth or sea or air I saw , And dear to me is still the breath I draw Through that blest moment , nor is love the less For all our mingled joy and bitterness Since first we lived beneath its holy law .

		Two little graves are side by side on earth ; Two little stars are added to our skies ; And children 's voices ring around our hearth ; And Love , reflected from their kindred eyes ,
First Love	ORGANIZATION	, springs up again in second birth And steals the golden key of paradise . ''

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's poems are mainly impressions of travel and memorial verses .

		Among the latter , there is a notable group of sonnets in which the author expresses his love and reverence for Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, to whom the book is dedicated '' in memorial of a friendship which has been the consecration of my life and of its poetic aspirations . ''

		Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	's new collection of parodies and other humorous pieces , while not quite equal in brilliancy to '' The Battle of the Bays , '' does not fall far behind that inimitable volume .

		He is almost entitled to wear the mantle of
C. S. C.	PERSON	, and that is saying much .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	, Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	are among the victims of his good-natured jesting .

		Which of them is aimed at in the following stanza we do not need to specify : '' For the
Silly Season	ORGANIZATION	is past and over , Gone with the equinoctial gales ; That sinuous hoax , the hoar sea-rover , Curbs the pride of his prancing scales ; And the giant gooseberry misbegotten Lies in the limbs of all things rotten , The savour that clings to last year 's clover , The loves that follow the light that fails . ''

		Nor do we need to name the poet parodied in the ode apropos of the affaire which closes thus : '' Like sails of a galleon , rudder hard amort With crepitant mast Fronting the hazard to dare of a dual blast The intern and the extern , blizzards both . ''

		This , written for an
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	Club dinner , is also rather good : '' Master , in memory of that
Verse of Thine	ORGANIZATION	, And of Thy rather pretty taste in Wine , We gather at this jaded
Century	ORGANIZATION	's end .

		Our Cheeks , if so we may , to incarnadine .

		`` Thou hast the kind of Halo which outstays Most other
Genii 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though a
Laureate	ORGANIZATION	's bays Should slowly crumple up , Thou livest on , Having survived a certain Paraphrase . ''

		The Lion and the Alligator squat In Dervish Courts the Weather being hot Under Umbrellas .

		Where is Mahmud now ?

		Plucked by the
Kitchener	LOCATION	and gone to Pot . ''

		We have the usual contribution of Canadian verse to our present garnering of recent poetry , three volumes being easily entitled to mention .

		The first of them shall be Mr.
Wilfrid Campbell	PERSON	's '' From the Hills of Dream . ''

		What we like particularly about most of these singers from over the border is their deep sense of natural beauty , their joyous fellowship with woods and meadows , with mountains and skies .

		Few of our own poets have these qual - ities in like degree with Messrs.
Roberts	PERSON	and Car - man and
Scott	PERSON	and
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, or with the late
Archibald Lampman	PERSON	.

		They offer us an interpre - tation of nature which , vivid in its realism , is yet intensely spiritualized .

		How etching-like in its line is such a picture as this : `` I thread the uplands where the wind 's footfalls Stir leaves in gusty hollows , autumn 's urns .

		Seaward the river 's shining breast expands , High in the windy pines a lone crow calls , And far below some patient ploughman turns His great black furrow over steaming lands . ''

		The poem on ''
September	DATE	in the Laurentian Hills '' will serve further to illustrate our thesis : '' Already Winter in his sombre round , Before his time hath touched these hills austere With lonely flame .


Last night	TIME	, without a sound .

		The ghostly frost walked out by wood and mere .

		And now the sumach curls his frond of fire , The aspen-tree reluctant drops his gold , And down the gullies the North 's wild vibrant lyre Rouses the bitter armies of the cold .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 '' O'er
this short afternoon the night	TIME	draws down .

		With ominous chill , across these regions bleak ; Wind-beaten gold , the sunset fades around The purple loneliness of crag and peak , Leaving the world an iron house wherein Nor love nor life nor hope hath ever been . ''

		Equally lovely , although in a far different fashion , is the following tender lyric : '' Love came at dawn when all the world was fair , When crimson glories , bloom , and song were rife ; Love came at dawn when hope 's wings fanned the air And murmured , ' I am life . '

		`` Love came at even when the day was done , When heart and brain were tired , and slumber pressed ; Love came at eve , shut out the sinking sun , And whispered , ' I am rest . ' ''

		Many of Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's poems are of more ambi - tious flight than those we have quoted , but he finds his truest inspiration in simple scenes and themes .

		His volume is one to be treasured for its beauty and elevated feeling .

		Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	has sought alien shores , even those of the
Bahamas	LOCATION	, for the inspiration of '' A
Winter Holiday	DATE	. ''

		The book is of the thinnest , and counts only seven numbers in its contents .

		South Sea islands are pleasant things to think about at this season of the year , and such lines as these are certainly enticing : '' Through the lemon-trees at leisure a tiny olive bird Moves all day long and utters his wise assuring word ; While up in their blue chantry murmur the solemn palms , At their litanies of joyance , their ancient ceaseless psalms . ''

		There in the endless sunlight , within the surf 's low sound , Peace tarries for a lifetime at doorways unrenowned ; And a velvet air goes breathing across the sea-girt land , Till the sense begins to waken and the soul to understand . ''

		This is pretty , at least , but it is nothing to what Mr.
Carman	PERSON	has done in the past , or what we still hope he may accomplish in the future .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	, it is generally known , is a cousin of Mr.
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, who occupies the foremost place in the group of young Canadian poets .

		What is not generally known , however , is that poetical talent is the common inheritance of all the
Roberts	PERSON	family .

		The volume of '' Northland Lyrics , '' now before us , gives convincing evidence of this propo - sition , for it is the joint work of one sister and two brothers of Mr.
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	. ''

		Beyond the Hills '' is a poem by Mrs.
Elizabeth Roberts Macdonald	PERSON	. ''

		The daffodils fling far the flag of
Spring	DATE	, Their golden troop the garden-fortress fills , And bird-throat bugles greet the days that bring The daffodils . ''

		Over the hills the Summer comes at last ; But sad the light and sad the laughing rills , And sad the golden flowers since he has passed Beyond the hills . ''

		Mr.
Theodore Roberts	PERSON	is the author of a `` Lament '' inscribed to the memory of
Archibald Lampman	PERSON	.

		We quote the first half of this poem : '' His was not the glory of the shattering of spears ; He did not cross his sword with Death , where scarlet flags are hurled , But Death came to him softly , with his dark eyes dim with tears , And broke a dream of woodland-ways across a singing world .

		`` So doff your hats , good poet-men , No fingers lift the fallen pen !

		The sun forgets to mark the time Without the music of his rhyme . ''

		Finally , Mr.
William Carman Roberts	PERSON	bids us select from upwards of a score of his pieces these two stanzas of the lyric , '' At the Heart 's Cry '' : `` Till the black-crimson petals of that night Drew down to the gold vortex of strange dreams My soul and body , wearied of the fight Of far ideals and clashing fierce desires , I was as one struck blind by life 's sweet light And deafened by a myriad singing fires .

		`` So was I glad when night 's deep velvet rose Closed over me and hid me from myself ; As on my northern hills the first soft snows From grey skies brooding like an angel 's wing ,
Compassionate	ORGANIZATION	, where the last lorn maple glows , Blot out all sad remembrances of
Spring	DATE	. ''

		These three lovely poems are fairly illustrative of their fellows .

		The collection as a whole is a really astonishing exhibition of talent , fine feeling , and melodious utterance .

		It has a foreword in verse by the brother , and an afterword by the cousin , of the three new poets .

		After a silence of several years , Mr.
G. E. Wood	PERSON	- berry has published a second volume of verse .

		But '' The North Shore Watch '' hardly led us to antici - pate `` Wild Eden . ''

		There was in the earlier vol - ume a manner of severe restraint , almost of aus - terity , and this is replaced in the later one by a wilding note and an outpouring of melodious rapture so free that a new poet seems to address us rather than the old one .

		The charm of these songs is as great as it is indefinable .

		Something of the dewy freshness of the Elizabethan music seems to be re - echoed in these exquisite lyrics , and yet the modern touch la maladie de lapensee is too evident to make this illusion more than fleeting .

		But whether the art be old or new , it is well-nigh perfect when it finds such expression as '' The Secret . ''

		`` Nightingales warble about it All night under blossom and star ; The wild swan is dying without it , And the eagle cryeth afar ; The sun , he doth mount but to find it , Searching the green earth o'er ; But more doth a man 's heart mind it O more , more , more ! ''

		Over the gray leagues of ocean The infinite yearneth alone ; The forests with wandering emotion The thing they know not intone ; Creation arose but to see it , A million lamps in the blue ; But a lover , he shall be it , If one sweet maid is true . ''

		This is pure song touched with imagination .

		The imaginative element is still finer and more marked in such a poem as '' The Sea-Shell , '' of which we quote the closing stanza : '' mystic Love !

		that so can take The bright world in thy hands , And its imprisoned spirits make Murmur at thy commands ; 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, As if , in truth , this orb of law Were but thy reed-hung nest , Woven by Time of sticks and straw To house the
summer	DATE	guest ; And so to me the starry sphere Is but love 's frail sea-shell ; 0 , might she press it to her ear , What would its murmurs tell ! ''

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's inspiration is his own , as far as this is possible in the case of a writer whose thought is steeped in the work of the older poets .

		That it should be absolutely unsuggestive of his predecessors would be too much to expect .

		So we are not sur - prised to find familiar cadences here and there , the Tennysonian cadence , for example , in these lines : `` O , hidden-strange as on dew-heavy lawns The warm dark scents of summer-fragrant dawns ; O , tender as the faint sea-changes are , When grows the Sush and pales the snow-white star ; So strange , so tender , to a maid is love . '' ''

		Seaward , '' the long poem which closes the volume , is the one most suggestive of a model , or at least of a recollection .

		Its first line , '' I will go down to the hoar sea 's infinite foam , '' instantly brings to mind Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' I will go back to the great sweet mother , Mother and lover of men , the sea . ''

		Again and again the suggestion recurs , now of '' The Triumph of Time , '' now of the '' Hymn to Proser - pine , '' now of ''
Hesperia	LOCATION	. ''

		We find it here , '' Of the flush of the bough , of the fragrance of woods , of the moan of the dove Weary and weary of passion and thrice , thrice weary of love ! ''

		And here , `` I will seek thy blessed shelter , deep bosom of sun and storm , From the fever and fret of the earth and the things that debase and deform ; For I am thine , from of old thou didst lay me , a child , at rest In thy cradle of many waters , and gav ` st to my hunger thy breast . ''

		And yet again here , as the end of the poem is ap - proached , `` Man-grown , I will seek thy healing ; though from worse than death I fly .

		Not mine the heart of the craven , not here I mean to die I Let me taste on my lips thy salt , let me live with the sun and the rain , Let me lean to the rolling wave and feel me a man again . ''

		But these suggestions do not mar our enjoyment of '' Seaward , '' which is a very beautiful poem , and , if it could not hope to catch all the music of ''
Hes	ORGANIZATION	- peria , '' it has music enough to remain ringing in our ears as the volume is reluctantly closed and put aside .

		Neatness and precision of expression , rather than poetical phrasing , are the characteristics of Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	's '' Lyrics of Brotherhood , '' a thin volume of mostly short pieces .

		The following is a typical example : `` A flash of the lightning keen !

		And lo !

		we know that , miles on miles , The dim , lost land is lying green .

		It brims our heart with joy , the whiles , To see that through the thick night-screen Full many a meadow smiles and smiles . ''

		A flash from the poet 's brain !

		The meaning of the many years , That mazeful seemed , grows very plain ; The level lands of gloom and tears Hint holy heights , turn bright again ; The night a transient thing appears . ''

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	is always a pleasing and thoughtful writer , but philosophy is too apt to usurp the place of song in his verse .

		Among the women singers of our country there is none whose work gives more satisfaction than that of Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	.

		It is sure to be tender in conception and artistic in finish .

		If Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's instrument be a flute rather than a violin , the exquisite purity of its tone is beyond question , although it can not bestow the rich measure of sen - suous delight that other instruments afford .

		The best flute music becomes monotonous if we hear too much of it at one sitting , and Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's new volume is not one to be read through at a sitting , but rather one into which to dip when the mood is properly receptive .

		It is made up of lyrics , sonnets , quatrains , and translations .

		The sonnets have all the purity of the other pieces , and some measure of richness as well . ''

		At Rest '' is a typical example . ''

		Shall I lie down to sleep , and see no more The splendid pageantry of earth and sky The proud procession of the stars sweep by ; The white moon sway the sea , and woo the shore ; The morning lark to the far Heaven soar ; The nightingale with the soft dusk draw nigh ; The
summer	DATE	roses bud , and bloom , and die Will Life and Life 's delight for me be o'er ? ''

		Nay !

		I shall be , in my low silent home , Of all Earth 's gracious ministries aware Glad with the gladness of the risen day , Or gently sad with sadness of the gloam , Yet done with striving , and foreclosed of care At rest at rest !

		What better thing to say ? ''

		We must quote also this exquisite translation of the French verses to which
George Du Maurier	ORGANIZATION	gave such wide popularity a few years ago . ''

		Ah , brief is Life , Love 's short , sweet way , With dreaming 's rife .

		And then Good-day !

		`` And Life is vain Hope 's vague delight , Grief 's transient pain , And then Good-night ! ''

		There is a marked contrast between the volume just noticed and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	's `` The Martyr 's Idyl , and Shorter Poems . ''

		If the tendency of the former was toward a sweetness well-nigh cloying and the gentle melancholy of subdued utterance , the ten - dency of the latter is rather toward heightened passion and something like asperity of expression .

		The larger titular poem is a legend from the
Acta Sanctorum	PERSON	, dramatically told , and concerned with a '' Virgin Martyr '' whose story is not unlike that of the Elizabethan tragedy and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poem .

		Among the shorter poems we find nothing more quotable than the set of sapphics entitled '' Charista Musing . ''

		THE DIAL 53 ''
Moveless	PERSON	, on the marge of a sunny cornfield , Rapt in sudden revery while thou standest , Like the sheaves , in beautiful Doric yellow Clad to the ankle , '' Oft to thee with delicate hasty footstep So I steal , and suffer because I find thee Only flown , and only a fallen feather Left of ray darling . ''

		Give me back thy wakening breath , thy ringlets Fragrant as the vine of the bean in blossom , And those eyes of violet dusk and daylight Under sea-water , '' Eyes too far away , and too full of longing !

		Yes : and go not heavenward where I lose thee , Go not , go not whither I can not follow , Being but earthly , '' Willing swallow poised upon my finger , Little wild-wing ever from me escaping , For the care thou art to me , I thy lover Love thee , and fear thee . ''

		This is charming , but not exactly typical , for
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	's inspiration is mainly spiritual , and religious mysticism is the fundamental note of her song .

		She is more truthfully represented by this
D.O.	LOCATION	M. prayer . ''

		All else for use , one only for desire ; Thanksgiving for the good , but thirst for Thee : Up from the best , whereof no man need tire , Impel thou me . ''

		Delight is menace , if Thou brood not by , Power a quicksand , Fame a gathering jeer .

		Oft as the morn -LRB- though none of earth deny These three are dear -RRB- , '' Wash me of them , that I may be renewed , Nor wall in clay my agonies and joys : close my hand upon Beatitude !

		Not on her toys . '' ''

		Out of the Nest , '' by Miss
Mary McNeil Fen	PERSON	- ollosa , is a volume of graceful fancies and snatches of song , divided about equally between oriental and occidental themes .

		From the former category we select this invocation to Fujisan : '' thou divine , remote , ineffable !

		Thou cone of visions based on level sea , Thou ache of joy in pale eternity , Thou gleaming pearl in night 's encrusted shell , Thou frozen ghost , thou crystal citadel , Heart-hushed I gaze , until there seems to be Nothing in heaven or earth , but thee and me ; 1 the faint echo , thou the crystal bell . ''

		This accumulation of metaphors is rather effective , and serves well to illustrate the writer 's style .

		Of the occidental pieces -LRB- so-called because they are not oriental -RRB- , the verses entitled '' Roses '' are as pretty as any . ''

		What shall I send to my sweet to-night ?

		Roses of yellow , or pink , or white ?

		Gold for her smile , and her sunny hair ?

		Pink for the flush that her cheeks will wear ?

		White for her soul , and the secrets there ? ''

		Which shall she lay on her breast of snow ?

		Is it a prophecy ?

		Weal or woe ?

		Yellow for gold , and the world 's decree !

		Pink for a love and its ecstasy !

		White for the robe of a saint to be ! ''

		Strange , how I shrink from the frail design !

		'T is but a fancy , a whim of mine .

		Fate does not come at a lover 's call , To lurk in the rose of a girl 's first ball .

		I think I '11 take violets , after all . ''

		The religious note is dominant in the '' Voices '' of Mrs.
Katharine Coolidge	PERSON	-LRB- who is , by the way , a daughter of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	-RRB- , but their tonic -LRB- in more senses than one -RRB- is a note of joyous acceptance of the whole of life , its buffets no less than its favors .

		The very first page sounds this clarion call to the soul : '' Awake !

		Fear not the perilled heights of strife 1 Great love and joy ; strong suffering and sin , With strenuous , upreaching vision , rise Beyond the veil , lifting us on to win Possession of the power that purifies ; Flame leaps to flame , and God hath given thee life ! ''

		Again we are told that '' Life to know life must pass through shades of death ,
Night	ORGANIZATION	touches day , and near to heaven is hell .

		Sinner or saint then , he who dauntless gives His heart 's blood to the world , supremely lives . ''

		And still again we read : '' Give thanks to Life if thou art tempest-hurled Through the abyss to feel the pulsing world !

		Of joy and pain reborn , thy life shall be , The boundless silence compassing the earth , The love that blossoms in the springtide 's birth , The vibrant force of the far-shining sea . ''

		In other moods , however , the strenuous spiritual life that is voiced in the foregoing extracts gives place to the plea for quietism , a plea made many times in the course of this volume , and not infre - quently with the exquisite grace of these lines to '' Dreamland . ''

		`` 0 holy Hypnos , listen to my prayer : Touch my closed eyelids with thy magic wand , That I may seek far bourns of
Lethe	LOCATION	's land , And find the key of vision hidden there , Dreamily drifting through the hazy blue , To palaces where all that seems is true . ''

		There dwell pure spirits of the forms on earth : The whispered secret of the woods at even , White flame of stars that glow in highest heaven , The arcana of the springtide 's wonder-birth ; The lily 's heart , the rainbow 's mystery , And the deep anthem of the encircling sea . ''

		This volume of '' Voices '' is characterized through - out by beautiful expression of the higher spiritual sort , as well as by a verse-technique that leaves little to be desired .

		The Puritan as colonist and reformer .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In the book entitled '' The Puritan as a Colonist and Reformer '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Ezra Hoyt Byington	PERSON	delivers a plain and unvarnished account of the Puritan in the double capacity indicated .

		This account is appreciative but not extravagant .

		While making it very clear that the Puritan , in respect to political , civil , and religious freedom , was in advance , and much in advance , of his time , Mr.
Byington	PERSON	makes it equally plain that he had his unpleasant limitations .

		For example , he introduces his account of the treatment of the Quakers and Baptists in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	with this frank admission : '' Among the weaknesses and inconsistencies of the 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
Puritans	LOCATION	, we must place their treatment of those who differed with them .

		They were very earnest in claiming liberty for themselves , but the majority of them were not willing to concede the same lib - erty to others . ''

		This is the plain fact , and no parad - ing of the extravagancies of the Quakers or of the Baptists can obscure it .

		Among the best chapters of the book , because the least hackneyed , are those on ''
John Eliot	PERSON	, the Apostle to the Indians , '' ''
Jona	PERSON	- than
Edwards	PERSON	and the Great Awakening , '' and ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the Puritans , '' the first being the best of the three .

		It gives us a moving picture of the heroic effort made by
John Eliot	PERSON	and his asso - ciates and compeers to Christianize the Indians of
New England	LOCATION	, and the utter failure in which , after a period of strong encouragement , the effort ended .

		The '' praying Indians '' never recovered from the effects of
King Philip	LOCATION	's War , in which they were ground between the upper and nether millstones ; but there is , we fear , small reason to think that the result would have been different if that war had never been .

		The chapter on '' The Great Awak - ening '' would be better if there were more of it .

		Some matters should have been included that are not .

		Much , for example , is laid at the door of the `` half - way covenant , '' but we are not told what the half-way covenant was , and not all of us are theological scholars .

		Then we think the writer should have made more of his opportunity to show the effect upon practice of fundamental theories in connection with native traits of character .

		He cor - rectly attributes much of the irreligion prevailing just before the Great Awakening to the extreme form of Calvinistic theology that prevailed , but there is much more in the matter than he has brought out .

		The chapter on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, while in no sense profound , will be informing to many readers , and interesting to still more .

		The book is a useful con - tribution to the extensive literature of this great subject .

		Cromwell at Lieut.-Colonel
T. S. Baldock	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	, matter of the furnishes the fifth volume of the `` Wolseley Series , '' in his `` Crom - well as a Soldier '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		As the title indicates , the work is primarily adapted to the student of military history , or to the ambitious tac - tician ; yet so clear are its accounts of manoeuvers even in detail , and so delightful its narrative style , that one unfamiliar with military technicalities may read it with understanding and interest .

		Prelim - inary to the real matter , however , a brief outline of the military organization of
England	LOCATION	before the civil war is given , together with an account of the battles antecedent to
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's appearance upon the field .

		The bulk of the work is devoted to a careful examination into
Cromwell	PERSON	's organization of the New Model , and a logical analysis of those ac - tions in which he had a personal share .

		Basing his arguments upon his own clear deductions then ,
Colonel Baldock	PERSON	credits
Cromwell	PERSON	's victories almost solely to his ability as an organizer and tactician : a conclusion quite new to readers of the civil war historical period .

		Without exception , the political historians of the times lay stress upon the religious enthusiasm of the New Model as the cause of vic - tories , in which
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's indirect share is due to his discovery of the fanatically religious soldier .

		To this ,
Colonel Baldock	PERSON	says : '' Stern fanatics as were his troopers , their victories were won , not by superior enthusiasm , but by superior organization and military training . ''

		In support of this , it is shown that
Cromwell	PERSON	's discipline was extreme , that his understanding of correct tactical principles was far beyond that of any other man of his time , and that the distinct advance made in the efficiency of the cavalry arm of the service during the civil war was due entirely to the military genius of its com - mander-in-chief .

		The period was , in fact , one in which the art of warfare was rapidly changing .

		The professional soldier was disappearing before the citizen warrior a patriot who desired the end of the war rather than to prolong it .

		Thus the age of maneuvers and of sieges was succeeded by the sharp attack and the decisive victory .

		In this ren - aissance period of the art of war , the author regards
Cromwell	PERSON	as the best exponent of the new method , and indeed as an innovator whose real genius in war explained his wonderful successes .

		The reader is indebted to
Colonel Baldock	PERSON	's work for refresh - ing light upon the character as well as the achieve - ments of the master spirit of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		He learns not alone to appreciate and admire the military sagacity of the general , but he can not help an added enthusiasm for the man , whose real great - ness in war shows a breadth of mind which makes him the less a bigot in religion .

		The charm of bygone manners and customs , bygone superstititions , by - gone imaginings , and bygone ideals , makes a great deal of the pleasure to be had from Mr.
Clyde Furst	PERSON	's little volume , '' A Group of Old Authors '' -LRB-
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The five separate studies , used before publication as popular lectures , concern themselves with
John Donne	PERSON	, the mediaeval story of
Griselda	LOCATION	, the voyages of St.
Brendan	PERSON	and
Maelduin	PERSON	,
Aldhelrn	PERSON	, and the
Beowulf	LOCATION	.

		In the first , the author essays the difficult task of making his readers realize the poetic qualities of the verse of a man of whom the world knows little , many-sided genius though he was .

		Donne the man was a stronger figure than
Donne	PERSON	the poet , and our author 's appreciative study does not make our interest in his verse more than merely intellectual .

		The second of the articles is a brief retelling of the tenth story of the '' Decameron , '' the clerk 's tale from
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, followed by an account of the vari - ous other forms which the story took in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Both
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	made use of the material of which the next study treats , and the legend is of peculiar interest , both because of its spread in different forms among European peoples , and because of the human feeling of which Early English life .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 it is an expression .

		It is a story of miraculous ad - ventures met with in the search for fabled islands of the western seas , symbols of those things toward which man 's aspiration looks with eternal longing .

		Though they have clearly come from some such place , these little studies are all of them free from any unpleasant suggestions of the scholar 's work - room .

		They will not , perhaps , have a very large audience , but so much of the glow and color of old times is in them that they might well have .

		The Beowulf story , told in simple nineteenth century prose , should interest anyone , and the time is com - ing when the legends and myths of our own
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	ancestors will be of equal importance in our eyes with those of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Furst	PERSON	's volume is in part an attempt to popularize them , and , while dealing with facts and so marshalling them as to prepare for scholarly conclusions from them , he has been concerned mainly to entertain his readers with some things well worth knowing .

		The book should while away a pleasant hour or two , and leave the reader a little richer in love and lore of old-time poesy and story .

		An argument Though not disguising in the least for abandoning the fact that the only reason the American ideal , .

		United States can find for departing from its old traditions is a mercenary one , Professor
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	's volume on '' The Expansion of Western Ideals '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- is a labored attempt to justify aggression and conquest under the plea that the time has come for us to be like
Great Britain	LOCATION	in colonizing localities remote from our own national domain .

		To do this , he is compelled to ignore the fact that this country is a democracy , and that it has domestic problems of the gravest moment wholly unsolved at home , just as he ignores the dealings of white Americans through our his - tory with the the Indian , the Negro , and the Alas - kan native .

		In exchange for our policy of unen - tangled peace , he offers the glittering bauble of an alliance with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and a '' world 's peace '' of which we and our new allies are to be the self - constituted guardians .

		If we fail to do this , we are warned that we shall be shut out of the world 's commerce in after years , nothing being said of the shutting of ourselves from the world 's commerce during a long generation .

		There are but two forces on the earth , Professor Waldstein avers , the British and the Russians ; and the time is at hand when we , like the Bezonian , must array ourselves under one king or the other , must '' speak , or die ! ''

		It need hardly be said that nothing more is promised us than increased commerce , except the possibility of our colonial administration becoming so excellent that it will drive us at home to better government the lesson of the Reconstruction era in the South and the recent letting down of the civil service be - ing ignored .

		Finally , it is to be distinctly under - stood from the entire book that the '' expansion '' to which the writer would see our '' western ideals '' subjected is the laying off all American ideals and substituting for them a complete suit of the British ideals to which his long residence in an English university has accustomed him .

		The '' Letters of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are arranged in four groups , one on musical topics , writ - ten to his wife , and the remainder the result of three literary friendships .

		Most of the letters have been printed in various magazine articles , but have never before appeared as a collection .

		They furnish data of
Lanier	PERSON	's life between
1866	DATE	and
1881	DATE	, and evince its cheerfulness in the midst of depressing surround - ings , and its exquisite response to the best in music and in art .

		The letters to his wife reveal the inmost man , as the others do the inner .

		As the series of letters comprising his correspondence with Mr.
Pea	PERSON	- cock progresses , one reads the story too brief , indeed of a friend who could never have been disappointing to his earliest avowed appreciator , as also it is plain that Mr.
Peacock	PERSON	was no disappoint - ment to him .

		Lanier the man shows larger ^ han
Lanier	PERSON	the poet : his delicate sympathy and fine nobil - ity of character are here clearly cut as in silhouette .

		The letters bear witness to
Lanier	PERSON	's gratitude for worthy suggestions , social opportunity , and the friendship of other poets , blessings brought within his reach by the generous critic-editor .

		The third section of the book gives letters that passed between
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	; and if the reader here feels that the younger poet was giving more , in the mutual giving , than his older world-worn friend , the wealth of friendship and tender solicitude with which
Lanier	PERSON	was endowed appear all the more clearly .

		The last group comprises letters to
Paul Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	, illustrating the warm feeling be - tween the two poets , together with
Lanier	PERSON	's detailed criticism and praise of
Hayne	PERSON	's verses , and contain - ing the interesting avowal that music , not poetry , was the main interest of
Lanier	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Sad as were the external facts of
Lanier	PERSON	's existence , involving poverty , ill health , and anxiety , and unreconciled to his early death as many lovers of his work must be , one can not but feel , while reading the record these letters give , that here was a man who con - quered , who passed out of life a victor .

		In a little volume of delightful inter - est , ``
Jane Austen	PERSON	, Her Contempo - raries and Herself '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , Mr.
Walter Herries Pollock	PERSON	talks sympathetically of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the woman and her art , considered with reference to the work of
Miss Burney	LOCATION	,
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	, and
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	.

		The book is a piece of discriminating and careful criticism , written in an easy conversational vein that only occasionally loses its sparkle by a parenthetical or other slipshod expression .

		Perhaps few of us have so great an interest in
Jane Austen	PERSON	as our author fancies , and perhaps , in spite of Scott 's encomiums and
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's praise , she is not quite so near to Shakespeare as he would have us believe .

		It is true that more A comparative study of

		56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, art is required for the portraying of commonplace characters than for the delineation of striking indi - vidualities ; but , granting that
Miss Austen	PERSON	's char - acters are at once commonplace and well-painted , must it not occur to the critic , even in this age of realism , that an author who presents only people already familiar to us is lacking in artistic judg - ment ?

		Prose fiction is of interest to us because it appeals to our emotions ; but it should also enlarge our experience both of persons and places .

		Modern readers are not content to find pleasure in a novel by reason of their ability to verify the characters through their own memories as they go along .

		It is refreshing , however , to have Mr.
Pollock	PERSON	's assur - ance that Miss
Austen	PERSON	's figures were never photo - graphic reproductions , for we are a little tired of the camera , and are glad to be reminded that in the days of '' Pride and Prejudice '' the snap-shot was unknown .

		All in all , the book is pleasantly written , presents fairly the artistic qualities of Miss Aus - ten 's work without ignoring her limitations , and adds .

		some very pertinent comment on the relation of her writings to those of her contemporaries .

		An expounder The recent publication of Mr.
Joel ofthepoetry Benton	PERSON	's `` In the Poe Circle '' has of Emenon .

		brought again into notice his two essays on ''
Emerson	PERSON	as a Poet , '' originally published in
1882	DATE	, and now reissued -LRB-
Mansfield & Wessels	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with the useful selected bibliography brought up to date , and with the partial concordance by Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- nedy .

		The undertaking to extend the circle of the readers of
Emerson	LOCATION	's poetry is commendable , and such critical judgments as the following , permeated with the writer 's enthusiasm and illustrated with liberal quotation from the poems , may well have this result .

		Emerson , like
Browning	PERSON	, says the critic , is obscure , but his dimness '' seems more directly a necessary incident , and less an invention . '' ''

		May he not at least be placed along with
Browning	PERSON	? ''

		The admirer can not furnish the indifferent with the seeing eye and the hearing ear , needed to appre - ciate justly '' the most pure , aerial and divinely souled poetry since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's music became measured and still . ''

		Mr.
Benton	PERSON	defends
Emer	PERSON	- son 's alleged technical deficiency , finding beauties where others see flaws .

		Though of Oriental con - tent , this poetry is essentially Northern and Gothic , and is marked by high majesty and solemnity , even by religious sanctity .

		There is '' a constant relation to the breadth of some endless horizon . ''

		The reader need not agree with every dictum of Mr.
Benton	PERSON	's ; but if he takes
Emerson	PERSON	's poems from their shelf to read them anew , the critic will have proved his inspiration .

		The way of the world is to atone for past injustice to genius by raising in after generations an altar bearing the name of the unappreciated one , who now is exalted to god-like proportions .

		Poe 's fame is just now experiencing a season of deification .

		Since the More of the celebration of

		celebration at
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	of the semi-centennial of the poet 's death , nothing is too good to be said of him , even though some of the saying is ill-judged .

		Unless the search for exact truth which is the distinguishing mark of the present age shall disappear , we may hope some day to possess a wholly accurate as well as wholly sympa - thetic biography of this cloud-enshrouded contem - porary , and also -LRB- although already Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	has largely furnished this -RRB- an estimate of his work which , while sacrificing nothing of the enthusiasm due to native ability , shall at the same time shun unqualified laudation .

		Meanwhile we must put up with essay-writing that proceeds as if , once for all , a man had been found without human limitations .

		Perhaps it is hardly fair thus to introduce Mr.
Henry Austin	PERSON	's historical and critical commentary , accompanying three volumes of the '' Raven '' edi - tion of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's selected tales -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- .

		And yet under these comments lies the assumption , which rears its head high on occasion , that when all is said there is no other writer , certainly no other writer of his time , worthy of comparison with him who was at the same time a Baltimorean and '' a Bostonian . ''

		One suspects the breadth of such a critic 's reading , as one is made certain of the carelessness of the critic 's style , despite his facility in making a telling phrase .

		The historical setting of the tales is given with frequent suggestiveness , and , after all , pardon should be ready for the fault of loving too much .

J. P. Fruit	PERSON	has read and as studied in re-read the whole of

		He has also consulted masters of the critic 's art like
Pater	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		He has intended to absorb the whole of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetic spirit , and for the time being declares that he has shut out all rival authors .

		If it is indeed sufficient to record subjective impres - sions , then the author of '' The Mind and Art of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's Poetry '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- has performed his duty , even if he has left something to be desired in defi - niteness of impression and , occasionally , in judicial discrimination .

		Surely few would agree that '' The Bells '' is
Poe	PERSON	's most nearly perfect poem .

		In the first part of his book Professor Fruit traces the de - velopment of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's mind in his poetry , which , he thinks , is marked by the following stages : First was the aim to interest the reader in himself as an ill-fated young man of genius , a Platonist yet a pes - simist .

		Then the poet devoted himself to beauty , in distrust of the scientific spirit .

		Next , poetry itself was the chief object of his thought ; and thus , having become a conscious artist , he produced his consummate poem by a chosen method the ono - matopoetic .

		The second part of the book follows the poems chronologically once more , with the pur - pose of showing
Poe	PERSON	's gradual gain in his art , involving a penchant for allegory , until `` The Raven , '' a masterpiece , is followed by a succession of master-strokes , and again '' The Bells '' crowns

		The third contains '' Richelieu , '' '' The Fool 's Revenge , '' ''
Brutus	PERSON	, '' '' Ruy Bias , '' and ''

		These sixteen plays consti - tuted Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's customary repertoire , although he occasionally produced a number of others .

		In fact , '' The Lady of Lyons '' and `` A New Way to Pay Old Debts '' seem to belong in such a collection as this .

		The increased attention given of late to cryptogramic botany in this country is once more signalized by the simultaneous appearance of two volumes devoted to the Myxomycetes and their allies .

		Professor

Arthur	PERSON	, the coming of Augus - tine , and the deeds of Alfred .

		The author 's experi - ment seems to us singularly successful , and students of early English history and literature alike should be grateful to him for his undertaking .

		Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	, the veteran journalist , has be - guiled the spare hours of his later years by preparing a translation of '' The Roman History of Appian of
Alex	PERSON	- andria '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is published in two band - some volumes .

		Since the work is indispensable for the study of Roman history , and the last preceeding English translation was made more than two centuries ago , the justification for Mr.
White	PERSON	's work is apparent .

		While this version is , in a sense , the work of an amateur , it has been conscientiously made , and has occupied the translator for five years .

		It has , moreover , had the benefit of revision at the hands of a professional clas - sical scholar , so that no doubt need be harbored con - cerning its accuracy .

		Recent English texts for school use include the fol - lowing : `` Selections from Landor '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Professor
A. G. Newcomer	PERSON	; Shakespeare 's '' Macbeth '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Professor
L. A. Sherman	PERSON	; `` Repre - sentative Poems of
Robert Burns	PERSON	'' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Charles Lane Hanson	PERSON	;
George Eliot	PERSON	's `` Silas Mar - ner '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Dr.
G. A. Wauchope	PERSON	; four books of Pope 's Homer -LRB-
Sanborn	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Philip Gentner	PERSON	; `` The Sir Roger de Coverley Papers '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- , edited by Professors
F. T. Baker	PERSON	and
Richard Jones	PERSON	; `` Milton 's Shorter Poems and Sonnets '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Frederick D. Nichols	PERSON	; and Chaucer 's '' Prologue , Knight 's Tale , and Nun 's Priest 's Tale '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Dr.
Frank Jewett Mather	PERSON	, and forming two numbers of the '' Riverside Literature Series . ''

		The chafing-dish having come to play so prominent a part in modern social functions , a liberal repertory of feasible dishes is highly desirable .

		Mrs.
Janet McKenzie Hill	PERSON	's book of '' Salads , Sandwiches , and Chafing-dish Dainties '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives many original dishes , thirty-two with illustrations .

		The very attractive form of the book fits it to go along with the pretty adjuncts of the chafing-dish supper .

		58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, NOTES .

		A translation of the '' Thsetetus '' of Plato , with an elaborate introduction , the work of Dr.
S. W. Dyde	PERSON	, is published by the
Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A novel by Mr.
Nelson Lloyd	PERSON	of the
New York	LOCATION	Sun , '' entitled '' The Chronic Loafer , '' will be published shortly by
Messrs J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	is the publisher of a ''
Maude Adams	PERSON	'' acting edition of '' Romeo and Juliet . ''

		The drawings which illustrate this volume are both numer - ous and charming .

		Two interesting announcements in the '' American Statesmen Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are volumes on
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, by his son , and
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, by Mr.
Moorfield Storey	PERSON	.

		The selling record of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' is one of the most remarkable of recent years , the book having been published but three months and the editions reaching 200,000 copies .

		Two addresses on
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, originally deliv - ered before the
Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
W. M. Salter	PERSON	, are now put together into a booklet bearing the imprint of Mr.
S. Burns Weston	PERSON	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. ''

		Nature Pictures by American Poets '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , edited by Mrs.
Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	, and '' The Poetry of American Wit and Humor '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , edited by Mr.
R. L. Paget	PERSON	, are two recently-published anthologies . ''

		On the Theory and Practice of Art-Enamelling upon Metals , '' by Mr.
Henry Cunynghame	PERSON	, is published by the
Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a practical treatise upon a subject that has been in much need of such a manual . ''

		Scribner 's Magazine '' for
February	DATE	will contain a description of '' Ik Marvel 's '' life at ''
Edgewood	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
A. R. Kimball	PERSON	, and the frontispiece of the number will be a drawing of the veteran author reproduced in color .

		The remarkable collection of original sketches and rare prints now being used for illustrating the life of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	in `` The Century Magazine '' have been put on exhibition at Brentauo 's
Chicago	LOCATION	store , 218 Wabash avenue .

		Volumes VIII .

		and IX .

		of the '' Eversley '' Shake - speare , edited by Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	, bring that most acceptable edition within one number of its com - pletion .

		The
Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, we need hardly add , are the publishers of this work .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce the first Amer - ican edition in the original tongue of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's '' Die
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
T. S. Baker	PERSON	.

		The firm also states that the 36th edition of '' The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	'' has just been put to press .

		Professor
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	's '' Outlines of
General History	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the latest candidate for the favor of teachers who have charge of this subject .

		It is a text-book of the modern scholarly type , interestingly written , and mechanically attractive .

		A very convenient book of general reference , of pocketable dimensions , is the ''
Twentieth Century Handy Cyclopedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of between four hundred and five hundred pages , thumb-indexed , with maps and other illustrations . ''

		Wotan ,
Siegfried	PERSON	, and Briinnhilde , '' by Miss
Anna Alice Chapin	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , is a third volume in this writer 's series of expositions of
Wagner	PERSON	for young people .

		The three character-studies are intelligently done , in simple language -LRB- a little too high-flown here and there -RRB- , and has illustrations in musical notation . ''


John Selden	PERSON	and his Table Talk , '' by Mr.
Robert Waters	PERSON	, is the title of a volume recently published by
Messrs. Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	.

		About one-fourth of this pleasant little book is the author 's own ; the major por - tion being given up to the genial seventeenth century scholar with whom the work is concerned . ''

		Illustrations of Logic , '' by Mr.
Paul T. Lafleur	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a small volume , containing three hundred brief extracts from general literature which are peculiarly susceptible of logical analysis , and , as such , provide the most help - ful sort of material for teachers of the subject .

		An accurate and well-printed map of
Paris	LOCATION	, designed to meet the requirements of the American tourist , is published by
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cloth case into which the map is folded contains also a booklet giving a complete list of thoroughfares , public buildings , trans - portation lines , and all points of interest to the traveller . ''

		Twelve English Poets , '' from Chaucer to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, are exhibited by Miss
Blanche Wilder Bellamy	PERSON	in a recently published volume -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		Each part has a brief sketch and a rather voluminous series of extracts .

		The purpose of the book is '' to show to young readers what has been the direct line of descent of English poetry . '' ''

		The
Temple Treasury	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , in two volumes , is `` a Biblical diary compiled with references . ''

		This means that for each day of the year there are two selec - tions , representing the Old and New Testaments re - spectively , and that marginal indications direct the reader to cognate passages found elsewhere in the Scrip - tures .

		The Dent imprint upon these volumes is a war - rant for their tastefulness . ''

		The Family of the Sun '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a book of astronomy for children , by Professor
E. S. Holdeu	PERSON	.

		It offers an excellent account of the solar system in simple language .

		The same author has just published , in the '' American Science Series '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , an '' Elementary Astronomy , '' which is condensed from the larger work in the same series written some years ago in collabora - tion with Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	.

		The committee of which Professor
Charles Eliot	PERSON	Nor - ton is chairman has purchased the library of Romance literature once owned by
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, con - taining more than 700 volumes , and the collection will be taken from
Elmwood	LOCATION	to the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	, where it will be known as the
Lowell Memorial Library of Romance Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		The funds to purchase the books were subscribed in answer to an appeal made last
February	DATE	.

		Few Americans of the elder generation will fail to recall the song of '' The Rain on the Roof , '' one of the most popular pieces of song-verse ever produced in this country .

		Its author , Col.
Coates Kinney	PERSON	, has recently included this and other familiar pieces in a volume of verse issued by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title '' Mists of Fire . ''

		Old readers as well as new ones will be glad to have this tasteful souvenir of a veteran and popular writer . ''

		A Guide to the Operas , '' by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , gives descriptions of twenty-nine works by twelve composers .

		The descriptions are something more than the meagre outlines of plot usually given in such works as this , and embody many intelligent hints for
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 the musical comprehension of the works considered .

		The selection is at least practical , for it keeps close to the familiar
Grau	PERSON	repertoire , and the illustrations are , appropriately enough , costumed portraits of the singers with whom the public is best acquainted . ''

		A Syllabus of Psychology , '' by Dr.
James H. Hyslop	PERSON	, and '' A Syllabus of an Introduction to
Phil	PERSON	- osophy , '' by Dr.
Walter T. Marvin	PERSON	, are recent publica - tions of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		While prepared for the use of college classes , these syllabi are of wider inter - est , presenting , as they do , a conspectus of the two subjects concerned in such a way as to prove helpful to the general reader .

		This statement is particularly true of Dr.
Marvin	PERSON	's work , which is more than a sylla - bus , strictly speaking , and has some of the character - istics of a treatise upon its subject .

		The latest addition to the '' Temple Classics '' offers a new and welcome departure from what have hitherto been the limitations of the series .

		It is a translation , by Mrs.
Muriel Press	PERSON	, of the ''
Laxdale Saga	PERSON	, '' and other sagas are promised if the success of this one shall war - rant the undertaking .

		Since the death of
William Morris	PERSON	cut short the comprehensive '' Saga Library '' upon which he was engaged , we trust that the work of popularizing these Icelandic masterpieces may be car - ried on by the editor of the present series .

		One has only to acquire a taste for this sort of reading to want as much of it as he can get .

		We hardly think of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as a poet espe - cially in need of the services of the illustrator , but the volume of '' Poems by Matthew Arnold '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- for which Mr.
Henry Ospovat	PERSON	has made a series of draw - ings , and for which Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	has written a critical introduction , is a pleasant book to have , and we will not quarrel with its idea .

		The selection of poems is such that a pictorial accompaniment is not forced , although
Arnold	LOCATION	would doubtless experience a feeling of mild surprise could he view the types of character and imaginative construction that his poems have sug - gested to the artist of the present volume .

		Mrs.
Walford	PERSON	's name first became familiar to read - ers with the publication of ` Mr.
Smith	PERSON	: A Part of His Life . '

		It was an admirable book one of the cleverest of the minor novels of her generation .

		... It has had many successors , not all of which were of equal rank , though ' The Baby 's Grandmother ' is a fascinating bit of work .

		All were natural , fresh , and more or less piquant , all were interesting , for that is one quality at least which this writer never lacks .

		She has the art to make live before us a man 's deep love , a girl 's shy and passionate response , and if her types are on the whole few , she knows them thoroughly and makes us know them , too .

		Now , after many years , she returns to something like the theme of her first success ... the prettiest of love stories , and strewn along its course are some little studies of modern English character and society that are full of truth and humor . ''

JOHN RUSKIN	PERSON	.

		Within a few days of the completion of his eighty-first year , death has crowned the labors of
John Raskin	PERSON	, and he has entered the com - pany of the immortals .

		There is no English - man of his intellectual and moral stature left alive ; his peers have all gone before him , and now the last of the great spirits who have shaped for our Victorian age its ethical and sesthetical ideals has been gathered to his rest . ''

		As he willed , he worked : And , as he worked , he wanted not , be sure .

		Triumph his whole life through , submitting work To work 's right judges , never to the wrong , To competency , not ineptitude . ''

		His life was so complete , so filled with mani - fold serviceable activities , so rich in the garner of life 's best fruits , that we can not deplore his death , however sincere our mourning , but must rather be touched with a deep solemnity at the thought of what he did and what he was , min - gled with a deep gratitude for the example of his consecrated days .

		His work for mankind was ended a full decade ago , and the peaceful hours that were given him after his pen had been laid aside removed him so entirely from any sort of contact with the active world that his continued bodily presence among men has been difficult to realize . ''

		The soul that 's tutelary now Till time end , o'er the world to teach and bless '' has seemed to us hardly more than a disem - bodied spirit since the year when those '' Prae - terita '' which we were reading with such eager interest met with their final interruption , and became themselves things of that past with which they were concerned .


John Raskin	PERSON	was born at
Herne Hill	ORGANIZATION	, a Lon - don suburb , on the eighth of
February , 1819	DATE	.

		He died
January 20 , 1900	DATE	, at his Lake Coun - try home ,
Brantwood	LOCATION	, in
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	, where some - thing like the last score of his years were spent .

		His intellectual activity covers a period of nearly sixty years , for his precocity was marked , and he wrote creditable verses at the age of ten or thereabouts .

		At fifteen we find him contributing to a periodical of popular science papers with such titles as '' Enquiries on the Causes of the Color of the Water of the Rhine '' and '' Facts and Considerations on the Strata 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of Mont Blanc . ''

		From this time until his physical breakdown at the age of seventy , there is no year that does not add its title or titles to the bibliography of his writings , the mere list of which , without comment , would nearly , if not quite , fill up all the space here at our command .

		And what memories these titles evoke in the minds of men and women to whom the message of
Ruskin	PERSON	has come as a veritable new gospel of beauty and the conduct of life !

		They think of `` Modern Painters , '' `` The Stones of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' '' The Seven Lamps of Architecture , '' and recall the quickened vision , the new appreciation , the deepened insight , which the reading of these books has brought them when viewing the cities and the galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They think of `` Sesame and Lilies '' and '' The Queen of the Air , '' and re - call the stimulus and the fresh inspiration that these books have brought to the study of liter - ature .

		They think of '' The Crown of Wild Olive '' and '' The Ethics of the Dust , '' and recall their realization of the unity of truth and goodness and beauty , their first sense of the fashion in which the cultivated intelligence apprehends the most diverse of phenomena as related to the same central set of ideals , in thought welding beauty to utility , and art to the practical conduct of life .

		They think of Munera Pulveris '' and '' Unto This Last , '' and recall the heightened sense of social solid - arity which they derived from these books , the view of human intercourse as a complex of mu - tual obligations , the doctrine of duties applied as a corrective to the doctrine of rights .

		Finally , they think of '' Fors Clavigera '' and '' Prae - terita , '' and recall the unselfish character and single-hearted devotion to the service of human - ity which these books so unconsciously portray , while love and reverence for the writer become blended into one emotion of thankfulness for all of his gifts to mankind , the most precious of them all being the gift of himself .

		Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	's career has two well-defined periods .

		During the first , he was essentially a teacher of art ; during the second , he was essentially a teacher of ethics .

		The year
1860	DATE	marks the grand climacteric of his life , for it saw the completion of '' Modern Painters '' and the inauguration , with '' Unto this Last , '' of the long series of the writings which are concerned with men in their social relations .

		When the turn - ing-point was reached , he was about forty years of age , he had become the foremost writer of his time upon the subject of the fine arts , he had forced an unwilling public to recognize the genius of the great landscape painter of En - gland , he had become the interpreter of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, and
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	, and many other great artists hitherto imperfectly appreciated or not at all , he had espoused the cause of the Pre-Raphael - ites , given effective aid to their propaganda , and had befriended them individually when help was most grateful , he had made himself one of the greatest masters of English prose , thereby increasing tenfold his influence as a critic of art , he had , finally , been called upon to bear his portion of the private grief which is the common lot of men , and the brief chapter of his domestic happiness had come to an end .

		His work done in the field of art criticism has called forth an enormous amount of discussion , in the form of both approval and dissent .

		At ; first , his opinions excited violent antagonism ; then , for a period , the force of his eloquence seemed to carry everything before it ; then , again , a marked reaction set in , and a deliber - ate effort was made to belittle his achievements and minimise his influence .

		We do not think that the two parties to this controversy have ever joined issue fairly and squarely .

		We may allow the justice of much that has been said by his hostile critics by Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	, for example , and Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	yet admit almost to the full what has been claimed for him by the most earnest of his champions .

		Both par - ties are right , in some sense .

		For the attack , we may say that his specific judgments were often wrong , that his bestowal of praise was exaggerated beyond all reason , that his ad - vice to painters was frequently impracticable , and that his influence upon contemporary ar - tists was slight .

		But for the defence we must also say something .

		We must say , for example , that he made the general English public think more seriously about art than it had ever done before .

		We must say that his writings opened eyes by the thousands that had hitherto been blind , and , if those eyes did not see just what he would have had them see , they were at least opened to some kind of truth that would not have been revealed to them at all except for his influence .

		We must say , also , that he gave to the pursuit and study of art a dignity that it had never known before , by virtue of his constant insistence upon the relation of art to morality , his unalterable determination to judge of artistic work from other standpoints than the narrow one of technique , and the prophetic fervor with which he proclaimed the gospel , not of art for art 's sake , but of art for the sake of man 's temporal delight and eternal salvation .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 The change that came over the complexion of Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	's thought in his early forties was very marked .

		He had outgrown the narrow - ness of his early beliefs , his sympathies had broadened , he had learned that life was more than art , he had resolved to do what he might to bring practical counsel and effective help to his fellow-men .

		At first , and for ten years or thereabouts , he confined himself for the most part to his writings , which now acquire for themselves a range that they had not known before ; then , with the fortune which had come to him upon the death of his father , and which he felt that he was to hold in trust only , he set about doing things , he began the publication of the ''
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, '' and instituted the
Guild of St. George	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the first letter of '' Fors , '' he thus stated his programme in gen - eral terms : '' I am not an unselfish person , nor an Evangelical one ; I have no particular pleasure in doing good ; neither do I dislike doing it so much as to expect to be rewarded for it in another world .

		But I simply can not paint , nor read , nor look at minerals , nor do anything else that I like , and the very light of the
morning	TIME	sky , when there is any which is seldom , now-a-days , near
London	LOCATION	has become hateful to me , because of the misery that I know of , and see signs of , where I know it not , which no imagination can interpret too bitterly .

		Therefore , as I have said , I will endure it no longer quietly ; but henceforward , with any few or many who will help , do my poor best to abate this misery . ''

		That so radical a programme as Mr. liuskin marked out for his declining years was fore - doomed to failure , as far as practical outcome was concerned , must have appeared manifest to any temperate observer .

		He sought to re - construct English society , to counteract the combined forces of democratic impulse and economic law , to restore to the nineteenth cen - tury the ideals of the thirteenth .

		A few only of the items in this programme may be speci - fied .

		Railways were to be done away with , and labor-saving machinery abandoned .

		The taking of interest was to be held sinful , and the regime of status was to replace the regime of contract .

		Individual impulse was to be sup - pressed by the weight of a restored social hier - archy .

		The whole system of popular education was to be made over upon essentially mediaeval lines .

		These things , and many more like unto them , were urged with all the ingenuity of ar - gument and eloquence of appeal at the author 's command , and , as far as might be , he put these things into practical effect in his own life , and in the lives of those over whom he had any sort of control .

		No summary in the bare outline form just attempted is really fair to Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		The stupendous wrongheadedness of such a pro- gramme , so stated , merely repels , and we would not repel a single possible reader from even the most practically impossible of the books wherein the parts of this programme are set forth .

		The attitude of the sane intelligence toward these teachings is expressed by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	when he says : '' In one sense , no doubt , I stand at an opposite pole of ideas , and in literal and direct words , I could hardly adopt any one of the leading doctrines of his creed .

		As to mine , he probably rejects every - thing I hold sacred and true with violent indignation and scorn . ''

		Yet in spite of this divergence of positive belief , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has made the author the subject of one of the most glowing panegyrics ever penned , and he ex - presses what we believe will remain the delib - erate judgment of mankind when he goes on to speak in the following strain : '' Some day , perhaps , a future generation will be able to take up these outpourings of the spirit , not to criticise and condemn what they find there to dispute or to laugh at , but in the way in which sensible men read
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's 1 Republic , ' or the book of Ezekiel , or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, ' to enjoy the melody of the language , the inspir - ing poetry , and their apocalyptic visions , without being disturbed in the least by all that is mystical , fantastical , impossible in the ideal of humanity they present . ''

		In a word , the balance of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's teach - ings , whatever specific vagaries they may em - body , will rest upon the side of progress , of ethical inspiration , of worthy human activity , of all that is desirable for the uplifting of the race .

		In this belief , we would earnestly recom - mend the most extreme of his books , even '' Unto this Last , '' and the many volumes of the ''
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, '' not indeed as the best food for untrained minds , but as a helpful influ - ence to the cultivated intelligence , as a needed corrective for all that is unspiritual and mate - rialistic in the thought of the age .

		Their essential teaching is at one with that of the great leaders of man 's ethical and religious thought , and their perversity of utterance no more than an accident powerless to work last - ing injury .

		The gift of communion with such a spirit is one of the most precious that litera - ture can offer , and a deep sense of gratitude , of reverent affection , is what remains to us unshaken , after all possible exceptions have been taken , after all needful allowances have been made , when we think of the great work and the noble life that have ended in the clos -
ing year of the century	DATE	to which they have lent so imperishable a lustre .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, COMMUNICA TIONS .

		ON FRENCH AND ENGLISH POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The controversy which has been raging regarding the relative merits of French and English poetry , and which has lately been touched upon editorially in THE DIAL , is replete with much interest to one whose love embraces more than the poetry of his native tongue .

		It is need - less to say that most of the unfriendly criticisms offered in such comparison are not sufficiently cosmopolitan in spirit , and give little more than an individual stand - point .

		We here touch upon what has not been suffi - ciently emphasized , and what seems to me to be the essential test of the worth of any comparative study in French and English verse .

		How far does racial antago - nism or race-difference , which is the soul of idiom or language-difference , act as a barrier even to the best - trained minds in a just appreciation of the inmost spirit of any foreign tongue ?

		And how far is it only indi - vidual taste , such as might lead one in one 's own lan - guage to prefer one poet to another ?

		What factors are to be reckoned with more carefully than these ?

		Long before
Tennyson	PERSON	's or Arnold 's expressed indif - ference to the Alexandrine verse , voices were loud in
England	LOCATION	against French poetry .

		Keats , not without bitterness , condemned the entire classical literature , some of
France	LOCATION	's greatest names .

		They were `` closely wed To musty laws lined out with wretched rule And compass vile ; ... they went about , Holding a poor decrepit standard out Marked with most flimsy mottoes , and in large The name of one Boileau ! ''

		Before
Keats	PERSON	,
Dryden	PERSON	-LRB- otherwise a great admirer and follower of the French classics -RRB- severely criticized , in his preface to '' All for Love , ''
Racine	LOCATION	's character - drawing , especially the feebleness of his heroes .

		England 's criticism , however , never took the shape of a polemic .

		That was reserved for
Germany	LOCATION	.

		I need hardly refer to
Lessing	PERSON	's hostile attitude , or the icono - clastic spirit taken up by
August Wilhelm Schlegel	PERSON	, who decided that it was about time that the entire classical dramatists , including Moliere , were shelved .


Schiller	PERSON	was indifferent , and Goethe warmly enthusiastic only for
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, though he prized the tragedy of
Racine	LOCATION	and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		When
Jacob Grimm	PERSON	wrote to
Michelet	PERSON	that he could find no '' poetic satisfaction '' in either
Corneille	PERSON	,
Racine	LOCATION	, or
Boileau	PERSON	, Sainte-Beuve sighed : '' Encore une fois il y a malentendu , et du cote '' de 1 ` Allemagne je crains que ce ne soit presque sans remede , nous avons beau faire et beau dire , la-bas nous ne som - mes pas pris au se * rieux poe ` tiquement ; le ge * uie des races s ' y oppose . ''

		And we ask , shall we ever clear these barriers of racial misunderstanding ?

		Will the master - ing of the technicalities of a foreign language bring us nearer to an unbiased judgment of its spirit ?

		The most hopeful reply is not assuring .


Karl Hillebrand	PERSON	, who spoke French as fluently as his native tongue , and who loved the genius of
France	LOCATION	, asks whether it is likely that she will ever produce the equal of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		If we proceed to consider the relative values of sep - arate words , adverse criticism , it seems to me , becomes absurd .

		A French lady once asked me the English for '' belle fille , '' and on my replying '' beautiful girl , '' she was horrified , and distorting the pronunciation , ex - claimed , '' mais que c'est laid ! ''

		Can there be any common standpoint from which to judge the relative values of any single words in two different languages ?

		The concepts being the same , the word or medium will satisfy the race which has used it from time immemorial .

		One may speak of words as apparently different in quality , but will not the French '' for a ' that '' prefer their disparaged '' fille , '' '' amour , '' '' ciel , '' to the '' girl , '' '' love , '' '' sky , '' of the '' harsher '' language across the channel ?

		If the Englishman finds '' fille , '' '' amour , '' '' ciel , '' flat or paltry , is it too much to say that his judgment is warped not only by an obtuseness for the '' finesses '' of a foreign living language , but also by un - justly associating with the French tongue the empty shell of that which was not her parent-speech , i. e. , the classical Latin , long dead ?

		If one of the English writers in this controversy speaks sneeringly of the Latin char - acter of French , it is clear that his
Virgil	PERSON	and his
Cicero	PERSON	, or the dead '' filia , '' '' atnor , '' '' caelum , '' were barriers that kept him from appreciating the living '' fille , '' `` amour , '' and `` ciel . ''

		The difficulty remains if we proceed from words to phrases .

		We hear Mounet Sully in Hamlet -LRB- I should say
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	to be up to date -RRB- : '' Etre ou n'etre pas , c'est la la question '' -LRB- trans , by
Dumas	PERSON	-RRB- .

		What Anglo-Saxon lover of Shakespeare can help smiling ?

		though he will not , if he be in
Paris	LOCATION	, offend his polished host , by laughing in his face .

		Who would recognize the original of many -LRB- or any -RRB- passage in that wholly inadequate translation ?

		Many of the most poetical passages , as , for example , the sublime '' absent thee from felicity awhile , '' are altogether omitted .

		Be - cause , adds the exultant English critic , the French lan - guage is incapable of such poetic expression !

		Let us examine the other side of the question .

		Vol - taire is horrified at the '' not a mouse stirring '' of the soldier on the watch , and after translating the '' undig - nified '' phrase to make its grotesqueness apparent , with '' je n'ai pas entendu une souris trotter , '' he adds : `` Voi - 1k qui est naturel , dans un corps de garde , mais uon pas dans une trage `` die . ''


Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	, in comparing a recent French translation of Macbeth with the orig - inal , triumphantly holds it up as superior to the English version .

		Can this be the judgment of one of the forty immortals of the Academy ?

		Is there , then , any com - mon ground of criticism ?

		No : le genie des races s ' y oppose .

		A factor of an importance almost equal to racial an - tagonism is that of individual temperament and taste .

		We might distinguish two classes of critics : first , the poet endowed with creative power , to whom we grant strong antagonistic feelings against all that does not harmonize with the dictates of his genius .

		But -LRB- sec - ondly -RRB- those who are merely critics -LRB- etre critique ou , mon Dieu , pen de chose -RRB- , who only adjudge the crowns ac - cording to the light they have , must judge in all mat - ters of comparison , as between French and English poetry , from a basis of mutual toleration .

		Where inher - ited or racially opposed conceptions of poetry dominate , the critic 's vision can not be clear .

		To illustrate the point I wish to make , and partly also for the mere delight of setting them down here , I place side by side three poems of similar beauty in conception , of equal poetic delicacy , simplicity , and charm .

		Victor Hugo : `` Soyez comme 1 ` oiseau pose '' pour un instant Sur des rameaux trop f reles ; Qui sent trembler la branche , mais qui chante pourtant , Sachant qu'il a des ailes . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 Goethe : '' Ich singe wie der
Vogel	PERSON	singt , Der in den Zweigen wohnet , Das Lied das aus der
Kehle	PERSON	dringt , 1st
Lohn	PERSON	der reichlich lohnet . ''

		And
Browning	PERSON	: ''
Hark	PERSON	, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge Leans to the field and scatters on the clover Blossoms and dew-drops at the bent spray 's edge That 's the wise thrush : he sings each song twice over Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture ! ''

		As I read each of these separately , I prefer it to the others , and in the end can make no choice .

		Comparison seems inadequate , for the pleasure each gives is perfect .

		No individual verdict on their relative merits could be final ; while , if the racial feeling were to decide , French , Germans , and English would each prefer their own .

		Let us , then , not take any judgment passed on foreign verse too seriously .

		In the realm of poetry there is room for much that the critic would often deprive us of , and which flourishes there none the less in undying beauty .

		The plea I make is one for mutual toleration .

		The critics on both sides of the channel have been most un - fair .

		They take color from the spirit they comprehend , which is only their own national spirit .

		The federation of the world is no more a dream than absolute justice in any judgment on a foreign literature .

		Apart from the great human truths , the general truths , the abiding truths , which are the same for all peoples , a nation 's individual traits must be seen with that nation 's eyes .

		At a time when the memory of the Prince of cacograph - ical chauvinists is becoming less and less fragrant among the better informed of his countrymen , the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	takes occasion to cast its spadeful of mud into the waters he has so disturbed .

		Equally without authority , discretion , or taste in the premises , this institution of learning lends its name to an exhibition of illiteracy at which
Webster	PERSON	himself would have revolted .

		Little except this illiteracy of spelling now remains to us of
Webster	ORGANIZATION	's various antics .

		Under the benign influences of his alma mater , we have seen disappear , successively , his etymologies , his orthoepies , and his definitions .

		Only the cacography remains , a pitiful memorial of a time when American hatred of British oppression could find expression in doing a harm to English speech .

		The unreasonable prejudices between the English-speaking nations are disappearing in the light of a better under - standing ; more books are printed in
America	LOCATION	every year in the only orthography current among all branches of the English race ; why , then , should this dying '' pro- vincialism of nationality '' find support at an institution supposedly devoted to the humaner letters ?

		Or , rather , why should such an institution commit itself to the exten - sion of a national bad habit which , like tobacco-chewing , the rest of us are steadily and surely overcoming ?

		MR.
GODKIN	PERSON	AND `` THE EVENING POST . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A monthly magazine in
New York	LOCATION	, which has peri - odical attacks of uncontrollable brilliancy in its edi - torial department , has made Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	and '' The Evening Post '' the subject of a number of statements which require a protest .

		After saying , truly enough , that the editor and the paper were thoroughly identified in policy and spirit , he tells us that in his editorial ca - pacity Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	`` not only felt that he himself could do no wrong , but that men of other views could do no right . ''

		Again , he thinks it strange that a man so highly cultivated '' should never have been able to rec - ognize anything that was good in those who were op - posed to him , and that he could see nothing in their policy and motives except folly , or malice , or baseness , or incompetence . ''

		Now , I have been a daily reader of '' The Evening Post '' for some years , just because it is nol characterized by the qualities here ascribed to it under Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's editorship .

		From the copies lying on my shelves I will undertake to fill an entire number of the magazine from which I have quoted with edi - torials from '' The Evening Post '' in hearty commenda - tion of specific acts of men to the general policy of whom it is well known that Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	has been stren - uously in opposition .

		And , on the other hand , although Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	was in general an earnest supporter of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	, he showed himself at the same time a severe critic when occasion offered .

		We are told again that he '' would never frankly and fairly and conspicuously admit an error . ''

		Now I have a pretty wide acquaintance with our more prominent daily papers , and I can name no other among them that allows its errors to be corrected in its columns with anything approaching the freedom of '' The Evening Post . ''

		No man can read it , even hastily , for a month , without meeting instances of this ; and that , too , though its freedom from sensationalism gives it a much greater freedom from errors of fact than is the case with the average daily .

		It is also true that no other prominent daily is so ready to allow its editorial opinions to be questioned in its own columns .

		Its special correspond - ents have full liberty to express opinions contrary to its own -LRB- witness notably its
Manila	LOCATION	letters -RRB- , and it does not back up its opinions by the exclusion or garb - ling of news matter apparently in conflict with those opinions .

		Indirectly , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	is also charged with '' pessim - ism . ''

		How inevitable that charge is against any Amer - ican who gets it into his head that the outlook for good government is at least bright enough to make it worth fighting for !

		And Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	was also '' extremely irritating . ''

		Yes , there is no gainsaying that his edi - torials were very irritating to any reader to whom the particular exhibition of incompetence , stupidity , or corruption which he was just then flaying was not irri - tating .

		If the editor from whom we have quoted has carefully read the '' Post '' during the weeks since his editorial was written , he has probably concluded by this time that he was over - hasty in assuming that its sting for such readers has been extracted by the withdrawal of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	.

		And that that sting may never be ex - tracted as long as there is any hope of irritating read - ers into a consciousness that there are evils in society and government which can be and ought to be eradi - cated , should be the hope and prayer of us all .

		PLAYHOUSE RECOLLECTIONS .

		* The reader interested in theatrical matters may remember some unpleasant things said of the stage a few years ago by Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, and the tea-pot tempest that thereupon raged in the press .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	was of opinion that if acting is to be considered an art at all -LRB- which he doubted -RRB- , it is certainly the very lowest of the arts and the one making the slen - derest demands on the intelligence of those practising it .

		For what , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	asked , in effect , is the actor but the playwright 's parrot `` a vulgar parrot that speaks by rote and screams before the footlights '' ?

		and what , sci - entifically regarded , is his alleged art but the developed form of a simian turn for mimicry derived from caudate arboreal ancestors ?

		But that which particularly angered Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, and , indeed , provoked his attack , was the fact that the modern successors of the humble '' poor players '' of the frankly disrespectable strollers of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's and
Jonson	PERSON	's time not only regard themselves and are regarded as , technically , ladies and gentlemen , but are actually come to be , in too many cases , the recognized social lions and drawing-room idols of the day .

		This social vagary Mr.
Moore	PERSON	styled '' Mummer - Worship '' ; and we are sorry to say that the impetus of his onset against it carried him into some waspish innuendoes as to the morals of the fairer divini - ties of the cult , that did him no credit .

		We have mentioned Mr.
Moore	PERSON	and his Histrio-mastix as furnishing a convenient con - trast to the veteran dramatic writer , Mr.
Clement Scott	PERSON	, and his two thick volumes of rapturous stage memories , now before us .

		From his youth up , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has been a '' mummer - worshipper '' of the most ardent type , and his present production fairly entitles him , we think , to be called the
Gronow	PERSON	of the Victorian stage .

		But the title of the book is certainly misleading , since it leads us to expect , what we assuredly do not get , a continuous history of the modern drama .

		At times , it is true , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	seems in a fair way of starting out conscientiously to fulfil the implied promise of his title ; but he scarcely ever gets beyond a paragraph or so of dramatic history proper when a good story of ''

		ject of good stories , pops into his head , and away he starts , with the bit in his teeth , and never pulls up until the end of the chapter is reached and it is too late to go on with the text formally propounded at the outset .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's stories are entertaining , and he clearly relishes them so much himself that it is hard to grudge him the pleasure of telling them .

		But it must in candor be said that the reader who goes to him for light and leading on the drama proper , and not for the ana and gossip of the playhouse , will generally be disappointed .

		The fact is , as one of Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's critics has already pointed out , it is not so much the drama , broadly con - sidered , as the playhouse , that attracts and interests him .

		He has little patience with the sort of people -LRB- with whom , we confess , we are much in sympathy -RRB- who profess to find a higher and completer satisfaction in reading a dra - matic masterpiece than in seeing it acted .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	would probably think it pedantic and affected to say that the best actor who ever trod the boards must inevitably dwarf in his ren - dering the poet 's conception , say , of King Lear ; and , indeed , he frankly admits : '' I do not believe it is possible to be thoroughly impressed with Shakespeare until you have seen his plays acted .

		Long before I had witnessed the majority of those masterpieces on the stage , I had studied Shake - speare , I had read and re-read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, I had attended Shakespearean readings , Shakespearean dis - courses , and Shakespearean lectures ; but I never thor - oughly understood ' the bard , ' as he is called , until I saw him acted in those always-to-be-remembered days with
Phelps	LOCATION	at
Sadler	ORGANIZATION	's Wells . ''

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, with a degree of accuracy , de - scribes his book as an attempt to blend the outlines of the history of the stage with per - sonal reminiscences .

		Into the narrative he has woven a partial account of his career as a dra - matic critic in which capacity we are , as we gather , to regard him as in some sort the founder of a new school of writing .

		Before Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, the dramatic critic was , as it seems , a sober and deliberate person , who took him - self and his function pretty seriously , and was given to postponing his written opinions upon a new play or a new actor for several days .

		With Mr.
Scott	PERSON	came the new era .

		** I was , '' he says , '' the first journalist who attempted to make the account of a new play not so much a solemn and serious criticism as a picturesque report . '' ''

		Solemn and serious criticism '' is not , we are convinced , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's forte ; and it was well he realized the fact at the outset .

		Among Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's reminiscences is an amus - ing one of the elder
Dumas	PERSON	, upon whom he once called at
Paris	LOCATION	, armed with a letter of introduc - tion from
Fechter	PERSON	. ''


Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	lived with his daughter , a very devout Catholic , in a fashionable quarter of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The daughter was evidently away , and when I left my card and
Fechter	PERSON	's letter I was ushered into a solemn room , which looked like an oratory , being full of crucifixes , relics , and sacred pictures .

		After waiting for some time in astonishment , for the religious atmosphere did not seem to coincide with my idea of the rollicking his - torian , novelist , and prolific dramatist , the servant re - turned to say that
M. Dumas	PERSON	would see me .

		From the oratory I was ushered into a kind of kitchen .

		The scene had changed entirely .

		Behold the hero of hundreds of dramatic successes , in his shirt sleeves , his negro skin beaded with perspiration , his hair like an iron-gray scrubbing brush reversed , sitting before the fire , with a pretty girl on each knee , pretending to cook an omelette or preside over a vol-au-vent !

		Dumas , as everyone knows , was an amateur cook , and he loved nothing bet - ter than to design , arrange , and carry out a dinner of his own invention .

		The girls pinched him , kissed him , chaffed him , and called him Papa . '

		He returned the compliment .

		He asked me about
Fechter	PERSON	and his suc - cess , which interested him .

		He gave me some tickets for the theatre , and I left the cheery old man , still in his shirt sleeves before the stove , kissing the pretty girls on either knee . ''

		While Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's Thespian ambition has been satisfied with the role of dramatic critic , he is , it seems , not altogether a stranger to the boards . ''

		At the Bijou Theatre ,
Bayswater	LOCATION	, I have enacted
Christopher Larkings	PERSON	in
Woodcock	LOCATION	's Little Game , ' and the boy Archie in < The Scrap of Paper . '

		I think I rather fancied myself in a black velvet coat and knick - erbockers , lent me by my old friend ,
Edmund Routledge	PERSON	, and a pair of scarlet stockings suggested by myself .

		This alarming costume secured me the honor of a scented note left at the stage door .

		My companions in crime still living are
James M. Molloy	PERSON	, the gifted balladist and composer , and
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	, who rejoiced in the farce called ` Number One Round the Corner ' ; but I fancy this brilliant poet and dramatist was as bad an actor as I was .

		He could not have been a worse one . ''

		The volumes are handsomely gotten up , and contain many interesting portraits of players and playwrights , managers and critics .

		While of no great value as a contribution to the his - tory of the drama , they are lively and amusing , and should find favor with the members of the profession to which Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has devoted the enthusiastic attention of a lifetime .

		It is a gift to the future historian which he will not lightly value ; while for the reader who seeks entertainment chiefly , its pages abound with matter of interest , amuse - ment , and serious instruction .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	has enjoyed through life a com - manding opportunity for gaining insight into the character of the personages and the prin - ciples which have given distinction to the won - derful years included in the closing century .

		Most of the famous men and women of the time were known to her , and in many of the great movements that evolved in grand pro- gression , one following rapidly upon another , she was a living part .

		It is a memorable retro - spect , leaving with the mind , as the most last - ing impression , a sense of the dignity , the sincerity , the high-mindedness of the writer .

		Her judgments are marked by breadth and graciousness , and her own career from first to last was noble and generous .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	was born in
1819	DATE	, in the city of
New York	LOCATION	, in a home of wealth and culture .

		Her father , a banker of high standing , was not only prominent in business affairs but in social circles , and his children were surrounded by every influence tending to nurture intelligence and develop the moral qualities .

		He was a Puritan of the Puritans , maintaining strict discipline in his household and a vigilant guardianship of the welfare of his daughters .

		No expense was spared in their education .

		They had the best masters in music , the languages , drawing , dancing , all the accomplishments be - fitting refined womanhood .

		But the social arena in which their gifts might find free dis - play was narrowly restricted .

		There was , nat - urally , some restiveness and discontent under such firm restraint , but the wisdom of it was justified in the light of mature experience .

		There was , however , no lack of genial life in the Ward mansion .

		At quiet dinners and in cheerful evenings in her own home and among her intimate friends , Miss Ward enjoyed un - usual opportunities for social cultivation .

		It consisted of a plate of toast and two small dishes of stewed fruit , which he offered to us with the words , ' Perhaps ye can eat some of this .

		I never eat these things myself . ' ''

		Her visit to
Wordsworth	PERSON	was a signal disap - pointment .

		The poet 's widowed daughter had met with a heavy loss through some unfortunate American investment , and the calamity had com - pletely upset the family equilibrium .

		It was the sole topic touched upon during the interview . ''

		The tea to which we had been bidden was simply a cup of tea , served without a table .

		We bore the har - assing conversation as long as we could .

		The only remark of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's which I brought away was this : ' The misfortune of
Ireland	LOCATION	is that it was only a partially conquered country . ''

		It was hard to go out from his pres - ence , all aglow with enthusiasm which he felt and inspired , and hear him spoken of as a teacher of irre - ligion , a pest to the community . ''

		Mr.

		As he could not comprehend the wit which en - livens and sometimes idealizes the discourse in general society , so he failed signally to grapple with the intricacies of exact science . ''

John Brown	PERSON	's hapless state in a Southern prison , without counsel or money , he '' telegraphed to eminent lawyers in

		At the close of an interview with the President , Mr.

		Why did he not do this , or that , or the other ?

		He a President , indeed !

		Look at this war , dragging on so slowly !

		Look at our many defeats and rare victories ! '

		Such was the talk that one constantly heard regarding him .

		The most charitable held that he meant well .

		Governor
Andrew	PERSON	was one of the few whose faith in him never wavered . ''

		It was during this eventful visit that Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	made her first attempt at public speaking , in an unstudied talk to a company of soldiers from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and also wrote , in a mo - ment of inspiration , the '' Battle Hymn of the Republic . ''

		Her party had been singing the popular war songs of the day , concluding with ``
John Brown	PERSON	's body , '' when Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	turned to her with the question , '' Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, why do you not write some good words for that stirring tune ? ''

		It had been in her mind to do so , but as yet the motive had not come to her . ''

		I went to bed that night as usual , and slept , accord - ing to my wont , quite soundly .

		I awoke in the gray of the
morning twilight	TIME	; and as I lay waiting for the dawn , the long lines of the desired poem began to twine them - selves in my mind .

		Having thought out all the stanzas , I said to myself , I must get up and write these verses down , lest I fall asleep again and forget them . '

		So , with a sudden effort , I sprang out of bed , and found in the dimness an old stump of a pen which I remembered to have used the day before .

		I scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper .

		I had learned to do this when , on previous occasions , attacks of versifi - cation had visited me in the
night	TIME	, and I feared to have recourse to a light lest I should wake the baby , who slept near me .

		I was always obliged to decipher my scrawl before another night should intervene , as it was only legible while the matter was fresh in my mind .

		At this time , having completed my writing , I returned to bed and fell asleep , saying to myself , I like this better than most things that I have written . ''

		The poem was published in the ''
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' without awakening special interest .

		But it reached the soldiers ' camps , and they sang it in rousing chorus on the march and by their evening fires .

		It penetrated the walls of
Libby Prison	ORGANIZATION	, and finally was rehearsed with startling effect by a released captive who told , in a public lecture in
Washington	LOCATION	, of the cheer it brought to the hearts of his comrades immured in that frightful death-pen in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the success of the poem was assured .

		Probably no sub - ject in the whole range of literature has suffered more in the hands of the judicious than this .

		It is the fashion of the English literary his - torian to treat the Scottish literature as a mere adjunct of the English ; and being unable , for the most part , to appreciate or to understand the picturesque and racy vernacular , made up of an immense variety of subtle linguistic forces Cymric ,

Scott	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	, and
Laing	LOCATION	, by the learned Clubs the
Bannatyne	PERSON	, the
Maitland	LOCATION	, the Rox - burghe , and the Hunterian and by the Early English and Scottish Text Societies , has been accumulating .

		What was needed was a clear and intelligent treatment of the whole subject within reasonable limits .

		This is what Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has attempted , and on the whole successfully , although the thoroughness of his scholarship on certain points is open to doubt , and his style leaves something to be desired .

		The survey of the vernacular covers more than five centuries , from the '' mokkyshe ryme '' on
Edward Longshanks	PERSON	to
Allan Cunningham	PERSON	.

		It was no light task to condense so large a sub - ject into one volume , but Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has been equal to it .

		His judgment is discrimin - ating , his taste is correct , if not mellowed , and his sense of proportion is good .

		No important author has been overlooked , and one notes few omissions among writers not of the first consideration . ''

		The Totall Discourse of the Rare Adventures '' -LRB- of
William Lithgow	PERSON	-RRB- ,
1632	DATE	, might have been included as a curious and interesting contribution to vernacular prose , and it is a genuine disappointment to miss `` Aye Waukin ' , O ! ''

		which has been described as a perfect song , so fortunate also as to be the subject of a perfect criticism , that of Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	in '' Horae Subsecivae . ''

		Poetry bulks large in the Scottish vernacu - lar , and the picture of it here shown , represent - ing Dunbar receiving the torch from
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and handing it on to
Burns	LOCATION	, is illuminating .

		The Scots '' makaris '' wrote , not a different language from Chaucer , but the same language , which , like him , they called '' Inglisch . ''

		The difference is only that the genius of Chaucer made the
Midland	LOCATION	dialect , the
London	LOCATION	speech , English ; the '' makaris '' preserved the North - ern English , which did not become a dialect , in the modern sense , until after the union of the crowns in
James VI	LOCATION	.

		Like Chaucer , also , the '' makaris '' went to the French poets , and sometimes to the Italian , for models of versifi - cation .

		Of a lineage so ancient and so honor - able , by the time of
Burns	PERSON	-LRB- as Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	happily says -RRB- the poetic tradition of
Scotland	LOCATION	was the noblest ever inherited by any peasantry , far higher than could have derived from even O an ideal peasantry .

		Of what other great poet than
Burns	PERSON	can it be said that much of the emotions and sentiments he expresses lay out - side his own personal experience ?

		Excepting
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 the chapter on the ballads , which in the main follows Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, and possibly therefor suggests an ignoring of recent research , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's treatment of Scottish poetry is excellent .

		His study of the relations between the French and Scottish poets , especially be - tween
Villon	PERSON	and Dun bar , is so good that one wants more of it .

		We see
Dunbar	PERSON	getting the idea of his stately '' Lament for the Makaris '' from
Villon	PERSON	's ballads on the '' dames '' and '' seigneurs '' of olden time , and writing it in a favorite French form with him , the
Icyrielle	LOCATION	.

		Other Villon metres are the octave with refrain ,
Villon	PERSON	's double ballade , and the rondeau .

		Dunbar makes large use of the French octave , named by
King James VI	PERSON	.

		the ballot royal , and more than a third of his verse is written in the stave of the French rondeau , with or without refrain .

		For two well-known French metres in English , the seven-line stanza of Chaucer 's '' Troilus and Criseyde , '' called by
Gascoigne	PERSON	rime royal , and the rime couee , or tail rhyme , so largely used by
Burns	PERSON	,
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	shows no great fondness .

		It is a pity that the chapter on
Dunbar	PERSON	is not more compact ; as it is , it shows Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's exceptional knowl - edge of Scottish prosody at its best , and his logical , or rather illogical , arrangement of ma - terial at its worst .

		Dunbar surely stands in no need of an advocate , and fewer quotations would have sufficed to show his quality , his humor , always gay , sometimes saturnine , and now and then deliciously quaint and fantastic , as when in `` Kynd Kittok , '' the alewife of Falkland Fells eludes St.
Peter	PERSON	and gets into heaven privily , '' God , '' we are told , '' lukit and saw her lattin in , and lewch his hert sair '' ; the reality of his touch , his worldliness , and his stoicism , all expressed with a brilliancy of im - agination that time and circumstance have not dimmed , and a mastery of language that easily ranks him the greatest of the Chaucerians .

		But on the whole the quotations are made with so much reserve and judgment and taste as to whet the appetite .

		The '' Bill of Fare '' which
Fergusson	PERSON	would have laid before Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	when banqueted by the
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	professors is fresh .

		His ''
Daft	PERSON	Days '' is more familiar : '' Now mirk
December	DATE	's dowie face Glowrs owre the rigs wi ' sour grimace , While thro ' his minimum of space , The bleer-ey 'd sun , Wi ' blinkin ' light and stealing pace , His race doth run . ''

		There , to use the words of
K. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, is '' the model of great things to come '' in
Burns	LOCATION	.

		Those who know -LRB- and who does not know ? -RRB-

		Mrs.
Craik	PERSON	's beautiful song , `` Too Late , '' will find the refrain of it in a curious old allegorical poem , by Sir
Richard Holland	PERSON	, called '' The Buke of the Howlat '' : `` O Dowglas , O Dowglas , Tender and trewe ! ''

		It is there given as a badge of the Douglases embroidered on the coat-armor of the pursui - vant .

		Exquisitely simple and sweet is the '' Departe '' of
Alexander Scott	PERSON	, the farewell of the dying Master of
Erskine	LOCATION	, slain at
Pinkie Cleugh	ORGANIZATION	,
1547	DATE	, to the Queen Dowager , the beautiful Marie de Guise : '' Adew my awin sweit thing , My joy and conforting , My mirth and sollesing Of erdly gloir ; Ffair weill , my lady brieht , And my remembrance rycht , Ffair weill , and haif gud nycht : I say no moir ! ''

		Brief quotations in prose are harder to make , but there is a good one from the diarist ,
James Melville	PERSON	, describing the young King James VI. , in
1574	DATE	, when eight years old , '' walking up and down in the auld Lady
Marr	PERSON	's hand , discours - ing of knowledge and ignorance . ''

		A single sen - tence from that belated humanist ,
George Bu	PERSON	- chanan , is an amusing hit , both at his old pupil , Queen
Mary	PERSON	, and at the pride of the Hamiltons : `` Thay wer in hoip yat scho sonld mary
Johnne Hamiltoun	PERSON	ye Dukis sone quhome wt -LSB- with -RSB- inery lukis and gentill contenance -LRB- as scho could weill do -RRB- scho enterit in ye gayme of ye glaiks -LSB- coquetry -RSB- , and causit ye rest of ye Hamiltonis to fon for faynnes -LSB- to play the fool for eagerness -RSB- . ''

		Scottish vernacular literature without Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	is the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out .

		In his index , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	tells us that he mentions Sir
Walter	PERSON	five times , and he honors him with one sentence by himself -LRB- p. 455 -RRB- .

		This sentence is well worth quoting , for two reasons : because it is all there is about
Scott	PERSON	, and because it exhibits Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's style , as they say in homely phrase , with its foot around its neck . ''


Hogg	PERSON	as a poet was very much a rustic Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, who was , besides , the founder of a vernacular school of his own , that of the vernacular novel a sub - ject too vast for our present consideration , but who very seldom in his poetry drops into the vernacular , and makes very chary use of it even in his lyrics , the only almost pure examples being the spirited Jock o ' Hazeldean founded on an old ballad , the witty char - acter sketch of
Donald Caird	PERSON	, and his new version of
Carle	PERSON	, now the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Come ; but
March	DATE	, march ,
Ettrick	PERSON	and Teviotdale derived from the old General
Leslie	PERSON	's
March	DATE	contains at least one vernacular exclamation ; and the vernacular slightly tinges his re-reading of D'Urfey 's
Bonnie Dundee	PERSON	. ''

		A precisely similar sentence sums up or 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, lumps up '' The Tea Table Miscellany '' of
Allan Ramsay	PERSON	-LRB- p. 410 -RRB- .

		Of minor matters of style , such verbal forms as '' strenuUy , '' '' re - joicements , '' '' artificiosity , '' instead of the usual words , may be good North British , but the contractions `` was n't , '' `` is n't , '' and `` ca n't '' are undignified in any serious writing .

		Anent
North Britain	LOCATION	, the transatlantic reader has his ''
Marmion	PERSON	'' to explain North Berwick Law , produced by the '' Gyre-Carling , '' the mother - witch of
Scotland	LOCATION	, to discomfit her lover , but what was the '' whikey '' tree which grew in
Robert Henryson	ORGANIZATION	's orchard ?

		Instead of furnishing a glossary of Scottish words , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	writes the glosses in the margin .

		This is well enough for general pur - poses , but for the use of students there should be something to indicate the connection be - tween word and definition ; and the proof - reading should have been done by someone with a correct eye for lines and leads .

		Some of the glosses are hopelessly askew .

		Titles throughout are not glossed , for some inexplica - ble reason .

		We note one or two slight errors .

		On p. 391 ,
Robert Sempill	PERSON	, author of ''
Habbie Simson	PERSON	, '' was active in promoting the
Restora	PERSON	- tion , not the Revolution .

		On p. 394 , a tangled sentence executes
George Baillie	PERSON	of Jerviswood , husband of Lady
Grizel Baillie	PERSON	, instead of his father ,
Robert Baillie	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is at his worst in his index , which does not seem to have been prepared upon any system .

		It is fairly inclusive as to names , but titles get into it by favor and grace only .

		To instance a few eccentricities of index - ing : we look in vain for '' The Lament of the Makaris , '' a poem which is probably mentioned oftener than any other , because it is a store - house of information on the early Scottish poets .

		Nor do we find the best-known Scotch song , ''
Auld Lang Syne	PERSON	, '' although '' The Gaberlunzie Man , '' barely referred to , is indexed . ''

		The Wowing of Jok and Jynny '' is indexed twice : incorrectly as '' Jok and Jynny '' -LRB- p. 289-290 -RRB- , where there is some account of it , but correctly at p. 133 , which points to a cross-reference .

		So the unwary reader who wants to turn to '' Tullochgorum , '' '' the best Scots song
Scotland	LOCATION	ever saw , '' in
Burns	PERSON	's extravagant praise , must know before - hand that it was written by one
John Skinner	PERSON	.

		But the faults of this book are few , and easily remedied ; its merits are many and great , and Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is to be congratulated on having produced a good book on a difficult subject .

AUGUSTA SCOTT	ORGANIZATION	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	has again made one of his occasional excursions into the historical past , and told us , in his '' Via Crucis , '' a story of the
Second Crusade	ORGANIZATION	.

		His central figure is that of Queen
Eleanor	PERSON	, the queen of the monkish
Louis VII.	PERSON	, linked afterwards to English history as the wife of
Henry Plantagenet	PERSON	, and to romantic tradition as the jealous persecutor of the fair
Rosamond	PERSON	.

		Stu - dents of English history are apt to learn little of her career as the consort of the French crusading monarch , or of that most picturesque episode which concerns her Amazonian masquerade , in company with a train of court ladies , across
Europe	LOCATION	to the
East	LOCATION	.

		It supplies a singularly effective subject for a romance , and Mr.

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 bulence of the strife between
Stephen	PERSON	and the daugh - ter of
Henry I.	PERSON	, and who seeks to carve out for himself a new fortune by joining the crusaders .

		The story is chiefly concerned with the fruitless efforts of the enamoured queen to withdraw him from allegiance to his early love , but his faith proves too steadfast to yield to this temptation .

		Other historical figures are those of Arnold of
Brescia	LOCATION	and
St. Bernard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The romance is excel - lently told , although it is not without longueurs and produces something of the stucco-effect which seems inevitable when such a theme is handled by any but the greatest of novelists . ''

		The Tempest '' has clearly been the inspiration of '' My Lady and
Allan Darke	PERSON	. ''

		The scene is an island off the coast of
Virginia	LOCATION	, the time something over a century ago .

		Prospero is a gentleman who , having been accused of a crime of which he is guilt - less , has taken refuge upon the island , and eventu - ally becomes monarch of all he surveys , including the plantation and slaves of the former owner , whose daughter he marries .

		Here his own daugh - ter -LRB- our Miranda -RRB- grows up in maidenly seclusion , not knowing the full tale of the past , and hither
Allen Darke	PERSON	-LRB- our Ferdinand -RRB- is brought by the accident of shipwreck .

		Now
Allan	PERSON	, unwitting of all this history , is really the one whom Prospero most fears , because he is by birth the natural avenger of the crime with which
Prospero	ORGANIZATION	is wrongfully charged .

		Declaring his name , his protestations of ignorance avail him no whit ; his life is spared , but he is kept a close prisoner on the island .

		Over and over again he escapes a treacherous death at the hands of a too zealous servant of Prospero , and in the end , when the latter dies , and all the mystery is cleared away , wins the love of My Lady , and the story ends happily .

		It is a really fascinating bit of romance , original -LRB- except for its admitted pro- totype -RRB- in design , and carried breathlessly on through many thrilling episodes to the conclusion that no experienced reader needs to be told is coming .

		For a professional man of peace ,
Archdeacon Brady	PERSON	has a very pretty taste in scrimmages .

		He prefers them by water , and the mere thought of a sea-fight is enough to heat his blood to the boiling point .

		In his new story , '' For the Freedom of the Sea , '' he has a theme after his own heart , and he writes of the glories of Old Ironsides with an en - thusiasm that is wholly unaffected .

		The War of
1812	DATE	supplies the subject-matter of this romance , and the fight between the '' Constitution '' and the '' Guerriere '' is but one of a series of episodes that keep the interest wide awake .

		The author is as yet an amateur novelist , to be sure ; he elaborates too much , and his style is far from impeccable , but there is an honest manliness about his work that compels both respect and admiration . ''

		In Old
New York	LOCATION	, '' the romance which we owe to the collaboration of Mr.
Wilson Barrett	PERSON	and Mr.
Elwyn Barren	PERSON	, is a story of the year
1745	DATE	, the time of the siege of
Louisburg	LOCATION	and of the Young Pre - tender .

		These happenings , however , only appear in the story as echoes from distant lands , although the fortunes of one of the characters are directly affected by the news of the Jacobite rising in
Scot	LOCATION	- land .

		The story is really concerned with the social and commercial life of
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	at a time when the city was mewing its mighty youth , and the possibilities of its future were becoming revealed to the far-seeing eyes of its shrewd Dutch and En - glish inhabitants .

		It is a well-constructed novel of private interests , with a charming heroine , and a pair of heroes who , if not charming , are at least interesting , and in quite different ways .

		Although Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's name stands first upon the title-page , we find more of Mr.
Barron	PERSON	in the book itself more , that is , which seems attributable to the author of ''
Manders	PERSON	'' than to the author of '' The Sign of the Cross . '' ''

		The Favor of Princes '' is a variant upon a very hackneyed theme .

		An impoverished young noble - man comes to
Paris	LOCATION	to seek his fortune at court .

		The time is that of Louis XV .

		and the ascendancy of the Pompadour .

		He marries a wealthy woman of bourgeoise extraction , actually falls in love with her , and finding a rival in no less a man than the
King	ORGANIZATION	, defies that
august	DATE	personage , and wins his point by virtue of sheer audacity .

		The story is with - out originality , and is told in too commonplace a manner to excite more than a languid interest .

		In writing '' The Grand Mademoiselle , '' Mr.
James Eugene Farmer	PERSON	has gone far beyond his first historical romance , '' The Grenadier . ''

		He has learned , for example , to mix historical fact with his narrative much more skilfully , and to impart to his work much more of vivacity and animation .

		His subject is , of course , the Fronde , and the character of
Mademoiselle de Montpensier	ORGANIZATION	seems to have inspired him with great enthusiasm .

		He tells of her audacious entry into
Orleans	LOCATION	, and of her brilliant although ineffectual defence of
Paris	LOCATION	against the forces of
Mazarin	PERSON	and the young King .

		The author displays a fertile invention in the devices with which he embroiders the pages of history , as well as a certain talent in the portraiture of the numerous historical characters who figure in his tale .

		From seventeenth century
Paris	LOCATION	, as described in the foregoing romance , to eighteenth century Lon - don , as depicted in Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's `` The Orange Girl , '' is a transit to be measured otherwise than in leagues of land and sea .

		The latter , too , is a historical novel , in a sense , but it is social rather than political history that concerns us .


Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, the debtor 's prison , and the details of a criminal trial , are Sir
Walter	PERSON	's themes , and he writes of them from that intimate knowledge of Old
London	LOCATION	with which few may hope to compete .

		There is more matter in this book than the author has been wont to give us of late , more antiquarian detail and more dramatic incident .

		And it is by a true artistic instinct that he takes us at the end , in company with his chief characters , across the ocean to the
Virginia	LOCATION	colony , and provides a peaceful epilogue 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to his story of crime and degradation .

		The mem - ory of his heroine , who rose from the slums to he - come a famous actress , and whose salf-sacrificing devotion saved the hero from the toils of villainy , will long remain in the mind of the reader .

		One does not get far in '' The Colossus '' of Mr.
Morley Roberts	PERSON	before supplying the words '' of Rhodes '' parenthetically .

		The novel has three fea - tures : a man , an enterprise , and an intrigue .

		The man has been indicated , the enterprise is the
Cape	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	railway , the intrigue is supplied by political conditions in
Cairo	LOCATION	, in which town the whole scene is laid .

		The designing young woman who has set her cap at the hero , and who insinuates herself into the intrigue for the purpose of helping him with the enterprise , excites little admiration and less sympathy .

		Nor is the figure of the Colossus half as impressive as the author evidently believes it to be .

		He affects a pretentious style , and succeeds only in producing an impression of futility .

		The '' Monte Cristo '' type of story has an inex - haustible interest .

		There are so many things that can be done by a man in possession of an enormous fortune , and so wide a field for the ingenuity of the novelist dealing with such a case , that the plot of such a story never becomes hackneyed .

		In '' The Princess
Xenia	LOCATION	, '' the fortune falls to an Englishman living in impecunious obscurity in a small German duchy , presumably in the pre-imperial days .

		He seeks to make himself the arbiter of destiny , both for this and the two adjoining petty states , and would combine them under one rule as a barrier against the Prussian policy of encroachment .

		In this design he almost succeeds , but the achievement is wrested from him at the very moment of triumph by the act of a passionate woman the inevitable and incalculable woman , with whom both fiction and actual life have to reckon in some unexpected fashion .

		There are intrigues manifold , and peril - ous adventures without number , from which entan - glement the hero barely escapes in the end , carrying with him the dispossessed princess , who seems to count the world well lost for the love of such a man .

		It is all delightfully and improbably entertaining .

		Mr.
Bernard Capes	PERSON	is becoming so completely the victim of his mannerisms that he is well-nigh unreadable .

		He is so inoculated with the Mere - dithian microbe that his style has become hope - lessly strained and obscure , while such a matter as coherency of plot seems altogether unworthy of his attention . ''

		Our Lady of Darkness '' is the book which occasions the present strictures .

		It is a ro - mance of the French Revolution , with English and Belgian episodes , and is carried through a bewilder - ing series of happenings to a most futile conclusion .

		The '' Siren City '' of '' Benjamin Swift '' is more interesting as a story than any of its three prede - cessors by the same hand , although it is not without that infusion of bitterness which so marks the work of this singularly powerful writer .

		The heroine is a woman whose purity and strength are brought into effective contrast with the sordid influences that surround her innocent life , and turn her romance into the darkest of tragedies .

		Superficially , this novel is the story of an English girl who becomes the prey of an Italian fortune-hunting adventurer .

		Psychologically , it is a study of the interrelations of a group of intensely passionate natures in which virtue is beset by villainy , but remains invincible .

		The Neapolitan setting of the best part of the work lends it an added external glamour , and its study of Italian character is no less subtle and penetrating than its dealings with English persons and scenes .

		The style is admirably direct and tense , at moments rising to the heights of a grave and restrained beauty .

		Altogether , the writer appears more than ever one to be reckoned with , and already displays evidences of a more softened humanity than has heretofore been discernible in his cynical envisage - ment of modern society .

		Those who remember Lord
Ernest Hamilton	PERSON	's '' Outlaws of the Marches , '' with its striking depic - tion of the fifteenth century feuds of the Scotch border , will hardly be prepared for the surprise that awaits them in '' The Perils of Josephine . ''

		No two novels could well be more dissimilar .

		The one was a stirring romance of the days of rough man - hood and hard fighting ; the other is a sensational melodrama of modern society , enacted in and about an English country house .

		We are led up by easy degrees to the extremely improbable plot against
Josephine	PERSON	, but her perils , when they become really manifest , are quite as thrilling as the most exacting reader could wish .

		The author is a clever artificer , besides being a versatile one , and this his latest effort is a noteworthy example of its own peculiar sort of composition . ''

		lone
March	DATE	, '' Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's latest ven - ture , is a most unhappy one .

		It is supposed to be a study in American girlhood , and what the writer does not know of the subject would fill many vol - umes .

		Such caricatures as those of the heroine and her girl friends are not often met with in fiction of serious intent , and such unrealities as the incidents which are strung together about the heroine belong strictly to the literature of burlesque .

		The story is one long and disjointed extravaganza , without a suggestion of real characterization , and without ordinary verisimilitude in its several episodes .

		We advise Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	to go back to his moss-hags , and never again venture so far away from them .

		In shifting his activities from the field of histor - ical to that of domestic romance , Mr.
S. R. Keightley	PERSON	has not been well-advised . ''

		The Crimson Sign '' and '' The Cavaliers '' were among the best recent examples of the former species of production , but '' Heronford '' is not thus distinguished among its many competitors .

		It is , however , a sufficiently stirring tale of an old English family , and leads up to certain culminating episodes that are sufficiently improbable to meet the most exacting of romantic demands .

		And it must be added that in matters of minor craftmanship , Mr.
Keightley	PERSON	's hand has even gained something of deftness .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 Since '' God 's Prisoner '' came into our hands some months ago , the name of Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	has been one that could not go disregarded upon the title-page of a book .

		His '' Rising Fortunes , '' which has just been published , is not equal in inter - est to its predecessors , but it is an enjoyable story .

		It is essentially a story of the '' literary shop '' as it exists in
London	LOCATION	, with its attendant commercial - ism , and log-rolling , and mean rivalries .

		The heroes for there are two of coordinate rank are young Scotchmen who , attracted by what Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	called the noblest of all prospects , start for the metropolis with little other provision than their undaunted ambitions .

		How they gradually secure a foothold , and eventually achieve success the one in art and the other in literature is the substance of the narrative which the author unfolds .

		The book has a grasp upon reality , which is much , and its ideas are wholesome , which is more .

		We can not say that there is much of either reality or wholesomeness in Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	's '' Love Made Manifest . ''

		Here again is a young man of letters , but the struggle is lacking , for he writes a play in a single night , has it accepted in a single interview , and becomes almost immediately the most popular author of the day .

		So much for the question of reality .

		We have but to continue our summary to dispose of the question of whole - someness .

		Our meteoric author is rashly and un - happily married , and , in the full flush of his success , meets a woman a childhood friend who is in like case .

		The conventional conscientious pose is maintained for a time , but in the end they run away together , and make a home on a lonely island in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Presently they both experience religion of the hysterical sort , and , in expiation of their sins , repair to a leper colony , and there end their lives .

		This is sad rubbish , although candor compels the admission that the book is somewhat better written than the Dr.
Nikola	PERSON	stories .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has a genius for titles .

		All of his books bear names that fascinate , and the latest of them is the happiest of them all in this respect . ''

		The Ship of Stars '' might mean so many things , and has about it such an atmosphere of mystery and poetical suggestiveness .

		The book itself seems to us the masterpiece among all that the author has produced hitherto .

		It is a tale of the
Cornwall	LOCATION	coast , of which the landscape , the customs , and the quaint folk are now so familiar to us through the ministrations of this gifted story-teller .

		The ele - ments of which it is compounded are various , recall - ing Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	in the lighthouse episode , '' Jude the Obscure '' -LRB- although with no touch of the bitterness -RRB- in the brief sojourn of the hero at Ox - ford , and '' Sentimental Tommy '' in the delineation of a boyish imagination , and the slow moulding of a character strong enough to react upon environ - ment and conquer it .

		There is something so abso - lutely clean and wholesome about this story of duty done for its own sake , so high and fine in the ideal - ism with which it is informed , that we may once more take heart for our fiction-literature , in spite of the meretricious and brutal forces that sometimes seem so hopelessly in the ascendency .

		What a refreshing contrast is here offered to such books as '' The Christian '' and ''
Stalky & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' to name two conspicuous illustrations of the degrading tendencies to which we have reference .

		It is the whole dif - ference between art and fustian . ''

		Lord , make men as towers '' is the prayer which here serves as a text , and in the spirit of that fine aspiration the book is written for the bettering of men 's lives and the bringing back into literature of a large sanity and a worthy purpose .

		To the coast of
Cornwall	LOCATION	or rather beyond it to the Scillies we are also taken by '' The Watchers , '' a story by Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	, which follows close upon the two that we reviewed only a few weeks ago .

		The story is , however , a disappointment , being little above the level of the '' shilling shocker , '' and de - pending for its mystery upon that cheapest of all sensational devices hypnotic influence .

		This and a buried pirate treasure are the mainsprings of what must be described as an irritating and grossly improbable invention .

		It is a story of the eight - eenth century , but the special coloring of the period is plastered upon the surface rather than worked into the texture of the narrative .

		The
Cromwell	PERSON	period of English history appears to be an inexhaustible source of material for writers of historical fiction .

		Industriously as it has been worked , it still offers one of the most interesting opportunities for romantic exploitation .

		Women , as a rule , are not very successful in work of this sort , but an exception must be made of Miss
McChesney	PERSON	, whose ''
Rupert	ORGANIZATION	, by the Grace of God '' is a highly satisfactory narrative .

		The hero is , of course , the daring royalist leader , and the story is chiefly concerned with a conspiracy to persuade him into treason by the promise of the English crown .

		The scene is mostly in the west of
England	LOCATION	, and the inter - est culminates with the siege and capitulation of Bris - tol .

		A love story is worked in , as a matter of course , and all ends happily for the hero and the heroine .

		Mrs.
Macquoid	PERSON	is a practiced novelist , but she is unwise in attempting historical romance .

		Her latest book , `` A Ward of the King , '' is prettily enough written , but the plot is feebly developed , and its excitement proves to be of a very mild type .

		It is a French story of the Constable de Bourbon and the struggle which led to the disaster of
Pavia	LOCATION	.

		Public interests are , however , rather kept in the background , and the story is really about the tribu - lations of a young gentlewoman , beset by unscrupu - lous enemies , and saved in due course of time from their evil machinations .

		Among recent volumes of short stories , the new collection by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	occupies the first place .

		These tales have , however , little of the pristine freshness of their earlier predecessors , and it is be - coming more and more evident that the author 's rich pay-streak is worked out .

		Even the familiar figure of
Jack Hamlin	PERSON	is less engaging and impu -
88	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, dent than usual , and the other types introduced reveal only a weakening of the writer 's grasp as his Californian past recedes farther and farther from his view .

		His improbabilities are too glaring to be accepted , now that they come to us unaccompanied by the old magnificent verve and picturesqueness of effect .

		The stories are eight in number .

		In Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's small volume there are no less than eleven stories , but several of these are mere sketches of a few pages each .

		The interest is here in the author 's own personality , for he does not strain after inventions , but rather chooses to portray his own experiences , with just enough imaginative coloring to save them from being tedious .

		They have an undoubted charm , in spite of their excess of sentiment , for they reflect a generous view of life , as observed by a man who is both artist and humorist .

		Several of them are based upon inci - dents picked up by Mr.
Smith	PERSON	in his character as a lecturer , for of recent years he has added that occu - pation to his many others .

		Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	has reversed the order usual with writers of fiction in that he has turned to the telling of short stories after having won a considerable success in the full-fledged novel .

		At least , '' The Powers at Play '' is the first collection of stories by his hand that has come to our notice , and we sin - cerely trust it may not prove the last .

		He has a quick eye for the possibilities of an incident or a situation , and he serves it up with neatness and despatch .

		There are eight stories in the present volume , some very slight , others more elaborate , and all interesting .

		Their invention is excellent , and they are enlivened by whimsical humor or else touched with subtle pathos .

		Whichever of these two formulae is applied to the work in hand , it is deftly employed and effective .

		The first story , '' His Word of Honor , '' seems to us on the whole the best of the eight , but a close second may be found in either '' The White Blackbird '' or '' The Incident of the British Ambassador . ''

		Turning now to Dr.
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	's '' The Surface of Things , '' we find ourselves confronted by writing of a different sort from that contained in the preceding volumes of short stories .

		Admirably entertaining as those volumes are , they are dis - tinctly light literature , and lightness is the last quality to be predicated of Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	's work .

		Indeed , the elaborate and possibly a trifle too '' im - portant '' prefatory matter which accompanies these three studies in '' the ethics of the surface '' pre - pares the reader for a severer strain upon the philo - sophical intelligence than is really intended , and it is with something of a surprise to find , in one of the studies at least , the adumbration of a love-story .

		Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	's thesis for his work is written to illustrate a thesis may be briefly stated , for the most part in his own words .

		The interests of the modern civilized man have come to embrace so many things that the motives of the older fiction become every year more and .

		more inadequate to express the complexity of the social organism . ''

		The relation of man to woman , love in all its phases and with all its consequences , the lust of power and gain , the struggle for empire or the strug - gle for existence , money , a successful career '' these must give way in part to '' the more abstract and intellectual interests of life '' if the art of fiction is to remain the typical literary art of the coming century . ''

		The novelists with whose theories I am at issue , it appears to me , always understand by life what I should call the life of prehistoric man . '' ''

		Not only those who are the fullest and highest representatives of our culture and civilization , but even the simplest and humblest members of our modern occidental communities , have a variety of needs and desires , without which life would to them not be worth living , which are so far removed from the fundamental necessities of prehistoric people that they would appear barely to graze the surface of existence . ''

		Voila le grand mot lance .

		That is the sense in which Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	would have us take his title . ''

		These needs appear to be on the surface , but in reality they form the very core of our conscious existence .

		Considerably more than half of our waking thoughts and aspirations are directed toward the satisfaction of them ; they have become fundamental to us , and we therefore need not appeal to the basal passions of life for their justification . ''

		In reading this plea , we think at once of the delicate work of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and the present writer reminds us of Mr.
James	PERSON	at more than one point , but we must add that he strikes the note of a deeper intellectual sincerity , that his utter - ance seems to us much weightier .

		It is true that studies of this sort leave indistinct the border-line that separates the story from the essay , but this difficulty of classification need not concern us in view of the keen pleasure which they afford .

		Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	has opened what is almost a new vein in literature , and we trust that the present small vol - ume is but the earnest of what he shall yet accom - plish in the exploitation .

		BRIEFS ox NKW BOOKS .

		Contemporary The translation of Seignobos 's '' Po - European litical History of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' history .

		by p ro fe 8 8or
S. M. Macvane	PERSON	-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , is a meritorious undertaking .

		The result , we be - lieve , would be more satisfactory were the work that of a translator alone .

		This , however , is not the case , for the book , as given in English , presents many of the translator 's views and criticisms .

		This would be the more bearable were these changes made in addition to rather than in place of original mate - rial ; or were they stamped and subscribed to as `` editor 's notes . ''

		The difficulty is that for the English reader there is nothing to indicate respon - sibility for statements and deductions .

		The most sweeping changes are made in the treatment of
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL present century English history , in which the author and the translator disagree .

		Aside from the gen - eral question of translators ' alterations , is not the conception of a distinguished French historian of greater importance to the student than the mere statement of more generally accepted opinion ?

		As to the book itself , it deserves most generous praise for simplicity of statement , clearness of in - sight , and for a just balancing of the various ele - ments that go to make up the history of a nation in any given period .

		Part I. is devoted to a do - mestic history of
Europe	LOCATION	since
1814	DATE	, by nations ; Part II .

		treats of '' certain political phenomena common to various European communities , '' as , for example , the growth and distribution of ideas of state socialism ; Part III .

		is given up to an exam - ination , for all
Europe	LOCATION	, of such details of military and diplomatic history as have not already been touched upon in previous pages .

		A most interest - ing chapter at the present time is that entitled '' The Parliamentary Republic '' the concluding one in the domestic history of
France	LOCATION	because of the author 's insight into secret political conditions , and because of his supreme faith in the permanence of the Republic .

		Especially noteworthy is his defense of the custom of interpellations .

		The present gov - ernment , says Seignobos , is anomalous in that
France	LOCATION	is governed by men chosen on the demo - cratic principle of election , while it is administered by a beaureaucratic official class , imperial in its organization , and in part independent of public opinion .

		The politicians labor to please the people upon whose votes their political existence depends ; the officials '' tend to see in the citizens subjects of administration who must be kept in due submission to authority and regulations . ''

		While the politicians , as cabinet members , are at the head of official ad - ministration , they are quickly imbued with the spirit and attitude of the permanent office-holding class , and it then becomes the duty of Deputies , by interpellations , to hold them in check .

		Thus inter - pellations '' are practical contrivances which enable two contradictory sets of institutions to exist side by side : a democratic political system and a per - manent administrative hierarchy .

		It compels the permanent officials to submit to the people 's chosen representatives . ''

		It is a new argument , but it will hardly suffice to overthrow the weight of evidence against interpellations .

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	is a man whose good opinion even a great nation of eighty millions of unprecedently well - fed , well-housed , and well-clothed people , like our own , may think worth having .

		We have pretty well gotten over our old provincial sensitiveness to foreign opinion .

		We do n't in general care a rap what the ordinary touring cockney or badaud may think or say of us .

		We did n't fume and fret and neglect our business when even
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	found our cities '' uninteresting , '' and hinted that
Chicago	LOCATION	, for all her culture and '' sky-scrapers , '' was Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's notes on
America	LOCATION	.

		still not exactly the
Athens	LOCATION	of Pericles .

		To be sure , Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	came before the World 's Fair , and never saw the bronze colossus that later kept watch and ward on the Lake Front and awed the soul of the approaching voyager , like the Athene Pro- machos on the
Acropolis	LOCATION	.

		But the pages of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's '' America of To-Day '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are quite free from that '' certain condescension '' we used to resent so hotly .

		He is pleased with us , and wishes us well ; but he does n't affect to look down benevo - lently on us .

		The only thing we have to complain of in his tone is that it is not quite free from that note of amused interest with which the Briton , time out of mind , has been wont to regard the outside world in general .

		But Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's smile is a quiet one , and not in the least irritating ; so we can well afford to let him enjoy it .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's papers are stamped with a freshness of view , and a tendency to reexamine and in some cases to combat certain stock complaints about Brother
Jonathan	PERSON	, that caused them to be rather freely quoted and can - vassed in
England	LOCATION	when they appeared serially for the book is a reprint of letters to
London	LOCATION	peri - odicals .

		His hardy defense of the '' American Lan - guage , '' for instance , really shocked some of his English friends Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, especially , whose nerves , originally none of the strongest , were quite upset by some of his fellow-critic 's heresies .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's Scotch ear is ravished by the skirl of the bag-pipes ; but the American phrase '' all the time '' is enough to drive him out of the room .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has divided his text under two captions ''
Obser	PERSON	- vations , '' under which are grouped the more purely descriptive letters reflecting his impressions of
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, of American hospitality , American character and culture , etc. ; and '' Reflec - tions , '' a series of thoughtful papers on '' North and South , '' '' The Republic and the Empire , '' '' Amer - ican Literature , '' and '' The American Language . ''

		He especially relishes the American humorous anec - dote , and has gathered some choice specimens for English consumption , notably that of the rustic Kentuckian who , leaving the theatre after witness - ing Salvini in '' Othello , '' warmly observed : '' It was a good show a mighty good show ; and I do n't see but the coon did as well as any of 'em .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's undertaking , it will be remembered , as originally planned , called for the completion of the work in five volumes .

		But the appearance of much new matter bearing upon naval events and developments of the present cen - tury has rendered a sixth volume necessary to the promised completeness and comprehensiveness of the work .

		The completion of the History , Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	hopes , will not be much delayed by this ex - tension , material for Volume V. being already in type .

		We gladly testify to the abundant evidences of painstaking research and collation manifest in the work of Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	and his competent colaborers .

		The distinctive plan of the work , that is to say , the parcelling out of specific phases and periods among writers specially qualified to deal with their respective allotments , whatever its obvious draw - backs from the literary point of view , has undoubt - edly conduced to accuracy and despatch , and will result in the production of a book which will long serve as the standard one for reference and appeal .

Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , appears to be to paint in the blackest possible colors the ways and characters of the officers of American sailing ships , not only now but some forty years back , when Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's own experiences of our merchant service were acquired .

		To-day , as in the sixties Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's literary sponsor , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, assures us the terms `` Yankeeship '' and '' Hellship '' are synonymous ; and he goes to say : '' Were the laws now on our statute books rigidly enforced , a large majority of American captains and mates would be sent to the penitentiary , and not a few to the gal - lows or electric chair . ''

		This is strong language , and , supposing it to be justifiable , it seems to imply that the gangs in the forecastles , with whom the wicked captains and mates necessarily served their time and got their notions of sea-discipline , must themselves be a pretty tough lot , and more amena - ble to hard knocks than moral suasion .

		For our part , we are inclined to think the common seaman suffers in general more from the rascally parsimony of stingy shipowners than from the brutality of mates and captains .

		There is at all events this to be said for the officers of a deep-water ship : they are very commonly under the absolute necessity of aweing into subjection ruffianly crews of potential mutineers who outnumber them twenty to one ; and if they resort to rough measures it is fair to pre - sume that they do so quite as much from their knowledge of the men they have to deal with as from mere wanton cruelty .

		Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's book is a readable one , of a rather lurid and sensational order , and it is clearly , as he claims , founded on personal experience ; but we are quite unwilling to accept the ''
Altamont	LOCATION	, '' the '' floating hell '' on which he sailed as an apprentice-boy from
Melbourne	LOCATION	to
Liverpool	LOCATION	, as a representative American merchant ship , or her fiend incarnate of a captain as the typ - ical Yankee skipper .

Benozzo Gozzoli	PERSON	,

		For example , says the '' Trattato '' : '' If you would make a changing drapery in secco , cover it with a flat tint of lake ; use flesh-color for the lights , or , if you will , giallorno .

		Glaze the dark parts as you like with pure lake , or purple -LRB- bisso -RRB- , with tempera . ''

		In

		No man could cover such a field as this without exhibiting many shortcomings , and the au - thor frankly acknowledges his dependence upon the standard histories for some of the outlying re - gions of his survey .

		In the case of
William Penn	PERSON	, it was not possible to produce a very sensa - tional story , because he has not been so idealized as have the two others .

		The changes in his thought as the panorama of his life shifted are admirably set forth .

		Both the frame and the picture are to be praised , and perhaps that is the most satisfactory thing that can be said of a biography .

		Mrs. Fields 's volume on

		Mr.

F. P. Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , although most of the matter is now for the first time printed .

		Over fifty documents or extracts from documents are given , some of them mere scraps from private letters and journals , and all of them narrating per - sonal experiences and adventures in the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	in the days of sail-power , when the gunner guessed at the range , and squinted across the sights of a piece that would have been about as effective as a catapult against the sides of a modern iron - clad .

		The most valuable paper in the book , '' The Journal of a Surgeon '' -LRB- 1758-63 -RRB- , presents a graphic picture of life afloat at that period , and is worth preserving .

		There are several plates after paintings representing famous naval episodes and engagements .

		The curious collection of materials JS .1 SK 1 b y Mr -
Howard Pav8on	PERSON	A old published under the title '' Historic Side-Lights '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , make up a book , whose plan , if it has any , is not easily discovered , and whose purpose excites the increasing wonder of the reader .

		Hercules and
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	may appear in one place ; while , in another , Trilby is appealed to , or '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' is introduced with a characteristic sentence .

		From many a by-path of literature , quaint and curious material has been gathered , quite a large part of it relating more or less closely to
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	.

		The discourse is rambling and disconnected in the extreme , and while portions of it are interesting , and the illustrative details it fur - nishes may be valuable to a reader who is fond of anecdote or flippant phrase , it scarcely seems that serious history is really illuminated by such '' side - lights '' as these .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We have examined with much interest a recent pub - lication of
the University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the work of Mr.
Coiiway Macmillan	PERSON	, and has for its subject ''
Minnesota Plant Life	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work is intended for general reading rather than for text-book use , but is clearly to be taken as an educational publication in the large sense .

		After preliminary chapters on the soci - eties and the migrations of plants , the descriptive work is taken up , beginning with slime-moulds and algfe , and leading up to the most highly specialized forms of flow - ering plants .

		The volume contains 568 pages , and has for illustrations 240 figures and photographs -LRB- many of them of great interest and beauty -RRB- besides four full - page plates .

		Scientific names of species are not given as a rule -LRB- which we think a mistake -RRB- , and there is no analytical key .

		We wish that every State in the
Union	LOCATION	might contrive to publish such a volume as this .

		A recent publication of the
Field Columbian Museum of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	deserves more than a word of passing men - tion .

		It is a work on '' The Birds of
North America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Charles B. Cory	PERSON	, and is a manual of the most practical character for the use of amateur ornithologists .

		The work is , in substance , an analytical key to the fam - ilies and species of all birds known to occur east of the ninetieth meridian ; the descriptions are so plain as to make identification an easy matter even for the inex - perienced , and what is not made clear by the text is made clear by the many illustrations .

		Such a manual as this , inexpensive and easy of use , ought to do much toward popularizing the fascinating branch of natural history with which it is concerned .

		Mr.
Thomas Newbigging	PERSON	, a student , and , we suppose , a stanch defender of the Stuart cause , has recently pro- duced a small volume on '' The Scottish Jacobites '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Gay & Bird	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While the greater part of the book is occupied with a brief narrative of the
Jacob	PERSON	- ite risings and an account of their battles , the two most interesting chapters are those devoted to the fascinating songs and music which had their inspiration in the Lost Cause .

		The portraits and illustrations are really fine , and the wide margins and clear type make up a very attractive volume .

		The following are the latest text-books in the mod - ern languages : M.
France	LOCATION	's '' Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Mr.
C. H. C. Wright	PERSON	; '' Letters of Madame de Sdvigne '' '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , selected and edited by Professor

		The tendency of the American publishing trade to centralize in

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	from
Boston	LOCATION	to that city .

		Their new address is 426 and 428

N. Y.	PERSON	`` The Wider View , '' edited by Mr.
John Monroe Dana	PERSON	, and published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, is an an - thology of short extracts in both prose and verse , em - bodying the higher aspirations and deeper religious thought of many great writers .

		The perennial vitality of

		It is in the ''

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publishes the set in this country .

		The Growth of
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	, '' by Prof.
D. L. Maulsby	PERSON	, is a publication of
Tufts College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pamphlet thesis designed to show that the work in ques - tion had its roots in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's earlier work , and was , in fact , '' an epitome of all that
Carlyle	PERSON	thought and felt in the course of the first thirty-five years of his resi - dence on this planet . '' ''

		Who 's Who '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for
1900	DATE	has just made its appearance and will be welcomed by editors and other persons who are constantly needing up-to-date information about persons and things .

		We note the curious classification which puts down '' The Atlantic Monthly '' as a leading American newspaper .

		The infor - mation afforded upon English subjects is , we doubt not , more accurate than this . ''

		Statistical Methods with
Special Reference	ORGANIZATION	to Bio - logical Variation , '' by Dr.
C. B. Davenport	PERSON	, is the title of a small volume published by Messrs.
John Wiley	PERSON	& Son .

		It is issued '' in answer to a repeated call for a simple presentation of the newer statistical methods in their application to biology , '' and contains the work - ing formula ?

		most used in
summer	DATE	laboratories .

		The little book is bound in full leather , and will slip easily into the pocket . ''

		Mythology for Moderns , '' by Mr.
James S. Met	PERSON	- calfe , is a book issued by the '' Life ''
Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text consists of a series of up-to-date versions of the ancient myths , as audacious as an Offenbach libretto , while many illustrations add their share to the enter - tainment offered .

		The same publishers have also sent us a thin quarto volume of ''
Coontown	PERSON	's 400 , '' by Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	.

		Here the pictures are the thing , and the text is reduced to brief explanatory notes .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	contributed recently the follow - ing verses , entitled '' A Christmas Ghost Story , '' to a
London	LOCATION	paper : '' South of the Line , inland from far
Durban	LOCATION	, There lies be he or not your countryman A fellow mortal .

		Riddled are his bones , But ` mid the breeze his puzzled phantom moans Nightly to clear Canopus fain to know By whom , and when , the All-Earth-Gladdening Law Of Peace , brought in by Some One crucified .

		Was ruled to be inept , and set aside ? ''

		The death of
James Martineau	PERSON	, which occurred as our last issue was going to press , must not be passed by without at least a brief and belated word of mention .

		He had reached the great age of nearly ninety-five years , and had retained his intellectual vigor almost to the last .

		Among the leaders of nineteenth century re - ligious thought in
England	LOCATION	he towers like a giant above all save two or three , having , for his peers only such men as
Newman	PERSON	and
Maurice	PERSON	.

		Nominally a Unitarian , 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, bis outlook was too liberal to be confined even by that broad horizon , and it is hardly fair to apply to him any sectarian name .

		His life was spent in teaching and preaching , in
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Liverpool	LOCATION	,
Manchester	LOCATION	, and Lon - don .

		So engrossing were these activities that he pub - lished few books .

		Two volumes of college lectures , four of sermons , '' A Study of Religion , '' and '' Types of Eth - ical Theory , '' are all the publications that need be men - tioned .

		The last-named is his most important book , and is likely to live the longest . ''

		The Empire of the South '' is the title of an attract - ive and creditable work of some two hundred pages , written by Mr.
Frank Presbrey	PERSON	and published with the cooperation of the
Southern Railway	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is a comprehensive treatment of the history , development , resources , and industries of the
Southern States	LOCATION	, with descriptions of pleasure and health resorts , and is illus - trated with five hundred photographs reproduced in half-tone .

		It appeals very strongly to those who have travelled in this interesting section of our country , and must prove of much value to the prospective traveller or investor .

		Mr.
Frederick Furchheim	PERSON	has followed his ''
Biblio	PERSON	- grafia di Pompei '' -LRB- see THE DIAL ,
1895	DATE	, Vol .

		XIX. , p. 149 -RRB- with a '' Bibliografia del Vesuvio . ''

		This is by far the most extensive collection of titles relating to Vesu - vius that has ever been brought together .

		According to a summary given by the compiler in a footnote , the names of about 1000 writers are recorded , reference being made to more than 1800 books and articles .

		Italian writ - ers naturally claim the largest number of titles , 944 ; but the interest that the world in general has taken in the volcano may be measured by the fact that there are no less than 329 German , 257 French , and 180 English titles .

		The matter of the books and articles referred to covers a wide range ; there are included technical treatises on the geology and mineralogy of the volcano , descriptions of eruptions , by eye-witnesses , and philo - sophical disquisitions on the volcanic phenomena , be - sides papers dealing with the history of the mountain from the earliest times .

		The titles are arranged in alphabetical order under the authors ' names .

		At the end is a list of engravings and maps , followed by a chronological finding-list and an index .

		The volume is well printed , and altogether a valuable addition to the list of bibliographical helps .

		-LRB-
Naples	LOCATION	: Emilio Prass . -RRB-


Richard Doddridge Blackmore	PERSON	, the author of ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' who died on the twenty-first of
last month	DATE	, at the age of seventy-five , had the misfortune to be con - sidered as a man of one book by a large section of the public .

		While it is probably true that the novel by which he was so widely known was his highest literary achievement , it is also true that he wrote other novels nearly as deserving of praise . ''

		The Maid of Sker , '' for example , is a very close second , and such books as ''
Alice Lorraine	PERSON	'' and '' Springhaven '' come not very far behind .


Blackmore	PERSON	's rank among the novelists of the latter half of the century is very high .

		There was a time about twenty-five years ago , after the major Victorian novelists had passed away , when he seemed to overtop any of his contemporaries .

		At that time , neither Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	nor Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	had been discov - ered by the larger public , and Black appeared to be the chief rival of
Blackmore	PERSON	.

		Besides the novels we have named , we may mention ''
Clara Vaughan	PERSON	'' -LRB- his first -RRB- , ''
Cradock Nowell	PERSON	, ''
Cripps	PERSON	the Carrier , '' Crema , '' '' Christowell , '' ''
Mary Anesley	PERSON	, '' and '' Perlycross . ''

		He began his literary life , however , as a poet , a fact attested by three or four volumes of verse , and by a translation of two of the '' Georgics '' of
Virgil	PERSON	.

		The last-named task was a labor of love , if ever there was one , for
Blackmore	PERSON	's interests throughout his life were divided , like those of our own Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, between literature and gardening , if indeed gardening may not be named as his vocation , having literature for a mere avocation .

		His neighbors , in his country home a few miles outside of
London	LOCATION	, knew him as an expert grower of fruits and vegetables , having little idea of his fame in the world of letters , and many of the most delightful pages in his books derive their charm from his intimate acquaintance with the aspects of farm life .

		His command of a finished -LRB- if at times too rhythmical -RRB- prose style , his familiarity with the homely speech of the rustic , his sympathy with dumb animals , his tender human feeling , and perhaps also his fine old crusted conservatism , may be mentioned as the predominant characteristics of his books and his thought .

		REVIEW OF THE WEEK .

		`` An excellent full-blooded romance .

		The quality of the story is its fine dramatic development , which keeps it so coherent a whole .

		It proceeds with the true dramatic sureness to an inevitable , admirable climax ; and the series of thrilling scenes at
Lady Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's house in Queen 's Square are among the most truly dramatic in romance . ''

		DAILY CHRONICLE . ''

		The scene in
Lady Oxford	LOCATION	's drawing-room , where most of the characters in the story are got together , and the newsboys in the street outside are shouting out the discovery of a Popish plot , is a most admirable piece of comedy , with tragedy as a background .

		We never wish to read anything better of its kind .

		It is a veritable triumph of stage management , and of the art which conceals art .

		Distinctly the book is a success .

		To speak of '
Parson Kelly	PERSON	' as though it were an effort of mere craftsmanship is to do it an injustice .

		It is very real artistry .

		One 's interest is held all through . ''

		PALL MALL GAZETTE . ''

		A brilliant novel ... The enjoyment of the book is so keen that it entirely absorbs one ... The Lady Oxford here presented is a brilliant , worthless ' strange woman , ' who must henceforth take rank in fiction as a distinct , vivid character ; and that the elaborate intricacy of cross purposes and cross currents that centred round her and the hero on the
night	TIME	when she gave her rout and
George Kelly	PERSON	was arrested as a Jacobite , is as clever and as masterly a piece of work as one would wish to see ... The work is worthy of the combined brilliance of its authors ; and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, whose position has long been established , will not grudge our saying that , above all , it sets the seal on Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's remarkable talent . ''

		128 `` WHEN WE DEAD AWAKE . ''

		The publication of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's latest drama comes a year later than his long-established custom had led us to expect .

		Since the appear - ance of '' An Enemy of the People '' in
1882	DATE	, every second year brought its new play until
1898	DATE	, when it was learned that no work was then forthcoming .

		Coupled with this announce ment was a report to the effect that the vener able dramatist had in view the writing of a volume of memoirs , but it seems that this pro ject , if ever definitely entertained , was aban doned in favor of another play , which duly came from the press late last
December	DATE	, and has re cently reached us .

		It is in three acts , bears the suggestive title , ''
Naar Vi Dode Vaagner	PERSON	, and is further described as '' a dramatic epi logue . ''

		We are given to understand that this description means that the author has defi - nitely closed the series of problem - plays , or studies in social pathology , which was begun in
1878	DATE	with The Pillars of Society , '' and which is made an even dozen by the work now under discussion .

		One in search of fanciful analogies might find in that first title some suggestion of an intellectual
Samson	PERSON	deter - mined to pull down the temple of modern so - ciety , and in the last some suggestion of the nobler social structure that may be expected to
spring	DATE	from the ruins of the old order .

		This is , of course , the merest fancy and nothing more , but it is the prerogative of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's work to suggest ideas that lie far afield from its direct message , and it is impossible to remain literal-minded in the presence of the ex - traordinary series of compositions now brought to an end .

		Their significance is none the less real because it is elusive , and their larger im - plications must determine our judgment quite as much as the nicety of their dramaturgical craftsmanship . ''

		When We Dead Awake '' is a title which in itself awakens many echoes from the author 's earlier writings .

		It proclaims anew his whole insistent gospel of the need of spiritual regeneration for an age sunk in sloth fulness the gospel of Brand 's '' Forth I out of this stifling pit !

		Vault-like is the air of it !

		Not a flag may float unfurl 'd In this dead and windless world '' * 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, it sounds once more that note of high idealism which is never altogether missing from his work , and which is the real secret of the appeal which he has so powerfully made to all who have ever dreamed of the realization of Utopias and the permanent betterment of the social order .

		But , whatever aspirations may breathe through his symbolism , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	never forgets that he is a dramatic artist writing for the stage , and that his first concern is the concrete pre - sentation of such men and women as we may at any time meet with in actual life .

		The new play opens in the most matter-of-fact way at a
summer	DATE	resort on the Norwegian coast .

		Pro- fessor
Rubek	PERSON	and his wife
Maja	PERSON	are seated outside the hotel .

		They have just finished breakfast and are reading the newspapers .

		Rubek is a sculptor of European reputation , who has returned to his native land after a lengthy sojourn abroad .

		Both are restless , and it soon transpires that neither of them has found satisfaction during the years of their married life .

		It is a case of the deeper sort of incom - patibility .

		An artist and a frivolous woman are joined together , and neither of them can give the other what is most wanted .

		To him has been denied inspiration for his work , to her the joyous round of gaiety which she craves .

		For years they have pretended a satisfaction they did not feel , but the breaking-point has nearly been reached .

		Maja .

		Tell me .

		You have begun to go restlessly about .

		You find contentment nowhere , either at home or abroad .

		Of late you have come to shun human society .

		Rubek .

		No , really ?

		Have you noticed that ?

		Maja .

		No one who knows you could help noticing it .

		And it seems to me , it has grown so serious that you have lost all pleasure in work .

		Ilubtk .

		Have I done that ?

		Maja .

		Just think , you , who formerly could work so un - weariedly early and late !

		Rubek .

		Yes , formerly , yes Maja .

		But from the time when your great masterpiece was once off your hands Rubek . ''

		The Day of Resurrection ''
Maja	PERSON	.

		the one that bus gone all over the world , that has made you so famous Rubek .

		Perhaps that is the misfortune ,
Maja	LOCATION	.

		Maja .

		Why so ?

		Rubek .

		When I had created that masterpiece of mine -LSB- making a passionate gesture -RSB- , for `` The Day of Resurrec - tion '' is a masterpiece .

		Or it was at first .

		No , it is still .

		It shall , shall , shall remain a masterpiece !

		Maja .

		Yes ,
Rubek	PERSON	, that is something which all the world knows .

		Rubek .

		nothing I
Maja	PERSON	,
Rubek	PERSON	.

		All the world knows nothing I Understands At any rate they imagine something .

		Something which is n't there , yes .

		Something which was never in my thought .

		They fall into an ecstasy over that .

		It is n't worth the while to wear yourself out for the mob and the crowd and for '' all the world . ''

		Maja .

		Does it seem to you better , or even worthy of your - self to do nothing but a portrait bust now and then ?

		Rubek .

		They are not strictly portrait busts that I make ,
Maja	LOCATION	.

		Maja .

		Yes they are , God knows , during the last two or three years , since your great group was completed and out of the house .

		Rubek .

		Yet they are not merely portrait busts , I tell you .

		Maja .

		What do you mean by that ?

		Rubek .

		There is something suspicious , something con - cealed , both inside and outside the busts something secret , that men can not see .

		Maja .

		Indeed !

		Rubek .

		But I can see it .

		And I get my quiet amusement out of it .

		Apparently there is the `` striking likeness , '' as they call it , which people stand and gaze at with wonder -LSB- in a tower tone \ but deep within are traced the respectable , even honorable lineaments of the horse , or sometimes donkey snouts , and close-eared low-browed dog-skulls , and masked swine 's heads , and the counterfeit presentment of brutal ox - faces Maja .

		All the domestic animals , in fact .

		Rubek .

		Just the domestic animals ,
Maja	LOCATION	.

		All the animals that man has transformed in his own image , and that have transformed man by way of compensation .

		And these tricky works of art are what well-to-do people come and order of me .

		And pay for in good faith , and with high praises .

		Almost with their weight in gold , as men say .

		Maja -LSB- filling his glass -RSB- .

		Fie , Rubek !

		Drink and be con - tent .

		Rubek .

		I am content ,
Maja	LOCATION	.

		Really content .

		In a way , that is .

		-LSB- Pause . -RSB-

		For there is a certain happiness in feeling free and undisturbed on all sides .

		To have everything that one can think of desiring .

		Externally , I mean .

		Do n't you feel as I do about it ,
Maja ?	PERSON

		Maja .

		Oh , yes , that is all very well , too .

		But can you remember what you promised me the day when we agreed about that difficult Rubek .

		Agreed that we should marry .

		It was a little hard for you ,
Maja	LOCATION	.

		Maja .

		And that I should journey abroad with you , and live there for good and be happy .

		Can you remember what you promised me then ?

		Rubek .

		No , really I ca n't .

		What was it I promised you ?

		Maja .

		You said you would take me up on a high moun - tain and show me all the glory of the world .

		Rubek .

		Did I make you that promise too ?

		Maja .

		Me too ?

		Whom besides ?

		Rubek .

		No , no , I mean merely , did I promise to show you ?

		Maja .

		All the glory of the world .

		Yes , you said that .

		And all the glory should be mine and yours , you said .

		Rubek .

		It was a sort of phrase that I was in the habit of using in those days .

		Soon after this conversation , the two remain - ing characters of the play come upon the scene .

		One is a landed proprietor named
Ulfhejm	PERSON	, the other is
Irene	PERSON	, a pale , mysterious woman who turns out to be an old friend of Rubek no other , in fact , than the woman who had been his model for '' The Day of Resurrection , '' and thus the inspiration of his best artistic effort .

		She is attended by a deaconess , a shadowy , silent figure , who speaks only three words at the very close of the drama .


Ulf	PERSON	- hejm , who is an enthusiastic sportsman , is coarse of speech and unconventional in man - ner .

		Maja is attracted to him by his abundant animal spirits , and they plan a hunting expe -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		Ill dition .

		When they have gone off together ,
Rubek	PERSON	is left with
Irene	PERSON	, and memories of the past come surging upon him .

		In the intimacy of their earlier relations , he had viewed her with the artist 's eye only ; she , on the other hand , had loved him with all the strength of her passionate nature .

		To him she had been an episode ; to her he had been every - thing that makes life desirable .

		When they had parted she had become like '' The Woman with the Dead Soul '' of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	's poem .

		She had existed , but the vital spark had been extinguished within her breast .

		He , learning too late how great was his need of her inspiration , had made a prosaic marriage , and had discovered that the creative impulse had fled beyond his control .

		The situation is some - thing like that of '' Master Builder Solness , '' when the appearance of
Hilda	PERSON	reawakens in the artist the old aspirations and the old ideal visions .

		Irene reproaches the sculptor with having seen in her only the beautiful figure , not the loving woman 's soul .

		Rubek .

		I was an artist ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		Irene .

		Just that , just that .

		Rubek .

		An artist first of all .

		And I was ill and would create the great work of my life .

		It should be called '' The Day of Resurrection . ''

		It should be produced in the likeness of a young woman , waking from the sleep of death .

		Irene .

		Our child , yes .

		Rubek .

		She should be the noblest , purest , most ideal woman of earth , she who awoke .

		And then I found you .

		I could use you with complete satisfaction .

		And you submitted so willingly , so gladly .

		Left people and home , and followed me .

		Irene .

		It was my resurrection from childhood when I fol - lowed you .

		Rubek .

		That was just why I could use you .

		You and none other .

		You became for me a sacrosanct creature , whom I might touch only in the worship of my thoughts .

		I was still young then ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		And I was possessed by the superstition that should I touch you , desire you in reality , it would be a desecration , and put beyond my power the work that I sought to do .

		And I yet believe there is truth in that .

		Irene .

		First the work of art then the human child .

		Rubek .

		Judge of it as yon will .

		But I was completely controlled by my task at that time , and it made me jubilantly happy .

		Irene .

		And your task turned the corner for you ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Rubek .

		With thanks and blessings for you , it turned the corner for me .

		I sought to create the pure woman just as it seemed to me she must awake on the day of resurrection .

		Not surprised at anything new and unknown and undreamed of , but filled with sacred joy at finding herself unchanged she , the woman of earth in the higher , freer , more joyous lands after the long and dreamless sleep of death .

		So did I create her in your image I created her ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		Irene .

		And so you were through with me .

		Rubek .

		Irene !

		Irene .

		Needed me no longer .

		Rubek .

		Can you say that ?

		Irene .

		Began to look about for other ideals .

		Rubek .

		But found none , none after you .

		Irene .

		No other models ,
Arnold	LOCATION	?

		Rubek .

		You were no model for me .

		You were the task set for my creative powers .

		Irene .

		What have you done since ?

		In marble , I mean .

		Since the day I left you ?

		Rubek .

		I have done nothing since that day .

		Merely trifled and modelled .

		Irene .

		And the woman with whom you are now living ?

		Rubek .

		Do not speak of her now .

		A pang strikes through my breast .

		Irene .

		Where do you think of journeying with her ?

		Rubek .

		Oh , some trip or other up the north coast .

		Irene .

		Journey rather high up among the mountains .

		As high as you can climb .

		Higher , higher , ever higher ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Rubek .

		Will you up yonder ?

		Irene .

		Have you courage to meet me once more ?

		Rubek .

		If we could ah , if we could !

		Irene .

		Why can we not do what we will ?

		Come ,
Arnold	LOCATION	, come up to me . ''

		Why can we not do what we will ? ''

		The whole of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is in that passionate question .

		Why does deed fall so far short of impulse ?

		Why do we cripple our lives by making them so much less than our ideals ?

		Noticeable also in this scene is the recurrence of the typical motive of '' Solness , '' for as
Hilda	PERSON	comes to the master builder , and recalls the past in such fashion as to rekindle his artistic energies , so
Irene	PERSON	comes to the sculptor at a similar period of slackened will , and bids him once more be greatly daring .

		The two extracts thus far made are taken from the first act of the play .

		In the second act ,
Rubek	PERSON	and his wife , in sorrow rather than in passion , say some of the things they have long felt , and put into bare and almost brutal speech their attitude toward one another .

		After this discussion ,
Maja	PERSON	leaves the scene , meets
Irene	PERSON	, and sends her to Rubek .

		Irene .

		She , the other woman , said that you were waiting for me .

		Rubek .

		I have been waiting for you year after year , with - out understanding it myself .

		Irene .

		I could not come to yon ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		I lay far yonder , sleeping a long , deep , dreamful sleep .

		Rubek .

		But now you are awake ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		Irene .

		Yet deep and heavy sleep is still upon my eyes .

		Rubek .

		It will dawn and grow bright for us both now , you shall see .

		Irene .

		I can never believe that .

		Rubek .

		I believe it !

		I know it !

		For now I have found you again .

		Irene .

		Arisen .

		Rubek .

		Transfigured !

		Irene .

		Only arisen ,
Arnold	LOCATION	, not transfigured .

		A long reminiscent scene between the two now follows , leading at last to this poetical and impressive climax .

		Irene Look ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Now the sun is sinking behind the peaks .

		Just see how red the slanting rays shine upon all the hilltops yonder .

		Rubek .

		It is long since I have seen a sunset on the moun - tains .

		Irene .

		And a sunrise ?

		Rubek .

		I think I have never seen a sunrise .

		Irene .

		I saw a wonderfully beautiful sunrise once .

		Rubek .

		Did you ?

		Where was it ?

		Irene .

		High , high up on a dizzy mountain top .

		You enticed me thither , and promised that I should behold all the glory of the world , if I would only Rubek .

		If you would only ?

		Well ?

		Irene .

		I did as you told me .

		Followed you up to the 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, heights .

		And there I fell on my knees , and besought you and worshipped you .

		Then I saw the sunrise .

		The close of this act brings an appointment between the two to spend the warm bright
summer	DATE
night	TIME	upon the heights .

		At the same time it must be remembered that
Maja	PERSON	and
Ulfhejm	PERSON	have planned a hunting expedition for that night also .

		Irene .

		Until to-night .

		On the upland .

		Rubek .

		And you will come ,
Irene	PERSON	?

		Irene .

		I will truly come .

		Wait for me here .

		Rubek .

		A
summer	DATE
night	TIME	on the upland .

		With yon , with you .

		Oh ,
Irene	PERSON	, it might have been a lifetime .

		And we have wasted it , we two .

		Irene .

		We first come to see the irretrievable when
Rubek	PERSON	.

		When ?

		Irene .

		When we dead awake .

		Rubek .

		What is it we come to see ?

		Irene .

		We see that we have never lived .

		With the last act comes the inevitable tragic ending .

		The scene is laid high up among the mountains , with precipices on the one hand , and snowclad peaks on the other .

		The time is just before sunrise .

		Maja and
Ulfhejm	PERSON	first appear , and after a long dialogue , come upon
Irene	PERSON	and Rubek .

		A storm is brewing , and the note of warning is sounded by
Ulfhejm	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ulfhfjm .

		Do n't you see that the tempest is over our head .

		Do n't yon hear the gusts of wind .

		Eubek .

		It sounds like the overture to the day of resur - rection .

		Ulfhejm .

		It is the storm-wind from the peaks , man !

		Just see how the clouds roll and descend .

		Soon they will close about us like a winding-sheet .

		Irene .

		Well do I know that shroud .

		Maja .

		Let us try to get down .

		Ulfhejm .

		I can help but one .

		Stop in that hut until the tempest is stilled .

		I will send people up to rescue both of you .

		Irene .

		Rescue us !

		No , no !

		Ulfhejm .

		To take you by force , if need be .

		It is a ques - tion of life and death .

		Now you know the truth .

		-LSB- To
Maja	PERSON	-RSB- Come on , and trust to your comrade 's strength .

		Maja .

		Oh , how I shall rejoice and sing if I get down with a whole skin .

		Ulfhejm .

		Just wait in that huntsman 's hut until they come for you with ropes .

		Rubek and
Irene	PERSON	are now left alone .

		The woman is in an ecstasy of terror at the thought of returning to the hopeless conditions of every - day life .

		She displays a dagger , and declares that she will not suffer herself to be rescued .

		She also confesses that she had meant the dagger for Rubek himself , that he might atone for all that she had suffered from his indiffer - ence and desertion .

		Rubek .

		Why did yon not strike ?

		Irene .

		Because the frightful thought came to me that you were already dead , long since .

		Rubek .

		Dead ?

		Irene .

		Dead , you as well as I .

		We sat there together , we two clammy corpses , and played together .

		Rubek .

		I do not call it death .

		But you can not understand me .

		Irene .

		Where is now the burning desire with which you once fought , when I stood before you as the uprisen woman ?

		Rubek .

		Our love is surely not dead ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		Irene .

		The love which is the life of earth , the beautiful , wonderful life of earth , the mystery - haunted life of earth that is dead in us both .

		Rubek .

		Do n't you know that just that love is seething and burning in me as fiercely as ever before .

		Irene .

		And I. Have you forgotten what I now am ?

		Rubek .

		Be who and what you will .

		For me you are the woman I dream that I behold in you .

		Rubfk .

		We are free .

		There is yet time for us to live our life ,
Irene	PERSON	.

		Irene .

		The desire of life died within me ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Then I arose , and spied you out , and found you .

		And now I see that both you and life are lying dead , as I lay .

		Rubek .

		How are your thoughts astray !

		The stir and the ferment of life are in us and about us as before .

		Irene .

		The young uprisen woman sees the whole of life upon its couch of death .

		Rubek .

		Then let us two dead live life once to the dregs , ere we go down again into our graves .

		Irene .

		Arnold !

		Rubek .

		But not here in the twilight .

		Not here , where the wet , hideous shroud flaps about us .

		Irene .

		No , no .

		Up into the light and all the glittering glory !

		Up to the peaks of divination !

		Rubek .

		Up there we will celebrate our bridal festival ,
Irene	PERSON	, my beloved .

		Irene .

		The sun will see us gladly ,
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Rubek .

		All the powers of light will see us gladly .

		And all the powers of darkness .

		-LSB- Taking her hand -RSB- Will you follow me then , my gracious bride ?

		Irene .

		Willingly and gladly will I follow my lord and master .

		Rubek .

		We must first make our way through the mists ,
Irene	PERSON	, and then
Irene	PERSON	.

		Yes , through all the mists , and so straight up to the towering peak , that gleams iu the sunrise .

		As the two pass upward hand in hand , the tempest increases in violence .

		The silent attendant of
Irene	PERSON	appears and looks about for her mistress .

		The jubilant voice of
Maja	ORGANIZATION	is heard from far below .

		Then , with a roar like thunder , an avalanche sweeps down the moun - tain side , and buries the devoted two in its depths .

		Such is the scene which , like the similar scene in '' Brand , '' leaves us awe-stricken at the close of the drama .

		We leave to others the task of reading a lesson into this tragic presentment of two human souls thus brought to the crisis of their lives .

		Journalism and by journalism we mean the sort of writing which , whether found in newspapers or in books , invariably balks at every form of ideal - ism , and always , of the possible motives for any course of action , assumes the basest or the least worthy to offer the most rational explanation journalism , we say , will scoff at this story , just as it scoffed at '' L'Abbesse de Jouarre '' and '' Die
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	, '' with both of which works this drama has suggestive affinities .

		But we pity the reader who can contemplate the situation here created by the genius of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, and find only prosaic emotions to feel , only prosaic things to say .

		An awful pity and
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 an awful sense of omnipotent fate seem the fitting subjective accompaniment of the tragedy here worked out with unerring objective mas - tery .

		In the presence of such creative power , of such a certain grasp upon the very core of passion , such an envisagement of the problem of life when stripped of all adventitious trap - pings , all criticism seems futile , and all com - ment superfluous .

		For this occasion , at any rate , we will remain content with the outline of the story that has been given , and with the illustrative extracts that have been translated .

		We understand that an English version of the drama , made by Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, will soon be offered to the public .

		Mrs.

Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	visited the Thackerays and took tea with them .

		Her hosts waited in vain for the brilliant conversation , or even intelligent remarks that they expected .

		Thackeray , before the evening was half over , made his escape to the club . ''

		The writer is wisely vague as to where Mrs.

		DEMOCRACY OUT OF JOINT .

		* Mr.
Gamaliel Bradford	PERSON	owes such public reputation as he enjoys mainly to the numerous contributions that he has made , in the last thirty years or so , to certain leading journals of the country , in which he has freely criticised the course of our governments and confidently offered a specific remedy for the evils that have furnished the subjects of his criticism .

		He now comes before the public with an elaborate work , which comprises two volumes of more than eleven hundred pages , devoted to a much fuller and abler presentation of his well-known views .

		The range of his argument is very wide , and it is impossible in these columns to do more than to state his leading ideas .

		First , however , we must seize the author 's point of view .

		Perhaps occasional readers , or even regular readers , of his newspaper lucubrations have formed the opinion that Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	despairs of popular government .

		Not at all ; he is rather a thorough believer in democracy .

		On this point he takes pains not to be misunder - stood .

		He begins with the well-known yet almost astounding fact that '' within little more than a century a force has made its appearance in the world which was never before known , and which , having already changed the whole face of society , points to still greater changes in the future '' ; the allusion being '' not to a phys - ical but to a moral cause ; that is , the carrying on of government , if only in theory , in accordance with the expressed wish of the great mass of the people . ''

		His first chapter is devoted to histor - ical illustrations of this proposition .

		He ex - amines and thrusts aside '' some criticisms of democracy '' that have been made by such well - known writers as President
Woolsey	PERSON	,
Francis Parkman	PERSON	, and Sir
Henry Sumner Maine	PERSON	, and asserts a confident faith in popular government .

		He insists that history furnishes no good reason for discarding it , but the contrary .

		If popular governments have made mistakes and fallen into excesses , so have all other governments since society began mistakes and excesses both greater and more numerous .

		At the same time , popular governments have been the source and cause of reforms and benefits of the most extended and beneficent character .

		The facts of history that he marshalls to support these * THE LESSON OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT .

		By
Gamaliel Bradford	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, propositions , and particularly the last one , are extremely effective .

		Think of it !

		when Black - stone wrote his '' Commentaries '' in 1760-70 there were a hundred and sixty capital crimes underthe English law ; up to
1838	DATE	, poor debtors were immured in the miserable prisons of the time ; down to
1833	DATE	, Parliament had done noth - ing whatever for popular education in
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, and then began with the pittance of .20,000 a year ; while as late as
1815	DATE	the tax on a copy of a newspaper was fourpence .

		The extraordinary changes that have been made in these matters , and many more , are the work of democracy .

		`` Much space has been given to the experience of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, because it is there that the best results of pop - ular government have been worked out . ''

		The other countries that have been deeply touched by the democratic spirit are passed in review , with an outcome that , on the whole , is encour - aging .

		If the
United States	LOCATION	has not made as much progress in matters of government as some other countries which must be admitted '' one reason is that we began at a point so relatively high that a proportionate improve - ment was not to be expected , especially when it was encumbered during the first half cen - tury with the conflict with slavery , and since then with the tide of promiscuous foreign em - igration . ''

		Before passing on , we may remark upon the almost universal tendency to exaggerate the weaknesses and excesses of democracy as com - pared with those of aristocracy or monarchy .

		The fact is a distinctly interesting one , and its psychology well worth investigation .

		Somehow it is far worse for the people to kill than it is for the prince or the lord ; also far worse to kill a prince or lord than it is to kill the peo - ple .

		And yet Mr.
Froude	PERSON	assures us , in a pow - erful paragraph of his ''
Caesar	PERSON	, '' that the popular party , as compared with the aristo - cratic party , has always been the party of mod - eration and mercy . ''

		Patricians and plebians , aristocrats and democrats , have alike stained their hands with blood in the work - ing out of the problem of politics .

		But impartial his - tory also declares that the crimes of the popular party have in all ages been the lighter in degree , while in themselves they have more to excuse them ; and if the violent acts of revolutionists have been held up more conspicuously for condemnation , it has been only be - cause the fate of noblemen and gentlemen has been more impressive to the imagination than the fate of the peasant or the artisan .

		But the endurance of the ine - qualities of life by the poor is the marvel of human society .

		When the people complain , said
Mirabeau	PERSON	, the people are always right .

		The popular cause has been the cause of the laborer struggling for a right to live and breathe and think as a man .

		Aristocracies fight for wealth and power wealth which they waste upon luxury , and power which they abuse for their own interests .

		Yet the cruelties of
Marius	PERSON	were as far ex - ceeded by the cruelties of Sylla as the insurrection of the beggars of
Holland	LOCATION	was exceeded by the bloody tribunal of the
Duke of Alva	ORGANIZATION	; or as ' the horrors of the French Revolution ' were exceeded by the massacre of the Huguenots two hundred years before , for which the Revolution was the expiatory atonement . ''

		But while a firm believer in democracy , Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	contends that in the
United States	LOCATION	, and in some other countries where popular government is found , democracy is out of joint .

		Popular government is not producing its legit - imate fruits .

		Incompetence , extravagance , and corruption abound and grow apace .

		He passes in review our
National , State	ORGANIZATION	, and municipal governments , as they bear upon this point .

		The suppression of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	rebellion and the maintenance of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, together with '' the crowning glory , '' the restoration of peace , and the speedy reestablishment of fraternal relations between the sections , shows what the American democracy is capable of doing when it has a fair chance . ''

		A firm conviction is justified that the spirit which did these things is just as available to-day for the vic - tories of peace as it then was for those of war ; that it can be made use of for reforms which would immedi - ately insure the purity and efficiency of government in the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, the States , and the cities .

		Why it is not , and how it may be so made , it is the object of this book to examine . ''

		What , then , is the matter ?

		Why does not popular government work as it ought to work ?

		Why is it that our governments are inefficient , costly , and often corrupt ?

		The answer comes in such propositions as that '' The executive is the essential branch of government , '' '' Neither the people nor the legislature can govern , '' and '' Our dangers arise from the legislature . ''

		Much of the author 's argumentation is really , but not formally , an expansion of the well - known sentences that
Madison	PERSON	sent in one of the papers of '' The Federalist . '' ''

		Experience proves a tendency in our governments to throw all power into the legislative vortex .

		The ex - ecutives of the States are little more than ciphers .

		The legislatures are omnipotent .

		If no effectual check can be devised on the encroachments of the latter , a revo - lution will be inevitable . ''

		Such was Mr.
Madison	PERSON	's prophecy .

		If he and his compeers could have seen the spectacle of mingled incompetence and corruption that our worst State legislatures present year after year the carnivals of folly and selfishness they might have been too disheartened to go farther
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 115 with the experiment of popular government .

		Fortunately , the character of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has never fallen so low , although that is low enough ; but the municipal legislatures have gone still lower .

		Good government , we are told , is impossible without leadership , and legislatures cannotlead .

		Political leadership , like all other leadership , is necessarily individual , and it must reside in or be directly connected with the executive . ''

		In all cases in history where a nation has been lifted out of almost desperate complications , it has been always under the leadership of one man .

		Take the dawn of modern civilization in
Europe	LOCATION	under
Charla	LOCATION	- magne .

		There is
William the Silent	ORGANIZATION	in
Holland	LOCATION	,
William Pitt	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	,
Richelieu	PERSON	and
Napoleon	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	,
Stein	PERSON	and
Bismarck	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Cavour	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	and Lincoln in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		If it were objected that some of these names are of ominous sound to believers in popular government , the author would reply that they stand for the power and value of leadership , which is just as important in popular govern - ments as in any other .

		What then is the remedy for the ills of the body politic ?

		What must be done to put democracy in joint ?

		In general the answer is that the power of the legislatures must be limited and the power of the executives be increased , while the two are brought into closer affiliation .

		In a word , the answer is the spe - cific if the word may be allowed that Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	has been holding up to view all these weary years , a form of cabinet government . ''

		For this it is necessary that they -LSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the President -RSB- should come physically into contact ; that the executive should have just as good an opportunity of stating his position and defending his rights before the great arbitrating tribunal of public opinion as the legislature has , and that each branch should enforce responsibility upon the other . '' ''

		The prescription for the complaint , '' Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	tells us , '' is furnished to us by good authority , '' namely , a bill that was submitted to the
National Senate	ORGANIZATION	by an influential com - mittee of its members in
February , 1881	DATE	, of which the following are the two leading para - graphs : '' That the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, the Secretary of the

		So far as remedy is concerned , Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's reasoning in great part may be described as the expansion and enforcement of these main ideas .

		We have now outlined , very roughly , the general course of the argument .

		It will not be at all new to many readers .

		These ideas have been more or less familiar to the country for a generation .

		Criticism of them , to be of value , would necessarily require space that we can not devote to the subject .

		We have long been of the opinion that it is desirable to bring the legislative and executive branches of our gov - ernments into much closer connection , borrow - ing , as far as we fairly can considering out institutions , the cabinet idea of
England	LOCATION	; but we must confess to not being fully persuaded that if this were done the effects would be as far-reaching and as beneficent as Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	, in his enthusiastic advocacy , is disposed to think .

		For the rest , it must suffice to say that he conducts the discussion with decided ability and earnestness ; that he brings before us an amount of historical and political information that makes his work valuable for the purposes of comparative study , and that , even if one does not agree with him fully , or not at all , in his main theses , he must admit the great import - ance of the subject and the value of all discus - sions of it that show marks of serious study by an earnest and able mind .

		We have a single reflection to add .

		If salva - tion can come to us only in the manner that Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	believes , the outlook is not very encouraging .

		His main idea has now been for some time before the country .

		We have not forgotten although he does not mention it , that we have observed a resolution which was before the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	in
1865	DATE	, in the identical words , or nearly so , that are quoted above from the report of
1881	DATE	, and that nothing came of it but talk .

		Mr.
George H. PendletOn	PERSON	, then in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, was the real author of the measure , as he was no doubt of the later one .

		General
Garfield	PERSON	, who was always deeply interested in whatever prom - ised to improve government , then serving his first term in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, supported it in an able speech that may be found in the first volume of his published works .

		This was his peroration : '' I hope , Mr.
Speaker	PERSON	, that this measure will be fairly considered .

		If it do not pass now , the day will 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, come , I believe , when it will pass .

		When that day comes , I expect to see a higher type of American States - manship , not only in the cabinet , but also in the legisla - tive hall . ''

		Unhappily , we see no sign of progress since that day , and the realization of the prophecy seems as far off as ever .

		REALISM ix FRENCH HISTORY .

		* '' To note the varying forms of government , to trace the ancient origin of modern laws and customs , to mark the encroachment of absolutism on popular rights , to describe the long-continued struggle of the many to throw off the yoke of the few , to emphasize the cor - rupting influences of the union between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, to illustrate once more the blighting effects of superstition , ignorance , blind obedience , unjust laws , confiscation under the disguise of unequal taxes , and the systematic plunder , year by year , of the weaker classes by the stronger , have been the motives which led to the enormous labor involved in this book . ''

		Thus forcibly stated is the comprehensive proposition of which Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' Story of
France	LOCATION	'' is the demonstration .

		He explicitly disclaims any attempt to fill in details in his study of the development of a great people , and protests that nothing less than a great pur - pose would have led him to undertake the pro- duction of these two large volumes .

		This purpose , then , is the raison d'etre of the work ; it looks out on every page , it is apparent be - tween the lines , it colors the facts and makes an untrue perspective ; and the question ever recurs , Does the end justify the means ?

		If , however , we accept this proposition and make allowance for the purpose , we have only applause for the consistent attitude and fear - less honesty of the author .

		His aggressive truth-telling makes French history superla - tively realistic , and his fertile mind , keen wit , and dramatic power combine to make a story of absorbing interest .

		He is no technical his - torian whose qualifications invariably include scholarly research , accuracy , and discriminat - ing judgment .

		He is , rather , the philosopher , who , after wide reading and assimilation , has been inspired to present in entertaining form the historical discoveries of others .

		In other words , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	is the popular historian in vogue to-day .

		The historian of a half-century ago was the man whose work showed care , symmetry , grace of style , fluency , and finish .

		necessary , to be sure ; but the manner was of greater importance than the matter , and errors of characterization , if there were such , were uniformly in favor of the personage depicted .

		To-day we seem to see a reaction , and the dan - ger of an extreme in the other direction seems imminent .

		If , as has been stated , we had '' by a slow process of evolution well-nigh discarded from the lives of our greatest men of the past all human faults and feelings ; have enclosed their greatness in glass of the clearest crystal and hung up a sign ' Do not touch , ' '' we are on the verge of another extreme wherein a com - mendable ambition to '' humanize '' runs riot and renders inhuman .

		It is apparently true that the public has outlived the days of myth - ology and is tired of hero-worship .

		Nothing is so relished as the '' True Story , '' wherein the traditional bundle of valor and virtue is invested with real flesh and blood and painted with true , if less vivid , colors .

		It is a refresh - ing performance , and when the task is under - taken with sympathy and enthusiasm , and the attributes of the writer include fluency and a well-balanced use of dramatic effect , he is then able to count upon the support of that uncer - tain quantity the reading public .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	has succeeded admirably in meeting the demands of this exacting critic .

		The sympathy and enthusiasm are not wanting , his creatures are men , not mere historical fig - ures , the style is dramatic and the interest sus - tained .

		But having got the ear of the public , is it fair to impose upon the credulity of his audience ?

		Is there any justifiable excuse for working upon the feelings of the reader with the weapons of the emotional evangelist ?

		Will not the effort to paint dark days blacker to ignore the rays of light and truth which have never been quite obscured react in a way to bring discredit upon the narrative ?

		If this tendency develops , shall we not ex - pect a protest against extravagant realism in history ?

		Let us examine , by way of illustration , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's portrait of Frederick II .

		of
Prussia	LOCATION	. ''

		Frederick the Great is one of the ' great men ' of history .

		Like most members of that order , he was unscrupulous , ungrateful , cruel , and treacherous .

		He played politics with a callous double-facedness that was Machiavellian in its perfect art .

		He could lie like Queen

		THE DIAL 117 achievements , by a writer who goes out of his way to accord credit to a king so universally condemned as Philip II .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's cordial condemnation of affairs existing under our own flag finds expression in an interpolated paragraph on Taxation , which , with its prophecy between the lines , we quote . ''

		Taxation , after all , is confiscation .

		When the gov - ernment takes no more than its just dues , the evil is a necessary one , for the government must live at the public expense ... More than it needs is tyranny .

		... Exceptions are made of those ablest to pay ... Now let the wrong go one step further .

		Let the privi - leged be salaried , pensioned , and sinecured out of the tribute wrung from the unprivileged , and we have a government which will become as rotten , as cruel , as vicious , and as intolerable as any that ever existed in the days of paganism .

		`` This was precisely what Bourbon was driving at , precisely what Richelieu achieved , precisely what
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		enjoyed , precisely what went to pieces under
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, and precisely what now exists in all
Chris	PERSON	- tian lands . ''

		Is this history , or has history simply furnished an excuse for a political stump-speech or a text for a campaign argument ?

		That Mr.
Watson	PERSON	was not unprepared for criticism because of these frequent digressions , is apparent ; for he discusses the province of the historian , and defends his '' right to meddle with politics . '' ''

		Is it not , then , the legitimate right of the historian to deal with laws as well as battles ?

		With robberies by statute as well as robberies by riot ?

		Must he write of the crimes of the sword and never speak of the crimes of the pen ? ''

		But whether in sympathy or at variance with this purposeful historian , we read on .

		The force and sincerity of the writer are unmistakable , and the tale is fascinating .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's first essay in history has succeeded , without doubt , in stimulating interest in his subject ; and herein must lie one of the chief merits of a book , where the facts of history are too often sacrificed to striking epigram and entertain - ment .

		There are scores of statements in these absorbing pages which can not be corroborated ; and more numerous than these are the distor - tions of fact , or the failure to give all the facts , which make it impossible to designate the work as history in an authoritative sense .

		There are so many examples which illustrate one or the other of these faults , that it is diffi - cult to choose .

		However , the revolting account of life under the
Ancien Regime	ORGANIZATION	, in the second volume , is a conspicuous illustration .

		Should we accept it in its entirety , we must believe in the unspeakable degradation of French Royalty and nobility universal and without excep - tion ; we must count virtue and decency un - known except among shopkeepers .

		Indeed , even from a champion of the people , is not the argument against classes weakened by whole - sale denunciations ?

		Thus we have the partisan , the prophet , the reformer .

		Yet , whatever the role , the promise in the preface has been faithfully kept , and these two readable volumes bear conspicuous evidence of sincerity and ability .

		M. S. B. A. CLASSICAL HISTORY , FESTIVALS , AND IjEGENDS .

		* The study of all matters pertaining to the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	has of late years taken on something of a new phase .

		In the place of the universal vilification of a generation ago , stu - dents of to-day accord to Roman life some - thing like a just measure of credit .

		In the same proportion as the study of the first few centuries of the Empire has not been carried on from the point of view of Christian apologetics , have we come to see the extraordinary mod - ern quality of the life then lived .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	, in '' Roman Life under the Caesars , '' has given a somewhat general treatment of this subject from the new point of view .

		He is well grounded in his literature , and has very properly made use of archaeology as furnishing materials for reconstructing the life of the time .

		Especially does this appear in his study of the Roman home life and the barbarians .

		The subjects handled are somewhat miscellaneous , and the student of
Friedlander	PERSON	will find few things new , but the work makes a capital hand - book of its subject .

		Another phase of the present interest in classical history is to be seen in the study of numismatics , a branch of archaeology that has to-day some better use than to amuse amateur collectors .

Feb. 16	DATE	, Museum , is something more than a mere de - scription of different coins , and for that reason is exactly the work that has been wanted .

		It will be difficult to find a better presentation of such matters as the manufacture of the coin , and the process of dating coins , than is given in this handbook .

		Occasionally , however , one might be inclined to differ with his judgment as to the authenticity of issues : as , for example , in the case of those issued in the year three of
Judaea	LOCATION	, which have been commonly assigned to Simon the
Maccabee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	refers this to the period of the great revolt under Nero , but gives no reason for his decision .

		The volume contains a series of valuable appendices , not the least important of which is a select bibliog - raphy .

		In addition it has fifteen collotype plates , which are as beautiful representations of the coins as one is likely to see .

		Equal commendation can be given the work upon Roman Festivals , by
W. Warde Fowler	PERSON	.

		The plan of the book is perhaps somewhat arbitrary , as it follows the calendar in its de - scription of the festivals .

		This , of course , has a certain encyclopaedic advantage , but at the same time does not give the assistance which comes from a classification of festivals on the basis of their intention .

		In this connection , however , it should be stated that the author is not as greatly interested as are men like Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	in the origin and deep-seated intention of the festivals , but is more concerned in de - scribing the customs as they actually existed .

		Within these limits , the book is most admira - bly constructed , and forms an exceedingly val - uable addition , not only to our knowledge of Roman life , but also to our knowledge of Roman religion ; for notwithstanding the praiseworthy absence of speculation on the part of the author as to the question whether the Roman festivals preserved primitive customs , no one can read the mass of material brought together so care - fully without feeling the force of the claim that religious festivals are largely the conventional - ized customs of primitive people preserved as forms of worship long after their original inten - tion has been forgotten .

		It is somewhat startling , however , to find this thesis carried out so rigorously by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	within the somewhat narrow limits of the Homeric Hymns .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is very sure that the Hymns are fragments of a school which had a great master and great tra - ditions .

		This , of course , is not especially sen - sational , but he also seeks '' the origins of Apollo , and of the renowned Eleusinian Mys - teries , in the tales and rites of the Bora and the
Nanga	LOCATION	; in the beliefs and practices of the Pawnees and Larrakeah ,
Yao	PERSON	, and the Khond . ''

		This purpose Mr.
Lang	PERSON	elaborates in his strik - ing conclusion , all of which would well bear quotation , but perhaps the following sentences most of all : `` The confusions of sacred and profane ; the origins of the Mysteries ; the beginnings of the Gods in a mental condition long left behind by
Greece	LOCATION	when the Hymns were composed ; all these matters need elucidation .

		I have tried to elucidate them as results of evolution from the remote prehistoric past of
Greece	LOCATION	, which , as it seems , must in many points have been identical with the historic present of the lowest contemporary races .

		In the same way , if dealing with ornament , I would derive the spirals , volutes , and concentric circles of Mycenaean gold-work , from the identical motives , on the oldest incised rocks and kists of our Islands , of North and
South America	LOCATION	, and of the tribes of
Central Australia	LOCATION	, recently described by Messrs.
Spencer	PERSON	and
Gillen	PERSON	, and Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	. '' ''

		Greek religion , Greek myth , are vast conglomerates .

		We find a savage origin for Apollo , and savage origins for many of the Mysteries .

		But the cruelty of savage initiations has been purified away .

		On the other hand , we find a barbaric origin for departmental gods , such as Aphrodite , and for Greek human sacrifices , unknown to the lowest savagery .

		From savagery Zeus is probably derived ; from savagery come the germs of divine amours in animal forms .

		But from barbarism arises the sympathetic magic of agriculture , which the lowest races do not practise .

		From the barbaric condition , not from savagery , comes Greek hero worship , for the low - est races do not worship ancestral spirits . ''

		It goes without saying that the translation of the Hymns is done into excellent English ^ perhaps just a trifle over-classic .

		It is a far cry from this work of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's to mediaeval legends as to
Virgil	PERSON	.

		To most readers of Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's collection of the '' Un - published Legends of Virgil , '' one may suppose , it will come as a surprise to know that the friend of their school days , like so many wor - thies , was transformed by mediaeval popular imagination into a sorcerer , generally with hon - orable and kindly intentions , and that through - out
Italy	LOCATION	there are still in existence among the people stories of his extraordinary perform - ances .

		The probability is that they all
spring	DATE	from the Sixth Book of the u ^ Eneid , and are thus humble guarantees of the guide chosen by
Dante	ORGANIZATION	; but apart from that , is not Virgil the last man , unless it be
Horace	PERSON	, who would ex - pect to find himself made into a mediaeval demi - god ?

		The stories are translated from a large number of sources , and form as curious a tail - piece to classical study as they are serviceable to the student of folk-lore .

		THE DIAL 119 PROFESSOR
FISKE	PERSON	'S ESSAYS .

		* '' A Century of Science '' is the slightly misleading title , explained by the sub-line '' and Other Essays , '' of a little book which will be welcomed by many readers .

		While the Other Essays which , in fact , include addresses , biographies , and book reviews , as well as essays proper form much the larger portion of the book , the spirit of a century preeminently sci - entific runs through the whole and does much to justify the leading title .

		The initial essay of the volume is an excellent presentation of the principal results of the scientific work of the last hundred years stated in terms of philos - ophy .

		The extension of the knowledge of chemical and physical laws over the extra - terrestrial sphere , the development of uniform - itarianism in geology , of the doctrine of corre - lation of forces in physics , of natural selection in biology , and of the philosophy of evolution in all branches of research , are all well shown in proper relations .

		Where , however , one attempts so much in a single essay , mistakes of fact or emphasis are hardly to be avoided .

		In the present case , for example , while the pre-Darwinian evolutionists have been treated to a refreshing meed of justice , the pre-Lyellian geologists are more scantily served .

		Particu - larly are the earlier French geologists ignored ; and this is the more unexpected since Sir Archi - bald Geikie has so recently called fitting atten - tion to them .

		The chapters on the '' Scope and Purpose of Evolution '' and on '' The Part Played by Infancy in the Evolution of Man '' belong to - gether , and include a discussion of Mr.
Spen	PERSON	- cer 's views , which , in the light of the fund of personal anecdote brought in , we must con - sider as almost ex-cathedra .

		In '' Guessing at Half and Multiplying by Two , '' a much needed dressing-down is given to some would-be critics of science .

		In lighter vein is the essay on circle squarers , perpetual - motion inventors , and others of similar pursuits who are consid - ered under the caption '' Some Cranks and their Crotchets . ''

		The remaining miscellaneous essays include a discussion of the late lamented '' Arbitration Treaty , '' ''

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, subject to slight modifications by individual writers , may be said to have found a permanent place in the writings of present-day economists .

		But the appli - cation of this theory to the problems of Distribution has proceeded but slowly .

		Some valuable work in this direction has been done , it is true , especially by American economists .

		But the work so done is fragmentary , and is so scattered through the maga - zines that there is danger that its real value will not be recognized .

		It is the work of bringing together this scattered material , and of constructing out of it and the work of the Austrians a theory of Distribution consonant with modern conditions , that Dr.
Macfarlane	PERSON	has attempted in '' Value and Distribution . ''

		His work is , however , not entirely one of construction , as his criticism of other writers and modification of their views ultimately leads him to a presentation of a theory of his own .

		This theory of Distribution originates in his belief that neither the cost theory of Bicardo nor the marginal-utility theory of the Austrians serves as a complete explanation of the way in which price is determined .

		The former fails because it does not show that in the case of monopoly or scarcity of goods the producer obtains a surplus over costs ; the latter fails because it does not take account of consumers ' surplus .

		The au - thor 's contention is that the point at which price is fixed is more or less indeterminate , being some - where between the marginal utility of the good to the consumer and its marginal utility to the pro- ducer , the exact point depending on the relative monopoly strength of buyer and seller .

		This he terms the monopoly theory of price , true of all goods which are not freely reproducible .

		In dis - tributing the social product among the various factors of production , we may find , the author con - tends , three forms of surplus : We have rent , which is a differential surplus peculiar to all factors , and is due to actual differences in the productivity of different portions of land , capital , labor , or em - ployers .

		It does not enter into price , but is deter - mined by price .

		We have also a marginal or monopoly surplus , which is secured by all factors in case they are engaged in the production of com - modities which have a monopoly or scarcity value .

		This is the surplus over the marginal utility to the producer mentioned above in treating of price .

		Unlike the surplus rent , this is secured by all pro- ducers , those on the margin as well as those above it ; and , unlike rent , it does enter into price .

		The author would call this monopoly surplus profits ; but it would seem likely to cause confusion to use a word of common usage to denominate this unfa - miliar conception of monopoly earnings .

		The third form of surplus is the normal surplus secured only by the factors that are freely reproducible , capital and labor .

		The normal surplus in the ease of cap - ital is interest , in the case of labor it is gain .

		Both result from the fact that the supply of these factors is limited by the abstinence of the marginal saver or laborer , as the case may be , who sacrifices present enjoyment in order to continue producing for the future .

		Like the surplus profits , this normal sur - plus enters into price .

		From this brief statement of the theory it will he seen that confusion must inevi - tably result from the attempt to keep separate these three forms of surplus .

		Little seems to be gained by the effort to treat interest and gain as a surplus .

		The author himself admits that in a progressing society they become a part of costs .

		The writer 's criticism of recent theories is characterized by much acuteness , but the continuity of his own argument is broken by the unnecessarily long excursions into the history of theory , and by the numerous and lengthy quotations with which the pages of his book are filled .

		The present system of distribution finds a sharp criticism from the extreme socialistic standpoint in Rodbertus 's '' Overproduction and Crises , '' an ex - cellent English translation of which has been made by Miss
Julia Franklin	PERSON	.

		Rodbertus 's theory of crises is , in brief , as follows : In spite of an increas - ing productivity of labor , the wages of the laboring classes become an ever smaller portion of the na - tional product .

		Because of this fact , `` the pur - chasing power of four-fifths or five-sixths of society does not expand in proportion to the progressive pro- duction , but rather simultaneously contracts in like proportion , from which it would be just and easy to demonstrate the necessity of gluts . ''

		If every partici - pant in exchange retained the entire product of his labor , then no glut could arise from over-production of any one or of all commodities until more of them had been produced than were required by society .

		The purchasing power of society would then always remain commensurate with its productiveness .

		In a critical Introduction to this work , Professor
J. B. Clark	PERSON	points out that crises do not result either from over-production or from a wrong distribution , but from misdirected production ; i. .

		, employers have made speculative and inaccurate estimates of incomes that are to exist in the future .

		Even if
Rodbertus	ORGANIZATION	's theory of wages as a steadily declining share of product were true , it would not lead to a crisis . ''

		Whatever qualities producing employers may lack , they have the capacity to bring the kinds of goods that from year to year they make into a general conformity to any gradually changing de - mand . '' ''

		The Psychology of Socialism , '' by the author of '' The Psychology of Peoples '' and '' The Psy - chology of the Crowd , '' is an interesting and sug - gestive book .

		To suggest , however , is not to demonstrate ; and , unfortunately , the writer has accepted his suggestions as though they were al - ready beyond the pale of controversy , and has been at little pains to examine the premises on which he bases his conclusions or to carefully weigh the evi - dence with which he supports them .

		As a conse - quence , many of his statements are without foun - dation , and even such of his interpretations of phenomena and tendencies as seem reasonable need far more proof than has been offered before we can
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 accept them as final .

		They suggest an explanation , but do not warrant it .

		Socialism , the author thinks , is rapidly gaining converts , and gives promise of a speedy adoption by one of the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It owes its power , however , not to any inherent truthfulness of its theories , nor to the fact that it would bring to its adherents the results at which it aims .

		Socialism is essentially a belief , and one which is rapidly assuming a religious form .

		It ap - peals to the emotions rather than to the reason , and its success , like that of all religious beliefs , is en - tirely independent of the proportion of truth which it contains .

		Its present success is due to the fact that it has appeared at a period in the world 's his - tory when men have become skeptical concerning the old doctrines and distrustful of the promises held out by the old religions .

		Something must re - place the old doctrines , for '' humanity has not been able to exist without beliefs . ''

		Socialism fits the needs of the hour .

		It is not based on logic , and it does not equal the old beliefs in the grandeur of its ideals ; but it does constitute an ideal which , however low , '' possesses the merit of bestowing on man a hope which the gods no longer give . ''

		Ow - ing to the fact that it appeals to the imagination rather than to reason , socialism appeals to the Latin mind much more forcibly than to the people of Teutonic origin .

		M. Le Bon apparently regards it as inevitable that at least one among the Latin nations of
Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- present circumstances point to
Italy	LOCATION	-RRB- should make an experiment with socialism on a large scale .

		No latter-day prophet of Latin degen - eracy has been more unsparing in his denunciation of the Romanic peoples than is this French psy - chologist and sociologist in the several chapters which he devotes to this subject .

		The Latin peo - ples , he asserts , are '' characterized by feebleness of will , energy , and enterprise . ''

		Lacking the indi - vidual initiative of the Anglo-Saxons , they are con - stantly seeking to be guided and governed .

		Their past history , their present needs and lack of capac - ity , their system of education which teaches de - pendence and the need of external discipline , and their failure to modify the old concepts of religion without rejecting all belief , have '' doomed '' the Latin nations '' to suffer the
State	ORGANIZATION	socialism which the collectivists are preaching to-day . ''

		Had
M. Le Bon	ORGANIZATION	confined himself to the work for which he is fitted and for which his book professes to stand a psycholog - ical analysis of the social mind , with the purpose of discovering the grounds for the reception and rapid spread of socialistic doctrines his book would have been of more worth and would have inspired more confidence than it will in its present shape .

		His knowledge of economic phenomena is not pro- found , and he lacks the sympathy for the laboring classes which is necessary to a fair discussion of the social problems of to-day .

		His fondness for gen - eralizations and striking statements has led him into statements not only careless and crude , but such as are unwarranted by even the most superficial knowledge of the facts .

		Numerous examples might be quoted , but one must suffice an account of the
Chicago	LOCATION	strike of
1894	DATE	. ''

		It ended , '' says the author , '' in the strike of all the railway men in the
United States	LOCATION	, and had as its further results the burning of the palaces of the Exposition and the immense workshops of the Pullman Company .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	assumed the upper hand only by suspending civil rights , proclaiming martial law , and delivering veritable battle to the insurgents .

		The strikers were shot down without pity , and de - feated . '' ''

		The Profit of the Many '' is a strong appeal from a Christian socialist for unselfishness in the production , distribution , and use of wealth .

		The appeal is made on economic as well as on ethical grounds .

		Self-interest , says the author , is inade - quate as a motive to secure the largest production of wealth .

		Production will not attain its true pos - sibilities until every producer takes as his motto , '' I seek not mine own profit but the profit of the many . ''

		The greater part of the book is taken up with a review and analysis of the social teachings of the
Bible	LOCATION	, wherein the author finds support for his thesis .

		Much of this work is well done .

		The treatment of the Mosaic code is especially suggest - ive .

		There is always the danger , however , that students of modern social problems who use the
Bible	LOCATION	to illustrate social teachings will read into the Scriptures lessons which they were never in - tended to convey .

		This , our author seems at times to have done , as when he tries to teach the necessity of cooperation from the story of
Cain	PERSON	; equality of wealth from the account of the gathering of the manna ; and sees in
Christ	LOCATION	's statement , '' Seek first the kingdom , '' not its obvious meaning , seek right - eousness , but a command to adopt socialism .

		No one can for a moment doubt the beauty of the ideal contained in the principle , '' Seek the profit of the many , '' or can wish to withstand the effort to realize this ideal .

		But the author is wiser than his doc - trine when he says that '' only the universal preva - lence of such a spirit can make socialism practicable ; and with such a spirit , individualism would accom - plish all the ends of socialism . ''

		The fact that Christ addressed himself to the individual in pre - senting the claims of a Christian life , and did not seek to overthrow existing social institutions , shows that society does not , because it can not , enforce this ideal .

		The beauty of the principle lies in the very fact that it is to be voluntarily and cheerfully ac - cepted , not enforced .

		A timely and excellent monograph on an inter - esting subject is that of Dr.
Fred S. Hall	PERSON	, entitled '' Sympathetic Strikes and Sympathetic Lockouts . ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	defines a sympathetic strike as one in which '' workmen having no grievance of their own take action out of a belief that another body of workmen is not fairly treated , and so take up the cause . ''

		A sympathetic lockout , on the other hand , '' occurs when an employer discharges men against whom he has no grievance in order thus to enforce the settlement of some other dispute . ''

		The author 122 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, reviews briefly the efforts of statisticians and others to give precise meaning to the terms '' strike '' and '' lockout , '' and decides that no absolute line of dif - ference can be drawn .

		What the employer calls a strike , the laborer terms a lockout .

		Each party to the controversy tries to throw the responsibility for initiating the disagreement on to the other 's shoul - ders .

		Our author concludes , therefore , that the attempt at distinction is both valueless and mis - chievous , and in scientific classifications should be dropped .

		But with what seems a strange inconsist - ency , the writer immediately insists that there is a clear distinction between a sympathetic strike and a sympathetic lockout .

		It would be interesting to know how he would make use of this distinction in a statistical table in which the distinction between strikes and lockouts had been abandoned .

		Is a sympathetic lockout a lockout and not a strike ?

		If so , what shall be done with lockouts that are not sympathetic ?

		If the o.nswer be that there are no such lockouts , may we not ask why then the quali - fying adjective '' sympathetic '' ?

		The sympathetic strike is a comparatively recent invention , intended to further the purpose of the original strike .

		Its de - velopment does not indicate a growth of sympathy among the working classes , but a better knowledge of their common interests .

		The sympathetic lockout was of much earlier development .

		It was intended to prevent laborers from contributing to the support of fellow-laborers during a strike .

		The necessity for it is thus as old as the habit of contributions , and this is as old as unionism itself .

		The sympathetic strike is a powerful weapon , but it is like a two-edged sword. : it cuts both ways , and requires intelligence for its effective use .

		The most powerful labor organi - zations do not make use of it .

		It has caused the downfall of the Knights of Labor and the
American Railway Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		It cuts off financial assistance to the original strikers by a cessation of earnings of the sympathizers , and this financial assistance is of supreme importance .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, accordingly , does not believe that the future holds much in store for the sympathetic strike , and thinks that it is likely to be displaced by the '' successive strike . ''

		The sympathetic lockout is even less likely to succeed .

		Prices rise , and competing firms who may have reached an agreement to assist each other find the temptation constantly growing stronger to break the agreement , either secretly or openly , in order to reap the advantage of high prices .

		The weakness of the sympathetic lockout thus constitutes a con - tinual and automatic check to its application .

		Another excellent monograph in the same series as the foregoing is that on the '' History and Func - tions of
Central Labor Unions	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
William Maxwell Burke	PERSON	.

		By Central labor unions is meant the general union which is caused by the federation of the trade unions of a given locality , usually a city , for the purpose of rendering mutual assistance as in case of strikes , or of cooperating to secure a desired end .

		The unions that make up the
Central	ORGANIZATION	union are not necessarily , or even generally , unions of allied trades .

		In this respect the
Central	ORGANIZATION	union differs from a national trade union , which is nearly always a federation of allied trade unions .

		The objects of the
Central	ORGANIZATION	union are -LRB- 1 -RRB- to aid and strengthen the organization of the local unions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to educate the laborers and the public '' along those lines in which they hope to accomplish ame - lioration in the conditions of labor or to effect cer - tain reforms '' ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- to protect the rights and to defend the interests of the laboring classes by offensive and defensive alliances of the workers of the district or municipality , especially those in the local unions .

		Although Central labor unions were not unknown in earlier years , the period of rapid development of this form of organization in this country has been since
1880	DATE	.

		Within this period they have grown both in numbers and in influence , and have done much to accomplish the above ob - jects , especially that of organization .

		In furthering the great object of all trade union organizations that of collective bargaining the
Central	ORGANIZATION	labor union has indirectly been of great assistance , espe - cially where , as in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, the union has a sal - aried agent to transact the business .

		The chief defect is the looseness of the organization , and the fact that the local unions can not be made to accept the decisions of the Central .

		Unless a radical change should take place in the organization of the Central unions , Dr.
Burke	PERSON	does not think that they will be able to directly undertake the function of collective bargaining .

		Plans for a reform of the existing wage system may be separated into three main classes .

		The first class is composed of those in which the em - ployer takes the initiative and which are carried out under his supervision .

		In the second class , the laborers combine into organizations , such as trade - unions , with the view of obtaining better terms from employers .

		In the third class , the
State	ORGANIZATION	takes the initiative and seeks to effect reforms through leg - islation .

		Such legislative measures range all the way from factory laws to the complete suppression of the wage system through socialism .

		It is prob - able that most economists and students of the labor question to-day expect the ultimate solution of the problem to be reached through one of the two last-named methods .

		But only the most rabid advo - cates of trade unionism or of socialism would deny the possibility of making substantial contributions toward the end of industrial peace through the first method proposed .

		It is further to be remembered that , as Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	, in his work entitled '' A Div - idend to Labor , '' says , while '' the distant future of industry may belong to cooperative production , or even to the socialistic stage , the present and the near future belong very plainly to capitalistic pro- duction on a large scale . ''

		In this system the employer-manager is an essential part , and his re - sponsibilities to his employees and his power of establishing friendly relations between capital and labor are not slight .

		Many employers have shown their interest in and sympathy for their workmen by
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 the adoption of profit-sharing , or by what Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	calls '' an indirect dividend to labor '' the establishment of certain institutions designed to promote the welfare of their employees as a class .

		Some of these institutions , which include social clubs , hospitals , dispensaries , schools and libraries , restaurants and lodging houses , cooperative savings - banks , accident and old-age insurance , etc. , have frequently been described in newspapers and mag - azines , but Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	has rendered an important service by bringing together in one work the infor - mation concerning these institutions and the firms which have founded them .

		Not all the establish - ments maintaining these welfare institutions have been considered , but the most important ones in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	are described , and several chapters are devoted to a discussion of the principles on which such institu - tions should be founded and maintained .

		One point mentioned by the author needs to be noted , and that is the danger of paternalism in the management of such institutions .

		Especially in
America	LOCATION	is it de - sirable to leave to the workmen the chief part in the administration of such institutions .

		Many phil - anthropic measures have been wrecked through a dictatorial policy or a patronizing spirit on the part of the employer .

		In the concluding chapters of the book , Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	supplements his earlier work by some additional information concerning profit - sharing .

		The reader of economic literature who can afford to devote some time to the consideration of panaceas for social disorders will find entertainment , if not instruction , in the perusal of Mr.
Alfred J. Ferris	PERSON	's book entitled '' Pauperizing the Rich . ''

		Like most social reformers , Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	finds the cause of pov - erty and distress to be the inequality in the distri - bution of wealth ; but , unlike many reformers , he does not propose , in order to bring about a better distribution , to reconstruct the present system of production or to abolish in its entirety the competi - tive system of distribution .

		The enormous produc - tion of wealth which has characterized the nineteenth century the author attributes to the great discov - eries and inventions and the improvements in the processes of industry which have been made since
1770	DATE	.

		These inventions have usually been patented by their inventors , and royalties charged for their use under governmental protection for a series of years , at the end of which period they have been thrown open to the public .

		It is the latter part of this plan to which Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	objects .

		He admits that at the expiration of the patent period the ben - efit of the invention goes to the consumer ; but he is not satisfied with this .

		He apparently regards the consumer as , in some sort , an enemy of society , and thinks that in reaping the benefits of improved production the consumer is receiving an advantage which he has not earned .

		He would have the na - tional government assume the ownership of these expired patents , copyrights , etc. , in perpetuity and would furthermore have the government assume control over all improvements that have been made in industry since
1770	DATE	.

		The government should collect the royalties on the same principle that would be followed by an individual , and should then divide the proceeds equally among the people of the coun - try .

		The effect would be , he thinks , to raise prices about one hundred per cent ; but each person would receive as his share of the '' Property in Ideas '' an income , estimated by our author at one hundred and sixty dollars . ''

		Rated in purchasing power , as compared with the present , therefore , each man 's income would be equal to one half of his present income plus one-half of the average income . ''

		This plan , he thinks , by guaranteeing everyone some sort of a living , would abolish poverty , do away with much of the present social inequality , abate sinful extravagance and remove the temptation to display , prevent crises , raise wages and guarantee employ - ment to labor , prevent friction between employer and employed , check intemperance , gambling , and the social evil .

		It would even do much toward reforming the criminal and curing the defective classes .

		There is always some danger of doing injustice to a writer by thus epitomizing his theories , and , of course , we have not attempted to describe the ways in which Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	's plan is to bring about these desired results .

		Still , we think that this brief statement of method and results exag - gerates in no way the absurdity of the book .

		It is use - less to criticize the theory , or to try to show what effects such a measure proposed would have on the social and economic habits of the people .

		Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	is not unaware of the objections which would be raised to his measure , but he puts them lightly aside as mere trifles the obstacles certain to be thrown in the path of any reformer .

		A careful study of the principles of taxation and an investiga - tion as to the results of our pifesent pension system would richly reward him .

		The State influences distribution in many ways that do not savor in the least of Socialism .

		Per - haps the most important of these ways is through its taxing power .

		How it may use this power to enrich individuals at the same time that it dimin - ishes the resources of others , is well shown by Dr.
Urdahl	PERSON	's monograph on '' The Fee System of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This is a carefully-prepared work whose value is accentuated by the fact that this subject has hitherto received scant attention in the American treatises on public finance .

		The scope of the monograph is somewhat wider than its title implies , since it treats not only of the fee system in this country but gives an historical review of the fee systems of
Europe	LOCATION	, both ancient and modern , and has a chapter on the theory of fees in general .

		The author quite rightly defends fees on the prin - ciple of benefits or service performed by the
State	ORGANIZATION	, thus distinguishing them from taxes which are levied in proportion to the ability of the tax-payer .

		He follows
Neumann	PERSON	,
Seligman	PERSON	, and
Rosewater	ORGANIZATION	, in separating fees from special assessments ; a distinc - tion which , in the opinion of this reviewer , none of 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, these writers has succeeded in justifying .

		Special assessments seem to be only an important class of fees .

		Among the most important abuses which the author finds connected with the fee system to-day is its employment in police and other minor courts as a means of payment of judicial officers and others .

		The tramp problem is aggravated by the encourage - ment which the fees give to the judges and jailers to confine these men in the jails , and direct encour - agement is often given to tramps to return .

		So with petty criminals .

		Payments according to the number of arrests or commitments swell the num - ber of persons convicted in the police courts .

		This is shown whenever a change is made from fee pay - ments to salaried court officials .

		The existence of court money paid to the wife who has made appli - cation for a divorce in order that she may hire an attorney , the author thinks , encourages divorce proceedings .

		Finally , the existence of offices which yield to their holders immense sums in fees is a standing premium to political corruption .

		The replacement of fee-paid public officers by salaried officials would do much to remove the political corruption connected with purely administrative offices .

		Miss
Helen Marot	PERSON	has compiled a bibliography of writings on the labor problem which will be of assistance to the readers of the literature on that subject .

		The execution of the work , however , is not entirely satisfactory .

		The titles of books are not always correctly given .

		The periodical litera - ture is not included , on the ground that it is to be found in ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index '' and the '' Review of Reviews , '' while the compiler has included a mass of literature which , like '' Monopolies '' and the '' Land Question , '' have no reference to the labor problem .

		The classification is peculiar in some respects , and we fine'Vsuch headings as '' Utopias '' and '' How the Other Half Lives . ''

		One of the best features of the book is the list of the labor period - icals and labor songs .

		It would have been interest - ing to have included a list of the important works of fiction and the poems dealing with labor questions .


M. B. HAMMOND	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		England in
England	LOCATION	, in the day of her military the day saj her decadence and humiliation , may de - tupremacy .

		r j ye & me i ancno iy satisfaction from the contemplation of the deeds by land and sea of the sturdier sons of her heroic past .

		In his '' How England Saved Europe '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Dr.
W. H. Fitchett	PERSON	undertakes to tell , in two moderate-sized volumes written from the British point of view , the story of the long struggle against
Bonaparte	PERSON	-LRB-
1793	DATE	-
1815	DATE	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Fitchett	PERSON	's picturesque and animated style , and his unfailing sense of the logical and dramatic unity of events , make his book an unus - ually entertaining and impressive piece of military history .

		He regards the Napoleonic war as essen - tially a contest in which , through the instrumental - ity of
England	LOCATION	, the modern world was delivered from the thrall of a despotism of the later Roman type ; and in his opening chapter he forestalls the catastrophe of the great drama he is about to unfold , by showing us the fallen
Caesar	PERSON	, a volubly complain - ing prisoner in the cabin of the '' Bellerophon , '' sunk so low as to crave the favor of British citizenship from his captors . ''

		Who , '' exclaims the author , '' shall assess the value of these memories to the new and vaster
England	LOCATION	of to-day ? ''

		The value of these memories has , we are inclined to think , been in some regards doubtful .

		Have they not contributed to breed in Englishmen that arrogance that has caused the world to-day to jeer at them in their hour of humiliation , that blind self-confidence that has resulted in the rout of their gorgeous Bond Street generals by the unkempt farmer - strategists of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	?

		Perhaps , instead of persistently pluming herself on the '' splendid memories '' of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	and
Waterloo	LOCATION	, it would be better for En - gland to reflect that it is for what she is to-day , not for what she was a hundred years ago , that the world is going to rate her .

		What her army is to-day is manifest ; if it can not stand before the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	what showing could it make in a contest with a first-class power ?

		Her navy , in respect of ships and arma - ment , is powerful ; but what , at present , must be the natural inference as to its personnel ?

		There is great reason to fear that that natural inference will govern the political enterprises of her rivals in a momentous way at no distant date .

		But nevertheless , as we have already said , Englishmen may derive a melancholy satisfaction from the con - templation of the deeds of their forefathers ; and they should find Dr.
Fitchett	PERSON	's book much to their liking .

		He has not attempted to deal with En - gland 's political history during the period covered , nor are the continental wars of Napoleon touched upon , save incidentally .

		What is undertaken is '' a living and realistic account of the greatest war En - gland ever waged . ''

		The opening volume is mainly a record of naval actions , with , incidentally , an ac - count of the surprisingly disaffected and even mu - tinous spirit prevalent in the navy at this period of great warlike achievements .

		Dr.
Fitchett	PERSON	is an effective painter of sea-fights .

		His style is one that wakes and feeds the imagination , and his forth - coming and concluding volume will be awaited with widespread interest .

		The work is attractively printed , and liberally supplied with portraits , plans , etc. .

		Mr.
Ooldwin Smith	PERSON	's lalett history .

		In the preface to his new two-volume work entitled '' The United
King	PERSON	- dom '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	writes : '' The friends who urged the writer to undertake this task know that it has been per - formed by the hand of extreme old age . ''

		If by this the author intends to disarm criticism or to
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 apologize for fancied shortcomings in the present labor , he has no occasion for it .

		As in his earlier writings , one finds in ''
The United Kingdom	LOCATION	'' the same clearness of insight and just appreciation of men and events , the same facility of expression , the same methodic grace , and , above all , the same mas - terly ability in so arranging and classifying material as to leave an ineffaceable impression of each historic period .

		The work is , in fact , more free from the faults and more replete with the beauties of the author 's accustomed style than is usual to the labors of old age .

		If it was ever true , as a reviewer said of him a few years ago , that '' with age he seems to have grown fond of crossing the ideas of all other men on all subjects and of arguing the worst result from any given present condition of affairs , '' the tendency has not developed , and old age has mellowed rather than heightened the historian 's ag - gressiveness .

		The reverse of this is rather a most noticeable characteristic .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was once prone to berate the Irish race , to deny their fitness under any conditions for self-government , to prophesy naught but evil of all projects for political inde - pendence , and to insist upon the necessity for strong coercive measures if
Ireland	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	were to live in harmony .

		But in turning from the role of pamphleteer to that of historian , the just historical attitude has been adopted , and differences of location , race , and religion , together with certain unfortunate incidents in the history of the two peoples , are made responsible for the failure of peaceful union between
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		No word is spoken of the future ; for prophecy , the author insists , is not the work of the historian .

		To be sure , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	does not renounce previous views ; but greater deference to contrary beliefs , as well as greater kindliness in general , characterize his statements .

		Again one is reminded of an earlier work in which Mr.
Smith	PERSON	held up the empire to ridicule as a discordant whole , emphasizing its lack of unity and expounding upon the bitter hostility shown by the races subject to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Even
Canada	LOCATION	was depicted as per - meated with factional strife and little likely to be a source of strength to the mother country in time of danger .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's '' Empire '' of to-day is a marvellous achievement , and its organizers are men of genius .

		Due credit is accorded British phil - anthropy for its treatment of subject states , and
England	LOCATION	's services as a world-civilizing force are justly estimated .

		Yet the shadows are there also , and are portrayed with a keen but friendly criti - cism .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has , in a word , abandoned the argumentative method in writing this history , and chosen to become the scholarly critic of historic events .

		He no longer belittles or magnifies some fact in support of his premises ; and as historical accuracy combined with brilliant execution are of more permanent value than mere brilliance in po - lemics , it is certain that the present volumes will bring more lasting fame to their author than any of his earlier writings .

		The work practically closes with the year
1840	DATE	.

		As a record of stirring adventure , i * k Sir
Stephen St. John	PERSON	's `` Rajah Brooke '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is delightfully entertaining , while as an account of pioneer en - deavor in private enterprise among
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	peoples , it depicts in a clear light conditions of government and custom hard to realize by the Western world .

		After a brief career in
India	LOCATION	, Sir
James Brooke	PERSON	, upon falling heir to a small fortune , determined in 183 $ to fit out a ship for the exploration of the then un - known peoples of the islands of the eastern
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The expedition ended in a remarkable manner , for
Brooke	PERSON	in the course of a year or so found him - self ruler , under the title of
Rajah	ORGANIZATION	, of a small ter - ritory called
Sarawak	LOCATION	, on the northwest coast of
Borneo	LOCATION	.

		His title was earned by judicious services rendered to the native Sultan , while the allegiance of his subjects ,
Malay	LOCATION	,
Dyak	ORGANIZATION	, and Chinese , was secured by the unfailing courage and ability with which he defended them against numerous pirate tribes .

		His kingdom of
Sarawak	LOCATION	, now largely increased in ter - ritory and population , still exists under the rule of his nephew , Sir
Charles Brooke	PERSON	, and furnishes the unique spectacle of an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	state ruled by an Englishman .

		In a strict sense
Brooke	PERSON	was not a '' Builder of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	, '' for his kingdom has never passed under the dominion of
England	LOCATION	, though at one time a '' protectorate '' was immi - nent ; but as an example of that adventurous spirit which has played so important a part in the exten - sion of
England	LOCATION	's empire ,
Brooke	PERSON	's name is illus - trious .

		The very fact that his enterprise was indi - vidual rather than the result of governmental action lends an added interest to the story of his successes .

		The story itself is well told , and with an intimate familiarity with the events related , for the author was himself an official of the
Sarawak	LOCATION	government in its earlier history , and always a per - sonal friend of Brooke .

		Possibly this friendship blinds him to some of the shortcomings of his hero , as in the case of the heated controversy with Cob - den and Bright , but in general the treatment , while sympathetic , is eminently fair .

		The main interest of the work is , however , in the narrative of
Brooke	PERSON	's achievements .

		The concluding chapters furnish an account of
Sarawak	LOCATION	, and of British
North Borneo	LOCATION	, at the present day .

		An historical ^ contribution of more than ordinary Encyclopedia interest to the annals of American oflihnoM .

		commonwealths is the '' Historical Encyclopaedia of Illinois '' -LRB- The
Munsell Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- , edited by Messrs.
Newton Bateman	PERSON	and
Paul Selby	PERSON	, themselves a part of the things they set forth .

		The death of Dr.
Bateman	PERSON	, during the early stages of the work , left the lion 's share of it to be performed by Mr.
Selby	PERSON	, a veteran journalist and citizen of
Illinois	LOCATION	, and familiar with its leading events and men for more than half a century .

		In one aspect the work is a biographical dictionary containing the names of
1200	DATE	persons whose lives are largely identified with that of the state ; in an - 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, other , it is a gazetteer , the counties of the state and all settlements with more than five hundred inhab - itants being treated ; in a third , and most important , it contains historical material of value to all students of human affairs , whether in the history of legisla - tion , the growth of institutions , the part borne by the people in the various wars of the nation , the economical development of railroads and canals , the geological and other scientific characteristics of the state , or in the ideas for which
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	is known to stand in legislation and political precedent .

		Espe - cially to be noted is the extended essay on the '' Underground Railroads '' which carried so many thousands of slaves from the neighboring states of
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Missouri	LOCATION	to safety across the great lakes into
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Remarkable Inundations , '' '' Natural Scenery , '' '' Northern Boundary Ques - tion , '' '' Camp Douglas Conspiracy , '' and ''
Naviga	PERSON	- ble Streams '' are all interesting and important entries .

		Where there is so much to commend there are , almost of necessity , some omissions to be noticed .

		While the investigator can find '' Minority Legisla - tion , '' '' Australian Ballot , '' and '' Torrens Land Law , '' he looks in vain for '' Factories Act , '' `` Arbi - tration Board , '' '' Prison Reform , '' '' Union Labor , '' '' Strikes and Lockouts '' -LRB- other than those in
1877	DATE	and
1894	DATE	-RRB- , '' Great Trials '' -LRB- as of the so-called anarchists and the murderers of Dr.
Cronin	PERSON	-RRB- , and many other matters of the first importance , as it would seem ; the treatment of others , as '' Labor Troubles , '' being wholly insufficient .

		It may be said generally of the political aspect of the book that it is unsympathetic so far as the democratic party is concerned , even to a total omission from its pages of all mention of the democratic plan of nominating
United States Senators in State	ORGANIZATION	conven - tions , a matter held in favor by thoughtful persons everywhere ; while the almost infinite obligations of the people of
Illinois	LOCATION	to its one democratic governor for placing it among the most progressive of English - speaking commonwealths in respect of scientific leg - islation find neither expression in the book nor justi - fication from its contents .

		With these limitations , the work is deserving of much praise , and has an historical value beyond that of any work in its field .

		The trump of
America	LOCATION	's naval fame is blown with no faltering or uncer - tain sound in Mr.
Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	's '' History of American Privateers '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- .

		The volume is published in uniform style with the author 's valuable '' History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' now the standard text-book on the subject , to which it forms a needed supplement .

		The story of American privateering is a stirring and romantic one , and Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	tells it with due verve and patriotic fire without , however , allow - ing his patriotism to sink into mere buncombe .

		The book denotes a considerable degree of inde - pendent research , and that its theme is by no means relatively unimportant is sufficiently shown by the fact that the value of prizes and cargoes taken by History of American privateers .

		privateers in the Revolution was three times that of the prizes and cargoes taken by regular naval vessels , while in the War of
1812	DATE	we had 517 pri - vateers and only 23 vessels in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was undoubtedly mainly the losses inflicted by our ships on
Great Britain	LOCATION	's commerce at sea that con - tributed most to bringing our wars with
England	LOCATION	to a close favorable to us .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	points out that in all the memorials presented to Parliament the arguments used to bring about peace with Amer - ica were based on the ruinous destruction of British commerce , the increased rates of insurance , the diversion of cargoes to foreign bottoms , etc. , due to the sleepless activity of our privateers .

		It is to be remembered , too , that these vessels fitted out by private enterprise were the training school , to a great extent , of our navy .

		Most of the naval heroes of that day such men as
Truxton	LOCATION	,
Porter	PERSON	,
Biddle	PERSON	,
Barney	ORGANIZATION	,
Decatur	LOCATION	,
Perry	PERSON	,
Rodgers	PERSON	,
Hopkins	PERSON	served their fighting apprenticeship as privateersmen .

		Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- lay 's spirited and sufficiently thorough book fills a gap in American naval history , and should find a place on the student 's shelves beside its popular prede - cessor .

		The plans and illustrations are satisfactory .

		Life without ^ n a ^ human likelihood , the incre - ennut among dulity with which '' The Adventures Australians .

		Q f
Lou	PERSON	j g de R ougemO nt , as Told by Himself '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- have been generally received , is due to nothing so much as the straining of the autobiographer to prove his case .

		When every - thing that can bear out the adventurer 's account of his stay for half a lifetime in the Australian wilds is printed in italics and small capitals , the reader 's mind goes back to Pooh-Bah 's '' merely corroborative detail , intended to give artistic veri - similitude to a bald and unconvincing narrative . ''

		Mr.
William G. Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	writes a preface for the book , in which he says : `` There are many men in
England	LOCATION	who know
Australia	LOCATION	.

		Most of these wanted to get at
de Rougemont	ORGANIZATION	in order to over - whelm him ; many had the opportunity , and were soon converted into devoted adherents . ''

		The name of a single authority of all these would have been better than the typographical hysterics ; or , failing this , Mr.
Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	's mere statement .

		For the adventures , wonderful as they are , and wholly out of the beaten track of exploration and adventure , are still in no degree improbable , if the difference in point of view between the Frenchman and the ordinary Englishman are taken into account .

		M. de Rougemont is somewhat more effusive on paper than most persons speaking English would be ; but it can hardly be said that he regards his own per - formances more highly than Mr.
Theodore Roose	PERSON	- velt and several of the newspaper correspondents regarded theirs during the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, as ap - pears from their published writings .

		Without ref - erence to the question of veracity , it is safe to say that life among the Australian natives as here de - scribed , if not wholly desirable , is yet fairly free from ennui .

		THE DIAL 127 The life of that delightful lying auto - .

		biographer , assassin , and matchless craftsman ,
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	, is in - telligently sketched in a suitably illustrated volume of 154 pages by the anonymous author of ''
Falk	PERSON	- lands , '' etc. .

		The little book may be read through in an
evening	TIME	-LRB- as it probably will be , when once begun , as we gladly testify -RRB- ; and as
Benvenuto	PERSON	sustained his own life with his chisel , took the lives of several others with his poignard , and provided entertainment for future lives with his pen , its author has entitled it '' Chisel , Pen , and Poignard '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The authorities seem to have been carefully examined and collated ; and the book may be read to advantage as a preparative for Benve - auto 's romantic but indispensable chef-d'oeuvre .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The collection of `` Songs of All Lands '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which Mr.
W. S. B. Mathews	PERSON	has edited for school and home use , is a work that meets with our most cordial approval .

		It includes the national songs - or hymns of many nations , an interesting selection of folk-melodies , a number of worthy old-time favorites that we fear the younger generation is in danger of not learning , and a few part-songs and glees .

		The selec - tion is altogether admirable , and the reconstruction of some of the newer material by Mrs.
Jessie L. Gay	PERSON	- nor is a feature that deserves special mention .

		Most of the selections are arranged in plain four-part har - mony , and in a few cases piano-forte accompaniment is provided .

		The two ''
Columbia University Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that have just been published carry on the series so solidly begun a few months ago with Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's monograph on the literary criticism of the Renaissance .

		Both are doctoral dissertations , and one of them , Mr.
F. W. Chandler	PERSON	's `` Romances of Roguery , '' is but half completed , for the volume on '' The Picaresque Novel in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' now at hand , is to be followed by a second volume exhibiting the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean influence of that literary form .

		Our other mon - ograph is Mr.
John G. Underbill	PERSON	's `` Spanish Liter - ature in the
England	LOCATION	of the Tudors . ''

		Both works are so well done that we may most heartily congratu - late Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	upon his department of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, since that is the source of this scholarly series .

		The `` Journal '' of the
National Educational Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion for the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	Meeting of
1899	DATE	has just been issued from the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of
1258	DATE	pages , and its contents make it a ver - itable encyclopaedia of current educational discussion .

		The noticeable features are the three special reports of the committees on public libraries , normal schools , and college-entrance requirements .

		These should be read by every teacher , for they are among the fundamental documents of the modern educational movement .

		From the hundreds of lesser contributions to the volume , it would be invidious to select for special mention .

		It must suffice to say that no department is neglected , and that much matter of weight is to be found among these minor features of the work .

		The latter includes a fine series of eighty full-page plates , illustrative of recent Foraminifera , as described in a monograph by Mr.

		The Russian Journal of Financial Statistics '' for
1900	DATE	is an octavo volume of over two hundred pages , written in excellent English , and likely to be of great value for reference purposes by economists and stndeuts of finance .

		It is an official publication of the Russian government prepared for free distribution to librarians , editors , and others interested in the subject .

		The edition of White 's '' Natural History of Sel - borne , '' which Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	has just published , is everything that the most exacting demand could specify .

		It is a handsome royal octavo of more than five hun - dred pages , with hundreds of illustrations .

		The late
Grant Allen	ORGANIZATION	edited this sumptuous volume shortly be - fore his death , and a more competent editor and anno - tator could not have been found . ''

		The Jew and Other Stories , '' by
Ivan Tourgue	PERSON	` nieff , forms the fifteenth , and , we understand , the final vol - ume in Mrs.

		SECONDARY ENGLISH TEXTS A Thoroughly Modern and Practical Text - Book in Composition and Rhetoric for Schools By
ROBERT HERRICK	PERSON	,
A.B.	LOCATION	, Assistant Professor of English in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	; and
LINDSAY TODD DAMON	PERSON	,
A.B.	LOCATION	, Instructor in English in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book embodies the most recently accepted method in English teaching in secondary schools .

		It has some distinctive features .

		INVENTIONAL WORK in shaping and arranging thought receives the first attention .

		The student is aided in discovering and developing his powers of expression both by the skilful directions of the book and by the work of theme-writing .

		The criticism of themes is at first suggestive , not repressive and dis - couraging .

		Genuine interest and self-confidence will follow this method of work , and the student will rap - idly mature the power of written expression .

		RHETORICAL THEORY as such is not presented until the second part of the book , where it is taken up systematically .

		The study of good use in words , of diction , and of the rhetorical laws of the sentence and the paragraph , is followed by a general review of lit - erary laws as applied to the whole composition .

		THE EXERCISES present many original and valuable features .

		They are suggestive , interesting , carefully chosen as to subject matter , and within the range of the average student 's experience and knowl - edge .

		ALREADY ADOPTED in the High Schools of 200 cities , of which 16 have a population of between 5,000 and 10,000 each .

		23 have a population of between 10,000 and 20,000 each .

		22 have a population of over 20,000 each .

		In addition , it is in use in 58 Preparatory Schools especially fitting for the larger Universities , and also in a large number of other Academies , Seminaries , Normal Schools , and Secondary Institutions .

		Cloth , 476 pages , with full Index and Synopsis for Review .

		Copies will be mailed on receipt of the price ,

		162 WHERE OUR SCHOOLS FAIL MOST .

		It will be remembered by those who take account of such things , that in the year 1893 a number of educational experts from different parts of
Europe	LOCATION	visited our country and studied our schools and school systems , often in school - houses and in superintendents ' offices , as well as in the educational exhibit made at
Chicago	LOCATION	; and that many of them , on their return home , published their observations and impressions , some in books and some in official reports , the whole mass forming a valuable body of informa - tion and criticism .

		Much of this material -LRB- especially when it took the form of official reports -RRB- Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, the Commissioner of Edu - cation , reproduced in a more or less abridged form in his Report for the year of the
Great Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the documents that he so treated was the Report of Dr.
E. Schlee	PERSON	,
Direc	PERSON	- tor of the Real Gymnasium at
Altona	LOCATION	, Ger - many , who had put his finger thus firmly upon the spot where , in his view , American schools fail most : '' If in every office the chief factor is the man , and in school the teachers , we have come to the weakest point in the American school system : professional teachers are wanting .

		That is to say , that most teachers are deficient in the requisite scientific and pedagogic pre - paration for their vocation .

		The greatest number are women , and comparatively few make a profession of teaching . ''

		According to the American way of looking at things , no importance is attached to the technical preparation for occupations and vocations or professions .

		Profes - sions are changed according to advantages or oppor - tunities .

		In annual reports we repeatedly meet with complaints of the fact that the teachers , men and women , have little or no normal or scientific education , and that they must be appointed without regard to the necessary knowledge and pedagogic preparation . ''

		Reviewing our facilities for providing quali - fied teachers for the elementary schools , Dr.
Schlee	PERSON	said : '' On account of frequent resignations , the yearly demand for teachers in
America	LOCATION	is astonishingly great ; one-third of the number needed annually can scarcely be met by the Normal schools . ''

		His account of secondary teachers is hardly more favorable . ''

		Teachers of high schools have , as a rule , graduated from high schools ; and for the most part have for a time attended a college , a university , or a normal school , before taking the teacher 's examination .

		Generally 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, speaking , however , the situation is about the same with them as it is with those of the lower schools . ''

		That Dr.
Schlee	PERSON	's view is the one commonly held by the most competent experts who visit us from abroad , and that it is also the view taken by our own most competent judges , is too well known to call for more than the slightest mention .

		How admirably the German specialist puts it ! ''

		If in every office the chief factor is the man , and in school the teachers , we have come to the weakest point in the American school system : professional teachers are wanting . ''

		This judgment involves two main points .

		One is the great lack of our teachers , as a body , in respect to academical and professional pre - paration ; and the other , the rapid and cease - less changes in the body itself .

		The two defects are more closely connected than some may think .

		Poor preparation leads assuredly to keeping the body in a state of ceaseless motion , while such motion is very unfavorable in itself to good preparation .

		The value of the good teacher is one of the lessons that mankind has been very slow to learn .

		From the days of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, we have a continuous stream of testimony bearing on this point .

		Again , the good teacher is not as highly appreciated in the
United States	LOCATION	as he is in the well-educated countries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It may seem a paradox , but it is the truth , to say that American teachers as a class , and the
Ameri	PERSON	- can people as a whole , earnest as both are , have never taken the teacher 's calling , as such , very seriously .

		The vast majority of teachers , in fact , do not look upon it as a calling at all , but only as an episode lying between school and a calling or as a prelude to the main action of life .

		It is often said that there are no highly civil - ized people in the world who place so low an estimate as we Americans do upon expert knowledge and skill of any kind .

		This is per - fectly true , although Dr.
Schlee	PERSON	indulges in some exaggeration in his putting of the case ; and it is impossible to tell how much we suffer in consequence .

		Causes that are perfectly famil - iar to students of such matters , have operated to produce in our country a type of character that is remarkably efficient and versatile , so much so , in fact , that it is hard for us to believe that we can not do anything we may undertake to do , no matter whether we have prepared our - selves to do it or know much about it or not .

		That great friend of our country ,
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, once spoke of this tendency as one of the serious defects in our character .

		That it stands in the way of our achieving the highest results in many lines of activity , is beyond all question .

		Once more there is reason to believe that we have a lower estimate of practical pedagogical ability than of any other highly specialized form of ability .

		Upon what other serious call - ing do we look so lightly ?

		Certainly not upon medicine , the bar , or the ministry .

		That teaching the formation of the bodies and minds , the manners and the morals , of children and youth is a refined and delicate art , call - ing for much skill and high excellence of char - acter , ought to be too plain to make serious argument on that point necessary .

		I do not for a moment forget three things that are essential to a just view of the subject : -LRB- 1 -RRB- , that many of our teachers do look upon the work as a calling , although the number is relatively small ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- , that the number of such teachers is increasing steadily , if not rapidly ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- , that many persons who have done a few years ' work at teaching , on their way to a calling , have rendered the public excellent services .

		Nevertheless , the fact can not be too much emphasized that the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will never become an educational state of the same rank as
Prussia	LOCATION	or
Saxony	LOCATION	until teaching as - sumes a position and a dignity among us that it has never yet known .

		One of the facts that give
Massachusetts	LOCATION	her preeminence as an educational state is the high standard of attainment that is required of teachers .

		In 1888-89 the teachers in her common schools who had attended a normal school were 33.3 per cent , of the total number , while the graduates of such schools were 26.6 per cent .

		In 1897-98 the corresponding per cents were 38.5 and 33.5 .

		That is , at the first date about a quarter of the teachers were nor - mal school graduates ; and at the other date , about a third .

		The Secretary of the
State Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Frank A. Hill	PERSON	, gave this account of the 61.5 per cent who had not attended a normal school : A few have prob - ably been appointed without reference to their preparation or fitness for the work ; some had had a little preliminary experience in local schools for the purpose ; some had begun to teach before normal school preparation had attracted the attention of school committees as an important prerequisite ; while some were College graduates .

		This is certainly an encour - aging showing , compared with the day when
Horace Mann	PERSON	said , in substance , that outside of the city of
Boston	LOCATION	there were not more than two hundred teachers who could be said to
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 follow teaching as a calling in that state .

		It is also encouraging in comparison with the showing that any other American state could make .

		But it is distinctly discouraging when considered in connection with
Prussia	LOCATION	or
Saxony	LOCATION	.

		Statistics that would fully reveal the exact state of things , the country over , are , unfor - tunately , not attainable .

		We know that a great army of teachers is employed , that this army is rapidly increasing in numbers , and that the average term of service is a short one .

		In 1897-98 this army counted 409,193 teachers , which was 5,860 more than the year before .

		Again , if ten per cent , of these teachers go out of the service every year -LRB- a very moderate estimate -RRB- , 41,000 new teachers are required to keep up the wastage .

		Putting the facts together , it is safe to say that the annual de - mand for common-school teachers at the present time is 50,000 .

		Where does the supply come from ?

		For the year 1897-98 the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	found 67,538 students in teachers ' training courses of all kinds , reaching from the high school to the university .

		He also found 11,255 graduates from normal schools be - tween a fifth and a fourth of the total number of the recruits required to keep the ranks full .

		This is a liberal view to take of the matter .

		President
Schurman	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, has calculated , from data furnished by the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, that in 1891-92 the total annual increase in the number of teachers em - ployed in the schools was less than two per cent , of the whole number , that nearly seventeen per cent , of the whole number were wholly inex - perienced , that the average length of service was between seven and eight years , and that only fifteen per cent , of the teachers in the schools of the country had passed through a normal school .

		While much has been said and written upon the two defects in our system that we are con - sidering the ill preparation of teachers when they enter the schools , and the frequent chan - ges within the body not much has been said , so far as I am aware , upon their relative mag - nitude or seriousness .

		How do they compare ?

		Probably most persons would lay emphasis , and perhaps heavy emphasis , upon ill preparation .

		This may be the true view , but I am not fully pursuaded that it is so .

		Let us look into the matter more closely .

		Mr.
William E. Anderson	PERSON	, when Superin - tendent of the Schools of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, ten or twelve years ago , found the changes in the personnel of the teaching corps of that city to be from ten to twelve per cent , annually .

		A well-known
Michigan	LOCATION	superintendent found the ratio to be about the same in his city .

		Applying this ratio to such cities as
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	, what an appall - ing result we have !

		But this is not all : changes in tine personnel of the force necesitate changes in the assignment of the remaining teachers to schools and grades , and these changes are probably equal in number to those resulting from the other cause .

		It is easy to say that some of these changes are for the good of the schools ; that some of the teachers who come are better than some who go , and that inter-school and inter-grade changes are often beneficial .

		This is true enough , but it is no proper offset to the evil that flows from unnecessary or un - desirable changes .

		It is undeniable that changes in the corps is one of the great sour - ces of waste in our public schools .

		No one knows this better than the experienced super - intendent .

		He labors hard to get his force in good working order , to effect the necessary adjustments upon which the success of the schools so closely depends , and only to see the whole organism broken up , or seriously deranged , at the end of the year .

		This is in the cities .

		In the rural districts the case is still worse .

		In
1886	DATE	a competent authority found that the schools in
Calhoun County	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, required 158 teachers , and that 342 different ones were employed in the course of the year ; also that the average length of the school year in the county was 8.4 months , while the average time for which the teachers served was but 3.8 months .

		He found also that the ratio of the teachers required to the teachers employed was about the same through - out the state , the tenure being longer in the newer counties than in the older ones .

		Since that time there has been a considerable , if not a marked , improvement in the mode of employ - ing teachers in
Michigan	LOCATION	, as well as in other states ; but the reform should go still farther .

		Why should not people change their bankers , lawyers , ministers , dentists , physicians , once in three or six months as well as their teachers ?

		We may scrutinize still more closely the loss that unnecessary changes entail upon the pupils of schools .

		We may justly say that a large majority of the inexperienced teachers wish to do their duty , and make an effort to do it ; they try to overcome in some measure their limitations arising out of their lack of prepar - 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ation , for which they are by no means fully responsible ; and , as the result of wish and effort , they make some commendable progress in mastering their art .

		But by the time they , or many of them , come to be really useful to their employers , they retire from the work , making room for new teachers who are as inex - perienced as they were at the beginning , and thus the Sysyphian labor is renewed .

		At what cost to pupils is the progress made by these successive relays of teachers earned !

		Some years ago , a
Kentucky	LOCATION	court , seeking to cut off some of the circumventions by which teachers strive to evade the law in regard to certificates , made these very pertinent remarks : '' The purpose of requiring a certificate is to be as - sured of the qualifications of the teacher in advance .

		He is not to practice on his pupils , keep one day ahead of his class , and thus , by going to school to himself , fit himself to stand the ordeal of an examination which he could not have stood at the beginning .

		Such a pro- cedure is a fraud on the district . ''

		The principle here involved would bear much wider application .

		The procedure described is not only '' a fraud on the district , '' but it is a crime on the children .

		How many teachers in the
United States	LOCATION	at the present time learn to teach , so far as they do learn , by '' practicing on their pupils , '' and thus '' going to school to themselves '' !

		In view of all the premises , what should be done ?

		What is the demand of the hour ?

		The comprehensive answer to this question is , Raise the teacher 's calling in the estimation of teach - ers and of the whole people .

		How shall this be done ?

		Of the numerous points that a full answer to this second question would involve , I mention only three , and these as briefly as possible .

		1 .

		The character of the teaching function , and especially the teacher 's calling , must be made the subject of constant direct appeal to the public .

		There is urgent need of an educa - tional campaign on the subject of education under its theoretical , practical , and historical aspects .

		2 .

		The preparation of teachers must be im - proved by direct efforts to that end .

		It is an undeniable fact , and a cheering one , that as a rule the better the work the teacher does , the longer his term of service .

		There can be no doubt that one reason why the tenure of city teachers is longer than country teachers is the fact that , as a class , they represent a much higher grade of preparation .

		3 .

		The folly of the incessant changes occur - ring in our corps of teachers must be dealt with directly and effectively , as far as possible .

		This will conduce to better preparation and to bet - ter teaching .

		It is true , of course , that the teaching body as a whole will undergo , and ought to undergo , constant changes , since changes are incident to human life and society ; but this is no defence of the wretched system that prevails at present .

		In this struggle there is much to encourage the friends of education .

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	has shown that from
1880	DATE	to
1897	DATE	the enrollment in public normal schools increased from about 10,000 to over 40,000 pupils , or fourfold ; and that in the same period private normal schools increased from 2,000 to 24,000 , or twelvefold .

		In
1880	DATE	there were 240 normal students in each million of inhabitants ; in
1897	DATE	there were 976 in each million .

		We may take courage from the un - doubted fact that education in the
United States	LOCATION	, inferior as it may be in many respects , is still on the rising grade .

		BYRON 'S INFLUENCE UPON GOETHE * '' I have simply run through the world .

		I have clutched everything by the hair .

		... I have longed and attained , and then longed again , and thus with might have stormed through life . ''

		These words of the aged
Faust	PERSON	, who , nearing his end , casts a retrospective glance over his past life , might well be taken to characterize
Byron	PERSON	.

		But only so far as we quote is the passage applicable : of the development hinted at in the following lines , he was utterly incapable .

		Flaring up like some strange meteor before the gaze of his astonished contempo - raries , his sudden plunge from the highest heights into death was far more favorable for his fame than a gradual decline and a lingering setting would have been .

		It was not without reason that
Goethe	PERSON	said : '' Although
Byron	PERSON	died so young , yet literature has not lost materially by him , so far as a more extended range of writing is concerned .

		He had reached the height of his creative power , and , whatever he might have written afterward , he could not have passed the natural boundaries of his talent . ''

		The last stage of the development of
Byron	PERSON	is that of his ''
Cain	PERSON	, '' who goes into exile uttering the despairing cry , `` And I ? ''

		The answer to this pessimism is to be found in the Second Part of '' Faust . ''

		The date of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's first acquaintance with
Byron	PERSON	's works can not be exactly determined .

		It must have been , however , sometime between
1812	DATE	-LRB- the date of the publication of the first two cantos * See note on page 161 of this issue .

		THE DIAL of '' Childe Harold '' -RRB- and
1816	DATE	.

		On
May 4	DATE	of the latter year he wrote to Eichstadt , '' I have just learned of the English poet Lord
Byron	PERSON	, who de - serves our interest , '' and inquires after a life of the poet .

		Corresponding to this is an entry in the '' Tag und Jahresheften , ''
1816	DATE	: '' My interest in foreign literature centred actively upon the poems of
Byron	PERSON	, who became ever more prominent and attracted me to him more and more , notwithstanding the fact that at first he had repelled me by his hypochondriacal pas - sion and by his bitter self-hatred , and that it was only with difficulty that I could approach his great personality .

		I read the ' Corsair ' and '
Lara	PERSON	' not without sympathy and admira - tion . ''

		From this statement we perceive that at first the fully-rounded nature of the German Altmeister found great difficulty in befriending itself with the skeptical , one-sided , misanthropic poet .

		In the fol - lowing year , however , his interest was not less active .

		`` English poetry and literature occupied a most prominent place this year .

		The more the public acquainted itself with the peculiarities of Lord
Byron	PERSON	's wonderful spirit , the more sympathy he gained , so that men and women , youths and maidens , appeared to forget their
Oerman	PERSON	nationality .

		As it became easier to obtain his works , I also formed the habit of busying myself with him more and more .

		He became to me a valued contemporary , and I followed him eagerly upon the wandering paths of his life . ''

		From this time on we find repeatedly in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's journals , letters , and conversations references to this or that work of
Byron	PERSON	.

		His interest is especially excited by the publication of ''
Manfred	PERSON	, '' in
1817	DATE	.

		On the
13th of October	DATE	of that year he writes to Knebel : `` The most noteworthy publication of recent date was the tragedy '
Manfred	PERSON	, ' by
Byron	PERSON	.

		This remarkable poet has absorbed my '
Faust	PERSON	, ' and has drawn out from it the strangest food for his hypochondria .

		He has used every motive in his own way , so that not one of them is identical -LSB- with mine -RSB- , and just for this very reason I can not sufficiently admire his genius ... Yet withal I do not deny that the sullen glow of an unbounded despair becomes wearisome after a time .

		And still the vexation which one feels is always coupled with re - spect and admiration . ''

		To Boisse 're ' e he writes , on the first of
May , 1818	DATE	, that '' an extraordinary spirit , great talent , insight into the world , and self-consciousness reign therein '' -LRB- i. e. , in `` Manfred '' -RRB- ; and in `` Kanst und Alter - tum '' he devotes a detailed discussion to it , part of which runs as follows : '' We find , then , here the real quintessence of the opinions and passions of this most wonderful talent , born to self - torment ... He has often enough confessed what tortures him ; he has presented it repeatedly , until hardly anyone has sympathy longer with that unendurable suffering of his . ''

		These strictures show that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's admiration was tempered by a healthy scorn of
Byron	PERSON	's unwhole - some melancholy .

		Goethe 's assertion that
Byron	PERSON	had imitated ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' and his assumption that '' Manfred '' had for its foundation a double murder caused by the poet 's passion for a married woman in
Florence	LOCATION	, were sufficient to touch the sensitive Englishman to the quick .

		He decided to revenge himself on Goethe by an ironical dedication to him of his `` Marino Falieri . ''

		The dedication was written , and sent to his publisher ,
Murray	PERSON	; but the latter had the good sense to suppress it .

		Ten years later ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	learned of this dedication through the younger
Murray	PERSON	.

		From '' Manfred '' Goethe translated the '' Curse '' -LRB- I. 1 -RRB- , and the `` Monologue '' -LRB- II .

		2 -RRB- , of which latter he said , '' Hamlet 's Soliloquy appears here intensified . ''

		It is not without interest to compare these two translations with the original .

		The '' Curse '' is translated into the original metre , but without rhyme .

		The sense of the '' Monologue '' is given for the most part excellently , but one notes a few minor errors .

		BYRON . ''

		Days Steal on us and steal from us . ''

		BYRON . ''

		In all the days of this de - tested yoke . ''

		GOETHE .

		`` Tage Bestehlend , stehlen sie sich weg . ''

		GOETHE . ''

		In all ' den Tagen der ver - wunschten Posse . ''

		Goethe has evidently read joke for yoke , and it is possible that the edition which he used contained this misprint , although I have not found it in any edition accessible to me .

		Again we read : BYRON . ''

		What is she now ?

		a suf - ferer for my sins A thing I dare not think upon GOETHE .

		`` Was ist sie jetzt ?

		Fur meine Siinden biisst sie Em Wesen ?

		Denk ' es nicht Veilleicht ein Nichts . ''

		or nothing . ''

		Here Goethe has entirely missed the meaning .

		BYRON . '

		And champion fears . ''

		human GOETHE .

		`` Der Erde Schreeken puf * ichauf . ''

		It is praise rather than blame to say that
Goethe	PERSON	was not a good translator .

		His translations lack entirely the Byronic tone , and are no longer
Byron	PERSON	, but
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The transmutation is so complete as to be striking in the highest degree .

		For '' Kunst und Altertum ''
Goethe	PERSON	wrote a notice of the first two cantos of '' Don Juan '' -LRB- 1821 -RRB- , and translated the first five stanzas of this work . ''

		Cain '' also received a full discussion from his pen .

		In spite of noteworthy waverings of opinion ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's admiration for
Byron	PERSON	grew with his years , but from the very first he had estimated the poet 's , character correctly .

		From the oft-quoted passages - in his letters and conversations we need not again - adduce examples as evidence .

		Byron , for his part , seems to have been flattered by so much attention - from the older master , and sent him in
1821	DATE	a proposed dedication to '' Sardanapalus , '' inscribed to him in the most flattering terms , and attended by a request for permission to print it at the beginning of the drama .

		The dedication was accepted , but , , through the carelessness of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	, was omitted in .

		printing .

		`` Notwithstanding this , '' says
Goethe	PERSON	, . ''

		the noble Lord did not give up his intention of showing a signal evidence of friendly feeling to his German contemporary and literary comrade ; and 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, consequently the Tragedy '
Werner	PERSON	' hears on its front a highly-prized memorial . ''

		In the
spring of 1823	DATE	an English traveller brought a letter from
Byron	LOCATION	to
Weimar	LOCATION	, which Goethe an - swered hy the well-known poem , '' Ein freundlich Wort komrat ernes nach dem Andern , '' mingling friendly admonition with cordial appre - ciation .

		Byron had already set sail for
Greece	LOCATION	, but was detained by a storm in the harbor of Leghorn , and here
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's answer reached him .

		He replied by a written greeting .

		So much for the personal and literary relations of the two during
Byron	PERSON	's lifetime .

		It is not within the limits of our task to consider
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's influence on
Byron	PERSON	, however interesting the investigation might prove .

		Byron owes the form at least of his '' Manfred '' and '' Deformed Transformed '' to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the opening lines of the '' Bride of
Abydos	LOCATION	, '' which he imitated from Mignon 's song , as translated by
Madame de Stae	ORGANIZATION	' l into French .

		All of
Byron	PERSON	's knowledge of German authors was through translations or through the kind offices of Shelley and of '' Monk ''
Lewis	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , the youthful and erratic genius of
Byron	PERSON	had worked as a mighty inspiration upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, bearing as its fruit the character of Euphorion in the Second Part of '' Faust . ''

		Yet even at this late stage the ten - dency to blame as well as praise the English poet was manifest , for we know that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	had at one time intended to satirize
Byron	PERSON	as one of the throng of poets introduced into the Second Part of '' Faust . ''

		Besides the traces of Byron which we have just mentioned ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	has adapted one of
Byron	PERSON	's epi - grams , a fact which seems to have been overlooked up to this time .

		We quote first Goethe 's rendition : '' Nein , fur den Poeten ist 's zu viel .

		Dieses entsetzliche Strafgericht .

		Verdanmit ist mein
Trauerspiel	ORGANIZATION	, Und die alte Tante nicht ! ''

		This is first published in
1833	DATE	.

		The original is not found in
Byron	LOCATION	's collected works , but in
Medwin	LOCATION	's '' Conversations with
Byron	PERSON	. '' ''

		Behold the blessings of a happy lot 1 My play is damned , and Lady is not ! ''

		Medwin explains the epigram as an allusion to two letters received by
Byron	PERSON	in the same mail , the one containing the news that ''
Marino Falieri	PERSON	'' had failed at
Drury Lane Theatre	ORGANIZATION	; and the other , that an old woman -LSB- Lady
Milbanke	PERSON	? -RSB-

		, from whom he had expected to inherit money , would probably sur - vive her hundredth birthday .

		Without this explana - tion ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's epigram , as well as that of
Byron	LOCATION	, is sheer nonsense .

		A satirical stanza , beginning , '' Lord
Byron ohne Scham	PERSON	nnd
Schein	PERSON	, '' may be referred to here , merely for the sake of completeness .

		The introduction of the poet 's name alone connects the verse with him .

		In
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's posthumous writings occurs another poem referring to
Byron	PERSON	, i. e. , '' Stark von Faust , gewandt im Rat . ''

		Eckermann would have us believe that the Ma - rienbad Elegy was influenced by
Byron	PERSON	, because greater strength of feeling is expressed in it than in other of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poems written at this time !

		It is true that
Goethe	PERSON	told the Chancellor von Mttller that everybody in
Marienbad	LOCATION	was talking about
Byron	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	, but is not
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ardor to be ascribed rather to his sudden and passionate admiration for
Ulrike	PERSON	von Levezow than to so remote a cause ?

		This absurd proposition is an excellent example of the lengths to which a would-be literateur will go when out on a Quellenjagd .

		In the third act of the Second Part of '' Faust '' is
Byron	PERSON	's real memorial at the hands of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		This third act appeared for the first time in
1827	DATE	, under the title ''
Helena	PERSON	. ''

		The son of Faust the exponent of Romanticism , and of Helena the expo - nent of the classic spirit , appears here as
Euphorion	LOCATION	-
Byron	PERSON	, the exponent of the modern subjective age .

		Goethe himself has given us the key to his charac - terization . ''

		As representative of the most recent poetic period , I could use no one except him who is to be regarded as without ques - tion the greatest talent of the century .

		And then ,
Byron	PERSON	is not antique , neither is he romantic , but he is like the present day itself .

		I had to have such a character .

		He suited also perfectly because of his discontented nature , and of his com - bative tendency , which brought him to destruction at
Misso	LOCATION	- lunghi .

		... I had planned the catastrophe formerly in quite another manner and once quite well .

		Then time brought me this matter of
Byron	PERSON	and
Missolunghi	LOCATION	, and I let every - thing else go . ''

		And how was Euphorion to be conceived ?

		Let us read a few sentences from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's own charac - terization of
Byron	PERSON	, one of the most shrewd analyses of the poet existent .

		`` One may very well say that bis uncontrolled nature was his ruin ... He lived passionately for each day , without thought of the morrow , nor did he consider what he did ... Everywhere the bounds were too narrow for him , and even with the most unlimited personal liberty he felt himself rest - ive ... He felt ever the poetic impulse , and all that ema - nated from the man , especially from his heart , was excellent . ''

		Goethe said this to Eckermann in
1825	DATE	, that is , just at the time when he had resumed work on the ''
Helena	ORGANIZATION	'' and was vigorously pushing it forward .

		And all that he expresses here as a critic , he repeats in ' * Faust '' as a poet .

		Let us examine the conception of Euphorion in detail .

		Soon after his miraculous birth the heavenly boy seizes the lyre , '' already announcing himself as the future master of all beauty , in whose members eternal harmonies are stirring . ''

		At once Phorkyas proclaims that the time of the old gods is past , and that the time of the new subjective song has come . ''

		List !

		the fairest harmonies !

		Quickly free yourself from fables .

		Away with the old multitude of your gods , their day is past .

		No one will understand you longer : we demand a higher tribute ; for that must come from the heart which is to work upon the heart . ''

		Compare with this the last sentence in the quota - tion above : '' And all which emanated from the man , especially from his heart , was excellent . ''

		Euphorion 's restless nature , ever striving upward
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 and onward , and forgetting itself only for the mo - ment even in love 's dalliance , now finds its ade - quate expression .

		This same unrestrained , restless longing in the real prototype Goethe excellently characterizes as his tendency toward the limitless .

		It is
Byron	PERSON	himself , the Byron of ''
Cain	PERSON	'' and of ''
Manfred	PERSON	, '' who says : '' That which is easily gained is repulsive to me .

		Only that which is won by force really delights me . ''

		The all-ruling love of nature , so evident through - out
Byron	PERSON	's poems , finds beautiful expression in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's verses .

		`` A crowding of rocks here , between the forest thickets .

		Why these bounds for me , me who am young and strong ?

		The winds are rushing there , the waves are roaring there , I hear both from afar , fain were I near . '' ''

		It was too narrow for him everywhere , '' says
Goethe	PERSON	.

		Then follows the allusion to his revolu - tionary spirit : '' Will you bring in the day of peace by dreaming ?

		Dream he who may .

		War is the watchword . ''

		And upon this follows the last flight , the fall : '' Icarus !

		Icarus !

		Sorrow enough ! ''

		Goethe is not the only German who has composed a dirge upon
Byron	PERSON	.

		We recall those of
Alfred Meissner	PERSON	, of
Heine	LOCATION	, of
Wilhelm Muller	PERSON	; but none has equalled his in quiet , sorrowful majesty .

		`` Not alone , wheresoe'er thou tarriest . ''

		Goethe says himself : '' The chorus falls entirely out of its role in this elegy ; it suddenly becomes earnest and highly reflective , and utters that of which it never thought and never could think . ''

		This is a true statement , not , however , a true criti - cism .

		Lovingly , with almost womanly idealization ,
Goethe	PERSON	has set Byron a memorial such as his own nation never dreamed of .

		Banned from his own country during his lifetime , wilfully misunderstood and misrepresented after his death , he found else - where universally recognition and acceptance .

		In conclusion , we venture to assert that what really influenced
Goethe	PERSON	was
Byron	PERSON	's brilliant per - sonality and romantic life , to which the fact of his being a '' noble Lord '' undoubtedly lent additional charm .

		Of a distinct literary influence there is no trace .

		But that the greatest German of his age was so quick to recognize in Byron a poetic spirit of high order , perhaps of the highest order , ought not be forgotten at the moment of our somewhat tardy Byron-revival .

		A QUESTION OF PROPRIETY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his excellent articles on
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, published in THE DIAL during recent years -LRB- the last one being in the issue for
February 16	DATE	-RRB- , Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	seems to delight in referring to the poet as Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		To be sure , it is perfectly correct to do so , as
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has received the degree from a university of recognized standing , but is it necessary and desirable to call a great poet doctor ?

		Suppose Oxford or Cam - bridge had conferred the same degree upon Shakes - peare ,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	, or Shelley : would it not offend us to hear the critics speak of Dr.
Shakespeare	PERSON	, Dr.
Milton	PERSON	, Dr.
Byron	PERSON	, or Dr.
Shelley	PERSON	?

		It is true we refer to
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	as Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, but his case is dif - ferent .

		He courted the title and was flattered by it .

		I have heard many intelligent admirers of the great Norwegian dramatist offer protests against Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's practice of calling him Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		A great poet needs no honorary degree : he is great enough without it , and , instead of adding dignity to his name , it seems to detract .

		Ibsen did not court any degree ; his countrymen never call him Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, and are inclined to ridicule those who do as pedantic .

		-LSB- The writer referred to in the above communica - tion simply follows the uniform practice of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	in mentioning the names of living men and women .

		We believe it to be a matter of the merest good manners to speak of people in print as we should speak to them in private conversation .

		If we were addressing Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	personally , we cer - tainly should not call him '' Ibsen , '' and are unwill - ing to offer him that discourtesy when writing about him .

		If we did not call him '' Dr. '' we should be obliged to call him ''
Herr	PERSON	, '' which our critic would probably think equally pedantic .

		Thus the cases of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Byron	PERSON	, who are not among the living , have no bearing upon the question .

		Our practice in this matter illustrates one of those `` little touches '' to use Professor
Peck	PERSON	's phrase that mean so much to persons of refined taste .

		The habit which Germans and Scandinavians have of denying in print to their living fellow-countrymen the titles whereby gentlemen designate one another is a thing which as far as it goes indicates an imperfect civilization , and it is one of the minor de - pravities of the American newspaper that it so encourages this form of rudeness that we should now be taken to task for observing the ordinary ameni - ties of social intercourse .

		In regard to the question -LRB- if question it be -RRB- raised in Mr.

		Mrs.

Miss Bronte	PERSON	that may well have been floating vaguely in the mind of the
New York	LOCATION	newspaper writer when he described , on Mrs.

		148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, THE EVOLUTION OF THE BRITISH ARMY .

		* Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	is a civilian , but his scholarly `` History of the British Army '' can not fail to win the respect of the intelligent military read - er .

		Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's valuable book is con - ceived and thus far carried out in the spirit of the scientific historian .

		The more romantic and picturesque side of his theme has for him but a secondary interest ; and this we must consider a fortunate characteristic , since , while the exploits in the field of the
British Army	ORGANIZATION	have been more than sufficiently celebrated in sounding prose by competent pens , the not less important record of its growth or evolution ab ovo as a national establishment has hitherto been strangely neglected .

		It is to this comparatively unworked field of research that Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	mainly applies him - self .

		In thus stating what appears to us to be the essential or distinctive feature of the work it is not intended to imply that the author has neglected the military aspect of his subject .

		It would be impossible to write even what may be called the bare natural history of the
British Army	ORGANIZATION	without depicting in some detail the great battles and campaigns which materi - ally affected its development and character by instituting more or less radical changes in organization , tactics , or equipments .

		Mr. For - tescue 's account of the political and adminis - trative side of British military history thus runs concurrently with the judiciously com - pressed and selective recital of the British soldier 's achievements in the field , the reader being constantly reminded that it is primarily the evolution of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	as a national estab - lishment that the author is aiming to trace out and illustrate .

		Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's powers of picturesque descrip - tion are moderate ; his analysis of military oper - ations is concise and clear ; and the fact that he is a civilian has not deterred him from exercis - ing a considerable degree of independence of judgment .

		The average reader , accustomed to the conventional view of
General Wolfe	ORGANIZATION	, will be surprised at Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's estimate of the much vaunted victory on the plains of
Abraham	LOCATION	, which was due more to good luck and the virtual mental collapse of the French commander than to good generalship , and was * A HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY .

		By the Hon.
J. W. Fortescue	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with maps .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		essentially a gambler 's throw of a general who had failed to see his real strategical opportu - nity .

		Says Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	: '' ... It is quite incontestible that the credit for the fall of
Quebec	LOCATION	belongs rather to the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	than to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		... It still remains for enquiry why
Wolfe	PERSON	did not take earlier advantage of the opportunities opened to him by the fleet ; and even after allowance is made for his constant illness , the answer is not readily found .

		The measures which led to the decisive action were , as has been told , taken on the advice of his brigadiers , and , if
Montcalm	LOCATION	had not succumbed to positive infa - tuation , would very likely have brought
Wolfe	PERSON	to a court-martial . ''

		It is easy , as the author observes , to be wise after the event ; but a careful analysis of the whole record of the operations at
Quebec	LOCATION	goes to show that
Wolfe	PERSON	's reputation as a soldier has been somewhat unduly enhanced by the tradition of his virtues as a man and of his heroic death in the hour of victory .

		Mr.
Fortescup	PERSON	's design is to write , in four volumes of about six hundred pages each , the history of the
British Army	ORGANIZATION	down to the year
1870	DATE	.

		The two volumes now ready carry the story down to the Peace of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1763	DATE	, and the two forthcoming volumes will bring it forward to the great reforms which virtually closed the life of the old
Army	ORGANIZATION	and opened that of the new .

		The common assumption , as Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	notes , that the history of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	begins with the 14th of
February , 1661	DATE	, is inaccurate , since the continuity of the ex - istence of the Coldstream Guards , a regiment of the New Model , was practically unbroken by the ceremony of
Saint Valentine	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		This famous corps therefore forms a link which binds the New Model army of the Long Par - liament to the army of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		But as the very name New Model indicates that there was an earlier and older model , the his - torian of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is not justified in begin - ning with the
Long Parliament	ORGANIZATION	's Ordinance of
Feb. 15 , 1645	DATE	, but is thrown back to the out - break of the Civil War .

		It is found that at that period King and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	had avail - able for purposes of military organization a body of trained and experienced officers who had learnt their trade abroad , and mainly in the Low Countries .

		The historian is thus led back to the Thirty Years ' War , to the tens and even hundreds of thousands of English and Scots who fought for pay and Protestantism under
Gustavus	PERSON	and
Maurice of Nassau	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , having gone back two generations before the Civil War for the germ of the New Model , it is found to be impossible to pause there .

		For in
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 the
earlier years of Elizabeth	DATE	's reign we are con - fronted with an important period in English military history , with a break in old traditions , with concessions to foreign ideas and adoption of foreign practices albeit such concessions were then as always distasteful to the nation : `` For there were memories to which the English clung with pathetic tenacity , not in
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's day only but even to the midst of the Civil War , the mem - ories of King Harry the Fifth , of the
Black Prince	ORGANIZATION	, of
Edward the Third	ORGANIZATION	, and of the unconquerable infantry that had won the day at
Agincourt	LOCATION	,
Pontiers	ORGANIZATION	, and Crec.y .

		The passion of English sentiment over the change is mirrored to us for all time in the pages of Shakespeare ; for no nation loves military reform so little as our own , and we shrink from the thought that if military glory is not to pass from a possession into a legend , it must be eternally renewed with strange weapons and by unfa - miliar methods .

		This was the trouble which afflicted
England	LOCATION	under the Tudors , and she comforted herself with the immortal prejudice that is still her main-stay in all times of doubt , 1 1 tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march Three Frenchmen . ' ''

		This '' immortal prejudice '' is proving just now anything but a u mainstay , '' and seems at last in a fair way of extinction .

		The origin of
England	LOCATION	's Elizabethan new departures in warfare are to be traced back by the historian through the Spaniards , the Lands - knechts , and the Swiss , and the old English practice and tradition must be followed to its source .

		It is not found at
Cre	ORGANIZATION
$ y	MONEY	, for
Edward III	ORGANIZATION	.

		's time was one of military reform .

		Revert - ing to the
Battle of Falkirk	ORGANIZATION	, the
Statute of Winchester	ORGANIZATION	, the Assize of Arms , the essentially English tradition still recedes , till at last at the Conquest we can discern a great English principle which forced itself on the conquering Normans , and eventually on all
Europe	LOCATION	namely , the rule that all men-at-arms must dis - mount when in action and as a preparatory step for action .

		The primitive national army of
Teutonic England	ORGANIZATION	consisted of the mass of free landowners between the ages of sixteen and sixty , and was known as the fyrd .

		Custom fixed its term of service at two months in the year .

		Alfred reorganized this force of Land - wehr by dividing the country into military dis - tricts , and requiring every five hides of land , at the king 's summons , to furnish , maintain , and pay an armed man .

		Each owner of five hides of land was furthermore required to do thane 's service , that is , to appear in the field heavily armed and to serve throughout the campaign .

		Canute later added a new and more distinctly military element in the form of a royal body-guard , originally a picked force of from three to six thousand Danish troops , known as the house-carles . ''

		It was with an army framed on this model the raw levies of the fyrd and the better trained men of the body-guard that
King Harold	PERSON	, flushed with the vic - tory of
Stamford Bridge	ORGANIZATION	, marched down to meet the invasion of William of
Normandy	LOCATION	... Yet the force was homogenous in virtue of a single custom wherein lies the secret of the rise of
England	LOCATION	's prowess as a military nation .

		Though the wealthy thanes might ride horses on the march , they dismounted one and all for action , and fought , even to the king himself , on their own feet . ''

		Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's opening chapters , then , are devoted to a sketch of the growth of
England	LOCATION	's military power to the time of its first manifesta - tion at
Cre	ORGANIZATION
$ y	MONEY	, and thence to
Agincourt	LOCATION	; then through its decay under the blight of the Wars of the Roses to its revival under the Tudors , and to the training of English contingents and adventurers under foreign schools and in for - eign wars which prepared the way for the New Model and the
Standing Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The six hun - dred years of English military history from
Hastings	LOCATION	to Naseby have been compressed into some two hundred pages , all details being omitted save those essential to a coherent ac - count of the growth of the national military system .

		The New Model army was voted in
February , 1645	DATE	; and with the opening chapter of Book III. , which nearly completes the first half of Vol .

		I. , the author proceeds to give an interesting and somewhat detailed account of the organization of this famous body and its exploits in the field .

		Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	has some - thing to say of the common tendency to regard the New Model army as primarily a body of zealots whose religious enthusiasm made them irresistible in battle , without taking into ac - count the vital fact that they were disciplined soldiers trained under a military code of almost unexampled severity . ''

		Cromwell 's system is generally summed up in the word fanaticism ; but this is less than half the truth .

		... Simple fanaticism is in its nature undisciplined ; it is strong because it assumes its superiority , it is weak because it is content with the assumption ; only when bound under a yoke such as that of a
Zizka	PERSON	or of a
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	is it irresistible .

		Cromwell 's great work was the same as
Zizka	PERSON	's , to subject the fanaticism that he saw around him to discipline .

		He did not go out of his way to find fanatics . '

		Sir , ' he once wrote , ' the
State	ORGANIZATION	in choosing men for its service takes no notice of their opinions ; if they be willing to faithfully serve it , that satisfies . '

		In forming his original regiment of horse he undoubtedly selected men of good character , just as any colonel would endeavor to do to-day .

		But
Fairfax	LOCATION	's was by no means an army of saints .

		One regiment of the New Model mutinied when its colonel opened his com - mand with a sermon .

		It is time to have done with all misconceptions as to the work that
Cromwell	PERSON	did for 150 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the military service of
England	LOCATION	, for it is summed up in the one word discipline .

		It was the work not of a preacher hut of a soldier . ''

		In fact , the contempt with which the Royalist soldiers came latterly to be regarded by the Parliamentarians seems to have savored rather of professional than spiritual pride .

		The king 's troopers were despised not so much as profane and loose-living '' malignants , '' as ill-furnished and ill-disciplined soldiers .

		This is indicated in the satirical accounts in the Parliamentary newspapers of the prisoners captured at
Bristol	LOCATION	, one of which says : '' First came half-a-dozen of carbines in their leathern coats and starved weather-beaten jades , just like so many brewers in their jerkins made of old boots , riding to fetch in old casks ; and after them as many light horse - men with great saddles and old broken pistols , and scarce a sword among them , just like so many fiddlers with their fiddles in cases by their horses ' sides ... In the works at
Bristol	LOCATION	was a company of footmen with knapsacks and half-pikes , like so many tinkers with budgets at their backs , and some musketeers with ban - doliers about their necks like a company of sow-gelders . ''

		The two chapters comprising Book IV .

		of Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's opening volume recount briefly the military events of the unsettled and transi - tional period between the Restoration and the accession of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	; and the clos - ing half of the volume is occupied mainly with reforms and campaigns of
Marlborough	LOCATION	's time .

		The Anglo-French struggle for empire in
India	LOCATION	and the New World forms the central theme of Volume II .

		Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's valuable work will be read with avidity by English military men , and his - torical students generally will find it a most convenient repository of the special class of facts it deals with .

		Ample references to the authorities consulted are given , for the most part at the foot of the page .

		The volumes are elegantly and substantially made , and are pro- vided with the necessary maps and plans .


E. G. J. DEAN MERIVALE	PERSON	.

1851	DATE	, Dean Merivale charged

		Edited by his Daughter ,
Judith Anne Merivale	PERSON	.

		With a Portrait .


London	LOCATION	:
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		the fourth chapter of that volume , wherein a somewhat similar movement on the part of Octavius is described .

		The letter also ex - pressed the confident hope that the Emperor would order a thousand copies of the '' His - tory '' for his regimental libraries , and would bestow upon its author the Cross of the Legion of Honor .

		Curiously enough , this bit of pleas - antry was taken by some in serious earnest which perhaps may go to prove the high repute enjoyed by the book in question from its first appearance .

		That the gap between Dr. Ar - nold 's unfinished work and
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Decline and Fall '' had been filled by a worthy successor to those great historians , seems to have been very generally acknowledged .

		The main events in Dean Merivale 's life may be briefly stated .

		Born in
London	LOCATION	in
1808	DATE	, he was educated at
Harrow	LOCATION	and Cam - bridge ; held a fellowship at that university from
1833	DATE	to
1848	DATE	; was settled over the parish of Lawford from
1848	DATE	to
1869	DATE	; and was then appointed dean of
Ely	ORGANIZATION	, a post which he held until his death in
1893	DATE	.

		In his youth the offer of a writership in
India	LOCATION	led to his spending eighteen months of his school life at
Hailey	PERSON	- bury , preparing for the civil service examina - tions and studying
Bengali	LOCATION	,
Hindustanee	LOCATION	, Per - sian , political economy -LRB- under
Malthus	PERSON	-RRB- , and general history ; but he and his family then wisely decided that he should follow his inclina - tion for a life of letters , and soon afterward he entered
St. John 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The recent '' Autobiography '' by the Dean 's daughter closes with the attainment of the fel - lowship at
St. John 's	ORGANIZATION	, the remaining two-thirds of the volume being devoted to correspondence .

		The whole forms a good record of a life filled with high aims steadily and successfully pur - sued from the beginning .

		It is worthy of note that when
Charles Merivale	PERSON	was but six years old he took delight in playing with his brother
Herman	PERSON	, aged seven , a game which they called '' Roman history . ''

		It was played in Queen 's Square , the northern end of which they named ``
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and the northeast corner ``
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		The trundling of hoops was a leading feature of the game , the career of each consul being typified by the course which the player 's hoop chanced to take . ''

		The straight line of pub - lic virture was the narrow path of the kerb - stone , and few magistrates kept it to the end . ''

		In his school days at Harrow the future his - torian of the Roman Empire committed to memory , for his own amusement , all but a few hundred lines of
Lucan	PERSON	's `` Pharsalia , '' when
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 his sudden removal to Haileybury interrupted the task .

		That largeness of view and generosity of sentiment which characterize
Merivale	ORGANIZATION	's writ - ings may , it seems not improbably , be largely owing to the variety of scene and of personal intercourse which he enjoyed in his youth .

		His paternal grandparents were dissenters ,
Presby	LOCATION	- terians of pronounced Unitarian convictions ; and there is something admirable in honest
John Merivale	PERSON	's sturdy refusal to enter the Ministry or , indeed , to embrace any profes - sion , even when an uncle 's fortune was offered him as an inducement .

		He preferred to be left to his books and his flute .

		On his moth - er 's side
Merivale	ORGANIZATION	's family was more orthodox , but the boy was free to follow his own inclina - tion in matters of religion , and he went to hear Dr.
Belsham	PERSON	in Essex Street fully as often as to Dr.
Martin	PERSON	's church in
Queen 's Square	LOCATION	.

		The liberality of his faith is well expressed in this sentence from his pen : '' I am well pleased to have had the opportunity of testing by my own observation how slight , how shadowy , is the pretended difference between the Episcopalian and the Presbyterian as such ; and how little even far wider divergence in speculative opinion on points of dogma may affect the graces of the true Christian character . ''

		The names of those eminent men with whom Dean
Merivale	PERSON	was more or less intimately acquainted would make a long list .

		In his college days we find him enjoying the society of the Tennysons and the
Wordsworths Charles	PERSON	and
Christopher	PERSON	, of Trench ,
Kem	PERSON	- ble ,
Milnes	PERSON	,
Hallam	PERSON	,
William Bodham Donne	PERSON	,
William Hepworth Thompson	PERSON	,
Arthur Helps	PERSON	, and many more besides .

		He had the honor of reciting
Tennyson	PERSON	's prize poem , '' Timbuctoo , '' at the request of the young poet , who was '' too shy or too proud to exhibit himself on such an occasion . ''

		His letters to and from and about persons of whom one likes to hear , are well worth reading .

		The genesis and growth of the '' History of the Romans , '' so far as re - corded in these letters , lend them an additional interest .

		Genial humor pervades both the au - tobiography and the correspondence .

		-LRB- Among his other virtues the Dean 's epitaph credits him with having been '' caustic in wit , '' as if causticity were likewise a virtue . -RRB-

		In a letter to
Christopher Wordsworth	PERSON	he refers to Lem - priere as `` A man of the highest imagination , which by a pe - culiar idiosyncrasy fell into an alphabetical form , in which the advantage of reference is more than counter - balanced by the constant dislocation of continuity .

		He was an index-maker of a higher order of beings , a vocabulist of the moon , of which he could probably have written a most veritable and entertaining history , including all the scandal about her paramour , the man in the moon . ''

		The chief fault of the '' autobiography '' is its brevity : it ends abruptly , although design - edly , at the most interesting period of the writer 's life .

		A less generous selection from his letters , on the other hand , might have proved equally acceptable to the general reader .

		The care with which
Miss Merivale	ORGANIZATION	has edited the volume is apparent perhaps almost pain - fully so in the abundant foot-notes , which deal with matters even of the minutest detail .

		On the very first page , however , an error probably a misprint has crept into one of these notes and assigned a wrong date as the year of
Merivale	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		Two short passages , culled at random from this book in closing , will give a glimpse of Dean
Merivale	ORGANIZATION	's conservatism on the subject of education and on the '' woman question . ''

		The first is from the `` autobiography . '' ''

		It is sad , and perhaps perplexing , to think that there should be no room at
the University	ORGANIZATION	for combining the old-world studies with modern accomplishments ; but so experience seems to teach us ; and if a choice is to be allowed between the two , as is the tendency of the present day , I would say from my own observation , by all means stick to the Old in preference to the New .

		There is no training , I feel sure , equal to that of clas - sics and mathematics . ''

		It should be noted that the above was written at least twenty years ago .

		The next passage is from a letter written by Merivale to his sister
Louisa	PERSON	in
1866	DATE	. ''

		About the comparative opportunities of men and women I have this to observe .

		Looking in the sphere of literary occupation most appropriate to the male genius , men have the advantage .

		In matters of wide research which lead to and require large inductions , men have the advantage not from education and oppor - tunities only , but from the natural structure of their minds .

		With the same advantages few , if any , women could compete with them .

		No woman could have written the histories of Tacitus or
Gibbon	PERSON	, with the highest university education and the run of the Bodleian .

		On the other hand , there are other matters in which women are unrivaled , from their tact and observation of character and clearness of view generally in a narrow compass ; and for these you have fair opportunities . ''

		162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A NEW BJBLICAL , ENCYCLOPAEDIA .

		* These closing years of the nineteenth cen - tury are full of promise for students of the sacred Scriptures .

		The appearance within two successive years of the initial volumes of two great four-volume Dictionaries of the
Bible	LOCATION	, marks an era in biblical study and research .

		These two comprehensive works place in the hands of Bible students , in concise and clear form , the best results of all previous critical study in this line .

		They promise to be small libraries on all the essential and interesting questions of biblical criticism and interpreta - tion .

		And both are edited and issued by en - ergetic and aggressive Britons ,
Hastings	PERSON	' '' Dictionary of the Bible '' in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-LRB-
T. & T. Clark	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and
Cheyne	PERSON	's in
London	LOCATION	-LRB-
A. & C. Black	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The raison d'etre of the issuance simultane - ously of two such works is found in the fact that critically they occupy practically different positions .

		While
Hastings	PERSON	' work is progres - sive ,
Cheyne	PERSON	's is described in the Preface in the following terms -LRB- p. ix . -RRB-

		: '' The sympathies of the editors are , upon the whole , with what is commonly known as ' advanced ' criticism , not simply because it is advanced , but because such a criticism , in the hands of a circumspect and experienced scholar , takes account of facts and phenomena which the criticism of a former generation overlooked or treated superficially .

		They have no desire , however , to ' boycott ' moderate criticism , when applied by a critic who , either in the form or in the substance of his criticism , has something original to say . ''

		The Preface is devoted largely to a eulogy upon the late Professor
W. Robertson Smith	PERSON	, editor of the ninth edition of the ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- paedia Britannica , '' to whom credit is given for the origination , twelve years ago , of the plan according to which this work has been executed .

		Some of the best contributions of Professor Smith to the Britannica have been brought down to date and embodied in this work .

		Other material prepared by him has also been used so far as consistent with latest research .

		The chief features of this work , in addition to its '' advanced '' critical position , are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the presentation in full , under each word , of readings of the Versions , extending in the case of the Septuagint , to several of the most im - portant MSS. ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- larger emphasis upon the * ENCYCLOPAEDIA BIBLICA : A Critical Dictionary of the Literary , Political , and Religious History , the Archaeology , Geography , and

		Old than upon the New Testament , especially in the lines of textual criticism and biblical archae - ology ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the omission of articles which treat of biblical theology proper , based on the state - ment that we are not as yet sufficiently ad - vanced in some other lines of research to venture on this field .

		The emphasis of the philological , the technical , and purely critical treatment of the themes is everywhere appar - ent .

		Every proper name in the Old and
New Testament	LOCATION	and the Old Testament Apocrypha is discussed with as much fulness as the data allow .

		The purely scientific and scholarly character of the work has brought along with it a for - midable array of abbreviations , symbols , and bibliographical notes .

		These together with their explanations cover nine double-columned pages , and are an enormous space-saving de - vice , though they may be a hardship on the reader until he has made himself their master .

		This first volume has a distinguished roll of fifty-three contributors .

		Of these thirty-two are British , fifteen are German , Dutch , and Swiss , and six are Americans .

		We find in the whole number twenty-two men in the Old Testament department , including all the six Americans , and only six in the
New Testament	LOCATION	, and of these latter four are Germans .

		The heaviest contributor is , of course , Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	, the editor-in-chief , whose reputation is a guarantee for critical and scientific re - search .

		Prof.
George Adam Smith	PERSON	's service is especially noteworthy in articles on the biblical geography of Palestine .

		Some of the most conspicuous articles in this volume are ''
Apoc	ORGANIZATION	- alyptic Literature '' by Professor
R. H. Charles	PERSON	, '' Apocrypha '' by
M. R. James	PERSON	, ''
Assyria	LOCATION	'' and ``
Babylonia	LOCATION	'' by
L. W. King	PERSON	, of the British Museum , '' Canon '' by
Karl Budde	PERSON	, '' Canticles '' by the Editor , '' Chronology '' by
Karl Marti	PERSON	and
H. von Soden	PERSON	, '' The Book of Daniel '' by
A. Kamphausen	PERSON	, and ''
Deuter	PERSON	- onomy '' by
George F. Moore	PERSON	.

		Upon an exam - ination of the articles we find that the editors have stood by their principle announced in the Preface , though there is not everywhere , as might , of course , be expected , full agreement on critical questions .

		Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	is quite in the van on most points , while a goodly number of his contributors are not far behind him .

		Together they give us in this volume the fin de siecle position of the advanced school , if such it may be called , of biblical criticism .

		As the pronouncement of this school it is the best up-to-date compendium , and for many

		THE DIAL 153 other purposes will be of real service to biblical scholars .

		The arrangement of the matter is admirable .

		The heading of each article is in full-face
Clar	PERSON	- endon type , and if it is long , it is subdivided into sections , and the section-theme is inset in dark-faced type .

		This plan , and a method of cross-references from one article to a given section of another where the same theme is treated , is both a space - saving device and an invaluable convenience to the user .

		The clean , clear type , and the use of different sizes for matters of minor importance , and a small type for notes , make up a solid , substantial , yet inviting page to the careful student of biblical problems .

		* The proposition , novel not many decades ago , has come to be accepted as axiomatic , that the written Constitutions of
America	LOCATION	are the result of a process of gradual development ; and now it is the details of that process which largely engage the attention of constitutional students .

		Landon ,
Taylor	PERSON	,
Stevens	PERSON	, and
Coxe	PERSON	have shown the origin of many of the funda - mental principles of our system ; Dicey and
Macy	ORGANIZATION	have explained how principles of iden - tical origin have experienced distinctive evo - lutions in the politics of
Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; and
Fisher	PERSON	has traced the American appli - cations of these principles , through their several stages of use in the charters and con - stitutions of various colonies , to their present accepted form .

		The terse and succinct provis - ions of the United States Constitution , permit - ting an elastic application to changing condi - tions and varying necessities , have proved fa - vorable also to disputes concerning its proper construction .

		What did the framers of that instrument intend ?

		is a question frequently asked , and often with much pertinence .

		The recently published essay on '' The Growth of the Constitution in the
Federal Convention	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
William M. Meigs	PERSON	, contributes to the subject of constitutional evolution , by throwing light upon the extent of the application of par - ticular principles which was in the minds of the Framers .

		of expression were selected , we can understand better the scope of the changes in our govern - ment which followed the adoption of the work of that convention .

		Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	has furnished a convenient summary , clause by clause , of the debates waged in the convention and the action finally taken .

		``
Elliott	PERSON	's Debates '' of course show all this ; but Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	has summarized these `` Debates '' topically ; and with him we can , without personal delving , follow from week to week , the presentation of diverse views on the same subject , and often trace the changes of sentiment leading to the unanimous selection of propositions which had previously been seri - ously questioned in debate .

		To illustrate fully Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	's method would be to repeat pages of his book .

		It will serve as an instance , to refer to the subjects of '' laws impairing the obligation of contracts , '' and `` ex post facto laws , '' the prohibitions concern - ing which were presented for consideration late in the deliberations of the convention ; and per contra , to the proposition which was pre - sented but rejected , to apply the `` obligation clause '' to congressional legislation .

		The de - bates disclose a growth of opinion on these and other subjects , in the convention .

		An important feature of this work is a fac - simile copy of
Randolph	PERSON	's draft , in his own hand , of a proposed constitution , with notes and additions by
Rutledge	PERSON	.

		Both the original draft and the emendations are shown to have been made while the convention was sitting ; and they throw light of their own upon the devel - opment of opinion among the delegates .

		Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	's Index is brief and simple , as he thought an exhaustive one unnecessary ; so he has indexed the names of eleven only of the delegates .

		But the present reviewer believes that many readers would liberally use an index in which the name of every debater in the con - vention should be given , and referring to every page where his share in the deliberations ap - pears .

		* That redoubtable and indefatigable traveller and writer , Mrs.
Bird-Bishop	PERSON	, has been touring up the
Yangzte Valley	LOCATION	for '' recreation and interest '' only , but on returning has presented us with two large volumes , entitled '' The
Yangtze Valley	ORGANIZATION	and Be - yond , '' packed with geographical , commercial , po - litical , and religious information , and well provided with map and illustrations and appendices .

		Mrs. Bishop , for the most part alone save for a few na - tives , traversed twelve hundred miles in regions little visited by Europeans , and in large part un - noticed in travel literature .

		The hardships she endured from the curious crowds she thus describes . ''

		I sat in my chair in the village street the unwilling center of a large and very dirty crowd , which had leisure to stand around me for an hour , staring , making remarks , laughing at my peculiarities , pressing closer and closer till there was hardly air to breathe , taking out my hair pins , and passing my gloves round and put - ting them on their dirty hands , and on two occasions abstracting my spoon and slipping it into their sleeves , being in no way abashed when they were detected ... The crowd which always gathered during my passage down the street rolled in at the doorway , blocking up the yard , shouting , often times hooting , and fighting each other for a look at the foreigner .

		Fortunately , doors in Chinese inns have strong wooden bolts , and when my baggage and I were once ensconced I was secure from intrusion , unless a few men and boys ran on ahead to take possession of the room before I entered it , or forced themselves in behind Be-dien when he brought in my dinner .

		If it were merely a boarded wall , a row of patient eyes usually watched me for an hour , and with much gratification , for these rooms are dark with the door shut , and my candle revealed my barbarian proceedings .

		But worse than this was the slow scraping of holes in the plaster partition , when there was one , * THE YANGTZE VALLEY AND BEYOND .

		Mrs. Bishop 's chapters on Chinese Charities , on Protestant Missions , and on Opium , and the Intro - ductory and Concluding chapters , show large and judicious views founded on full knowledge ; and the work as a whole is an extremely sane contribu - tion to books on

		In Dwarf Land and
Cannibal Country	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
A. B. Lloyd	PERSON	, is a record by an enterprising young En - glish missionary of a journey across
Central Africa	LOCATION	by the Uganda-Congo route , and includes some notes of residence in
Uganda	LOCATION	and Toro .

		The title is quite misleading , as '' Dwarf Land '' and '' Can - nibal Country '' play but a small part in these pages .

		The first seven chapters might well be compressed into one ; but from Chapter VIII .

		on the book is concisely written and of decided interest as well as of considerable value .

		The author has many ad - ventures with wild beasts and men , which he nar - rates modestly and well , in some of which a bicycle figures prominently . ''

		A bicycle which had been sent to me during my stay in
Uganda	LOCATION	was constantly used by me in taking my journeys abroad , and often I have had most exciting times when on the wheel .

		One morning I started off to visit a village some few miles away from the mission station .

		The road was well cultivated and about 5 feet wide .

		It was , in fact , the main road leading to
Uganda	LOCATION	.

		I had reached the top of a long hill , and on the other side was a gentle slope into the valley beyond ; I knew the road well , having often passed that way , and I therefore prepared myself for a ' coast . '

		Near the foot of the hill was a slight turn in the road , and as I approached it I put my feet again on the pedals .

		I was going at a great speed , and as I rounded the cor - ner an awful sight met my gaze ; not twenty yards in front there lay in the centre of the path a huge lion , with head down upon his paws , facing the direction from which I was coming .

		It was impossible for me to stop the machine , the speed was too great .

		To the left of the path was a high wall of rock towering some twenty feet above my head ; on the right was a steep incline down , down , down , for 100 feet to a river .

		I had scarcely a second to take in the situation , and to make up my mind as to what course of action to pursue .

		It was a critical moment .

		What could I do ?

		To turn to the right down the steep incline would have meant almost certain destruction ; to attempt to stop , even if success - ful , would have meant pulling up at the entrance to the jaws of the King of the Forest .

		I therefore did the only thing that was possible , I rang my bell , and shouted at the top of my voice , then let the bike ' go at its topmost speed .

		As I shot into view , the lion raised his huge shaggy head , and seeing this unearthly creature come racing towards him making so strange a cry , lifted up his voice and gave forth a most blood - curdling yelp .

		The apparition was too much even for him , and when I was about five yards from him he leapt onto the right side of the path , and I had just
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 room to scramble past him .

		Once beyond , I pedalled away as I never had before , not even looking round to see what next happened to the startled lion .

		But such an experience , if it happen once , is quite enough , and I learned the lesson not to ' scorch , ' even in
Africa	LOCATION	, where there are no policemen . ''

		He traverses the great primeval forest and catches sight of pigmies , and has some intercourse with them , and on his way down the
Aruwimi River	LOCATION	he has some adventures with cannibals , perhaps the finest race of men he met . ''

		Sometimes one would see part of a limb roasting over the fire , or else in a cooking pot , boiling , while the warriors sat around watching eagerly until it was cooked .

		But still , notwithstanding the fact of there being a superstitious idea in connection with this cannibalism , there is no doubt a depraved appetite .

		I have seen the wild , exciting feast , where spirit dances and invo - cations have been the principal items , and I have seen the warriors in all soberness sit down to a ` joint of man ' in exactly the same way as they would do to a piece of forest antelope . ''

		The book is well illustrated and has useful maps . ''

		Through Unexplored
Asia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
William Jameson Reid	PERSON	, whose veracity has been sharply questioned in some quarters is a narrative of the first half of a journey made in
1894	DATE	through un - known parts of
Western China	LOCATION	and
Eastern Thibet	ORGANIZATION	, and contains interesting accounts of adventures with savage beasts and men .

		He thus describes a curious custom of the Su-Chu natives : '' On our arrival we discovered that we had come at a most inauspicious time of the year in which to hope to secure hospitable entertainment , as the native popu - lation was given up to the enormous undertaking of washing the bones of their ancestors .

		When we first saw this operation it struck us as being remarkably funny ; but it is an exceedingly serious matter to the natives themselves , and is a custom pretty generally existing among the tribes of
Western China	LOCATION	and Thibet .

		For many centuries it has been an established rule among them once a year to exhume the bones of their ancestors and wash them .

		This annual washing usually lasts for a period of two or three weeks , or even a month , and is a function attended with much ceremo - nious pomp and religious devotion .

		Huge pots of water are placed beside the graves , and one by one the bones are taken out , and carefully scoured , and then tenderly consigned to their resting-place once more .

		These bones are also looked upon as having a high market - value , it being considered a mark of great esteem among the members of the tribe to be the proud possessor of the largest ' bonery , ' so that the trading and bartering of them for other objects forms a considerable industry .

		They are frequently seized upon by creditors for debt , when at once the unfortunate debtor is shunned by the rest of the tribe , and is suffered to remain in disgrace until he shall have redeemed them . ''

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	claims to have been the first to explore the remains of an ancient civilization near
Hissik Karpo	PERSON	, Thibet , but his report is very meagre .

		The author 's style is simple , direct , and forcible , though we miss the romantic touch which gives glamour to travels .

		The work is furnished with a number of illustrations and several maps . ''

		The Real Malay , '' by Sir
F. A. Swettenham	PERSON	, is an intimate study by a British resident of native life in the
Malay Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		The atmosphere and color of the semi-barbaric country are well depicted .

		We have a series of realistic etchings of the land and its inhabitants , animal and human , and the episodes are clearly and vividly drawn .

		He thus remarks on the difficulty of understanding the
Ori	PERSON	- ental character , and on the lack of individuality in the inhabitants of the Far East . ''

		One who is the outcome of Western civilization and Christian teaching , could hardly expect to understand the peculiarities of an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	character , the product of generations of Muhammadan or Hindu ancestors .

		But if you live in the East for years if you make yourself perfectly familiar with the language , litera - ture , customs , prejudices , and superstitions of the peo - ple ; if you lie on the same floor with them , eat out of the same dish , fight with them and against them , join in their sorrows and their joys , and at last win their regard then the reading of their characters is no longer an impossible task , and you will find that be - tween one
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and another there is a much greater similarity than there is between two Westerns , even though they be of the same nationality .

		There are good and bad , energetic and lazy , but you will hardly ever meet those complex products of Western civiliza - tion whose characters are subordinated to the state of their nerves , and those to the season of the year , the surroundings of the moment , politics , the money market , and a thousand things of which the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	is blissfully unconscious . ''

		The introductory chapter on the English method of expansion in the
Peninsula	LOCATION	ought to be of interest to Americans .

		The book has no map , illustrations , or index .

		The latest book from the prolific pen of the late Mr.
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	is entitled '' In
India	LOCATION	. ''

		In this volume he writes with his usual vigor and as - surance , and gives in his brisk and vivid way an impressionist sketch of
India	LOCATION	, political , social , and industrial .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	draws often with too hard and heavy a stroke ; however in this picture of ele - phant travel we see him at his best : '' The elephant knows .

		When the mahout wants to get on her neck , she takes him on her trunk and bends it till he can walk up her forehead .

		When you want to get on to her back , she lets down a hind-foot to make one step , and curls up her tail to make another .

		She knows that a branch she can walk under will sweep you off her back ; therefore she goes round , or , if that is not possible , pushes down the tree with her trunk as gently as you put down a teacup .

		At every ford she tries the bottom , at every bridge she tries the planks : she knows better than you do how much she weighs and what will bear her .

		Jerk , jerk , jerk she see-saws you at every step , for you are sitting on a blanket just atop of her shoulder .

		Now and again the mahout ad - dresses her in a language , banded down from father to children , that only mahouts and elephants understand , or smites her over the head with a heavy , iron-hooked ankus .

		It falls with a dull thud on her hairy forehead ; it would crack your skull like an egg-shell , but it hurts the elephant as a dead leaf would hurt you .

		Behind her ear you see a crevasse of raw flesh in the armour - 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, plating of hide : that wound is kept open , and through it only can she be made to feel .

		She just tramples on , now tilted almost onto her head , now all but standing on her tail ; over the shallow rivers , along the rutted cart - tracks , till the sun begins to bake and the line of hills in front changes from a wash of blue to a clearcut saw-edge of shaded greens and browns . ''

		Mr.
John W. Bookwalter	PERSON	, in ''
Siberia	LOCATION	and Cen - tral
Asia	LOCATION	, '' gives us some modest letters of travel profusely illustrated from admirable photographs .

		He journeys into
Siberia	LOCATION	as far as
Tomsk	LOCATION	by the Trans-Siberian Railway , and into
Central Asia	LOCATION	as far as
Samarkand	LOCATION	by the Trans-Caspian railway . ''

		Great as will be the effect upon the world of the opening of the Trans-Siberian railway system a fact that is generally recognized , the Trans-Caspian rail - way system , when completed , will be productive of re - sults even far more important in their political and commercial consequences .

		There is a branch of the Trans-Caspian railway now completed , some 250 miles in .

		length and running southward to Mervand to
Kushk	LOCATION	, on the very borders of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		It is being quietly extended to
Herat	LOCATION	, and it will , when completed , give
Russia	LOCATION	practical control of
Northwestern Afghanistan	LOCATION	, as
Herat	LOCATION	is the key to that country .

		These lines , when in operation , will thus obviously give
Russia	LOCATION	a control - ing influence in
Persia	LOCATION	and
Northwestern Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		A branch also of the main stem of the Trans-Caspian line is being built from
Samarkand	LOCATION	through Ferghan , in the direction of Kokand and
Kashgar	LOCATION	, in the
Pamirs	LOCATION	, almost in sight of the northern border of
India	LOCATION	.

		This line in time will , no doubt , be extended into Chinese Turkestan , and perhaps into the very center of
China	LOCATION	itself , bringing thus this great and populous country into communication with
Europe	LOCATION	, even more directly than by the way of the Trans-Siberian railway line . ''

		The author gives a very glowing account of the de - velopment of Northern and
Central Asia	LOCATION	under Rus - sian auspices , and the account seems as accurate as we ought to expect from the passing traveller . ''

		Two Years in
Palestine	LOCATION	and
Syria	LOCATION	, '' by Mar - garet
Thomas	PERSON	, is a fresh and pleasantly written de - scription , to which the colored illustrations add much embellishment .

		The account of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and its environs is specially full and good . ''

		Jerusalem has neither street lamps , policemen , post - men , nor newspapers ; people who go out at night are ordered to carry lanterns under a heavy penalty .

		The keeping of three successive
Sundays Mohammedan	PERSON	,
Jewish	LOCATION	, Christian leads to much loss of time , for the lazily-disposed observe all three ... Night in the Holy Land is a thing to be remembered .

		The air is soft and balmy , neither hot nor cold ; ' the sun , setting like a globe of amber , tinges the top of the blue vapor which ever hangs over the
Moabite Mountains	LOCATION	and Dead Sea with iridiscent tints .

		The sky is literally powdered with stars , not gleaming as they do on a frosty night in the North , but soft and dreamy . '' ''

		The American in
Holland	LOCATION	, '' by the Rev.
W. E. Griffis	PERSON	, is a fairly readable description of various trips in all parts of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		He visits American friends who have spent years in
Holland	LOCATION	, living at the Hague in

		He is in love with Dutch civilization .

		It is delightful to his eyes '' to find no spoiling of scenery by advertise - ments .

		The black-letter printing of this book is very refreshing to the eye .

		There is no excuse for the iniquity of thin type on highly glazed paper , for though illustrations may be on plate paper , they should be , as in this book , on separate pages , and so not interfere with a continuous text . ''

		`` The Holy Land , from
Landau	LOCATION	, Saddle , and Palanquin , '' by Mr.
W. B. Lent	PERSON	, is thoroughly re - ligious and biblical ; but the sentiment is often com - monplace and the description quite cursory .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Bismarck ^ r * J ames
Wycliffe Headlam	PERSON	's new and hi * life of
Bismarck	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- adds a king thtorie * .

		somewhat belated volume to the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series .

		The delay has been well utilized , however , for this volume is a much more valuable monograph than is ordinarily furnished by the series .

		The history of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's earlier life , and of his labors in the formation of the German Empire , up to the close of the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian war , brings out nothing new , so that any criticism must occupy itself with the style rather than the matter of this portion .

		Briefly , the author has done his work exceedingly well .

		Bismarck 's
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 purposes , and the means by which they were exe - cuted , are stated simply and clearly , without any attempt at detailed analysis of diplomatic manoeu - vres , and notably without any wearisome effort at character painting .

		Yet the character of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	is made manifest in his official acts and in the mo - tives which inspired them .

		The novelty of Mr.
Headlam	PERSON	's work lies in his treatment of the career of
Bismarck	PERSON	in his later labors as Chancellor of the German Empire , for here the author rejects in a measure the opinions held by
Von Sybel	ORGANIZATION	and other authors and follows more nearly modern German criticism ; a criticism which is becoming more schol - arly as it becomes less contemporary .

		Bismarck 's refusal to identify himself with any political party , and his constant shifting for support from one to another of the parties of the
Reichstag	LOCATION	, is attributed by the author to the earnest conviction that , as Chancellor , he could not become a party leader .

		To him the Emperor was still ruler '' by grace of God , '' limited in some degree in the exercise of his kingly power , but still the centre and sun of all governmental activity .

		He ,
Bismarck	PERSON	, was merely the Emperor 's representative , chosen personally by the Emperor , and not in any way responsible to the authority of votes .

		The wisdom or unwisdom of measures was , in the end , purely a matter for exec - utive decision , and freedom of decision could not be guaranteed if the Chancellor should ever become a party leader .

		Mr.
Headlam	PERSON	maintains in fact that it was neither love of power , nor disdain of political parties , nor lack of principle that kept
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck from adopting a partisan position , but pri - marily rather the desire to preserve for the mon - archy the right , always strongly manifested in the Prussian state , of exercising a controlling influence in legislation and in government .

		Possibly this is more didactically stated than is warranted by the author 's language , but the impression is given , nev - ertheless , and as such , furnishes a clearer thread of central purpose for
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's political activities than is customarily credited to him .

		The book con - tains many excellent illustrations and a map of
Germany	LOCATION	showing the changes made in
1866	DATE	.

		The new method There has been of recent years a of teaching tendency to substitute the study of Economics .

		economic history , correlated with the general facts of political and social development , for the older-fashioned study of theoretical economics in our secondary schools .

		We have doubted the wis - dom of this tendency , for elementary economic the - ory has always seemed to us to offer an almost ideal form of mental discipline for young people from sixteen to twenty years of age .

		In the hands of the right sort of teachers it is equal in value to geometry , the mechanical section of physics , and the structural study of a foreign language .

		We have feared that the substitution in question might mean a substitution of mnemonic cram for enforced intellectual self-activity .

		But we are bound to say that this fear is almost dispelled in the presence of such a book as Mr.
Henry W. Thurston	PERSON	's recent '' Economics and Industrial History for Secondary Schools '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is no lack of facts in Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	's presentation of the subject , but there is also no lack of stimulus for the best type .

		of intellectual exertion .

		The exercises planned by the author are so ingenious , and the questions he sets the students so searching , that it would be difficult to devise a more valuable disci - pline than a student would gain from the conscien - tious following of the plan of work here prescribed .

		It means , however , a good reference library to - gether with freedom in its use , an enthusiastic instructor , and a body of students willing to depart widely from their ordinary methods of learning school lessons .

		Given these conditions , we know of no other text book as good for its purpose as the one now before us .

		It is clear in its exposition , yet does not smooth away all the difficulties ; it pre - sents many facts of industrial history , yet does not preclude the necessity of digging out many more .

		It is , moreover , up to date , and based upon the best authorities .

		In fact , we are acquainted with no other elementary book which thus brings within the reach of beginners the conclusions of
Seebohm	PERSON	and
Cunningham	PERSON	, of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	and
Ashley	PERSON	, of
Weeden	ORGANIZATION	and
Wright	PERSON	.

		The work has three parts .

		The first of these offers a series of inductive exercises in the economic life that surrounds us .

		The second and most considerable recounts the economic history of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The third deals with the elements of economic theory , and for this the other two sections afford admirable preparation .

		We rec - ommend the book most cordially to all who are seeking this particular sort of solution of the prob - lem of teaching economics , while those who still adhere to the more orthodox method will at least find in the book a valuable adjunct to their work . ''

		The Redemption of
Africa	LOCATION	, '' a rather ambitious work , in two vol - umes -LRB- p R Reyell Q ^ ig another one of the ripened fruits of the
Chicago Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	, Mr.
F. P. Noble	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on
Africa	LOCATION	, set before himself the task of preparing `` A Story of Civilization '' in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The entire work is broken into three books .

		The first discusses `` The Ancient and Mediaeval Preparation , '' the second '' The Religious Partition , '' and the third book , '' The Expansion of Missions . ''

		The author begins with
Abraham	PERSON	's sojourn in the land of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and attempts to follow every re - ligious influence on that continent of any import - ance from that day down to modern times .

		The first book is the least satisfactory of all , especially in its earlier chapters , in that it involves too many assumptions . ''

		The Religious Partition '' is a well - considered and tersely-stated estimate of the part which each of the great religious bodies of the church has had in the evangelization of that dark continent .

		This estimate is based on the works of the best and most recent writers on the various The religious redemption of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, phases of the civilizing and evangelizing forces at work in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The third book is a still hroader view of the whole question .

		It presents a condensed yet very readable description of the re - ligious and educational work carried on by all bodies of Christians among the negroes of the South and in the Antilles , and the part which they must take sooner or later in the evangelization of the home-land of their ancestors .

		The importance of educational , medical , and literary training is also emphasized by the results already achieved on these lines , particularly in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		One of the most useful features of this work is the large body of maps , charts , and tables .

		The educational sta - tistics include colleges and universities , theolog - ical seminaries and training-schools , boarding and high schools , industrial and medical schools and kindergartens .

		The literary table presents the name of the language and the location where the whole or a part of the Bible is now in circulation ; also statistics of African languages and peoples possess - ing Bible-versions .

		Among the numerous remaining statistics we note especially the '' Directory of Agen - cies for the Christianization of African Peoples in
Africa	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, the Antilles , and
Madagascar	LOCATION	, '' the authorities used in the compilation of the work , also indexes of persons , places , societies , and sub - jects .

		This work is and for some time must be a valuable birds-eye view of all modern attempts to civilize and evangelize the untold millions of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

Victor Hugo	PERSON	, Musset ,

		In the volume entitled '' The Literary Reminiscences of
Edward Grenier	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , translated by Mrs.
Abel Bam	PERSON	, there is the glowing enthusiasm of one who remembers with a sort of reverent fidelity , the looks and accents of the deities of his youth .


M. Grenier	PERSON	, has written with an easy abandon to the impres - sions that are now but memories , and very much of the fervor of his personal devotions or his personal dislike gives color to the pages .

		The ready gar - rulity that should flow without reserve in such reminiscences is natural to him , and the reader can not question either his veracity or his sincerity .


M. Grenier	PERSON	had some successes as a poet himself , and the naivete with which he tells of them gives a piquant relish to his account of the doings and say - ings of others whose larger success gave him no rankling jealousy , but only the warm appreciation of a kindred spirit in love with art , humanity , and the world .

		A broad , genial charity sweetens every unpleasant incident to which his pen must make record , and the tone of intellectual and moral health and soundness is finely unmistakable .

		The pleasure with which he told Me ` rime'e of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's praise of him is charmingly fresh in his memory of it , and the same happiness beams again in his telling of a like pleasure in quoting Ary
Sheffer	PERSON	's praise to
Delacroix	LOCATION	, and in telling him of what
Goethe	PERSON	had written of his lithographs for Stappf er 's translation of '' Faust . ''

		Altogether the book is a pleasing intro - duction to a sort of personal acquaintance with a host of writers , artists , and politicians , who pass before the reader in splendid procession .


M. Grenier	PERSON	does not attempt to fix the rank of any of them , merely telling his little stories of them as he knew them , bidding us share
Mussett	PERSON	's passion , lament the '' subtle harmony in the three words , fame , genius , misfortune , '' with
Lamartine	PERSON	, and pass on to wait for a casual word from
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	.

		One or two of the later volumes of
Bruce	PERSON	, and other the FamoU8 Scots '' series -LRB- im - famous Scots .

		_ .

		, .

		V ported by ocribner -RRB- are less inter - esting than their predecessors , sometimes because the best subjects have been already handled , and sometimes for another reason .

		In the case of the volume on
Robert Bruce	PERSON	, the necessity of detailing many matters of history makes the biography of the thinnest .

		There is no more famous Scot than
Robert Bruce	PERSON	: he is the knightly hero of
Scotland	LOCATION	, even more than Sir
William Wallace	PERSON	.

		But he lived centuries ago , at a time of which the history is not clearly understood in all details .

		Mr.
Murison	PERSON	, then , here as in his volume on
Wallace	PERSON	, has to spend a good part of his book in explanation and contro - versy .

		The result is not entertaining although it has value for purposes of information .

		The vol - ume on
Alexander Melville	PERSON	, by Mr.
William Mor	PERSON	- ison , has something of the same drawback .

		Mel - ville was a typical figure , if not a man of remark - able character ; and it is proper that he should be represented in any general group of Scotch worthies .

		On the other hand , his life is hard to write and not very easy to read .

		He had so much to do with the public affairs of his time , that one must spend too much space in recounting the stages in a struggle of which the results only are clearly remembered .

		Melville was the representative of Scottish Presby - terianism as against King James the Sixth of
Scot	PERSON	- land and the
First of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was beaten in the great cause to which he devoted his life , but it was through him and many lesser men like him that the cause itself was victorious .

John Gray M'Kendrick	PERSON	, M.D. Of the great French physiol - ogist to whom we owe our present knowledge of the pancreatic functions , the facts concerning his pro- fessional life are made sufficiently clear , and in so far his life is to be followed with interest ; but after a brief insight into his private and personal affairs granted at the outset of the book , the rest is per - mitted to remain undisclosed .

		THE DIAL to read the work through the man , and the book leaves a sense of incompleteness .

		Of the German whose investigations in optics and acoustics were epoch-making , there is here the opportunity to read of what it was he stood for , to his friends as well as to the scientific world .

		But we miss all reference to the attack upon Darwinism which is still a matter of surprise to those who think with
Haeckel	PERSON	, and are hardly to be consoled by such a phrase as '' ... the Darwinian hypothesis , with which
Helmholtz	PERSON	often expressed his general agreement . ''

		Both books give portraits of the men of whom they treat , as frontispieces , and the serene majesty of their countenances brings forth the reflection that no - where has man found the expression of intellectual development more complete than in the faces of the modern men of science .

		It is because they are in constant pursuit of nothing less than Truth ?

		There is much diversity of interest Likings '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which our notice has been too long delayed .

		The dozen or more papers that make up the volume are mostly reprinted from the literary periodicals -LRB- THE DIAL among others -RRB- , although two of them did their previous public duty as lectures .

		These two are discussions of ''
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's Services to American History '' and ''
Renaissance Pictures	ORGANIZATION	in
Browning	PERSON	's Poetry . ''

		One paper is a study in `` the literary time-spirit , '' as illustrated by
Herr BjOrnson	PERSON	,
M. Daudet	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	three writers who assuredly were never before grouped together , yet who have enough in common to jus - tify the present classification .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	ventures , in another paper , to discuss the perilous subject of '' The Democratic and Aristocratic in Literature , '' and escapes the extravagance which usually over - takes those who essay this theme .

		A group of three short papers on aspects of '' Old English Poetry '' betrays both the scholarly student and the appre - ciative reader . ''

		Phases of Fiction '' affords a col - lective title for four brief essays .


Brownell	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	are made the subjects of special studies .

		Altogether , there is much vigorous and sensible criticism , expressed in admirable English , in this volume .

		Barring the occasional allusions to books that are fast sinking into forgetfulness , the matter which Mr.
Burton	PERSON	offers is worth preservation , and speaks well for the critical intelligence of the writer .

		Sixth edition '' in this case means a careful and thorough revision in the light of the most recent learning , of the entire subject , and the additions are both many and noteworthy .

		First published in
1878	DATE	, the work was a pioneer of its kind and it re - mains to-day the most authoritative and most inclu - sive , covering the plate of churches , colleges , and private owners alike .

		Considerations of the marks of many guilds of silversmiths , situated in many towns widely removed , are followed by lists of year marks , hall marks of all kinds , and the various stamps set in the finished work from the beginning of the practice in the
early fifteenth century	DATE	.

		The vexed question of the statutory origin of the year marks is not yet settled , though the hope is still strong among antiquaries that archival researches now going on will cast light upon the problem .

		The illustrations are excellent and profuse , and the vol - ume , a crown octavo , is an excellent specimen of book making .

		An earlier edition of the same book has appeared in
America	LOCATION	, somewhat abridged , and without authorization .

		In '' Great
Britain	LOCATION	and
Hanover	LOCATION	'' -LRB- xford Diversity Press -RRB- , Mr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	presents the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	lectures delivered by him last year in the
University of Ox	ORGANIZATION	- ford .

		While Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's attention is chiefly devoted to the international action of
Great Britain	LOCATION	as affected by Hanoverian interests , he does not fail to consider also the effect of the personal union on the home policy of the two countries .

		His analysis of the situation leads him to conclude that , in some instances , the popular outcry against the use of the union for dynastic ends , was justified , notably when , at the expense of
England	LOCATION	's true policy ,
Bremen	LOCATION	and
Verden	PERSON	were transferred from
Sweden	LOCATION	to Han - over .

		Taken all in all , however , British interests were well conserved by British statesmen , and , in the light of those duties of friendship really owed to
Hanover	LOCATION	, there was small ground for the prevailing dissatisfaction with the '' Hanoverian policy . ''

		In
Hanover	LOCATION	, on the other hand , the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, regarded with extreme favor at first , '' came very slowly , but very surely , to be recognized as having retarded an enduring association with the fortunes of the Ger - man people , and with the future to which it was looking forward . ''

		While the author disclaims any profound investigation of documentary evidence , the book is essentially the work of a scholar , written only after careful study , * and distinguished by its fairness of view .

		impartiality , nor does he ever descend into mere par - tisanship .

		A brief statement of his concerning the question of civilization involved deserves to be sup - plemented by the observation that with some persons of intelligence who would shudder at the thought of '' doing ill that good may come '' in religious matters , the same doctrine finds easy acceptance when the ends which justify the means are those of patriotism or '' civilization . ''

		The issue of `` The Day 's Work '' and '' From Sea to Sea , '' each in two volumes of the '' Outward Bound '' edition of the works of Rudyard Kipling -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , offers an opportunity , of which we can not avail our - selves at this moment , for a consideration of some of the aspects of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's later work .

		Since '' Captains Courageous , '' which was the last of the original twelve volumes of this edition , Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has written a good deal that has been variously criti - cised .

		There have been those who thought that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	had reached a parting of the ways , and had chosen the wrong road .

		We think ourselves that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's later work has the same funda - mental qualities that his earlier work had , that it lacks some of the characteristics that were apt to mar his first stories , and has gained other charac - teristics , some of which are not entirely admirable .

		Really far more interesting -LRB- or extraordinary -RRB- than an understanding of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	is the way in which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has been understood , especially in this country .

		This is one of the most instructive things in the history of literature in
America	LOCATION	.

		It may be remarked that '' From Sea to Sea '' is not illustrated from the models of Mr.
Lockwood Kip	PERSON	- ling , but from photographs of the places in question .

		Even now , with its appearance sadly belated through the author 's continued illness after the hardships of his life in
Cuba	LOCATION	, it is not a book to be lightly read or disregarded .

		Mr.
Musgrave	PERSON	was an Englishman holding
Spain	LOCATION	in high favor when he went to the island as a correspondent for a British journal , and the knowledge gained on the ground saw him within a few months fighting in the insurgent ranks .

		He bears the testimony of an eye-witness to the disinterested valor of the Cuban patriots , but he makes little prophecy for the future .

Albert Shaw	PERSON	lecturer in diplomatic history in the
Johns Hopkins Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		Carefully threading his way between the devious diplomacy of
Spain	LOCATION	and the confused par - tisan politics of the
United States	LOCATION	, he fairly ex - hausts his subject within the compass of five hundred octavo pages .

		It is safe to conclude that no future historian of
Spain	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, or the
United States	LOCATION	, can afford to neglect Dr.
Callahan	PERSON	in any of his state - ments or conclusions , which appear to be as well considered as his researches have been thorough .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It is not often that a scholar of Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	's rank is found willing to perform the drudgery incident to the annotation of an elementary English text , and teachers who come into possession of his edition of four selected books of Pope 's '' Iliad '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have much reason to be grateful .

		The introduction and notes supplied by the editor , and the pictures provided by the publisher , combine to make this edition one of un - usual value .

		In a general way , the editorial apparatus embodies the same ideas that are found in Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's edition of
Horace	LOCATION	, which we had occasion to praise about a year ago . ''

''

		The ex - tracts are usually of some length , and are so happily cho - sen as literature -LRB- aside from their illustrative function -RRB- , that the book has claimed more of our attention than we should ordinarily have given such a manual .

		In fact , the didactic part of the work has been reduced to a bare minimum , a feature which will recommend the Primer to judicious teachers and serious students .

		It is a reprint of matter from '' The Open Court '' and '' The Monist , '' and the author is essentially right in the controversy , although he seems to inject into his comments more acerbity than is strictly necessary for the sustaining of his position .

		What is likely to prove the definitive and standard library edition of
Tennyson	LOCATION	has been published in ten volumes by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It includes the '' Life , '' by the present Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	, which fills four volumes out of the ten .

		Chaste simplicity and dignity are the characteristics of this set of volumes from the mechan - ical point of view .

		The illustrations , of which each volume has at least one , are nearly all portraits in pho - togravure , and include all the familiar examples , besides some of the less familiar ones made by the camera of Mrs.
Cameron	PERSON	.

		Publishing a Book '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, is one of those small manuals put forth from time to time for the practical guidance of inexperienced writers for the press .

		It is a small volume , containing only the bare essentials .

		The directions are clearly given , and young writers who follow them will save themselves much annoyance .

		Mr.
Gold win Smith	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare : The Man '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is a rather slight essay which seeks to do what Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	attempted a few years ago upon a more elaborate scale , and what Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	makes the essential thesis of his great critical work on Shakespeare namely , to find indications of the poet 's personality in the text of his plays .

		That the essay has both critical value and charm of expression may be taken for granted .

		The article on ''
Byron	PERSON	's Influence upon Goethe , '' in this issue of THE DIAL , derives a sad interest from the death of its author , which occurred at
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illi	PERSON	- nois , the 28th of
January	DATE	.

		Miss
Anna M. Bowen	PERSON	, a woman of rare qualities of character and scholarship , held , at the age of twenty-seven , the responsible posi - tion of Dean of the Woman 's
College of Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, at which institution she was graduated in
1893	DATE	, afterwards studying at
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, and later at Leipsic and
Munich	LOCATION	.

		Some of the results of her German studies she had planned to embody in a series of articles on
Byron	PERSON	's influence on German lit - erature , of which series , now interrupted by her death , the article in this number was intended as the beginning .

New England	LOCATION	By
W. DeLOSS LOVE	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Author of `` The Fast and Thanksgiving Days of

$ 1.50	MONEY	net .

		rPHIS volume is a historical study of Indian civilization as illustrated in the life and labors of
Samson Occom	PERSON	, the Mohegan teacher , mis - sionary , hymn-writer , and statesman .

		The author , after reviewing the relation of the
New England	LOCATION	fathers to Indian civilization in the first century of our history , takes up the
work of the second century	DATE	among the Indians of southern
New England	LOCATION	, of whom
Samson Occom	PERSON	was the central figure .

		He tells the story of the hero 's youth , education as the pupil of Rev.
Eleazar Wheelock	PERSON	of
Lebanon	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, and experiences as an Indian teacher among the
Montauk	LOCATION	tribe .

		An account is then given of
Wheelock	ORGANIZATION	's Indian Charity School and the Indians who were there educated , many of whom were associates in
Occom	LOCATION	's work .

		This Mohegan was the first
New England	LOCATION	missionary sent to the
Oneida Indians	LOCATION	, and his mission thither is detailed , with that of
David Fowler	PERSON	and other Christian Indians who were the companions of
Samuel Kirk	PERSON	- land .

		The relation of
Samson Occom	PERSON	to the famous Mohegan Land Case , his experiences as a preacher in
England	LOCATION	, and his work as a hymn - writer are treated .

		The crowning honor of this Indian 's life , however , was his formation of the
Brothertown	PERSON	tribe out of the Christian Indians at Mohegan ,
Grot	PERSON	on ,
Stonington	LOCATION	,
Niantic	LOCATION	,
Farmington	LOCATION	,
Charlestown	LOCATION	,
R. I.	PERSON	, and
Montauk	LOCATION	,
L. I.	PERSON	, their emigration to the Oneida country under his leadership , and the establishment of their Indian town , which they governed under the supervision of the State of
New York	LOCATION	for half a century .

		The story follows the experiences of this `` Indian Moses '' among Indians and whites till his death in
1792	DATE	.

		It also narrates the subsequent history of the
Brothertown	PERSON	tribe to the present time , giving an account of their removal to
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and participation in the award of nearly
two million dollars	MONEY	recently made to the
New York Indians	LOCATION	in their claim against the
United States	LOCATION	.

Eastern North America	LOCATION	; while its author 's phenomenal success in photographing birds in Nature not only lends to the illustrations the charm of realism , but makes the book a record of surprising achieve - ments with the camera .

		Several of these illustrations have been described by experts as '' the most remarkable photographs of wild life we have ever seen . ''

		The book is practical as well as descriptive , and in the opening chapters the questions of camera , lens , plates , blinds , decoys , and other pertinent matters are fully discussed , making the work an admirable guide for the camera hunter , who can not but be stimulated by its author 's enthu - siasm and convincing demonstration of the methods he recommends .

		It is of course unnecessary to speak of the author 's high standing as an ornithologist , his '' Handbook of Birds '' and '' Bird-Life '' having taken a leading place among books upon birds .

Spring	DATE	pub - lication , but the publishers are glad to announce that
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's health has per - mitted his completing it and that the American edition is now ready .

		It is a sombre but tremendously powerful novel touching upon many tragedies and problems of life in the
Russia	LOCATION	of to-day .

		It shows the genius of ``
Anna Karenina	PERSON	'' blend - ed with a more mature comprehension of human life and character .

		The '' Great Master of the North '' has written in '' Resurrection '' a harrowing yet absorbing story with all his old fervor , and with a deeper and more searching spiritual understanding .

		The theme is that of a woman 's life weighed down and well nigh extinguished by the most terrible mis - fortunes and tragedies , but finally , through the power of love , resurrected and made new .

		Count Tolstoy 's determination to write no more fiction has been overcome by his de - sire to assist the Doukhobors in their exodus from their grievous oppression in
Russia	LOCATION	to the provinces of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Five years ago he wrote the synopsis of this novel , which he then laid aside , but has since taken up and completed .

		It is published simultaneously in
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, and the pro- ceeds will be devoted to settling the Doukhobors in their Canadian home .

		A CELEBRATED CRITIC HAS SAID OF IT : `` There is little in this noble and yet heart-breaking work to explain the prudery of those who wanted to take great liberties with the original .

		Here and there a few lines might with advantage be omitted .

		But the purpose of the great author is so manifestly pure , and the form in which he has cast his thought is so impeccable , that only the inde - cent could take umbrage . '

		Resurrection ' will rank with the most vital and beautiful studies of our poor humanity the world has seen . ''

		THE HOUSE OF MOLIERE .

		The destruction by fire of the Theatre-Fran - cais , on the eighth of this month , is one of those calamities which appeal with overwhelm - ing force to the sympathies of the small but world-wide public of cultivated people .

		To the large general public , no doubt , which weighs disasters chiefly by the number of human lives concerned , such an event is merely the loss of an interesting building , to be deplored for a brief space and then forgotten .

		But to the comparative few who know for what the
Maison de Moliere	ORGANIZATION	has stood in the development of dramatic art and the history of human intelli - gence , the thought of its destruction , together with that of its priceless historical and artistic contents , is one of those intolerable oppressions that the mind refuses to bear all at once , that have to be gradually realized as one detail after another , whether derived from closet-study or from intimate personal association , comes back to the memory , to be reviewed in the new light of the knowledge that all these things are now of the past indeed .

		It seems that the exterior of the building may yet be preserved ; it seems also that some of the treasures of painting and sculpture were rescued from the flames ; but no reconstruction of the famous edifice , no recon - stitution of its collections , can ever again make it what it was , or offer to the twentieth-century pilgrim of culture such a shrine , hallowed by such relics , as the old building offered to the pilgrim of the nineteenth .

		The precursors of the Theatre-Francais are to be found in the Hotel de Bourgogne of
1548	DATE	, the Hotel du Petit-Bourbon of
1677	DATE	, the early seventeenth century Theatre du Marais and salles de spectacle of the Palais - Royal .

		Two or three other theatres had a brief vogue dur - ing the
seventeenth century	DATE	, but it was not until the year
1680	DATE	that the action was taken which determines the beginnings of the The - atre-Fransais in the strict sense .

		In that year the actors of the
Marais	PERSON	and the
Bourgogne	PERSON	joined forces , and were united by royal decree into the company of the Comedie-Fran9aise , which still survives , after a corporate existence of over two centuries , almost the only institu - tion of the Ancien Regime that was not swept away by the Revolution .

		It is to be noted that 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	,
Moliere	PERSON	and his fellow-players , after the period of their strolling apprenticeship to the stage , came to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1658	DATE	, and played at the
Petit	LOCATION	- Bourbon and the Palais-Royal .

		Moliere died in
1673	DATE	, and after his death his companions united with the
Marais	PERSON	troupe , thus joining the tradi - tion of Moliere with the tradition of Corneille .

		The tradition of
Racine	LOCATION	was added by the fusion with the Bourgogne troupe , and thus , in
1680	DATE	, the Comedie-Fran9aise came into its inherit - ance of the three great dramatists , their tradi - tions , their prestige , and their fame .

		How that inheritance has been handed down to our own time may be illustrated by the following quo - tation from M. Sarcey : '' Do you know that between Got and Moliere there are only seven or eight names of great actors ?

		We have , so to speak , only to stretch out our hand to be able , across several generations , to find the first
Mascarille	PERSON	.

		Got played a long time with Mon - rose , who had seen
Dazincourt	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dazincourt appeared young by the side of
Preville	LOCATION	, already old .

		Preville had known
Poisson	PERSON	, who is the last link of the chain up to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this way the tradition has been preserved alive from one great actor to another . ''

		Now and then an innovation has been made in the interpretation of some character of the classical drama ; when such an innovation has won the approval of the judicious , it has been adopted , and has fur - nished the starting-point for a new tradition .

		During the century or more that followed its foundation , the Comedie-Fran ^ aise occupied many homes the Palais-Royal , the Tuileries , the
Odeon	LOCATION	, and others .

		It was at the Odeon that the Revolution overtook the players , inter - rupted their activities , and threw them for a time into prison .

		When they were released , they took possession of the building in the
Rue Richelieu	LOCATION	that they have occupied ever since , and assumed the name of Theatre - Fran9ais changed temporarily , in order to follow the fashion of the hour , to Theatre de la Repub - lique .

		Into the building thus occupied , the lares and penates of the historical organization were gathered , and the collection of works of art and historical records has continued to accumu - late ever since .

		It is this collection , together with the venerable building which housed it , which was in great measure destroyed the other day , to the irreparable loss of mankind .

		It is only when one thinks of all that the Comedie-Fran9aise has meant for the history of dramatic art that one can realize what is meant by the destruction of the material em - bodiments of that history .

		With this institu - tion are inseparably interwoven the seventeenth - century glories of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Corneille	LOCATION	, and Ra - cine , the eighteenth-century triumphs of
Mari	PERSON	- vaux ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and Beaumarchais , the nine - teenth-century renown of Hugo ,
Dumas	PERSON	, and
Augier	PERSON	.

		Nor does the roll of its great actors evanescent though the fame of the player be , as compared with that of the writer sound in our modern ears with a greatly inferior rever - beration .


Talma	PERSON	, Mars , and
Rachel	PERSON	are still names with which to conjure , and we doubt not that a century hence such names as Got , Coquelin , and
Bernhardt	PERSON	will be something more than dead memories of a forgotten past .

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, in the following ima - ginary comparison , gives us some notion of what an institution like the Comedie-Fran ^ aise must mean to the national consciousness of a people : '' To find any parallel for the career of the Comedie-Fran < jaise in our language and literature we should have to rely on the imag - ination .

		If the Globe Theatre had been worth - ily maintained from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death until now ; if the best works of
Shirley	PERSON	and
Congreve	PERSON	and
Farquhar	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	had been written for it ; if
Barton Booth	LOCATION	and
Gar	PERSON	- rick and
Siddons	PERSON	and
Kemble	PERSON	and
Kean	PERSON	had appeared on its stage ; if our memory connected it with every masterpiece of dramatic writing and acting then we might form some idea of the position held in
Paris	LOCATION	by the
Comedie	LOCATION	- Fran9aise . ''

		Some idea , yes , but even then a very inadequate one , for the drama , in spite of the great Elizabethans , is not nearly as import - ant a part of our literature as it is of the French , and by just that difference would our imaginary
Comedie	ORGANIZATION	- Anglaise fall short of being what its real French prototype has been and will continue to be , even amid its strange new twentieth-century surroundings .

		The foreign sojourner in
Paris	LOCATION	, if possessed of the capacity for enjoying the finer sort of art , has always found his way upon an early occasion to the
House of Moliere	ORGANIZATION	in the
Rue de Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	.

		He may have gone to other play-houses as a matter of curiosity , but for steady enjoyment he has soon settled down to the Fran9ais , and , however few his Parisian evenings , he has , if well-advised , spent the greater number of them at the one place where the fine fleur of French civilization is at its best .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has written charm - ingly of the charm of the place , '' the charm that one never ceases to feel , however often one may sit beneath the classic , dusky dome . ''

		What he writes is so exactly expressive of the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 feelings of everyone who is susceptible to the more subtle forms of artistic appeal that we may fitly reproduce his further reflections upon the subject : '' The Theatre-Fran cais has had the good fortune to be able to allow its tradi - tions to accumulate .

		They have been pre - served , transmitted , respected , cherished , un - til at last they form the very atmosphere , the vital air , of the establishment .

		A stranger feels their superior influence the first time he sees the great curtain go up ; he feels that he is in a theatre that is not as other theatres are .

		It is not only better , it is different .

		It has a peculiar affection something consecrated , historical , academic .

		This impression is deli - cious , and he watches the performance in a sort of tranquil ecstasy .

		Never has he seen anything so smooth and harmonious , so artis - tic and complete .

		He has heard all his life of attention to detail , and now , for the first time , he sees something that deserves that name .

		He sees dramatic effort refined to a point with which the English stage is unac - quainted ... He is in an ideal and exem - plary world a world that has managed to attain all the felicities that the world we live in misses .

		The people do the things that we should like to do ; they are gifted as we should like to be ; they have mastered the accom - plishments that we have had to give up . ''

		The contrast offered by this exhibition of dramatic art taken seriously to the best that the En - glishman or American sees upon the stage at home is very startling , and is , considered merely as an object lesson , of prime importance .

		The sensational devices of our own theatres , their tawdry decorations and their crude stage management , the poses and affectations of our actors , the reliance of our actresses upon the gowns which distract an audience from proper attention to the action all these things ap - pear in their true light after one has seen half a dozen performances in the famous French theatre .

		One used to think them highly ef - fective , knowing nothing better ; one now dis - covers that they appertain to a primitive form of art , and contemplates with dismay the pros - pect of returning home , and having to fall back upon them for theatrical entertainment .

		The experience is nothing less than a revela - tion , an opening - of eyes hitherto blind , and we may at least hope that when the revelation shall have come to a sufficient number of Americans , they may be able to create the de - mand requisite for the production and support of genuine dramatic art .

		Nor will this inspira - tion be lacking , despite the loss of the histori - cal play-house , for the spirit which made it what it has been must still survive , and we have no fear that the Comedie-FranQaise , in whatever new home it may select for itself , will fail to carry on into the coming century the high artistic ideals that it has upheld dur - ing the century now so nearly at an end .

		THE REALITY OF THE IDEAL .

		It seems paradoxical , yet it is true , that life shows wholly life-like only in the interpretations of art .

		Nor is it the forms and the manner , inaptly styled realistic , but rather the less circumstantial reports of ideal art , that reveal it thus fully .

		Let us select from this art any group of people , either from a novel , a dramatic poem , or a painting , and we shall find that they awaken a consciousness of life in us that is much wider than their own range of time and action .

		Suppose we take two perfectly familiar figures from the art which stands midway between the painting and the novel .

		What is it in the fig - ures of lago and Othello that makes them stand out in such splendid relief from the background of life and of the art that circumstantially repeats it ?

		No real people could give so full a report of the ener - gies that gather and play around these storm-centres of life , not even those whose measure would most nearly correspond to these heroic proportions .

		But would not the real people have the expression that belonged to the emotions and thoughts that were active within , and should we not be able to read what was going on there as well as , or better than , we can read it in the poem , or in any art expression that might be given it ?

		Certainly not .

		No doubt the real people would show something of what they thought and felt , but not enough to overcome and dominate the impression of what was external and mere scenic effect .

		Even if by some altogether unlikely chance the circumstance should so perfectly fit the thoughts and feelings that were active , as to show all that they were , the natures which gave them exercise would be too limited in their capaci - ties to make them a revelation of life at large .

		It is only when art arranges and selects and shapes life , to make it fit some ideal conception thereof , that it shoves thus complete and whole .

		Our ideas of what life is are formed of many ex - periences and impressions .

		Memory saves from each some essential expression , and the rest becomes mere shadowy background or is quite forgotten .

		Out of the sum of these '' survivals of the fittest '' we get a general notion of how life would look if we could see it complete in any one of its expres - sions ; that is , if the imperfect , badly shaped , and fragmentary forms in which love and envy and de - sire and hate have appeared to us in life could be shown in forms that would compass all that they 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, are .

		The art , then , whose forms are such as com - prehend fully , to its potential limits , the life that is its subject , will be more life-like than life itself , an interpreter and revealer of it even to those who know it best .

		But life-likeness in a work of art not only de - pends upon a conception and terms that comprehend the whole range of its kind of experiences , the work must be the expression as well of a mind working in a correspondingly comprehensive way .

		Its terms must not only release life from the narrow bounds of the actual , but they must also be the expression of artistic perceptions as wide in their range as that of the life out of which the conception has been formed .

		Now , perception and feeling reach both ways , and every state of mind and every act is de - termined by negative as well as by positive compul - sions .

		This needs not to be proved , for experience everywhere witnesses to it .

		It is shown in the equally imperative `` do '' and `` do not '' of every civil , moral , and religious code , in the divergent percep - tions and sentiments of good and evil that determine all conduct , in every fear that waits upon every hope , in every hope that waits upon every fear .

		A work of art , then , must be the product of the artist 's perceptions and feelings , on both sides of his subject , if it is to be a full expression of his mind about it .

		In lago , evil shows all real and human , without a single incompetence or failure , as of pointed ear or cloven hoof , because a great ap - preciation of what he is not , worked together and equally with a great hatred and a clear intellectual perception of what he is , in creating him .

		Othello is thus completely convincing , because the mind that conceived his joy had an equal perception of the anguish that waited upon it , and the mind that conceived '' the pity of it '' conceived it in such moving terms because it realized the opposite po - tentialities of the soul with the same full and pas - sionate appreciation .

		The artist has here confessed himself , and in large , from limit to limit , disclosing the whole vast reach of his thought and feeling from the Olympian peak of his desire to the black depth which limits his perception of related evil .

		The ideal is thus the only real art , because it alone disengages life from its encumbrances , its ac - cidents of time and place and scene ; because it alone joins together the broken pieces that show in its single incidents and events , and presents them in an intelligible and organic whole .

		And not only by its fuller revelation of life is it more real than the art that is miscalled so , or even than life itself , but also because the spirit that has created it has infused a full measure of its own life into the ex - pression it has given the other .

		And , after all , it is this that has entered into it , this virtue , this pas - sion of the heart and brain that have conceived it , that makes it moving .

		This it is that , like the quiver in a voice , plays on the heart-strings .

		This is the breath of life , to its cold and perfect forms .

		LiiGHT ON LINCOLN 'S The distinctive value of
Miss Tarbell 's Life of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	lies in the fact that it is to some extent based on independent research , and con - tains a considerable amount of new and inter - esting information .

		This information is the fruit of the systematic and extensive inquiries instituted in
1894	DATE	by the proprietors of '' Mc - Clure 's Magazine , '' with a view to securing , ere it was too late , such reminiscences of Lin - coln 's then surviving contemporaries as were worth preserving .

		As the enterprise , aside from its commercial character , was rightly felt to be of a quasi-public nature , the public was asked to cooperate in it ; and the invitation was freely responded to .

		Hundreds of replies from all parts of the country were received , and a good deal of new and useful matter was se - cured .

		This matter was largely embodied in the two series of articles by Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	which appeared in ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine '' during the past five years , the first one covering Lincoln 's life up to
1858	DATE	, and the second one dealing with the later and more strictly historical phase of his career .

		Both series , in a revised and sup - plemented form , are published in the present volumes .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's work has thus been largely one of compilation , and she has done it for the most part in a thorough and workmanlike way .

		She has given us a straightforward , plain nar - rative , copiously strewn with extracts and an - ecdotes , and free from rhetorical flourish or attributions of the
Parson Weems	ORGANIZATION	variety .

		An appendix of some two hundred pages is devoted to a miscellaneous collection of hitherto unpub - lished speeches , letters , and telegrams , some of which are worth preservation , others , in our opinion , not .

		Let us hasten to say , however , that the new material presented by
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	is , as she claims , of considerable value , and adds much to our knowledge of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life .

		It is not a mere new budget of Lincoln stories tending to vulgarize one of the noblest figures in our history .

		It is time to have done with the no - tion that
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	was in the main a wag , a dry joker with an uncommon fund of '' horse-sense , '' and a backwoodsman 's boorish *

		THE DIAL 193 contempt of learning and good manners .

		With all his humor , his not always delicate drollery , there was a vein of the profoundest melan - choly in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's nature .

		He loved mourn - ful poetry , and was haunted by mournful fan - cies .

		The pathos of life touched him deeply , the more so because his own days were full of it .

		He thirsted for learning , and prized it not alone as a means , but as an end in itself .

		How ardently he had pursued it his later mastery of language , of a singularly pure and impres - sive style , attests .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	endeavors to show that
Lin	PERSON	- coln 's mother was '' not the nameless girl that she has been so generally believed , '' and that his father was in reality something more than a shiftless '' poor white . ''

		Lincoln 's biog - raphers , eager to enhance the in any case re - markable story of his rise from the log cabin to the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, have perhaps overdrawn his humble parentage and early privations .

		Later researches tend to show that some in - justice has in this way been done to
Thomas Lincoln	PERSON	, and especially to
Nancy Hanks	PERSON	, who is now known to have come of good
Massachu	PERSON	- setts stock , her more immediate ancestors pass - ing into
Virginia	LOCATION	-LRB- where the records show that they owned nearly a thousand acres of land -RRB- , and thence into
Kentucky	LOCATION	, where they were useful and thrifty members of the young com - munity .

		On the death of her parents a home was found for
Nancy Hanks	PERSON	, then nine years of age , with an uncle and aunt who had a farm near
Springfield	LOCATION	, where a number of her Vir - ginia relatives were living .

		Dr.
Graham	PERSON	, an entertaining
Kentucky	LOCATION	cen - tenarian now living , describes the wedding of
Thomas Lincoln	PERSON	and
Nancy Hanks	PERSON	, and also the `` infare '' that followed it a Homeric marriage feast to which everybody was bidden , and of which Dr.
Graham	PERSON	has , very naturally , a distinct remembrance .

		The '' infare '' was giv - en by the bride 's guardian ,
John H. Parrott	PERSON	; and , says Dr.
Graham	PERSON	, `` only girls with money had guardians appointed by the court . ''

		Mr.
Parrott	PERSON	's notions of an '' infare '' menu were liberal : `` We had , '' says Dr.
Graham	PERSON	, `` bearmeat ; ... ven - ison ; wild turkey and ducks ; eggs , wild and tame , so common that you could buy them at two bits a bushel ; maple sugar , swung on a string , to bite off for coffee or whiskey ; syrup in big gourds ; peach-and-honey ; a sheep that the two families barbecued whole over coals of wood burned in a pit , and covered with green boughs to keep the juice in ; and a race for the whiskey bottle . ''

		The home to which
Thomas Lincoln	PERSON	took his bride was a log cabin ; but at that date few families in
Kentucky	LOCATION	had anything better .

		That Lincoln 's '' credit was good , '' in a finan - cial sense , we have evidence , descendants of two of the early store-keepers of
Hardin	PERSON	county still remembering charges against him in their grandfathers ' account - books .

		Tools and gro - ceries were the chief purchases made , and on one of the ledgers the amazing item of '' a pair of silk suspenders , worth one dollar and
fifty cents	MONEY	'' was entered .

		In
1816	DATE	Lincoln was ap - pointed a road surveyor , or supervisor ; and on the whole his position in
Hardin	LOCATION	county seems to have been better than he is usually credited with .

		In
1803	DATE	he moved to La Rue county ; and here his second child ,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, was born .

		The new home , into which the well - starred little stranger came , was indeed the rude dwelling of the western pioneer a one - roomed cabin with a huge outside chimney , a single window , and a rough door ; but the stock descriptions of its comfortless squalor are over - drawn .

		The Lincolns lived roughly , but they lived happily , and as comfortably as most of their neighbors .

		In
1816	DATE	the Lincolns emigrated to
Indiana	LOCATION	; and here their home seems to have been much more primitive than it had been in
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		The country was a wilderness , and land had to be cleared for the planting of the first crop .

		For a year the family lived in a '' half-face camp . ''

		`` The cabin which took the place of the ` half - face camp ' had but one room , with a loft above .

		For a long time there was no window , door , or floor ; not even the traditional deer-skin hung before the exit ; there was no oiled paper over the opening for light ; there was no puncheon covering on the ground .

		The furniture was of their own manufacture .

		The table and chairs were of the rudest sort rough slabs of wood in which holes were bored and legs fitted in .

		... Little Abraham 's bed was even more primitive .

		He slept on a heap of dry leaves in the corner of the loft , to which he mount - ed by means of pegs driven into the wall . ''

		Those early pioneering days in
Indiana	LOCATION	were indeed , as
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	said , '' pretty pinching times , '' darkened , too , by his first great sorrow ; for in 1818
Nancy Hanks Lincoln	PERSON	, '' infare '' doings and rose-hued '' infare '' prospects far enough behind her , laid down the burdens of her rough life ; and the boy saw his father nail together a green pine box and put his dead mother into it , and bury her not far from the cabin , '' almost without a prayer . ''

		In the year following
Thomas Lincoln	PERSON	went back to
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and presently returned with a new wife
Sally Bush Johnston	PERSON	, a woman of energy , thrift , and gentleness , who took the motherless boy at once under her wing , and 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, did her best to foster the gifts she saw were in him . ''

		The new mother came well provided with household furniture , bringing many things unfamiliar to little
Abraham	PERSON	one fine bureau , one table , one set of chairs , one large clothes-chest , cooking utensils , knives , forks , bedding , etc. ' ... In his habits of reading and study the boy had little encouragement from his father , but his stepmother did all she could for him .

		Indeed , be - tween the two there soon grew up a relation of touching gentleness and confidence . ''

		The books that we know Lincoln read at this period were , the
Bible	LOCATION	, Pilgrim 's Progress , 2Esop 's Fables , a History of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Weems	PERSON	's Life of
Washington	LOCATION	, and , later , the Statutes of
Indiana	LOCATION	.


Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	, too , came later , as did
Burns	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a story that he read Plutarch ; but this he denied .

		Besides these works there were many others whose titles we do not know ; for Lin - coln used to say that he '' read through every book he had ever heard of in that country for a circuit of fifty miles . ''

		As he read , he made extracts , sometimes on a smooth board in lieu of paper , with his turkey-buzzard quill and brier-root ink . ''

		By night he read and worked as long as there was light , and he kept a book in the crack of the logs in his loft , to have it at hand at peep of day ... Every lull in his daily labor he used for reading , rarely going to his work without a book .

		When ploughing the fields of Spencer county , he found frequently a half hour for reading , for at the end of every long row the horse was allowed to rest , and
Lincoln	PERSON	had his book out and was perched on a stump or fence , almost as soon as the horse had come to rest . ''

		Thus
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	began , through sheer force and probity of character , and over a path perhaps as rough as ever climbed by man , to work his way upward .

		But to say that he was a '' self-made man , '' a man that '' owed everything to himself , '' is to tell only half the truth ; for he was most richly en - dowed by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her gifts to him were lav - ish ; and he made the most of them .

		Much has been said , too , and with a certain truth , of Lincoln 's '' great simplicity of character '' ; but it must not be forgotten , on the other hand , that his homely ways and quaint ex - terior were mated with a political ambition and a political shrewdness almost unmatched in our history .

		But as man , as advocate , and as politician , he was , first , last , and always , '' honest Abe . ''

		His right to that fine title can never be questioned .

		Of all American states - men his life best deserves to be read and laid to heart by American youth .

		It forms a story in which mirth and pathos are strangely mingled a story full of interest and golden lessons , and saturated with the distinctive spirit and character of our national life .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	has told it , on the whole , satisfactorily .

		Her book contains something that is new , and the essentials of the old .

		It aims to be biog - raphy rather than history to set before the reader as clearly as possibly the real Lincoln .

		The style is plain , and savors of journalism , as the origin of the work would lead one to ex - pect ; but it is clear and pithy .

		Evidences of hurried proof-reading there are , for example a curious omission at the foot of page 20 , Vol .

		I .

		The volumes are well made and ac - ceptably illustrated ; but why , in the name of common sense and rational book-making , was that essential feature , an Index , omitted ?

		E. G. J .

		THE ENGLISH RADICALS .

		* No more readable historical monograph has appeared of late than Mr.
Koy lance Kent	PERSON	's '' The English Radicals . ''

		The author is aston - ishingly fertile in his characterization of the radical political leaders of varying periods , calling attention to and emphasizing differences not heretofore noted in their activities .

		This , with a keen analysis of radical platforms and principles , all excellently stated , makes the book exceedingly interesting , while the impres - sion of scholarship and research is maintained throughout .

		Mr.
Kent	PERSON	traces the radical movement from its inception in
1761	DATE	to the present time .

		Un - usual fairness distinguishes the accounts of the earlier radicals , even when they were , like
Wilkes	PERSON	, really inspired by sordid motives and given to disreputable political manosuvres .

		Though individuals may have been sordid , the radical party as a whole , according to Mr.
Kent	PERSON	, possessed great intellectual ability and an honest fervor for democratic government , though somewhat lacking in political common sense and in practicality , and in these days of historical adulation for the men of action in details of government , it is refreshing to find an author who is not afraid to emphasize and eulogize the influence of great ideas , and of the men who consistently labored in their propaga - tion .

		The early radical was essentially an agitator and as such naturally devoted more attention to the benefits of an ideally perfect system than * THK ENGLISH RADICALS .

		THE DIAL 195 to its practical workings .

		Yet the effort of the agitator in arousing the nation to a sense of danger is quite as essential as that of his more fortunate successor , the practical politician , who suffers none of the hardships and social disbarments of his forerunner , and commonly receives all the applause .

		Mr.
Kent	PERSON	gives full credit to the men of ideas , for their honesty of purpose , their enthusiasm , and their sincere belief in the healing virtues of their plans .

		If the author is anywhere harsh it is in the comparison made , in the final chapter , between the purpose and attitude of the early radicals and the radicals of to-day .

		The early radical was a believer in the theory of '' delegated '' government , the modern rejects the theory though acting in indirect subservience to it ;
Cobden	PERSON	and Bright deified individualism in government and in commerce , while the mod - ern radical is an adherent of socialistic pro- grammes in both .

		James Mill expressed the radical doctrine of his time very well when he observed that '' the desire so often expressed that we should interfere to establish good gov - ernment all over the world is most alarming , and , if asserted to any degree , would lead to the worst of consequences ... The business of a nation is with its own affairs . ''

		The rad - icals of to-day , like their conservative oppo - nents , seem fully agreed that this an '' outworn and unfashionable creed and that the white man has a burden which it is his duty to take up . ''

		But it is especially in the spirit of the old and new that the difference is most strik - ing .

		Of this Mr.
Kent	PERSON	says : '' It is rather in their traits , their character , their temperament and disposition that the new radicals con - trast so strongly with the old .

		The latter had at least some well-defined ideas ... They knew exactly what they wanted , and , knowing it , they pursued it with un - conquerable zeal ... They were no light half believ - ers of their casual creeds ; the principles they held , they grasped with hooks of steel .

		They were men who sig - nified somewhat , as
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	would have said .

		If they held unpopular opinions they had the courage to avow them ; ... such firmness of conviction , such disinter - ested zeal , such limitless philanthropy , and such optim - ism , are at present far to seek ... Upon what princi - ple the new radicalism is now based , or what unity underlies the various items of its programme , it is dif - ficult to see ... Never before have the Radicals pre - sented so disorganized , so undisciplined a body . ''

		Whatever may be the opinion of the reader as to the justice of the author 's conclusion , the book everywhere attracts and hold the interest .

		It has a good Index and abounds with foot - note references to authoritative sources .

		MORE LETTERS OF THE MASTER OF BALL.IOL , .

		* The '' Life and Letters of
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	, '' by
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	and
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	, pub - lished in
1897	DATE	, was widely welcomed by schol - ars and all thoughtful people who had come under the peculiar spell of the
Master of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was inevitable that a man who had lived at one of the centres of English thought and scholarship for the greater part of the nineteenth century , who had been on terms of intimate friendship with many of the leading men of his time , and who had pre - served an attitude of serene and fearless independence under some pretty sharp tests of this quality , should have left a fascinating accumulation of correspondence .

		And though
Jowett	PERSON	, shortly before his death , burned all or nearly all of the letters he had received , the more precious half his own letters was found to be largely at the disposal of the editors .

		None knew better than Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	and Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	that they had not exhausted their treasure ; and they have now given us the present volume , containing , to quote the Pre - face , '' A number of letters , partly on special subjects , and partly of more general interest , which could not be in - cluded in the previous volumes , and yet seemed to be worth preserving ; and also some documents of a more public nature , which throw light on important features of
Jowett	PERSON	's career . ''

		The letters are divided topically under five heads , as follows : I. ,
Church Reform	ORGANIZATION	and the Abolition of Religious Tests ; II. , Educational ; III. , European Politics ; IV. , Letters on
India	LOCATION	; V. , Miscellaneous .

		The arrangement under each head is of course chronological ; and a sixth division contains many of the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's dated and undated notes and sayings which '' live in the memory of his friends . ''

		The mere titles of these divisions forcibly suggest the varied intellectual powers of the man and the extraordinary range of his sym - pathies .

		In the battle for the abolition of religious tests at the universities , the smoke of which has now blown away ,
Jowett	PERSON	took an advanced and decided stand , which is too well known to need description here .

		When he was examined , in
1871	DATE	, before a committee of * LETTERS OF

		196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, he comprehensively said : '' I should not bind a person by the obligation of a test .

		I should like to put before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	this consideration .

		Supposing you had one class of profes - sors bound by tests ; for instance , supposing the
Church of England Divinity	ORGANIZATION	professors were bound by tests , and other Divinity professors were not bound by tests , which do you suppose would have the greater authority and weight the persons who were free to speak what they thought , or the persons who were obliged to speak within a certain limit ? ''

		In a precis which he drew up in
1874	DATE	for
Lord Sherbrooke	LOCATION	, he sums up the Non-con - formist situation with pungent equity : '' The relation of the Church to the Dissenters , and of the Dissenters to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, is the greatest and worst schism in the Christian world .

		They divide the nation : these divisions affect all our politics , education , Church reform , etc. .

		This division affects society , upper and middle classes , gentlemen and tradesmen ' See how these Christians ' look down upon one another or hate one another .

		The sense of injustice has passed into the blood and bone of one half of the people of
England	LOCATION	.

		They were driven out in
1661	DATE	, and have never been restored . ''

		Jowett kept a watchful eye on European politics ; and his views are freely expressed in his letters to Sir
R. B. D. Morier	PERSON	, attache at
Berlin	LOCATION	, and subsequently Ambassador to Rus - sia .

		From his position near the Prussian court Morier naturally reflected at any rate he quite understood the distrust which
Prus	PERSON	- sia then -LRB- 1861 -RRB- felt toward
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	; and it is interesting and even amusing to note
Jowett	PERSON	's attempts to convert his friend to his own strange admiration for '' the man of des - tiny '' and his `` missions . ''

		In
1861	DATE	he writes to Morier : '' How I should like to have a good talk about for - eign politics with you !

		You know I was always a Napoleonist , as far as is consistent with being an Englishman .

		The way I come to it is this ; the map of
Europe	LOCATION	is badly settled at present in accordance with traditions of
Vienna	LOCATION	, rights of petty German princes , etc. .

		In the next twenty years it must be re - settled , and the only person who can lend a guiding hand in the resettlement is N. I have been very much struck with his Idees , which I read lately , and also with what one of the librarians of the British Museum told me , that for years he used to read there daily .

		He is not scrupulous , and perhaps his Court may be a mass of immorality and his Ministers dishonest jobbers , but he is the only man who sees the end many moves on , and understands not only
France	LOCATION	, but
Europe	LOCATION	and the times ... He will not fall into the error of his uncle of doing things too rapidly .

		And he has the best plan of all to have no plan . ''

		In
July , 1870	DATE	, the rush of events drew from
Jowett	PERSON	this plaint , with `` something of pro- phetic strain '' : `` The Emperor seems to have lost his head .

		I fear that this will be the end of his dynasty and the ruin of
France	LOCATION	.

		And I do n't want to see him ruined , for he has been the best friend of
England	LOCATION	, and though on the whole my sympathies go with the Protestant power , yet we have need of both
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		These wars tend to make other wars , for although
France	LOCATION	may be too much weakened to continue , she will fight again as soon as she recovers her strength .

		The hatred of
France	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION
from 1815	DATE	to
1855	DATE	will be as nothing compared with her abiding hatred of
Prussia	LOCATION	. ''

		The letters on
India	LOCATION	are largely concerned with the educational requirements for the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are addressed to Lord Lans - downe -LRB- Viceroy from
1888	DATE	to 1893 -RRB- ,
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	, Sir
M. E. Grant	PERSON	-
Duff	PERSON	-LRB- the governor of
Madras	LOCATION	-RRB- and others ; and deserve a more attentive reading than they will probably get in
America	LOCATION	: for they are marked by
Jowett	PERSON	's best qualities perspicacity of statement , sound reasoning , and an ardent desire for the improvement of the service .

		The personal traits which made the Master of Balliol so beloved of his friends shine with special brightness in the miscellaneous letters to
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	,
Frances Power Cobbe	PERSON	, Professor
Abbott	PERSON	,
Professor Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		From one of these it may be well to quote bis opinion of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	: `` No one ever united so much kindness and light - heartedness with so much strength .

		He was the most sensible man of genius whom I have ever known and the most free from personality , and his mind was very far from being exhausted . ''

		The collection of aphoristic sayings with which the volume concludes is a mine from which various minds will dig out their own treasures ; here are a few we have taken at ran - dom : -LRB- Memory -RRB- .

		`` A man should make a compact with his memory , not to remember everything .

		Great memories , like that of Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	, are apt to disable judgment . ''

		-LRB- Rank -RRB- '' I do not doubt that one day such dis - tinctions will vanish .

		While they remain , I wonder at any one not taking advantage of them . ''

		-LRB- Youth and Age -RRB- .

		`` I hope our young men will not grow into such dodgers as these old men are .

		I believe everything a young man says to me . ''

		-LRB-
Christian Evidences	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		`` The man who asks for demonstration must be either very ignorant or an utter sceptic . ''

		-LRB- The Limit of Scepticism -RRB- There must come a reaction towards religion again ; the void will be too great . ''

		The book is , as intended , a welcome and almost necessary supplement to the '' Life and Letters '' ; and those who have the one will want the other .

		THE DIAL 197 THE HUDSON 'S BAY COMPANY .

		* How engaging a subject he lias found for his pen in his '' The Great Company , '' Mr.
Beckles Willson	PERSON	shows in the very paragraph , the last of his first chapter , in which he defines the aim and purpose of his book . ''

		To narrate the causes which first led to the forma - tion of this Company , the contemporary interest it ex - cited , the thrilling adventures of its early servants , of the wars it waged with the French , and drove so valiantly to a victorious end ; its vicissitudes and grad - ual growth ; the fierce and bloody rivalries it combated and eventually overbore ; its notable expeditions of research by land and sea ; the character of the vast country it ruled and the Indians inhabiting it ; and last but not least , the stirring and romantic experiences con - tained in the letters and journals of the Great Com - pany 's factors and traders for a period of above two centuries , such will be the aim and purpose of this work . ''

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Willson	PERSON	has not done better justice to the importance and interest of a subject that he so well under - stands .

		He shows commendable diligence and application in the accumulation and pre - sentation of material that is at once interest - ing and valuable , but he does not show literary art , or even a good book-maker 's skill .

		He does not handle his matter to good advan - tage .

		Sometimes he seems to miss the con - nection of events , and his narrative becomes confused and vexing to the reader .

		Some - times long quotations are introduced where a sentence or two of summary would answer a better purpose .

		Sometimes he goes into too much detail , and then again not into enough .

		Sometimes the sources of the narrative are given , and sometimes they are not .

		We do not blame him for not being a
Parkman	LOCATION	; we do not say that his narrative is always heavy and slow ; but it does seem a pity that he should not have made a more effective use of the picturesque and romantic elements of his story .

		As to grammar and style , it would be easy to select from the 541 octavo pages enough bad examples to stock a couple of common school text-books , although we must admit that they would fall considerably short of the required variety .

Beckles Willson	PERSON	.

		adventurers Groselliers and
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	, grace - less scamps , who were equally ready to ply their trade under the French and the English flags , and closing with the Great Com - pany 's far more extensive but prosaic busi - ness of the present time .

		How much chro - nological territory is included is seen when we recall that the story fills the period from
Prince Rupert	ORGANIZATION	, the dashing cavalry officer of the royal army in the civil war , who was the first President of the Company , to his present successor , Lord
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	and Mount Royal , who is engaged just at present in fitting out in
Canada	LOCATION	a command of four hundred mounted men to fight the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	in
South Africa	LOCATION	, all to be paid out of his share of the profits that the
Company	ORGANIZATION	has made .

		Or , again , the scene opens with a single feeble trading post clinging to the shore of the great inland sea , then little known , which gives the Company its name ; it closes with the great and powerful organization that counts its well-established and well-furnished posts by scores , spread over the vast regions of the North , to which the picturesque name The Great Fur Land was once applied .

		Within the field of the
Company	ORGANIZATION	's operations in the
North	LOCATION	there has been a great change since the latter part of the seventeenth century , but how small it is compared with the corresponding change in the outer world !

		We shall quote three or four passages that will show the quality of the book at its best .

		Our first selections reveal the awful waste at - tending the maintenance of savage life in the far North . ''

		The Indians were ruthless slaughterers of animals at the earliest period at which they were known to the servants of the Company .

		Whether they happened to be under the pinch of necessity or enjoying themselves in all the happiness of wealth and plenty , it was their custom to slay all they could .

		They boasted a maxim that the more they killed , the more they had to kill . '

		Such an opinion , although opposed to reason and to common sense , was clung to with great pertinacity by them .

		The results of this indiscrimate slaughter were obvious ; and to such a pitch of destitution were the tribes often brought that cannibalism was not infrequent amongst them . '' ''

		Throughout their progress -LSB- down the streams to the factories -RSB- the Indians were obliged to go ashore for several hours daily , which caused great delay in their progress .

		Their canoes were small , holding only two men and a pack of one hundred beaver skins , with not much room for provisions .

		Had their canoes been larger , their voyages would undoubtedly have been less protracted , and they would have been able to transport a greater cargo .

		Often great numbers of skins were left behind . '' ''

		A good hunter of these nations could kill six hun - 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, dred beavers in the course of a season ; he could carry down to the factory rarely more than one hundred , using the remainder at home in various ways .

		Sometimes he hung them upon branches of trees by way of votive offering upon the death of a child or near relation ; often they were utilized as bedding and bed coverings ; occasionally the fur was burnt off , and the beast roasted whole for food at banquets . ''

		What the poor savages got for the furs that they brought down to the shore in those times , this paragraph shows : `` It was reported that in the year
1742	DATE	the natives were so discouraged in their trade with the Company that many found the peltry hardly worth the carriage , and the finest furs sold for very little .

		When the tribes came to the factory in
June	DATE	they found the goods much higher in price , and much in excess of the standard they were accustomed to .

		According to
Joseph	PERSON	la
France	LOCATION	, a French-Canadian voyageur , they gave but a pound of gunpowder for four beavers , a fathom of tobacco for seven beavers , a pound of shot for one , an ell of coarse cloth for fifteen , a blanket for twelve , two fish-hooks or three flints for one , a gun for twenty-five , a pistol for ten ; a common hat with white lace cost seven beavers , an ax four , a bill-hook one , a gallon of brandy four , a checkered shirt seven , all of which sold at a monstrous profit , even to two thousand per cent . ''

		First and last it is slight exaggeration to say that the fur trade in
America	LOCATION	, while conducted on a far smaller scale than the quest for gold , was marked by a selfishness and cruelty equally great .

		Here is our author 's description of the mot - ley throng of humanity that the motives which carried on the fur trade in the palmy days of the
Northwest Company	ORGANIZATION	brought together in the season on the farther shore of Lake Supe - rior , around the walls of
Fort William	LOCATION	. ''

		But if the scene within was noisy and animated , that without beggared description .

		Hundreds of voy - ageurs , soldiers , Indians , and half-breeds were encamped together in the open , holding high revel .

		They hailed from all over the globe ,
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, the African Gold Coast , the
Sandwich Islands	LOCATION	,
Bengal	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, with Creoles , vari - ous tribes of Indians , and a mixed progeny of
Bois Ernie	PERSON	's or half-breeds . '

		Here , ' cries one trader , ' were congregated on the shores of the inland sea , within the walls of
Fort William	LOCATION	, Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists , Sun-worshippers , men from all parts of the world whose creeds were wide as poles asunder , united in one common object , and bowing down before the same idol . ' ''

		Among the interesting portions of the book are the accounts of the exploring expeditions conducted by
Hearne	PERSON	and
Mackenzie	PERSON	to the Arctic and to the
Pacific	LOCATION	oceans , and the Lord Selkirk episode .

		Mr.
Willson	PERSON	's account of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's expedition from
Fort Chippewan	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	in 1792-93 well illustrates that lack of definiteness which is one of the most serious blemishes of his book .

		He does not tell us where
Mackenzie	PERSON	crossed the Rocky Moun - tains , or , having done so , by what route he made his way to the ocean .

		This is his account of the close of the expedition : '' The navigation of the river , although interrupted by rapids and cascades , was continued until the 23d , when the party reached its mouth .

		Here the river was found to discharge itself by various smaller channels into the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		The memorable journey was now finished , and its purpose completed .

		In large characters , upon the sur - face of a rock under whose shelter the party had slept , their leader painted this simple memorial '' '
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	, from
Canada	LOCATION	by land the 22d of
July	DATE	, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three . ' ''

		We are left wholly in the dark as to the name of this river and as to the spot where the intrepid explorer painted his vermillion - colored memorial .

		Such indefiniteness as this in a work of this description is inexcusable .

		Still the author is entitled to the praise of having brought together in an accessible and readable form a vast amount of important in - formation relative to a great subject .

		SOME CURRENT FALLACIES OF CAPTAIN
MAHAN	PERSON	.

		* The proverbial failure of the sailor as an equestrian seems nowhere more lamentably ap - parent than in Captain
Alfred T. Mahan	PERSON	's present pose as '' the man on horseback . ''

		Colonel
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	has had recent occasion to characterize his views as '' the naval board of prize-money theory , '' and the recent collection of his papers in the volume called `` Lessons of the War with
Spain	LOCATION	, and Other Articles '' fails to show any higher notion of right than is held in the word might .

		Within the limits of his profession , which is the art of killing his fellows , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	speaks with a certain authority ; upon matters of more general interest , he is performing at the present time an even more useful function as the outspoken advocate of '' The good old rule , the simple plan : That those should take who have the power , And those should keep who can . ''

		Of '' The Lessons of the War with
Spain	LOCATION	, '' accordingly , there is little to be said so far as the naval aspect of the case is concerned ; though such statements as this , '' If we lost * LESSONS OF THE WAR WITH
SPAIN	LOCATION	, and Other Articles .

		THE DIAL .

		199 ten thousand men , the country could replace them ; if we lost a battleship , it could not be replaced , '' ought to serve in illustrating the difference in morals between times of war and times of peace .

		But when we come to '' The Moral Aspect of War , '' the second paper of the book , we find ourselves in the midst of an argument against peace so far as peace is bound up in the idea of arbitration , which shows that the writer is unable to think in any terms but those of war .

		He illustrates the injustice of arbitration , for example , by the admission , on disinterested authority , that the
United States	LOCATION	had no doctrine of international law behind its intervention in
Cuba	LOCATION	, and that a board of ar - bitration would have denied its right so to inter - vene .

		This is the preliminary statement he makes concerning the status ante bellum : `` In the island of
Cuba	LOCATION	, a powerful military force , government it scarcely could be called , foreign to the island , was holding a small portion of it in enforced subjection , and was endeavoring , unsuccessfully , to re - duce the remainder .

		In pursuance of this attempt , measures were adopted that inflicted immense misery and death upon great numbers of the population .

		Such suffering is indeed attendant upon war ; but it maybe stated as a fundamental principle of civilized war - fare that useless suffering is condemned . ''

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	proceeds to ask , `` Under such circumstances , does any moral obligation lie upon a powerful neighboring state ? ''

		It is useless , perhaps , to point out that he begs the entire question when he introduces the word '' powerful . ''

		For ''
Cuba	LOCATION	'' in the quo - tation substitute '' Luzon , '' and ask , what is
Japan	LOCATION	's duty in the premises ?

		Evidently , if there is a principle behind Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's doctrine , it is a mere question of
Japan	LOCATION	's ability to take
Luzon	LOCATION	away from us ; and on such principle as he here discloses , if
Japan	LOCATION	can , she ought .

		But regard this in the ser - ious light of being an argument against arbi - tration : that , rather than arbitrate , being powerful enough , we are to stop the slaughter of Cubans in order to place our citizens in a position where the lives of ten thousand of them are of less value than a battleship ; our army in the position of performing much such a service for the Filipinos as
Spain	LOCATION	had pre - viously been performing , and finally , to fly in the face of all international law , which has expressly reserved to nations the right to mind their own business in their own way .

		And all , as Captain
Mahan	PERSON	points out , undisguis - edly , in the ultimate analysis for no better reason than because we had the power .

		What becomes of moral force in the face of the Captain 's thirteen-inch guns ?

		From this he passes to '' The Relations of the
United States	LOCATION	to their New Dependencies . ''

		Here we are to learn from
England	LOCATION	how to rule .

		Learn what from
England	LOCATION	?

		For one thing , '' administration from without '' in trop - ical regions .

		What have we learned from
England	LOCATION	in respect of the North American Indian ? ''

		Since she lost what is now the
United States	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	has become be - nevolent and beneficent to her colonies , '' Cap - tain
Mahan	PERSON	says in one place , and in another , '' The task is novel to us ; we may make blund - ers . ''

		What , then are we to `` lose '' in order to become as benevolent and beneficent as , for example ,
England	LOCATION	has been in
South Africa	LOCATION	or the Soudan ?

		We are not told ; but we may discover why it is that we should govern from without in the British manner , and the answer is worth recording , for Captain
Mahan	PERSON	forgets the appeal to the national conscience and the God he has been invoking and says , baldly : '' It is our interest ... Enlightened self-interest demands of us to recognize not merely , and in general , the imminence of the great question of the farther East , which is rising so rapidly before us , but also , specifically , the importance to us of a strong and bene - ficent occupation of adjacent territory . ''

		What do we gain ?

		The answer is ready : '' The inhabitants may not return love for their bene - fits , comprehension or gratitude may fail them ; but the sense of duty achieved , and the security of the ten - ure , are the reward of the ruler . ''

		And what do we lose ?

		Every principle dear to us : liberty , equality , taxation with representation , the consent of the governed , democracy , and the Constitution itself !

		The book concludes with a paper upon '' Current Fallacies upon Naval Subjects . ''

		Those whose memory goes back a few years will remember that it is upon Captain
Mahan	PERSON	more than any other single person that the nation relied in its annexation of
Hawaii	LOCATION	.

		In
1893	DATE	he began calling our attention to the fact that we must decide '' Whether the Sand - wich Islands ... shall in the future be an outpost of European civilization , or of the comparative barbarism in
China	LOCATION	, '' the
Flowery Kingdom	LOCATION	being about to send forth another Mongol horde armed with weapons of precis - ion and battleships galore for the purposes of his argument .

		Later we were informed of '' The importance of the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	as a position powerfully influencing the commercial and military 200 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, control of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and especially of the northern
Pacific	LOCATION	, in which the
United States	LOCATION	, geographically , has the strongest right to assert herself . ''

		And to this was added the following significant sentence : '' These are the main advantages , which can be termed positive : those , namely , which directly advance commer - cial security and naval control . ''

		With still later and stronger statements to the same end the naval historian buttressed his position , and to secure the naval control of the
Pacific Hawaii	LOCATION	was annexed , and our legis - lators are now devising some limitation of the franchise which shall not throw the islands into the hands of the Kanakas , or rightful owners thereof .

		But almost to our dismay , in this last paper , Americans are told that this was a current fallacy upon naval subjects in the following unmistakable language -LRB- p. 301 -RRB- : `` We now come to the assertion that if the
United States	LOCATION	takes to itself interests beyond the sea of which
Hawaii	LOCATION	is an instance , it not only adds to its liabilities , which is true , but incurs an unnecessary exposure , to guard against which we need no less than the greatest navy in the world . ''

		Since Admiral
Mahan	PERSON	will not permit it , let us not forget , as is said above , that his pro- fession is the art of killing his fellows , and that he is far too eager professionally to dis - cern any of the possibilities of peace .

		STATISTICS AND CENSUS-TAKING .

		* Professor
Mayo-Smith	PERSON	's '' Science of Sta - tistics , '' of which the volume entitled '' Statis - tics and Sociology '' appeared some
four years ago	DATE	, has now been completed by the publication of a second volume on '' Statistics and Eco - nomics . ''

		The plan of this volume , though similar to that of the earlier one , is otherwise unique ; and it suggests a doubt whether there is after all a distinct science of statistics , or whether the so-called science is not simply a method of studying economics or sociology or some other division of knowledge .

		After an introductory chapter on '' Statis - tics in the
Service of Economics	ORGANIZATION	, '' various eco - nomic questions are treated under headings * STATISTICS AND ECONOMICS .

		which would serve equally well for a theoretical treatise in economics '' Consumption and Production , '' `` Exchange , '' and `` Distribu - tion '' for the main divisions , and such titles as '' Money and Credit , '' '' Wages , '' '' Rent , In - terest , and Profits , '' for the chapter-headings .

		Each chapter begins with a brief statement of the economic theory of the topic to be con - sidered , and of the usefulness of the statis - tical method in that particular field ; then fol - lows an exhibition and critical examination of the more important statistical data pertinent thereto , with a bibliographical note telling where additional figures may be found .

		The methods of gathering and using the statistics of the subject are next subjected to certain '' scientific tests '' for the purpose of determin - ing which are the best methods ; and finally , there is a `` reflective analysis '' in which gen - eral conclusions are stated .

		This method of treatment makes the book valuable for several distinct purposes : it is a systematic treatise in descriptive economics , so far as the subject is capable of numerical treatment ; it deals in a judicious and scientific manner with statistical methods ; and the convenient arrangement and full index make it useful as a book of refer - ence , in which the leading facts on almost any economic topic may be found , not only for the
United States	LOCATION	, but also for some at least of the European countries .

		It will be helpful to many students to find how many economic problems there are to the solution of which the statistical method may be made to contribute .

		Among these there is none of more general interest than the problem of the distribution of wealth , which is , how - ever , one of the most difficult for the statisti - In the study of this problem , use may cian .

		be made of statistics of wages , rent , interest , and profits , and also of tax returns and other data indicating the distribution of incomes or of property .

		In all these ways Professor Mayo-Smith tests the assertion that the rich are growing richer and the poor poorer , and finds that the latter part of the statement at least seems to be unwarranted by the figures , which agree in showing that wages have been advancing during the past thirty to fifty years , while the cost of subsistence has been declin - ing ; but he adds the caution that certain other things must be taken into consideration , such as regularity of employment , duration and in - tensity of labor , the conditions under which it is carried on , and the method of payment .

		THE DIAL 201 comes and property are even less conclusive ; the author decides that they fail to show any marked concentration of income in the hands of a few , though there is undoubtedly very great inequality , now as in the past .

		But he argues that the concentration of wealth , either by the growth of private fortunes or by combination , is not altogether an evil , but on the contrary is absolutely necessary for the purpose of pro- duction on a large scale .

		The division of a large income among a number of persons would probably result in greater present enjoy - ment , but at the expense of future production , because less would be saved . ''

		The institution of millionaires in the modern com - munity works somewhat like the institution of slavery in former times .

		It is a method by which all members of the community are , to a certain extent , compelled to save and economize and lay up capital . ''

		Finally , it is pointed out that remedies for too great concentration of power lie at hand in the formation of trades unions , benefit and cooperative societies , and other forms of asso - ciation which enable the laboring class to assert its power ; in factory , educational , and sanitary laws ; in the exercise of political power by the many ; and in the furtherance of public opinion and Christian sympathy .

		The
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	, at its meeting at
Cleveland	LOCATION	in
1897	DATE	, authorized the appointment of a committee on the national census .

		The members appointed on this com - mittee were Professor Mayo-Smith , Professor
Walter F. Willcox	PERSON	, Hon.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	, Professor
Roland P. Falkner	PERSON	, and Professor
Davis R. Dewey	PERSON	.

		The committee called upon all the members of the Association for sugges - tions , and also invited a number of experts to prepare critical articles on particular parts of the
Eleventh Census	ORGANIZATION	, for the purpose of sug - gesting possible improvements in the Twelfth .

		These papers have been collected and printed as one of the publications of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are twenty in number , not counting two letters which are printed at length among the briefer suggestions received from members .

		Various phases of population statistics are treated by Professor

W. Z. Ripley	PERSON	, Professor
Franz Boas	PERSON	, and Mr.
George K. Holmes	PERSON	; illiteracy and educational statistics , by Professor

Carl C. Plehn	PERSON	; muni - cipal finance , by Professor
Henry B. Gardner	PERSON	; while a general article on the scope and method of the census is contributed by Mr.
William C. Hunt	PERSON	.

		The various papers are of very unequal merit , as is apt to be the case in a compilation of this kind ; but it is hardly necessary to say , after naming the contributors , that the volume contains much that is of value , not only to the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	, but to statistical workers every - where .

		The university professors may not in all cases fully recognize the practical difficul - ties confronting the census-taker , but they are able to point out defects from the standpoint of the consumers of statistics , and to suggest remedies .

		While their attitude toward the
Eleventh Census	ORGANIZATION	is decidedly critical for the most part , they are not slow to recognize a particularly good piece of work , such as the inquiry concerning farms , homes , and mort - gages .

		In the report of the committee the opinion is expressed that the main defects of the census have been due to lack of sufficient time for preparation ; and the establishment of a permanent census bureau under civil service rules is proposed as the remedy .

		It should be a happy augury for the success of the Twelfth Census that several of the ex - perts who contributed to this critical volume are now connected with the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	in important capacities , so that they are in a posi - tion to prevent the repetition of the mistakes which have come to their notice .

		The inten - tion seems to be to have the work of the next census criticized before the results are pub - lished , and so far as possible even before the census is taken .

		For this purpose Professor
Willcox	PERSON	has been put in charge of a
Division of Methods and Results	ORGANIZATION	, and has gathered about him half a dozen student-clerks young men who have had university training in the use of statistics , and who are enabled to devote all their time to the careful study of statistical problems .

		In several of the government de - partments there is observable a similar tendency to put the statistical work more and more into - the hands either of university men or of others who combine the scientific attitude and breadth of view with practical experience in statistical 202 THE DIAL offices .

		If an improvement in the character of official statistics should follow , the credit will be due partly to the work of the
Civil Service Commission	ORGANIZATION	, partly to the appointment of student-clerks , and partly to the publication of such works as the two which have just been reviewed .

		MAX THE RACES OF
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		* Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	has done a great service , both to general readers and anthropologists , in prepar - ing his work , '' The Races of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		No - where are there more difficult ethnological questions than in
Europe	LOCATION	: nowhere is it more desirable to have clear ideas than in that field .

		True , much has been written regarding the physical anthropology of the Continent ; the mass of literature on the subject is really appal - ling .

		But what has been written has been from the local standpoint .

		The race types of a state or governmental district have , in many cases , been worked out with wonderful care and pa - tience .

		But their relation to the types of other districts , the race types of the continent as a whole , these were questions which were but badly , if at all , answered .

		It was to present a .

		general view , to combine and correlate the local data so as to arrive at grander results , that our author has labored .

		Race is but one of the elements which has made European populations what they are to - day .

		Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	states this plainly .

		Still the title of his book itself warrants our confining our review to that single element . ''

		A type is a combination of characters . ''

		A race type should be a definite combination of characters , frequently recurring and persistent in time .

		To define types , characters must first be studied .

		Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	bases his European race types upon three characters head form , color , stature .

		Heads are long and narrow or short and broad dolichocephalic or brachycephalic .

		Persons are blond or brunette light or dark in com - plexion , hair color , and eye color .

		They are tall or short .

		Having studied the range of va - riation within each of these three characters and investigated their distribution , our author works out three race types to which he gives the names Teutonic , Alpine , and
Mediterra	PERSON	- nean .

		The Teutonic is dolichocephalic , blond , THE RACES OF

New York	LOCATION	: D. Appleton 00 , and tall ; the Alpine is brachycephalic , bru - nette , and medium ; the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	is do - lichocephalic , dark , and short .

		In a general way the three types are geographically located , from
North to South	ORGANIZATION	in the order named .

		Careful study of the populations of every part of
Europe	LOCATION	shows that any one of these types rarely exists alone .

		Usually two , sometimes all three , are found together sometimes sep - arate and approximately pure , but generally more or less mixed .

		Parts of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	are almost purely Teutonic ; most of
Italy	LOCATION	is Med - iterranean .

		In
France	LOCATION	all three of the types assist in making up the population .

		We can not follow Professor
Ripley	PERSON	's inter - esting discussion in detail .

		He investigates a variety of important historical , political , and sociological questions .

		Even from this brief review , it will be seen that his book is of great importance .

		It will greatly advance study .

		A pioneer work -LRB- from the present standpoint of science -RRB- , it can hardly reach final conclu - sions on all points .

		To indicate the possible divergence from its conclusions , we may men - tion the work of Deniker , of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This deals with the same subject and practically by the same method .

		Yet Deniker defines ten and not three European types .

		Later students will probably come to an agreement upon some intermediate number .

		Ripley considers his Mediterranean Race of African origin .

		He suggests that the Teu - tonic Race may have developed from it under the influence of a peculiar environment .

		The Alpine , he appears to think , is an Asiatic im - migrant which has wedged in between the other two .

		Whatever their origin , three such different physical types must differ in mental and moral characters .

		Each must affect , with its own peculiar color , the communities of which it forms a part or to which it has contributed by mixture .

		While , of necessity , Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	's book is a compilation and claims to be no more , it is a compilation into which personality has so en - tered as to make it new matter .

		The author is especially to be praised for three important helps , which multiply many times the value of the simple text .

		These are the maps , the por - traits , and the bibliography .

		A series of inter - esting and instructive maps of
Europe	LOCATION	and the different countries of

		A notable '' selected bibliography '' of about two thousand titles directs the student to a vast , little known , and widely scattered literature .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		An admirable Of recent text-books dealing with account of the English fiction , by far the most ser - Engiiih novel .

		yiceable we have seen is Mr.
Wilbur L. Cross	PERSON	's `` The Development of the English Novel '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This book should prove of interest and value to the general reader as well as to the student in this department of literature , for there is little to suggest the school-room in its plan or style .

		The headings of its eight chapters are : '' From Arthurian Romance to
Richardson	PERSON	, '' '' The Eighteenth Century Realists , '' '' From '
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	' to '
Waverley	LOCATION	, ' '' '' Nineteenth Century Romance , '' `` The Realistic Reaction , '' `` The Re - turn to Realism , '' '' The Psychological Novel , '' '' The Contemporary Novel . ''

		An appendix contains a list of twenty-five prose fictions designed to show in outline the development of the English novel and fourteen pages of useful bibliographical notes .

		There is an Index .

		In the details of his work , Mr.
Cross	PERSON	puts forth no plea for any particular writer or school : '' We are by nature both realists and idealists , '' he declares , '' delighting in the long run about equally in the representation of life somewhat as it is and as it is dreamed to be ... Idealism in course of time falls into unendurable exorbitances ; realism likewise offends by its brutality and cyn - icism .

		And in either case there is a recoil . ''

		This is eminently sane , for it is true both in reason and in fact .

		The clash of rival schools in fiction , the petulance of their respective champions how ex - asperating !

		Yet this absurdity is also natural and would better be regarded in humor than in anger .

		The analysis and classification of English fiction is no simple matter ; the diversities and the similari - ties are often so perplexingly contradictory that one finds his material capricious .

		The pigeon-holes are duly labeled , but some of the stories apparently be - long in half-a-dozen at once .

		The author of this book , however , approves himself a master of his subject , subservient to no theories of arbitrary as - sortment ; his frequent repetition of names and titles previously localized , in connection with groups which in some respects overlap the others , con - tributes directly to the clearness of the classifica - tion and supplies a series of links that emphasize the inter-relations and points of connection in the material as a whole .

		Among the many excellent features of the essay we note the occasional para - graphs upon the influences , social and political , for - eign as well as domestic , which always affect public taste and often account for the literary fashions of the day .

		In the characterization of the novelists we have been especially pleased with the sections upon
Sterne	PERSON	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	-LRB- `` the greatest force that has yet appeared in English fiction '' -RRB- r
George Eliot	PERSON	, and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		In his treatment of contemporary writers , Mr.
Cross	PERSON	does Mrs. Hum - phry Ward scant courtesy , sparing never a word in comment upon her fine character creations and her excellent technique .

		It occurs to us that in a text - book of this nature , there should be included a section on technique ; a discussion of this topic treated historically would be of great service to the student of fiction .

		Recollections , by The P a g es of Sir
Algernon West	PERSON	' 8 Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's chatty volume of '' Recollections : private secretary .

		1 8 32-1886 '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- are thickly strewn with the names of men well known in En - glish political and official life during the period cov - ered .

		Sir
Algernon	PERSON	's long career in the fiscal branch of the public service has kept him constantly in touch with public men , and furnished him with an un - usually large budget of stories about them , and these form the staple of his book .

		He was chosen
Pri	ORGANIZATION	- vate Secretary to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	on the latter 's re - turn to power in
1868	DATE	, and naturally has some rather interesting recollections of his old chief not a few of them comically tinged with the Private Secretary 's proverbial self-importance .

		For exam - ple , he records : '' ... After the ceremony we all adjourned to luncheon at Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's , who asked me whom I should propose as Chancellor of the Exchequer .

		I suggested
Chamberlain	PERSON	, but he thought that the city would be terrified at his views of ' ransom , ' while I maintained that a few weeks of official experience would soften the crudeness of his views . ''

		Sir
William V. Harcourt	PERSON	received the appointment , and the ex-Secretary goes on to say : '' On the llth I had my first interview with my new master -LRB- Sir
William	PERSON	-RRB- , who received me aux bras ouverts as his ` guide , philosopher , and friend . ' ''

		Lest the foregoing extracts should seem to argue a general lack of the sense of humor in
Sir Algernon	LOCATION	, we hasten to say that in point of fact his mind is on the contrary of a somewhat
Joe Millerish	PERSON	cast , if we are to accept his book as a fair reflection of it .

		His stories are largely of the jocular order , and pleasantly reflect the foibles and humors of old official colleagues those of Mr.
Alfred Montgom	PERSON	- ery , for instance , a witty but punctilious gentleman of the old school of manners , long Chairman of the
Board of Inland Revenue	ORGANIZATION	.

		One baking hot day , Sir
Algernon	PERSON	relates , the Chairman 's private secre - tary rashly came into the board-room with his coat off . ''

		Montgomery was much shocked , and as the 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, secretary was leaving the room he called him back and said : ' Mr. , if you should find it con - venient in this hot weather to take off your trousers , pray do not let any feeling of respect for the
Board	ORGANIZATION	stand in your way . ' ''

		There is a touch of pathos , and an illustration of the ways of royalty , in the last recorded jest of this old public servant .

		As he lay on his death-bed the Prince of Wales called on him , and shortly afterwards the Princess .

		On her departure he said to his servant : '' Should the Queen call , say that I am too tired to see her Maj - esty . '' ''

		He once told me , '' Sir
Algernon	PERSON	signifi - cantly adds , `` that though he had been in the Queen 's household since her Majesty 's accession , she had never once spoken to him . ''

		To an Englishman , of course , the oversight was tragic .

		Sir
Algernon	PERSON	's book makes pleasant reading , but it lacks pith , and conveys the impression that its author is a good deal of a trifler which of course he is not , outside literature .

		There are some good illustrations , mainly portraits , and the volume is attractively made .

		There was abundant room for a The troubadours WQrk in Engl i 8h on the troubadours .

		and their world .

		.

		The reader who is confined to En - glish works has had nothing outside the encyclo - paedias that was not untrustworthy and antiquated .

		He may now turn to the two large and sumptuous volumes that Professor
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	has just devoted to '' The Troubadours at Home '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which are certainly neither meagre nor ill-informed .

		Indeed they present a vast mass of facts gleaned from a wide study of the best and most recent in - vestigations and from a considerable acquaintance at first hand with the poetry of the troubadours themselves .

		Something may be found here con - cerning more than a hundred of the upwards of four hundred singers known to us , and very full information concerning all the most important ones .

		Emphasis is justly laid on the interest that the lit - erature of the troubadours should have for us as containing the beginnings of our own culture , and the attempt is made to present the social and intellect - ual movement of which it is the expression , and to make more intelligible to the modern reader the spirit , the ideas , and the ideals of that forgotten world .

		To that end attention is also given to the exterior aspects and customs of the time .

		The troubadour country has been carefully studied , and the character of its scenery and the appearance of its towns impressed upon the reader , not only by highly colored word-pictures , but also by a great wealth of fine illustrations from the author 's own photographs .

		This is frankly an ceuvre de vulga - risation , and even the method of historical fiction is not disdained in order '' to constitute an environ - ment and an atmosphere for the poets , '' and to in - duce with regard to '' the life , the events , the local - ities and the personalities '' of the time '' a sense of actuality . ''

		But in spite of these painstaking efforts and these elaborate means , we lay down the vol - umes with a measure of disappointment .

		The world of the troubadours has not risen clear , firm , coherent , and substantial in our minds .

		Somehow it still remains shadowy , distant , and unreal .

		Its parts are left too scattered , our gaze is too often distracted from it to this world of modernity , and the rising illusion of reality is too often rudely dis - pelled by the instrusion of the author with his
Baedeker	PERSON	and his camera .

		Perhaps , as so often happens , he would have succeeded in doing more if he had been content to attempt less .

		We really have three works here : a beautifully illustrated book of travel , a historical novel , or rather a score of them , and a work of literary history .

		Each one would gain immensely by being cut loose from the others .

		However , the author 's failure to achieve all the ends that he proposed to himself by no means robs his work of its solid value ; it pre - sents by far the most ample and trustworthy store of information about the troubadours and their world to be found in English .

		The fulness of its bibliographical references will make it of service even to special students .

		A stimulation '' Literature is largely made in the to the schools a Knowledge subject .

		The study of
Milton	LOCATION	.

		great f unct i on o f literature , namely to bring into play the spiritual faculties , is very inadequately recognized , and the study of En - glish literature is made too much an objective job the fault of teachers , not students . ''

		There are many readers who would promptly assign these words to Professor
Hiram Corson	PERSON	without being explicitly informed of their source , so fre - quently and so insistently has this veteran cham - pion of the true interests of literary instruction ex - pressed the idea which they embody .

		As a matter of fact , they are taken from the preface to Dr.
Corson	PERSON	's latest work , `` An Introduction to the Prose and Poetical Works of
John Milton	PERSON	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Nor are the following words any less distinctively characteristic of the author 's controll - ing ideas upon the subject of literature-study : `` Notes are a necessary evil , and should not be read until after a requisite general impression has been received from an independent reading ; often two or more independent readings should precede any attention to explanatory notes ... A special attention to the details should be given only after the reader has , in a general way , taken in the articulating thought and the informing life of the poem . ''

		Such words as these can not be said too often , and deserve to be printed in letters of gold .

		The aim of the work before us is to en - courage students in such a study of
Milton	LOCATION	as shall bring them into vivifying spiritual contact with the loftiest of English poets .

		It has two main sec - tions .

		The first , called ''
Milton	PERSON	's Autobiography , '' consists of about a hundred pages of text , `` made up of all the more important autobiographical passages contained in his prose and poetical works , '' and arranged chronologically with reference to his
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 205 life .

		The second section consists of `` passages in
Milton	LOCATION	's prose and poetical works in which his idea of true liberty , individual , domestic , civil , pol - itical , and religious , is explicitly set forth . ''

		Here we have the whole of '' Comus , '' '' Lycidas , '' and ''
Samson Agonistes	PERSON	, '' besides some score of pages of brief extracts .

		To state the plan of this work , together with the name of its editor , is to commend it to all who love English literature , and believe in its enormous possibilities as an educative influence .

		Of
Milton	PERSON	, particularly , in these days of the glo - rification of brute force and the wide departure of the English peoples from the ideals that have made them great , we may well repeat the familiar cry of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's sonnet , and welcome any attempt to create a renewed interest in one whose only care was '' To stand approved in sight of God , though worlds judged -LSB- him -RSB- perverse . ''

		The life of
James Hogg	PERSON	offers to its Thereat biographers one difficulty or , per -
Eltnck Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		& , r / haps better , an opportunity that is unique in the history of literature .

		Hogg became widely known , not merely by his own writings or his own personality , but also by the character given him by others in a work of fiction .

		Indeed , we rather think that
Hogg	PERSON	was even in his life-time known as the
Ettrick Shepherd	PERSON	of the '' Noctes Ambrosianae '' more widely than as the author of '' Kilmeny . ''

		Or , in other words ,
Hogg	PERSON	even in his lifetime was known , not merely as he could present himself to the public but as the none too scrupulous
Wilson	PERSON	, or sometimes
Lockhart	PERSON	, chose to present him .

		This is certainly a strange predicament .

		We think of no analogy save that of
Socrates	LOCATION	, and he was in his lifetime known personally and not as he appears in the Dialogues of Plato .

		This curious double character of
Hogg	ORGANIZATION	is fully appreciated by Sir
George Douglas	PERSON	, who has just written the vol - ume devoted to him in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		Professor
Ferrier	PERSON	, who edited the '' Noctes , '' was of the opinion that
Hogg	PERSON	would be better known to posterity in the character given him by
Wilson	PERSON	than in his own .

		Sir
George	PERSON	naturally holds to the facts ; he decidedly prefers '' the simple , kindly , unsophisticated farmer of Yarrow as he stands ' in his rights of a man , ' ow - ing nothing to art , his imperfections on his head '' to '' the sham
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	, the fatuous amorist of his own eloquence , the maudlin retailer of tirades ad libitum over whisky-punch at a tavern . ''

		We incline to agree with him , and to differ with Pro- fessor
Ferrier	PERSON	as to posterity , which now does not know much or care much about the ''
Noctes Am	ORGANIZATION	- brosianae . ''

		Whether it knows or cares much more for the work of
James Hogg	PERSON	may be a question .

		But those who read this sketch of the poet 's life will probably feel some desire to turn for a moment to the work of one of the most typical of Scotch poets .

		It should be added that the volume includes also short sketches of
Tannahill	LOCATION	,
Motherwell	ORGANIZATION	, and
Thorn	LOCATION	.

		In `` The Peasant 's War in
Germany	LOCATION	'' The Peasants War .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
E. Belfast Bax	PERSON	furnishes the second of his series of three volumes on the social side of the German reformation .

		The period is a difficult one to cover owing to the lack of unity in the various separated revolutionary movements , and to their having oc - curred at nearly the same time .

		The details of each rising are narrated with careful discrimination between fact and tradition .

		Occasional digressions , suggested by the events of his period , on the phil - osophy of socialistic movements in general , and on the scope of modern socialism in particular , seem rather forced , and mar the general excellence of the author 's work .

		A sharp contrast is justly drawn between the essential spirit of the reformation , and the objects sought by the peasant 's war .

		The re - formation was wholly individualistic and modern in its tendency , while the material purposes of the peasants were communistic and mediaeval , and were therefore doomed to failure in the end .

		Yet the wrongs of the peasants were not to be borne quietly , and whatever their mistaken remedies , the peasant 's war , per se , says Mr.
Bax	PERSON	, was a laudable effort against unjust conditions .

		The author 's impartial - ity in treating of the relations of peasants and princes , both before and during the war , is note - worthy , even when emphasizing the inherent right - fulness of the peasant 's cause .

		Unfortunately this same equitable balance is not consistently main - tained in the references made to the position of the Lutheran theologians toward the peasant move - ment .

		The bare mention of their names brings with it epithets of bitterness and scorn , while Melancthon in particular is designated successively as '' malig - nant toady , '' '' Luther 's little dog , '' and '' Luther 's jackal . ''

		Whatever Mr.
Bax	PERSON	's opinion of these men , the use of such terms is certainly not dignified , and most sensibly detracts from the impression of scholarly impartiality otherwise received .

		A minor criticism from the scholar 's point of view is that while we find in the preface a list of authorities , no specific references to them are anywhere made .

		Nor is there an index , though it may be the inten - tion to supply this for the entire series , in the third and concluding volume , on the Anabaptists , now in preparation .

		An excellent map of
Germany	LOCATION	during the reformation -LRB- from
Spruner-Menke	ORGANIZATION	's Historlscher Atlos -RRB- has been included .

March 16	DATE	, author considers , in a chapter apiece , the social status of the stage , the stage as an artistic career , the necessary qualifications , the best training , dra - matic schools and teachers , and the lights and shad - ows of the life .

		His experience as a dramatic critic has brought him into close relations with the stage , and it is by no means a rose-hued picture he has drawn of the qualifications and training essen - tial to success .

		The question of dramatic art that is to say , of movement in a play and of com - petent execution and acting of it is , of course , distinct from the question of morals ; but , since morality , either positive or negative , is inherently present in everything , moral quality never permits itself to be ignored .

		As a corollary Mr.
Hubert	PERSON	maintains that the actor or actress can not hold his or her own in society that the stage leaves its mark .

		There is a light vein of animosity in this broad statement .

		The question of character should enter more fully into the discussion '' it is the root of the flower , and the flower is as the root makes it . ''

		We have , besides , a paper on '' English Prose , '' and a semi-satirical dialogue called '' The Book-Trotter . ''

		To those familiar with Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's literary characteristics and phil - osophical method these titles alone will convey a fair idea of what the book contains .

		Such readers , at least , will know beforehand that the discussion will be animated and interesting , filled with fine enthusiasm , and couched in a style burly rather than delicate , yet expressive of much good sense and warm sympathy with most worthy matters .

		The touchstone of
Comte	ORGANIZATION	is applied now and then , as a matter of course , and the author 's familiar habit is practiced of massing his praise and dispraise in separate formations .

		The essay on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is probably more imperfect in its sympathies than any of the others , while the three papers on
Raskin	PERSON	exhibit Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's temper and acumen at their best .

		The book as a whole , which is well worth reading , seems to occupy a sort of half-way station between criticism of the kind that endures and criticism that is of the day and year only .

		Brought to the
United States	LOCATION	by the working of a political system which excites our wonder at its selection of its victims , he proved his country 's loss in advocating the cause of good government with a zeal that has left all Americans his debtors .

		Like all Germans of his time , he attached himself to the party of
Hamilton	LOCATION	and
Marshall	PERSON	- : in itself a sufficient answer to those who had detected signs of revolution in him , and the interesting development of his mind toward the more popular forms of American political philoso - phy in later years is almost the only omission in the present volume of which complaint can be made .

		To the American legist and jurist he stands in the light of a pioneer , reducing broad areas of cultivable soil to tillage which , until his coming , had been covered with wild growths .

		To the student world of his time he was almost a prophet , so well organ - ized and so interesting was the combination of knowledge and wisdom he imparted to his classes .

		To the political sphere of his day he appeared as a seer , and many of his theories even now suggest the idea of illumination .

Irving	PERSON	's impersonations so lib - erally , indeed , that the book serves as a moderate anthology in that kind ; and it should be observed that though Mr.

Sir Henry	ORGANIZATION	's career on the sta ^ e from the time of his first appearance at

		The numbers take the form of sixpenny pam - phlets , of which four have thus far been issued , as fol - lows : `` Celtic and Mediaeval Romance , '' by Mr.
Alfred Nutt	PERSON	; `` Folklore : What Is It , and What Is the Good of It ? ''

		by Mr.
E. S. Hartlund	PERSON	; ''
Ossian	PERSON	and the Os - sianic Literature , '' by Mr.
Alfred Nutt	PERSON	; and `` King
Arthur	PERSON	and His Knights , '' by Miss
Jessie L. Westou	PERSON	.

		These are engaging little books , and none the less schol - arly because of their popularizing intent .

		The plan of Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	's new '' Library of En - glish Classics '' is to reproduce , in typographically per - fect reprints , the best existing texts of the masterpieces of English literature , with no fresh editorial material other than a brief bibliographical note to each volume from the pen of Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	.

		Bacon 's Essays and
Sheridan	PERSON	's Plays inaugurate the series , and form two octavo volumes of handsome and dignified outward appearance , and irreproachable typography .

		We trust this commendable enterprise may extend indefi - nitely beyond the twenty-five volumes planned for publication during the present year .

		Mrs.
Sara T. D. Robinson	PERSON	, the widow of the late Governor
Robinson	PERSON	, has issued , through the Lawrence Journal Company , a new edition of her `` Kansas : Its Interior and Exterior Life . ''

		The book was written when Mrs.
Robinson	PERSON	was with her husband in the Le - compton prison , and was first published in
October of 1856	DATE	.

		It ran rapidly through nine editions and exerted an important influence upon Northern opinion at the time .

		Its present interest lies wholly in the fact that it presents an account of important events , written by an eye-witness at the time of their occurrence .

		It is therefore unfortunate that Mrs.
Robinson	PERSON	has in this edition interpolated a good many paragraphs , without distinguishing the new from the old .

		NOTES .

		Messrs.
Eaton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Alma Holman	PERSON	Bar - ton .

		It is a text-book for school children of the younger sort .

		The '' Old South Leaflets '' enter upon their second century of numbers with `` The Rights of War and Peace , '' a translation of the Prolegomena to the great work of Grotius . ''

		A Manual of Zoology , '' by Messrs.
T. Jeffrey Parker	PERSON	and
William A. Haswell	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an American edition with special adaptations and illustrative material .

		The publishers of Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's ''
Trinity Bells	ORGANIZATION	, '' Messrs.
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, announce that the book has just gone into a third edition .

		Its success has been due largely to its exceptional fitness for young girls ' reading .

		The two closing volumes for
1899	DATE	of the series of '' Economic Studies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are '' The English Income Tax , '' by Dr.
Joseph A. Hill	PERSON	, and '' The Effects of Recent Changes in
Monetary Standards	ORGANIZATION	upon the Distribution of Wealth , '' by Mr.
Francis S. Kinder	PERSON	.

		A unique addition to the numerous reprints of `` The Compleat Angler '' is the
India	LOCATION	paper '' Thumb '' edi - tion , published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is about two inches square , and although con - taining 600 pages of text is less than half an inch thick .

		The publishers of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's long-deferred '' American Anthology '' state that owing to the editor 's continued illness it has been found possible to issue only the limited large - paper edition of the work this
Spring	DATE	, publication of the regular trade edition being post - poned until Fall . ''

		Glimpses across the Sea , '' by Mr.
Sam T. Clover	PERSON	, is published at
Evanston	LOCATION	, 111. , by the
Windiknowe Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lishing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pleasant volume of sketches of travel in
Europe	LOCATION	, enlivened by humor and shrewd ob - servation .

		The contents are reprinted from the '' Even - ing Post '' of
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		Outlines of the Comparative Physiology and Mor - phology of Animals , '' by Professor
Joseph Le Conte	PERSON	, is a text - book just published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		It presents a general view of its subject rather than that study of selected types that has found favor of late , and that many educators believe to have been overdone .

		By degrees the writings of
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	are trickling into the light of the more permanent publicity that appertains to books as distinguished from period - icals .

		Three small volumes of his verse have been put forth , and now
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	an - nounce a volume of his prose and letters for early pub - lication .

		In connection with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will shortly begin the publication of a series of international primers forming a Primer-Cyclopaedia .

		The aim is to provide in a con - venient and accessible form the information which the usual bulky and high priced encyclopaedias place beyond the easy reach of the average reader .

		The series will accordingly aim at the comprehensive in - clusion of the chief department of Literature , Science and Art , and each volume will be the work of a spec - ialist on the subject treated .

		Recent English texts and supplementary reading books include the following : Irving 's `` The
Alhambra	LOCATION	, ''
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 edited by Mr.
A. M. Hitchcock	PERSON	;
Scott	PERSON	's ''
Marmion	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
George B. Aiton	PERSON	; and
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Sir Launfal '' and other poems , edited by Mr.
Herbert Bates	PERSON	.

		These three are published by the
Macmillau Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the Messrs. Appleton we have '' Stories from the Arabian Nights , '' selected by Mr.
Adam Singleton	PERSON	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	sends us ''
South America	LOCATION	, '' a geo - graphical reader by Mr.
F. G. Carpenter	PERSON	; `` A Tale of Two Cities , '' edited by Miss
Ella Boyce Kirk	PERSON	; and '' The
Talisman	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Miss
Julia M. Dewey	PERSON	.

		Dante 's '' Paradiso '' is a new '' Temple '' classic which , like the recent edition of the ''
Laxdale Saga	PERSON	, '' indicates a purpose on the part of the editor to enlarge the scope of this series of books beyond what have heretofore been its limits .

		The little volume contains the text of the '' Paradiso '' faced by Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	's prose trans - lation .

		Each canto is supplied with an argument and notes , the contribution of Messrs.
Wicksteed	PERSON	and Oels - ner .

		There are also given the necessary maps and charts .

		No announcement is made of similar editions of the other two cantiche , but the demand for them is likely to be such as to force their preparation .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' A
Practical Treatise	ORGANIZATION	on French Model Auxiliaries , '' by Dr.
Alfred Hennequin	PERSON	; `` French Prose of the XVII .

		Century , '' edited by Prof.
F. M. Warren	PERSON	; '' Scenes de la Re * vo - lution Franchise '' from Lamartiue 's '' Girondins , '' edited by Professor O. B. Super ; and Moliere 's '' Las Pre ` cieuses Ridicules , '' edited by Professor
Walter D. Toy	PERSON	.

		An edition of the last-named play , edited by Dr.
C. Fontaine	PERSON	, is also sent us by Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	. ''

		French Reading for Beginners , '' edited by Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an abridgment of '' La Tulipe Noire , '' by
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, made and edited by Professor
Edgar E. Bran	PERSON	- don .

		The
International Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, Art and
Education	ORGANIZATION	is an organization that was projected last
September	DATE	, when the British and French Associations for the advancement of Science held their meetings at
Dover	LOCATION	and Boulogne , respec - tively .

		Special committees were appointed under the general presidency of M. Le `` on Bourgeois .

		It is plan - ned to hold an
International Assembly	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	during the
summer	DATE	of the Exposition , in connection with the comprehensive scheme of Congresses which will be in
Paris	LOCATION	, as it was in
Chicago	LOCATION	, an important adjunct to the work of
the Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		As Secretary of the British contingent of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in charge , Professor
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	is now in the
United States	LOCATION	for the purpose of securing the cooperation of our scientific and educational forces in the prosecution of this im - portant and altogether praiseworthy undertaking .

		In a general way , it may be said that the Assembly will aim to secure to those who take advantage of its ar - rangements the fullest benefits of the Exposition , and of its auxiliary congresses .

		Provision will be made for classes , lectures , expert guidance , excursions , and social gatherings , whichshould greatly enhance the profit of American students in
Paris	LOCATION	during the coming sum - mer .

		The energy and contagious enthusiasm of Pro- fessor
Geddes	PERSON	are such that his present mission is sure to be productive of good results , and we cordially in - vite those interested in the matter to put themselves into communication with him .

		He may be addressed at any time in care of the
United States Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS .

		THE DIAL 'S annual Spring Announcement List , pre - sented herewith , is considerably larger than any previ - ous list of the kind that we have yet given our readers at this time of year .

		Over 700 titles are included , as against 600 a year ago .

		It is not intended to name in this list any books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books ; and all the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being in - cluded unless having new form or matter .

		The list presents , therefore , a real survey of the new and forth - coming books of the
Spring of 1900	DATE	, carefully classified , and compiled from authentic data .

		A story of thrilling adventure and heroism , drawn from the great treasure-house of such scenes modern missionary enterprise .

		It shows anew , that missionary truth is stranger and more exciting than the old time fiction of adventure .

		The leading character is a hero in many senses , for he not only braves the dangers of Tierra del Fuego , but he gives up the girl he loves , when she makes it a question of choice between her and the call of the Master .

		In the end he gains more than he has lost , for he wins her back , a devoted woman , by his heroic example .

		The English surroundings of the '' home '' features of the story , give it a quaint and pleasant setting which will be attractive to readers on this side of the water .

		Two Volumes .

		Illustrated ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	; or in One Volume , 853 pages ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		The works of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	have frequently been compared .

		They have both written historical romances complete in themselves and yet in which the same characters made their appearance in several success - ive volumes bearing different titles .

		When we decided to issue `` Knights of the Cross '' we believed that either the conclusion had been reached , and such announcement purposely omitted , or else that we might expect it to continue for an indefinite period .

		When the death of a heroine is recorded , either the end is reached or the hero must undergo a further series of adventure .

		In other words , to make an artistic success of a romance sufficient time must elapse ere the hero be permitted to make a second serious conquest of the heart or succumb to the inevitable , if the lady say him nay .

		It was only while the book was on the press that we learned that more was to follow , but inasmuch as a complete romance was given the reader , we felt that we were justified in issuing the book as it was , and our opinion is confirmed by the perfect satisfaction our edition has given to the thousands of purchasers of Dr.
Sam	PERSON	- uel
A. Binion	PERSON	's translation .

		Our edition must of necessity have been translated from the Polish , as the complete - ness of our edition clearly demonstrates that not sufficient time has elapsed for us to make the translation from the Russian edition .

		What has struck me especially is the freshness and directness with which it appeals to the average school-boy and school-girl .

		It attacks the problem of writing as they have to cope with it , talks the plain and vigorous common sense which they are likely to appreciate , and offers illustrations which are often striking and always directly to the point .

		258 THE ARTIST AND THE MAN .

		Among the many principles for which the late
John Raskin	PERSON	contended with all the force of his impassioned and vehement eloquence , there is one which occupies a peculiarly signi - ficant position .

		It is the principle that a man 's art and a man 's character are so mutually de - pendent that the latter is implicit in the former .

		This principle is central in the great critic 's doctrine , for it supplies the nexus whereby his ethics and his esthetics become united into a single body of teaching .

		It affords the justi - fication fpr his constant injection of moral ques - tions into his discussions of art , and for his persistent employment of artistic illustrative material in his treatment of the problems that relate to the conduct of life .

		The principle in question finds its typical expression in such sentences as these : '' The faults of a work of art are the faults of its workman , and its vir - tues his virtues . '' ''

		Great art is the expression of the mind of a great man , and mean art , that of the want of mind of a weak man . '' ''

		And always , from the least to the greatest , as the made thing is good or bad , so is the maker of it . '' ''

		When once you have learned how to spell those most precious of all legends , pictures and buildings , you may read the characters of men , and of nations , in their art , as in a mirror ; nay , as in a microscope , and mag - nified a hundredfold ; for the character becomes passionate in the art , and intensifies itself in all its noblest or meanest delights . ''

		Finally , the doctrine of these pronouncements receives summing-up in the following impressive fash - ion : '' Of all facts concerning art , this is the one most necessary to be known , that , while manufacture is the work of hands only , art is the work of the whole spirit of man ; and as that spirit is , so is the deed o ' f it ; and by what - ever power of vice or virtue any art is produced , the same vice or virtue it reproduces and teaches . ''

		There are many impulsive sayings to be found in the forty or fifty volumes of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, many opinions too clearly born of a moment 's intellectual caprice to be deserving of more than a moment 's attention , but these which we have quoted do not belong to that category .

		They are rather the deliberate records of a life - 240 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, long belief , time and time again solemnly re - affirmed , and fundamental to a comprehension of the whole structure of their author 's thought .

		That the proposition which they embody has been vigorously denied is matter of common intelligence among those familiar with the cur - rents of critical discussion during the past half - century or more .

		The doctrine of '' art for art 's sake '' falls to pieces unless we reject the notion that the character of the artist is re - flected in his work .

		That doctrine has exerted a strong influence upon criticism , and there was a time , not so many years ago , when it seemed to hold the field against its opponents .

		If we consider the case of literary art alone , there were two excellent reasons for the apparent ascendancy of this opinion in the forum of aesthetical controversy .

		The first was offered by the fact that didacticism in literature had been greatly overdone .

		When we think of the long and dreary annals of allegorical composi - tion and sermonizing in verse , we naturally revolt from the assumption that this sort of activity has anything to do with literature proper , and it gives us a sense of satisfaction to take refuge in even the extreme opinion that poetry has no business to teach anything , that its message is that of pure beauty , and that , by just so much as it departs from this aim , its purpose becomes weakened , and its spiritual power impaired .

		The second reason which seemed to justify the principle of '' art for art 's sake '' was offered by those over-zealous critics of literature who were constantly dragging petty personalities into their work , raising a great pother over the superficial aspects of a poet 's private life , and making out of some carelessness of habit or fault of temper a struc - tural defect in character which must always be kept in the foreground of thought when the poet 's work was under consideration .

		It was no wonder that these two influences combined drove many sensitive intelligences to the ex - treme of revolt .

		The fact that , on the one hand , such didacticism as Young 's '' Night Thoughts '' and
Pollok	PERSON	's `` Course of Time '' could pass for poetry at all , and that , on the other , whole sections of the reading public should be warned against the poetry of
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	because their lives did not square with the social conventions of their time this twofold fact , we say , based upon a false perspective and a complete misunderstanding of the poetic art , was amply sufficient to ac - count for the success of a form of teaching whose fundamental object was to restore to poetry the dignity which it seemed to be in danger of losing .

		When , however , we come to take a broader view of the whole question , it must be admitted that the doctrine of '' art for art 's sake , '' the doctrine that the artist must deliberately es - chew the intention of teaching , that , if he have the divine fire within him , the purity of its glow will remain undimmed whatever the life he may lead , is almost as narrow as the doc - trine against which it was raised in protest .

		Because certain dull poets have been offen - sively didactic we have no right to say that poets of genius may not engage their powers in the furtherance of worthy ideals .

		That some great poets have had personal failings , about which their critics have been more curious than was necessary , is no reason why we should deny that , other things being equal , the blame - less life will in the long run express itself in nobler forms than the life that has not escaped '' the contagion of the world 's slow stain . ''

		As far as the latter of these two propositions is concerned , we take a just pride in the thought that
Milton	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	were no less great as men than as poets , and , while giving full acceptance as poetry to the work of men whose character we may not call unblemished , it would distinctly add to our satisfaction could we know them to have lived lives in stricter consonance with their ideals .

		As for the for - mer proposition , we need only point to the long line of great poets who have allied their work with the practical human causes of religious and ethical teaching , of political and social progress .

		From the defence of the Areopagus and the old conservative order by .

		^ Eschylus to the denunciation by Hugo of the saturnalia of a bastard French imperialism , the most famous of poets have ever been ready have found themselves irresistibly impelled to make their work tell in the never-ending struggle between truth and error , between right and wrong , be - tween the conservative and the destructive agencies in the life of the social organism .

		How does our star-like
Milton	PERSON	serve to illum - inate the doctrine of '' art for art 's sake '' ?

		It is true that he turned from serene verse to stormy prose in his championship of the strug - gling Puritan Commonwealth , but it is also true that when he turned again to verse his thought took on a new majesty , and that the deepest feelings of puritanism are to be found rather in his epics than in his polemics .

		Surely , our literature has no nobler art than that of the '' Paradise Lost , '' but was the poem written
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		241 for '' art 's sake '' alone ?

		Not unless we take '' art 's sake '' and '' life 's sake '' to be synony - mous , which they probably are , if our defini - tions be made sufficiently liberal .

		In the final synthesis , beauty and truth and virtue are one and the same thing , and the '' art 's sake '' shib - boleth appears but a question-begging phrase .

		We can not judge the artist without in large measure judging the man as well , for as Pro- fessor
Corson	PERSON	says , speaking of such poets as
Milton	LOCATION	, '' their personalities and their works are consubstantial . ''

		But we may easily make the mistake and often do make it of bas - ing our estimate of a poet 's character too much upon the trivial outward aspects of his life , and too little upon the writings in which his inmost self stands clearly revealed .

		If his actions and his books give each other the lie , why should we jump to the conclusion that the written ex - pression of character must be insincere ; why not take the more reasonable view that the true personality is to be sought in the books ?

		They , at least , if read aright , offer a form of self - expression that is deliberate and clear ; while a man 's daily actions are impulsive and open to a hundred misinterpretations .

		Again writing of
Milton	LOCATION	, Professor
Corson	PERSON	says : '' His personality is felt in his every production , poetical and prose , and felt almost as much in the earliest as in the latest period of his authorship .

		And there is no epithet more applicable to his own personality than the epithet
august	DATE	.

		He is therefore one of the most educating of authors , in the highest sense of the word , that is , educating in the direction of sanctified character . ''

		What is here said of
Milton	LOCATION	we believe to be equally true of Shake - speare .

		We all know what
Wordsworth	PERSON	said of the sonnet , that '' with this key
Shakespeare	PERSON	unlocked his heart , '' how
Browning	PERSON	replied to this dictum with an indignant , '' If so , the less Shakespeare he , '' and how
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in a vein similar to that of
Browning	PERSON	, wrote these lines : '' Others abide our question .

		Thou art free .

		We ask and ask Thou smilest and art still , Out-topping knowledge . ''

		In this conflict of opinion , it seems to us that
Wordsworth	PERSON	has expressed the deeper truth .

		It is true that the closest scrutiny of Shake - speare 's work will not give us the facts about his boyish poaching upon Sir
Thomas Lucy	PERSON	's preserves , or explain the mystery of that '' second-best bed '' bequeathed to his wife .

		But the knowledge of a man 's personality does not depend upon such trivialities as these .

		We know his qualities of heart and mind better than we know those of our closest friends .

		We know what he thought upon most serious subjects r and how he felt about human life in its most significant aspects .

		The superstition which would have us believe that , as a dramatist , he exhibited the personalities of his created char - acters and concealed his own beyond any pos - sibility of surmise has been tenacious , but is at last losing its hold upon intelligent students .

		The little book of Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	upon the man
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the still more recent book of Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	upon the same subject , are interesting records of the change of opinion upon this subject .

		Still more interesting is the closing paragraph of the important work of Shakespearian criticism which we owe to Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	: '' The
William Shakespeare	PERSON	who was born at Stratf ord - on-Avon in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, who lived and wrote in
London	LOCATION	in her reign and that of
James	PERSON	, who ascended into heaven in his comedies and descended into hell in his tragedies , and died at the age of fifty-two in his native town , rises a wonderful personality in grand and distinct outlines , with all the vivid coloring of life from the pages of his books , before the eyes of all who read them with an open , receptive mind , with sanity of judgment , and simple susceptibility to the power of genius . ''

		THOREAU AS A HUMORIST .

		There are many volumes purporting to set out the choicest bits of American humor , but the compilers of practically all of them have omitted an important contributor to this branch of our literature .

		It is a question if there exists another set of books -LRB- of wisdom , at least -RRB- so potent for smiles , even hearty laughs , as are the works of
Henry D. Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an oversight that his mirthful sayings have never been exploited by the excerptors .

		Even those who have essayed to interpret him in criticism have not adequately reckoned with this phase of his genius .


Stevenson	PERSON	, for instance , in his rather querulous ap - praisement of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, but mentioned the gift ; and then , as it seems , only to the end of carping at the author for expunging some of its manifestations from his later works .

		The truth is , here is a rich vein of humor which belonged to Thoreau by right of inheritance ; his mother , and the
Dunbar	PERSON	family of which she was a member , were remarkable , ac - cording to one of the biographers , for their keen dramatic humor and intellectual sprightliness . ''

		Direct communication with the risible muscles of the globe '' amounted to a family trait .


Thoreau	PERSON	said of
Carlyle	LOCATION	that he lacked the repose in his inmost being necessary to make his humor thoroughly genial and placid .

		Repose in his inmost being one should say
Thoreau	PERSON	did have in a pre - vailing degree .

		His humor , for the best part if not 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, for the most part , is blue and transparent as the surface of Walden Fond itself .

		And when the smoothness of the mood is less it is as a rule , like the Pond and the poet 's serenity , '' rippled but not ruffled . ''

		Of course ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's is not always a perfectly good-humored humor ; it is often acrid .

		If he make you laugh , you not rarely find that you are laughing at somebody , or at mankind .

		One who offends his ideals he is capable of flaying rather mercilessly , with wit for a whip .

		The unlucky wight who named
Flint	LOCATION	's Fond for himself comes in for a scolding whose ill-temper is hardly atoned for by its eloquence .

		Usually , however ,
Thoreau	PERSON	wields his weapon lightly , relying upon the dexterity in preference to the force of his thrust .

		He is given to impaling his -LRB- intellectual -RRB- enemies , not with the bayonet , so to speak , but upon the point of his deli - cate naturalist 's needle .

		In the midst of a matter - of-fact account of his bean-raising , he turns a laugh at the expense of the grosser public when a joke is least expected .

		His enemies in this gardening en - terprise , we are informed , were worms and wood - chucks ; '' soon , however , '' he reflects dryly , '' the remaining beans will be too tough for them , and go forward to meet new foes . ''

		At other times the fun is weak or quite abortive .

		He enjoys making a pun , and , punster like , especially a poor one ; but he is so guileless about it that one easily forgives him these trespasses .

		But there are many touches of sheer pleasantry with no one for butt .

		When he relates going to take possession of the hut he has purchased -LRB- for its boards -RRB- of the Irish workingman , he runs on whim - sically : `` At six I passed him and his family on the road .

		One large bundle held their all , bed , coffee-mill , looking-glass , hens , all but the cat ; she took to the woods and became a wild cat , and , as I learned afterward , trod in a trap set for woodchucks , and so became a dead cat at last . ''

		Again , what fisherman but would confirm the phil - osopher 's experience that he '' found the increase of fair bait to be nearly as the squares of the dis - tances '' ?

		Some of these quips and sallies are turned neatly and packed tersely enough to be likened for their keeping qualities to the staple article described in the following amusing bit : '' Who has not seen a salt fish , thoroughly cured for this world , so that nothing can spoil it , and putting the persever - ance of the saints to blush ?

		with which you may sweep or pare the streets , and split your kindlings , and the teamster shelter himself and his lading against the sun , wind , and rain behind it , and the trader , as a
Concord	LOCATION	trader once did , hang it up by his door for a sign when he commences busi - ness , until at last his oldest customer can not tell surely whether it be animal , vegetable , or mineral , and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake , and if it be put into a pot and boiled , will come out an excellent dun fish for a
Saturday	DATE	's dinner . ''

		The volume in which
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's natural playful - ness finds freest vent is perhaps ''
Cape Cod	LOCATION	'' a book to be prescribed in cases of the blues , espe - cially to nature lovers .

		The science , philosophy , common-sense , poetical narrative here are seasoned continually with unmistakable humor .

		There is page upon page of delicious banter , directed now at the author of the old Cape history
Thoreau	PERSON	reads under his umbrella , now at the quaint coast towns and the townspeople , now at the church and its ministers .

		His authority has lauded Sandwich town bravely , but
Thoreau	PERSON	demurs : '' Ours was but half a Sandwich at most , and that must have fallen on the buttered side some time . ''

		He reads of the prosperity of the worthy citizens of
Chatham	LOCATION	: '' In many families there is no difference between the breakfast and supper ; cheese , cakes , and pies being as common at the one as at the other . ''

		To which , Thoreau : '' But that leaves us still uncertain whether they were really common at either . ''

		He describes an unprepossessing Nauset woman as one who `` looked as if it made her head ache to live . ''

		In
1662	DATE	,
Eastham	LOCATION	, according to this history , decreed that a part of every whale cast on shore should be appro - priated for the support of the ministry . ''

		The ministers must have sat upon the cliffs in every storm , and watched the shore with anxiety . ''

		East - ham also voted that every married man be required to kill so many crows or blackbirds , since these fowls were a pest in the grain fields . ''

		But , '' ob - serves the facetious bachelor from
Concord	LOCATION	, '' the blackbirds still molest the corn , ... from which I concluded , that either many men were not married , or many blackbirds were . ''

		In ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' if the book be read with an eye to this element , one may enjoy a running feast of humor of a quality seldom matched in a book primarily serious .

		To an idealist who has once for all cast in his lot with his idealism , the spec - tacle of the work-a-day world is not only life with - out principle , it is life without sense .

		The farmer , in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's view , is '' Endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula more complicated than the problem itself .

		To get his shoe-strings he speculates in herds of cattle ... And when the farmer has got his house he may not be the richer but the poorer for it , and it be the house that has got him .

		... I would say to my fellows , once for all , live free and uncommitted .

		It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail . ''

		The man of business is eager for the newspaper , taking it up with the demand , '' ' Pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe , ' and he reads it over his coffee and rolls , that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the
Wachito River	LOCATION	; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed Mammoth Cave of this world , and has but the rudiment of an eye himself . ''

		Some of the sage 's reflections under the topic '' Economy , `` charged with a mother-wit and homely wisdom that can not be gainsaid , have become fa - miliar to everyone . ''

		Kings and queens who wear a suit of clothes but once can not know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits .

		They are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on ... For most men ... it would be easier to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon ... We know but few men , a great many coats and breeches .

		Dress a scarecrow in your last shift , you standing shiftless by , who would not soonest salute the scarecrow ? ' '

		When
Thoreau	PERSON	asked that a garment be made in
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 some particular way , the local tailoress disposed of his request by calmly saying , '' They do not make them so now . ''

		Thoreau puzzled over this awhile , wondering who the mysterious '' they '' might be , and why their preference as to patterns should be binding on him ; and presently , thinking of no bet - ter rejoinder , replied : '' It is true they did not make them so recently , but they do now . ''

		This quite nonplussed the good woman , and
Thoreau	PERSON	got his clothes as he wanted them .

		As regards shelter ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's requirements may seem to smack of levity , though he protests he is far from jesting . ''

		Furniture ! ''

		he cries , '' Thank God , I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse ... Formerly ... I used to see a large box by the railroad , six feet long by three wide , in which the laborers locked up their tools at night , and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a dollar , and having bored a few auger holes in it , to admit the air at least , get into it when it rained , and at night , and hook down the lid , and so have freedom in his love , and in his soul be free . ''

		People used sometimes to ask the poet if he were not lonely at
Walden	LOCATION	.

		He answers : '' I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud , or than
Walden Pond	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		... I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture , or a bean leaf , or sorrel , or a house-fly , or a humble-bee . ''

		He knew the emptiness of the ordinary social existence and stated it with charac - teristic drollery : '' We meet at meals three times a day and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are . ''

		At the same time , to visitors at
Walden	LOCATION	, and to visits paid thence by
Thoreau	LOCATION	, are owing some of the most delightful of classic passages .

		The
Cana	LOCATION	- dian Wood-chopper long since acquired fame as a piece of character - drawing . ''

		He was so genuine and unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him , more than if you introduced a woodchuck to a neighbor . ''

		This was the original
Thoreau	PERSON	appreciator from the point of view herein , who reclined on a log while the two conversed , and who '' sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with laughter at anything which made him think and tickled him . ''

		The casual visit to
Baker Farm	ORGANIZATION	, where
Thoreau	PERSON	retreated upon being over - taken by a thunder storm , affords this inimitable sketch : '' -LSB- Here -RSB- dwelt now
John Field	ORGANIZATION	, an Irishman , and his wife and several children , from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work , and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain , to the wrinkled , sybil-like , cone - headed infant that sat upon its father 's knee as in the palaces of nobles , and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger , with the privi - lege of infancy , not knowing but it was the last of a noble line and the hope and cynosure of the world , instead of
John Field	ORGANIZATION	's poor starveling brat ... An honest , hard-working , but shiftless man plainly was
John Field	PERSON	; and his wife she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the re - cesses of that lofty stove ; with round greasy face and bare breast , still thinking to improve her condition one day ; with the never absent mop in one hand , and yet no effects of it visible anywhere .

		The chickens , which had also taken shel - ter here from the rain , stalked about the room like members of the family , too humanized , methought , to roast well .

		They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe signifi - cantly . ''

		Of this kind of comedy
Thoreau	PERSON	was well-nigh master .

		One other example -LRB- from the chapter on '' Sounds '' -RRB- refuses to be left unquoted : '' Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over bridges , a sound heard farther than almost any other at night , the baying of dogs , and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn - yard .

		In the meanwhile all the shore rang with the trump of bull-frogs , the sturdy spirits of ancient wine - bibbers and wassailers , still unrepentant , trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake , if the
Walden	LOCATION	nymphs will pardon the comparison , for though there are almost no weeds , there are frogs there , who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables , though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave , mocking at mirth , and the wine has lost its flavor , and become only liquor to distend their paunches , and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past , but mere sat - uration and waterloggedness and distention .

		The most alder - manic , with his chin upon a heart-leaf , which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps , under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water , and passes round a cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk , ir-r-r-oonk , tr-r-r-oonk !

		and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated , where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark ; and when this observ - ance has made the circuit of the shores , then ejaculates the master of ceremonies , with satisfaction , tr-r-r-oonk !

		and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended , leak - iest , and flabbiest paunched , that there be no mistake ; and then the bowl goes round again and again , until the sun dis - perses the morning mist , and only the patriarch is not under the pond , but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time , and pausing for a reply . ''

		Let it be hoped that some day the appreciation will be general that this is a higher kind of humor than any machine output of our professional wits or comic papers .

		When the understanding does come , and along with the comfits people swallow the pills of wisdom ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's cure for the world 's ills will begin to take effect .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-


Francis Douce	PERSON	was the author of '' Illustrations of Shakspere , '' which was one time regarded as a text book of high authority .

		When the work first appeared , critics assailed the author with great fierceness , and he , being sensitive and irritable , determined never to publish any - thing more .

		A legacy was left him by
Nollekens	PERSON	, the sculptor , which enabled him to live without resort to his pen , and he kept his word excepting for an occa - sional magazine article .

		He died in
1834	DATE	.

		But he left some manuscripts in iron-bound boxes , and by his will directed that they be kept in the manuscript room of the British Museum , and remain unopened until Jan -
uary 1 , 1900	DATE	.

		Has the literary world received any notice of the opening of the boxes ?

		If not , perhaps this note from '' a man with a memory '' may serve as a '' pointer '' to some enterprising publisher .

		AN UNFINISHED RECORD OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR .

		* '' From
Cape Town	LOCATION	to Ladysmith '' is the collective title of fifteen letters written by the late
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	for a
London	LOCATION	newspaper , from the seat of the South African war .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	died , as the world learned to its sor - row , in
January	DATE	last of enteric fever at Lady - smith ; and in him the type or school of jour - nalism he wrought in lost perhaps its ablest and most representative exponent .

		Mr.
Steev	PERSON	- ens arrived at
Cape Town	LOCATION	on
October 10	DATE	, and he gives his impressions of that somewhat lan - guid community in an interesting letter which forms the first chapter of the present volume .

		After spending a few days at
Cape Town	LOCATION	and en route to the seat of impending hostilities , he reached Ladysmith about
October 20	DATE	; and from there ten of the fifteen letters are written .

		In his letter , dated
October 14	DATE	, from Burghers - dorp , a stronghold of bitter Dutch partisanship , Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	recounts his interview with the presiding genius of the place , a pastor who edited its Dutch paper , dictated its Dutch pol - itics , and poured out weekly vials of wrath upon the heads of politicians whose views were more moderate than his own .

		Personally , he turned out to be a genial old gentleman who kept his ill-humor for the printer , and who , while taking his own side strongly in conversation , was quite willing to allow that it was proper for a Briton to be equally strong on the other .

		The substance of his talk may be quoted , as illustrating a phase of Dutch Afrikander opinion . ''

		... I look on this war as the sequel of
1881	DATE	.

		I have told them all these years , it is not finish ; war must come ... The trouble is because the Boer have never had confidence in the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	, just as you have never had confidence in us .

		The Boer have no feeling about
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	, but they have about
Natal	LOCATION	; they were driven out of it , and they think it still their own country .

		Then you took the diamond-fields from the Free State ... Then came annexation of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	; up to that I was strong advocate of federa - tion , but after that I was one of the founders of the Bond .

		After that the Afrikander trusted
Rhodes	PERSON	not I , though ; I always write I distrust
Rhodes	PERSON	and so came the
Jameson	PERSON	raid .

		Now how could we have confidence after all this in British Government ?

		I do not think
Transvaal Government	ORGANIZATION	has been wise ; I have many times told them so .

		They made great mistake when they let people come into the mines .

		I told them , This gold will be their ruin ; to remain independent you * FBOM CAPE TOWN TO LADYSMITH .

		must remain poor .

		But when that was done , what could they do ?

		If they gave the franchise , then the Republic is governed by three four men from
Johannes	PERSON	- burg , and they will govern it for their own pocket .

		The
Transvaal Boer	ORGANIZATION	would rather be British colony than
Johannesburg Republic	LOCATION	.

		Well , well : it is the law of
South Africa	LOCATION	that the Boer drive the native north and the English drive the Boer north .

		But now the Boer can go north no more ; two things stop him : the tsetse fly and the fever .

		So if he must perish , it is his duty , yes , I , minister , say it is his duty to perish fighting . ''

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	gives a vivid account of the Elandslaagte fight '' battle , '' he calls it in which testimony is borne to the humanity of the victors : '' And mark and remember for the rest of your lives that
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	made no distinction between the wounded enemy and his dearest friend .

		To the men who in the afternoon were lying down behind rocks with rifles pointed to kill him , who had shot , may be , the comrade of his heart , he gave the last drop of his water , the last drop of his melting strength , the last drop of comfort he could wring out of his seared , gal - lant soul .

		... A few men had made a fire in the gnaw - ing damp and cold , and round it they sat , the unwounded Boer prisoners .

		For themselves they took the outer ring , and not a word did any man say that could mor - tify the wound of defeat .

		In the afternoon
Tommy	PERSON	was a hero , in the evening he was a gentleman . ''

		When the
Boers	PERSON	' turn came , at
Nicholson	ORGANIZATION	's Nek , they , too , showed that when the duty of slaughter was done , and the fighting devil in them was laid , they could return to the ways of humanity , and do those acts which go to save the battlefield from being a scene of diabolism pure and simple : '' As
Atkins	PERSON	had tended their wounded there and succoured their prisoners , so they tended and succoured him here ... They gave the whole men the water out of their own bottles ; they gave the wounded the blan - kets off their own saddles and slept themselves on the naked veldt .

		They were short of transport and they were mostly armed with Martinis ; yet they gave cap - tured mules for the hospital panniers and captured Lee-Metfords for splints .

		Some of them asked soldiers for their embroidered waist-belts as mementoes of the day . '

		It 's got my money in it , ' replied
Tommy	PERSON	a little surly , small wonder and the captor said no more .

		Then they set to singing doleful hymns of praise under trees .

		Apparently they were not specially elated . ''

		Everybody who has read of the siege of Ladysmith has read of '' Long Tom , '' a lead - ing performer in that dreary drama , but not a very destructive or formidable one , if we may believe Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	. ''

		... ` He is a friendly old gun , and for my part I have none but the kindest feelings towards him .

		It was his duty to shell us , and he did ; but he did it in an open , manly way .

		Behind the half-county of light red earth they had piled up round him you could see his ugly phiz thrust up and look hungrily round .

		A jet of flame and a spreading toadstool of thick white smoke told us he had fired .

		On the flash , four-point-seven
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 banged his punctilious reply .

		You waited until you saw the black smoke jump behind the red mound , then Tom was due in a second or two .

		A red flash a jump of red-brown dust and smoke a rending-crash : he had arrived .

		Then sank slowly through the air his frag - ments , like wounded birds .

		You could hear them com - ing , and they came with dignified slowness : there was plenty of time to get out of the way .

		Until the capture of Long Tom when he will be treated with the utmost consideration I am not able to tell you exactly what brand of gun he may be .

		It is evident from his con - servative use of black powder , and the old-gentlemanly staidness of his movements , that he is an elderly gun .

		... Anyhow , he conducted his enforced task with all possible humanity . ''

		S tee vena 's recital breaks off with pathetic abruptness .

		There is not much of it only 156 well-leaded pages ; and these are supple - mented by a memorial chapter from the hand of the editor , Mr.
Vernon Blackburn	PERSON	.

		The cable that flashed the news of
Steevens	PERSON	's death to
England	LOCATION	states that a few days before the nd came he had so far recovered as to be able to do some journalistic work .

		Relapse fol - lowed , and he died at five in the
afternoon	TIME	.

		The cabled account of the funeral paints a mournful little picture quite in
Steevens	LOCATION	's own manner : '' Funeral same night , leaving
Carter	PERSON	's house at eleven thirty .

		Interred at Ladysmith cemetery at
midnight	TIME	.

		Night dismal , rain falling , while the moon attempted to pierce the black clouds .

		Boer searchlight from Um - balaa flashed over the funeral party , showing the way in the darkness . ''

		`` Long Tom , '' we may fancy , boomed a requiem over the grave .

		Steevens was an exceptionally gifted painter of swiftly executed word-pictures in the impres - sionist style ; and descriptive journalism was therefore his true field .

		Afterthought , elabo - ration , retouching , must in some degree have taken the life and freshness out of his work .

		It has been regretted that he chose for his province journalism instead of literature
Csome	PERSON	- body , of course , must always have his fling at journalism -RRB- ; but we think
Stevens	PERSON	knew best what he was good for , and that he chose wisely .

		As journalist he served the world well , and blazed a new path for others ; and then how much literature there was in his journalism !

		Proud spirits among us , condemned to a brief sojourn on a planet not specially swept and garnished for them , groan daily over the vices of the press , as if the press had nothing but vices .

		The press , like other human contriv - ances , might be a good deal better than it is ; and it certainly does not reflect the tastes and cravings of an ideal humanity .

		But it is fair to say that it makes on the whole powerfully for good in the world .

		It holds out , too , a generous reward to ability of the kind it needs .

		It turned the stream of Pactolus , or a saving rivulet therefrom , at least , into starving Grub Street .

		It gave
Steevens	PERSON	his chance gave him early fame , and set him on the way to fortune .

		Steevens 's style is well described as '' cine - metographic . ''

		We think he tried to attain in his writing precisely the effect called to mind by that expression .

		His descriptions , the char - acteristic ones , affect us like a series of '' cine - metographic '' pictures running swiftly before the mind 's eye .

		There are occasional lapses of taste , expressions too hurriedly minted ; and we tire at last of a series of such phrases as : '' The trains drew up and vomited khaki into the meadow '' ; '' the pipes shrieked of blood and the lust of glorious death '' ; '' the bubble of distant musketry , '' and its '' scrunching roar , '' -LRB- one is reminded of Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	's famous `` crimson roar '' -RRB- .

		But there is no denying the extraordinary vividness of Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's writing , his power of making us see what he wanted us to see .

		His death must be accounted one of the more deplorable results of the iniquitous business now going on in
South Africa	LOCATION	, for his life was a really productive one , of much promise for the future .

		To his per - sonal attractiveness and worth Mr.
Blackburn	PERSON	pays feeling tribute .

		This little book contains his last work ; and it will be prized the more for the excellent portrait that forms the fron - tispiece .

		That a man should achieve eminence in any one of these lines ordinarily would be counted enough , but the present biographer had the pleasant task of giving us an insight into the life of a man of marked achievements in all , the last of the famous group of men who in the closing years of the eighteenth and early years of the nine - teenth centuries have done so much for scien - tific work and thought and for whom there is no better title than the good old word , natur - alist .

Daniel C. 246 THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 1	DATE	, early years , his several books , and his more than two hundred scientific papers , demonstrate his claim to the title of naturalist , his precise and detailed work , particularly in the field of mineralogy , place him in the front rank of specialists even in these days of specialization .

		Dana will probably be remembered longest because of his researches in mineralogy and geology , and in these two branches his text books stand as his greatest works .

		His book on '' Corals and Coral Islands '' and on the '' Characteristics of Volcanoes '' are more de - tailed works , and in a sense are probably of greater permanent value .

		Text books , it is true , must necessarily change from time to time , while detailed observations and records of fact are of continuing worth .

		The essentials , however , of Professor
Dana	PERSON	's work on corals and volcanoes are included in his text books , and the greater comprehensiveness of the latter make them the greater works .

		It is , indeed , in the fact that his Geology includes the result of so much original work that its greatest per - manent value lies .

		Text books must be to some extent compilations , but
Dana	PERSON	's text books are based to an unusual degree upon personal observations and have contained in each new edition much original matter .

		He did original work of high and permanent value , and he chose to publish this in his texts .

		It was , however , as a teacher and interpreter that his greatest work was done .

		His power of accurate gen - eralization and his firm grip on the philosophy of his subject were the elements which gave him the mastery .

		He came into the geological field after the fundamental question of methods was settled .

		Ly ell 's Principles had been pub - lished and accepted before he began his work .

		The Principles , however , while pointing the way to work , gave no suggestion of the evolu - tion of the earth as a whole , and it was
Dana	PERSON	's peculiar privilege to work out this idea .

		His text book , in which the American continent is taken as the type , keeps steadily in view the development of the earth toward a definite re - sult .

		It is not a series of sketches of disjoined geologic periods .

		It is interesting to remember the readiness with which Professor
Dana	PERSON	gave up his per - sonal methods or ideas whenever something better was offered .

		His system of crystallo - graphic symbols , for example , worked out with care and really of high utility , was eventually abandoned for that of
Miller	PERSON	.

		His devotion was to the science , not to his personal methods or ideas .

		Throughout his long and busy life of eighty-two years , there seems to have been no time for thought of self .

		It was all for his work .

		Professor
Dana	PERSON	was twenty years old when in
1833	DATE	he was graduated from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		His bent for scientific work was already pronounced , and his cruise through the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	in 1833-34 served to deepen his inclination .

		He was fortunate in being chosen , and the world of science proved fortunate in that he was chosen , a member of the
Wilke	ORGANIZATION	's exploring expedition , which in the years
1838	DATE	to
1842	DATE	surveyed so much of the
Pacific	LOCATION	in the interest of knowledge .

		It is worth the climb to the upper alcoves of a library to find among the disregarded government publications the mag - nificent quartos in which
Dana	PERSON	and his associ - ates tell the story of this enterprise ; one of which all Americans can well be proud .

		Equipped and maintained at government expense , the little fleet sailed over many miles of known and unknown seas , and in the work of exploration as well as in solid scientific results it amply re - paid the cost .

		No member contributed more to the lasting credit of the work than did
Dana	PERSON	, and no member received more personal benefit than did he .

		The wide experience in many regions and with many sorts of phenomena , coupled with the necessity for close systematic work along the lines assigned to him , gave him the knowledge and the poise which made pos - sible his after work .

		The chapters in which President
Gilman	PERSON	tells the story of this expedition are not the least interesting in the book ; and here , as else - where , he has wisely left the story to be told as much as might be in the words of
Dana	LOCATION	him - self .

		As a result , the letters telling of the dis - covery of
Bowditch Island	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 126 -RRB- , and the ways of the Feejees half a century ago -LRB- p. 131 -RRB- , have all the interest of contemporary writing .

		The pictures of life in
Hawaii	LOCATION	,
Samoa	LOCATION	, Aus - tralia , and on the west coast of the
United States	LOCATION	, are particularly interesting in these days when the
Pacific	LOCATION	holds so much of interest to Americans .

		Upon the return of the expedition
Dana	PERSON	took up the work of studying and describing the specimens collected , and writing his three re - ports covering the geology of the region visited , the zoophytes and the crustaceans .

		This work occupied most of his time from
1842	DATE	to
1856	DATE	, but the reports are of the greatest value .

		In view of his great contributions to the sciences of geology and mineralogy , the fact of his studies in zoology are quite generally over -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 looked .

		It is well to remember that in his re - ports upon the zoophytes and crustaceans he not only had large and puzzling groups to deal with , but that he was almost entirely without the help of previous work .

		The classification which he worked out has been quite generally adopted , and the works were very substantial additions to the then sum total of zoological knowledge .

		One of the interesting features of his work in the
Pacific	LOCATION	was his study of corals and coral islands .

		He worked out independently sub - stantially the same theory of coral islands that is associated with
Darwin	PERSON	's name , and which , with some modification , is the accepted theory of to-day .

		This work later gave rise to his book on Corals and
Coral Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1856	DATE	he assumed the duties of ''
Silliman	PERSON	Professor of Natural History '' at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and up to the time of his death he held this position .

		In
1859	DATE	, and again in
1868	DATE	, his health broke down and he temporarily gave up college work .

		In
1880	DATE	he was released from college duties , though up to the date of his death -LRB- in
April , 1895	DATE	-RRB- he continued to edit the `` American Journal of Science , '' a work which he took up in
1848	DATE	.

		This work , with his classes , the re - vision of his manuals , some field work and original investigations , took up the larger por - tion of his life .

		In the work he was brought into close contact with the leaders of scientific thought of both this country and
Europe	LOCATION	, and among the most interesting features of this biography are the pages given over to the let - ters which passed between
Dana	PERSON	and Gray ,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	,
Guyot	LOCATION	,
Geikie	PERSON	,
Brezelius	PERSON	, De Saussure , and others .

		These letters give one a side view of the development of many phases of scientific thought which can hardly be ob - tained from other sources .

		In
1887	DATE	, when at the age of seventy-four years , Professor
Dana	PERSON	crossed the
United States	LOCATION	, travelled to
Hawaii	LOCATION	and return , and made careful studies of the Hawaiian volcanoes .

		These studies are particularly valuable in view of his wide acquaintance with volcanic phe - nomena beginning with an ascent of Vesuvius in
1834	DATE	and including visits to
Stromboli	LOCATION	,
Milo	PERSON	,
Maderia	LOCATION	, and Cape Verdes -LRB- 1838 -RRB- ,
Tahiti	LOCATION	,
Tutuila	LOCATION	,
Upolu	LOCATION	, and
New South Wales	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	; the Feejees and the Hawaiis in
1840	DATE	; the craters of
Oregon	LOCATION	and extinct volcanoes of
California	LOCATION	in
1841	DATE	; and a second visit to Vesu - vius in
1860	DATE	.

		Professor
Dana	PERSON	's acquaintance was equally wide with any subject upon which he undertook to write .

		In the arrangement of the biography ,
Presi	LOCATION	- dent
Gilman	PERSON	has followed the plan of present - ing original documents , with just enough of personal explanation to allow the latter to be read understand ingly .

		In his charming word - picture of
New Haven	LOCATION	in
1850	DATE	he has given a little sketch of wide and permanent usefulness .

		Professor
Dana	PERSON	's was a rich , full life , a well rounded life of active work well done ; and it is pleasant to state that President
Gil	PERSON	- man 's book is a fitting recognition .

		These conquests have aroused diplomats and statesmen , best informed on the eastern ques - tion , to forecast the next possible move of the Muscovite power .

		Explorers , military men , and historians are likewise actively at work on some phase of this urgent question .

		`` The Heart of

		The first part of the book is a rapid survey of the history of central

		The author , Professor

Darius I. Cyrus	PERSON	penetrated these regions as far as the
Jaxartes River	LOCATION	.

		Alexander the Great also reached the same limits and occu - pied over three years in the subjugation of the hostile and independence-loving peoples of this region .

		The history of
Bactria	LOCATION	, or
Central Asia	LOCATION	, henceforth has been almost one perpetual battle for life .

		It has been occupied in turn by Iranians , Greeks ,
Scythians	LOCATION	, Chinese , Turks , and Russians .

		One of the most genius-like and powerful conquerors and rulers mentioned in the long list is that of
Chingiz Khan	PERSON	.

		Of him
Stanley Lane-Poole	ORGANIZATION	, as quoted by our author , says -LRB- p. 160 -RRB- : '' The Mongol armies , divided into several immense brigades , swept over
Khwarazm	LOCATION	,
Kborasan	PERSON	, and Af - ghanistan , on the one hand ; and on the other , over
Azerbaijan	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and
Southern Russia	LOCATION	; whilst a third division continued the reduction of
China	LOCATION	.

		In the midst of these diverging streams of conquest
Chingiz Khan	PERSON	died in A. H. 624 -LRB- 1227 -RRB- , at the age of sixty-four .

		The territory he and his sons had conquered stretched from the Yellow Sea to the
Euxine	LOCATION	, and included lands and tribes wrung from the rule of the Chinese , Tanguts , Afghans , Persians , and Turks . ''

		Thereafter the country was torn by civil war , a prey to the worst forms of tyranny , until de - livered by that man of destiny , and great fame , '' Lame Timur , '' whose biography and history have formed a basis for all European historians , including even
Gibbon	PERSON	.

		The thirty-eight years ' rule of this cultured prince were the golden age of central
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Successive centuries found no relief from the barbarity and tyranny of the for - eign and native rulers of these regions until the intervention of
Russia	LOCATION	, and their final ab - sorption into the Muscovite empire at different dates since
1860	DATE	.


Russia	LOCATION	's last signal battle for the possession of central
Asia	LOCATION	was fought in
1881	DATE	.

		In the author 's description of the awful carnage he estimates the importance of the battle in these terms -LRB- p. 297 -RRB- : ``
Geok Teppe	PERSON	was the last stronghold of Central Asian independence , and its capture must rank among the decisive battles of the world .

		While civilization gained by the Russian victory , it is impossible to re - fuse sympathy to those who were crushed by its giant forces .

		With the conquest of Turkomania a national entity disappeared forever which had been preserved intact during ages of change and retained many noble qualities .

		The world is the poorer by the disappear - ance of such types , and by the gradual reduction of all mankind to a dead level devoid of color and charm . ''

		Of the benefits of Russian rule in these regions the author says : '' Slavery is another practice which has lost its terrors since the advent of the Russians .

		Bokhara was once the greatest market in
Asia	LOCATION	for the produce of
Turko	PERSON	- man and Kirghiz raids .

		Eighty years ago 40,000 Per - sians and more than 500 subjects of the Tsar were detained there in bondage .

		There was a regular tariff for these human cattle .

		A labourer fetched 29 , a skilled artisan 64 , and a pretty girl nearly 100 .

		The treatment meted out to them by Bokharan taskmasters was more atrocious than anything recorded by Mrs.
Beecher Stowe	PERSON	. ''

		The author 's position is almost that of a Russophile .

		He sees the best side of Russian rule and diplomacy , and does not show a vig - orous hand in pointing out her radical defects .

		In support of his view he gives in the appen - dices translations of two notable documents ; the second was an address delivered at Askabad to a party of English tourists
Nov. 25 , 1897	DATE	.

		In it we find this remarkable statement : `` Our policy in
Asia	LOCATION	is essentially a peaceful one , and we are perfectly satisfied with
OUP	ORGANIZATION	present boundaries . ''

		Events which have taken place on the Russian frontier since
1897	DATE	, and are now in full progress in
Persia	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, show that the position taken here regarding Russian policy and methods and results is especially roseate .

		The growth of
Asiatic Russia	LOCATION	is one of the marvels of modern civilization .

		``
Russia	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	'' is a comprehensive , yet concise , history of this expansion of Muscovite sway .

		The au - thor has presented his conclusions as the result of investigation among the writings of more than two hundred authorities .

		In the descrip - tion of military campaigns , he has made use of the original Russian documents .

		Discussions of the diplomatic methods of
Russia	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	are based on official correspondence of the two countries .

		The book is furnished with exten - sive appendices , which reproduce in English dress all the important treaties and conventions now in force respecting the Asiatic frontiers of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A round dozen maps vivify the whole discussion .

		The
Russian Empire	ORGANIZATION	has extended , since the death of
Ivan Basilovitz	PERSON	, in
1482	DATE	, from 500 , - 000 to over 9,000,000 square miles , reaching from the eastern limits of
Sweden	LOCATION	and Ger - many to the
Pacific	LOCATION	and from the
Arctic Ocean	ORGANIZATION	to
Afghanistan	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	.

		Asiatic
Russia	LOCATION	to-day comprises a total of 6,564,778 square miles .

		This territory extends over 40 degrees of latitude , and across 173 degrees of longi - tude , and includes '' every species of climate , soil , and people . ''

		The rapidity with which
Russia	LOCATION	has absorbed this territory may be con - ceived when it is said that by actual computa - tion covering a period of 318 years , she has
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 annexed an annual average of 20,643 square miles .

		At the present time
Russia	LOCATION	owns more than one-third of the total area of
Asia	LOCATION	, but only one forty-second of the population , while
China	LOCATION	owns less than one-fourth of the area , but more than one-half of the population .

		The history of the diplomatic methods em - ployed , and an array of the reputed reasons given , for the acquisition of a large part of this domain , are a series of revelations to those who are accustomed to the national transac - tions of Western powers .

		The author appears to give us a true picture of each conquest , of each diplomatic manosuvre , on the basis of ac - tual recorded statements .

		After
Russia	LOCATION	has in one way or another se - cured possession of all this territory , what does she do for its betterment ?

		The author , after studying the question from every side , comes to the following conclusion -LRB- p. 140 -RRB- : ''
Russia	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	is at present a purely military power .

		Her mission , as viewed by those responsible for her policy , is neither to develop territory nor to refine people .

		Her destiny is to use that which she already possesses as a means by which further con - quests are to be made , until by dint of an ever forward movement , she finds herself in possession , not of
India	LOCATION	, or of
China	LOCATION	, or
Persia	LOCATION	, but of the whole Asiatic con - tinent , which under the military sway of an army , ruled by the great White Tsar , may once again control the destinies of the world . ''

		In carrying out her designs -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- , ``
Russia	LOCATION	is restricted neither by considerations of the law of war , nor by any code of self-imposed mor - ality .

		The ethics of Russian diplomacy are extremely simple .

		Diplomacy , being the means employed in the attainment of the ends most necessary to the future prospects of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, is used without restriction of any kind ... Muscovite diplomacy is utterly unscrup - ulous , and pledges given or promises made are merely subterfuges , with the object of attaining something which is desired . ''

		The author cites many examples of the execu - tion of this policy within the
last quarter	DATE	cen - tury ; most striking of these are the cases of the capture of Merv while a Russian ambas - sador was sent to
London	LOCATION	to assure
England	LOCATION	that no such plan was in mind ; and the seiz - ' ure of Port
Arthur	PERSON	under guise of wintering a part of the Russian fleet in the shelter afforded by that harbor .

		The most efficient instrument in carrying out her designs is the army -LRB- p. 284 -RRB- : '' The life , the energy , and the intelligence of
Russia	LOCATION	are centred in her army , which , with certain exceptions , claims the service of every male within the age limit .

		... Each male spends eighteen years of his life in the standing army .

		... A diminution in the period of ser - vice is gained by attaining a certain standard of educa - tion ; but as the opportunity of reaching this standard is not readily afforded , the proportion of the masses who benefit by the regulation is infinitesimal .

		The number of persons who can read throughout the Rus - sian empire is under three per cent of the population , and the existing school accommodation caters for under two million pupils out of a total population of 129,000 , - 000 .

		And this state of things is likely to remain , for in the ignorance of its people lies the security of Russian bureaucracy . ''

		The author 's exposition of Russian policy , methods , and conditions is based on more than fifty pages of official documents , and the best authorities found in Muscovite literature .

		While unsparing in his criticism of
Russia	LOCATION	, he has no patience at all with the slow and change - able methods adopted by
England	LOCATION	to counter - check her advances .

		His book is a timely note of warning , and should open the eyes of the Western powers to the comprehensive designs , the resourceful methods , and the results certain to follow in the wake , of the Muscovite power .

		AN ENGLISH AND AN AMERICAN PLAY .

		* There is enough movement in the English drama for us to say that life is still in it .

		It is true that here in
America	LOCATION	affairs are in no very hopeful state ; true , also , that no great acting plays come to us from
England	LOCATION	.

		Still there are signs worth noting .

		One of these is the popularity of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	's play '' Paola and Francesca '' : the literary gossips inform us that the play is to be acted , that Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	has ordered another like it , and so on .

		To the fact furnished by this play we may add the recent publication of `` Osbern and Ursyne , '' by
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	, of which we have similar advertisement : Mrs.
Patrick Campbell	PERSON	is said to be reading it , and other important things are happening .


John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	is not most widely known as a dramatist .

		It is now a year or so ago that we noticed '' The Ambassador '' : the play was given in
New York	LOCATION	not long since , and was currently pronounced witty but undra - matic .

		The present play was given semi - privately in
New York	LOCATION	, and was admitted to have technical excellence .

		But that particular point is not very important for the moment .

		When the play appears on the public stage it will be time to criticize it from the theatrical standpoint .

		250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, intrinsic interest in the play , which will be dif - ferent for different people -RRB- is the fact that we have another example of the particular kind of romantic drama which now marks English lit - erature .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	there is now a romantic drama which goes far toward allegory : '' Die
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	, '' '' Die
Drei Reiherfed	PERSON	- ern , '' `` Die Konigskinder , '' these are em - phatically plays of ideas .

		In
France	LOCATION	there is something a little different : In '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' is a heroic romance which in spirit is still inspired by ''
Hernani	PERSON	. ''

		In
England	LOCATION	the drama is the romance of passion .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's play , Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's , Mr.
John Dav	PERSON	- idson 's '' Godef rida , ''
Michael Field	PERSON	's ''
Anna Ruina	PERSON	, '' these are of a type wholly different from the great French or German dramas .

		All medieval tragedies , for one thing , all ex - ploration of some tortuous by-way of passion , are marked by the atmosphere of the strange isolation of love .

		We take it that historically they belong to the school of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, who still lives in ''
Rosamunda	PERSON	. ''

		We think that the '' Osbern and Ursyne '' is most inter - esting in its significance .

		But there is good writing in it , too , and it would be worth read - ing even if there were no other dramas written in
England	LOCATION	.

		The publication of Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	's '' Na - than
Hale	PERSON	'' is also worthy of notice .

		We do not incline to believe that we have here any addition to literature .

		But we need not sup - pose , because a thing is put in such form that the world may read it , that it is necessarily to be thought of as literature .

		Mural and other inscriptions form a matter of considerable in - terest , and may be worth the attention of any - body .

		So , also , a close study of advertisements in all their varied forms , is an extremely curi - ous matter , and one which extends into vistas far beyond the imagination of the beginner .

		But neither inscriptions nor advertisements , valuable and fascinating as they are , can be called literature .

		Mr.
Fitch	PERSON	's play is of course a theatre play , and its publication is not a matter of literature but a matter of record .

		It is a record of a very interesting fact , namely , that the play was suc - cessfully written and acted , and it is now pre - sented in a worthy manner .

		It is well printed and attractively bound , and illustrated with photographs of the original actors , both indi - vidually and in scenes .

		These pictures sug - gest a curious question , all photographs of stage scenes and groups do , namely , How can such stiff and awkward combinations ever have seemed natural ?

		That they do seem nat - ural enough on the stage , is a well-known fact .

		The pictures , however , are preeminently artificial ; not these especially , but all such .

		To some extent the same question is reechoed on reading the text of this or many another successful acting play , How can this ever go smoothly , naturally , and with any show of reality ?

		Perhaps the two questions together will suggest an answer : the stiffness of the stage setting and grouping is forgotten when we hear what the people say ; the convention - ality of what they say is relieved when we see them in their own persons and costumes .

		``
Nathan Hale	PERSON	'' is not a reading play , but many will like to have it for all that .

		GARDENS AND THEIR PRAISES .

		* While lovers of verse may wonder at the exclusion from Mr.
Sieveking	PERSON	's '' Gardens An - cient and Modern '' of nearly all poetry bearing upon his delightful topic , lovers of gardens for their own sake will find in the really erudite collection of prose which he has gathered through a wide reading nearly all that they could wish or hope for .

		Yet he is not without a reason for omitting the rhymes all garden lovers treasure , when he says '' in a garden everyone is his own poet , '' and this is a better reason than his plea '' that poetry is richer in flowers than in gardens . ''

		The work is an outgrowth of the former '' The Praise of Gardens , '' now long out of print , but still prized by those fortunate enough to own it .

		It has now been enlarged , until its scope runs from the
Nineteenth Dynasty	ORGANIZATION	of old
Egypt	LOCATION	to Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, and from the Canticles to Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	justifying the '' ancient and modern '' of the title to the foot of the letter .

		There are , too , an interesting Prologue , in which the various sources from which the read - ing matter and illustrations have been gleaned are set forth ; the pictures themselves , which comprise copies of inscriptions from the monu - ments of

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 and an historical epilogue , wherein the story told brokenly in the selections is given original literary form , resulting in an essay of real value to the investigator .

		If old learning , quaint receipts , half remembered anecdotes of the great and wise in connection with gardens , and a charming style of his own can make a book delightful , Mr.
Sieveking	PERSON	has won the palm .

		Miss Jekyll 's '' Home and Garden '' is a most inclusive work , and the breadth of scope permitted by its name is taken advantage of almost to the full .

		The pleasantly printed vol - ume begins with the praise of the author 's home , which is an English country house built with loving care and the almost perfect cooper - ation of the owner , architect , and builder .

		The owner is frank enough to admit that she would have been wiser if the architect had been fol - lowed a little more closely in his suggestion ; though there is a proverb concerning the intel - lectual qualifications of those who build which is more inclusive and comes to the same thing .

		From the interior of this charming house , built of timber and stone which the proud owner had seen years before in forest and quarry with honest and painstaking artisanship , it is an easy passage to the trees and flowers which make it beautiful without .

		Consequently , there ensue many chapters of delightfully empirical knowledge about the flora of that part of Brit - ain , told discursively and with a fine irrelevance .

		From cats to cauliflower and pot-pourri to phlox may distract the imagination , but it results in just the sort of book one loves to read , with no thought of finishing the work forthwith or any feeling of compulsion or necessity .

		Passing from the immediate realm of the garden itself , but returning to it from time to time as if loath to leave , '' Outside the Garden '' is the affectionate tribute of
Helen Milman	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Caldwell Crofton	PERSON	-RRB- to the little land of
Surrey	LOCATION	where she has her home and shares her life with the living things , animal , vegetal , and human , of the neighborhood .

		It deals with hop-pickers , herons , cross-bills , literary men , men of science , mills , castles , abbeys , cottage gardens , felling trees , kings , queens , squirrels , sheep , nightingales , and Love , all embodied in little essays which abound with the spirit of out-of-doors and the sense of being told because O it was needful that the world should not forget the charm of nature .

		All these books , published with care and consideration , leave little to be desired in re - spect of paper , pictures , printing , and binding , and are an unwitting tribute to the ineffable tiresomeness and folly of an age which makes life in the dull sordid town needful to existence when we might all of us get into the woods and dales , winter or
summer	DATE	, for a better knowl - edge of ourselves and a better feeling for those about us .

		THE INSENSIBLE , IRRESISTIBLE DRIFT OF FAITH .

		* The last half of the present century has shown a decisive change in the centre of gravity in men 's religious opinions .

		The result is conspicuous in the insensible way in which conservative minds are drawn forward , and in the many checks by which radical ones are restrained .

		No man can write on religious themes at the close of the century as he would have written at its beginning .

		The attrac - tions and repulsions are all different .

		The centre of revolution is far out in the light compared with those earlier years .

		This fact impresses one strongly in looking through a miscellaneous collection of fresh publications from the religious press .

		No man escapes .

		The Gifford lectures , by Dr.
Caird	PERSON	, are volumes of unusual interest .

		The biography which intro - duces them is well written , and the discussions which follow will especially please those who wish to accept the new faith with the least possible * THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF CHRISTIANITY .

		252 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, change of the old .

		Principal
Caird	PERSON	possessed a vigorous and earnest mind , and yet one loath to de - part from beaten paths .

		The lectures on the fun - damental truths of Christianity are more radical than they seem to be .

		The fire has touched the flax , and the mind is free , though the ashes remain , with , here and there , a few fibres unconsumed .

		The living evolution of truth is a controlling idea with the author . ''

		Christian Mysticism '' is a rare book ; rare in scholarship and rare in penetration a book not to be expounded in a half dozen sentences .

		Mys - ticism , with the author , means that overplus of reason by which we force a passage through sensu - ous impressions , and take possession of the truly intelligible world , the spiritual world , beyond .

		This he has discussed in its characteristics and chief forms .

		It is a book which many will pass negli - gently , a few contemptuously , and a more consid - erable few will receive enthusiastically .

		We give a few passages which may enable the lover of books to determine its quality in reference to himself .

		`` Reason is the logic of the whole personality . ''

		`` Whatever view of reality deepens our sense of the tremendous issues of life in the world wherein we move , is for us nearer the truth than any view which diminishes that sense . '' ''

		Personality is not only the strictest unity of which we have any experience ; it is the fact which creates the postulate of unity on which all philosophy is based . ''

		It is difficult for mysticism , even in its most sober expression , to escape the taint of ecstasy ; and this difficulty the author does not entirely overcome . ''

		Thoughts of and for the Inner Life '' is a vol - ume of twenty discourses , most of which were preached in the chapel of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are somewhat disappointed in them .

		As a matter of course , they are good , but they are not as superior as published sermons should be .

		The thought is moderately discriminating , the style is somewhat abstract and cold , and the discussion rarely melts into vivifying feeling .

		The personal presence of the speaker may have reduced these defects , but they leave the printed sermon somewhat in the shadow .

		The subdued tone of sympathy which the presence and character of the preacher may have accentuated is not perceptible to the reader . ''

		The Divine Pedigree of Man '' is a clever book .

		It is clearly written , and gives some trenchant blows to
Empirical Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a reductio ad absurdum of that phase of belief .

		Its own psy - chology , however , is of a mongrel order , and ex - plains little or nothing .

		According to the author , man is possessed of two minds ; one , perceptive and inductive , which is a function of the brain ; another , intuitive and deductive , which is independent of the brain .

		This latter is present in the very earliest manifestations of life , and so antedates not only brain structure but all organic structure .

		Thus the doctrine that intelligence is the function of brain tissue disappears , and mind makes its way backward to the mind of God . ''

		The Victory of the Will '' is a book of devotion , and good of its kind .

		It aims to awaken the spir - itual powers to deeper insight and a better mastery of invisible things .

		Most readers would find stim - ulus in it .

		The symbol of this class of books is , man overleaping the world rather than man bearing it on his shoulders .

		The two should be merged in one . ''

		The Moral Order of the World '' is a second course of
Gifford Lectures	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first course The Providential Order of the World has already been noticed .

		The present volume is an historical and critical discussion of earlier and later beliefs concerning the moral government of God .

		The range of topics is broad .

		The discussion is per - fectly clear and candid , and the criticisms are well directed and sober .

		Almost everyone could profit by its perusal .

		`` What Shall We Think of Christianity ? ''

		and '' Can I believe in God the Father ? ''

		are composed of lectures ; the first series delivered before the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, and the second before the
Harvard Summer School of Theology	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their drift is sufficiently indicated by the titles .

		They are popular rather than philosophical , and their value is reduced by the fact that the treatment is rambling and fails to yield a clear and compact line of thought . ''

		Science and Faith '' is a misnomer .

		The vol - ume has little to do with science as a form of knowl - edge , and next to nothing to do with faith .

		It is a rendering of the facts , real and imaginary , by which man has grown into a personal , rational life , and become a member of society .

		Judging from a final remark , we have suffered no special loss by this diversion from the proposed theme . ''

		The two do - mains of science and faith are totally different are two contrary poles . '' ''

		The Theology of Civilization '' is a discursive , popular treatise .

		It discusses religious beliefs in connection with our current life and experience .

		The book shows clear thought and a large heart .

		By virtue of robust common sense , it delivers some very square blows .

		While it does not aim to be philosophical , it does not lack philosophy .

		One 's first impression from the title of the book , '' Enemies and Evidences of Christianity , '' is that of a disagreeable alliteration .

		Further acquaintance with the work , however , shows that the '' enemies '' were quite in the foreground of the author 's con - ception , and not present by any rhetorical trick .


Hinduism	LOCATION	, Buddhism , Theosophy , Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	,
Altru	PERSON	- ism , etc. , are soundly belabored , the evidences being the convenient club with which it is done .

		The reason the author offers for this almost vicious attack , is the indignation which he calls righteous , experienced by him at the rhapsodies of meetings held in
Maine	LOCATION	that no-man 's - land in the
summer	DATE	months .

		He evidently attached too much import - ance to these unrestrained outbursts of the religious sentiments , and assails them in excessive wrath .

		It was a case in which the precept was in order , '' Be not overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good . '

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 '' Religio Pictoris '' is a noteworthy book , artistic in form , in purpose , and in treatment .

		The vitality and constructive elements in a picture are traced with delicate analysis , and are used as analogies interpreting to us that life picture which , in its mo - tive , its lights and shades , makes up for us our reli - gious faith .

		The work is executed with the same delicacy with which it is conceived .

		It leads us to the fundamental truth , that opposites , empirical and intuitional , in seeming contention , must be made to blend with each other in an ever more comprehen - sive and stimulating unity .

		We think , however , that the author has , in one or two instances , held too long to ideas , and striven to make them explan - atory beyond their power .

		The pump handle has been vigorously applied when the piston has simply wheezed and yielded no water .

		For the most part it pours forth a clear and refreshing stream . ''

		Life Beyond Death '' is a popular treatise , ap - parently shaped by service in the pulpit .

		The earlier portion is historical ; the later portion is an interesting discussion of Spiritualism , and of the results of the
Society of Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr. Savage believes that Spiritualism and these re - searches establish the existence of spirits of the dead .

		We are quite content to accept a grave obli - gation to those men who have striven to clear up a threshing-floor of so much chaff and dust in search for the few grains of wheat it contains .

		The spirit is a true one and a wise one .

		We are also ready to accept any confirmation thus brought to the doc - trine of immortality .

		We are not quite willing to regard it as a necessary or even important part of the proof .

		The doctrine rests on the force of our moral nature and of evolution .

		We believe it rests so securely as to be independent of these confused and doubtful phenomena .

		The mathematician does not feel the need of confirming his conclusions by empirical measurements .

		The appendix gives some very interesting personal experiences .

		Those who regard the older beliefs in theology as the germs , and the later beliefs as the flowers , of one plant ; who think that old things , in passing away , become new , will always be much interested in the works of President
Hyde	PERSON	.

		He belongs with those who hold on to the past and the present with equal tenacity .

		The body of the volume , '' God 's Education of Man , '' is earnestly practical .

		The educational elements are three : law , grace , and service .

		They are traced in a vivid and cogent way .

		An introduction , and a briefer conclusion , raise the speculative inquiries by which the flow of religious faith is justified .

		The two volumes of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's addresses , `` The New Evangelism '' and '' Stones Rolled Away , '' are quite diverse .

		The first is made up of discourses carefully prepared for set occasions , and of special articles .

		Both the thought and the style adequately present the author .


Henry Drummond	PERSON	was a very apt product of our time .

		He was possessed in equal parts of the devotion of faith , of the comprehensive thought which comes from enlarged knowledge , and of sound sympathetic common sense . ''

		The New Evangelism '' is an excellent illustration of the first two elements , and '' The Problem of Foreign Mis - sions '' of the third .

		The second volume is a repro - duction of the extempore addresses made in this country .

		They give the simple , homely , direct , and earnest method which belonged to him in an imme - diate effort to influence young men .

		They are a single outcome of a theory of life , rather than that theory itself .

		They disclose the practical side of his character .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		One of the latest numbers of the ySSZ * . ''

		Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a sketch of
John Brown	PERSON	by
Joseph Edgar Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		The book well merits attention , for the importance of the principles involved .

		The author tells us in his preface that his aim is to present a picture of the man , and to tell the story of his life , without inquiry into the effect of his work or estimate of his character .

		It strikes us that this omitted esti - mate is the very thing that readers of little books of this class most need .

		They are presumably busy people who , lacking time for larger books , want to find in a nutshell not only the story of a man 's life but an estimate of his place in history as well .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	tells his story in the heroic vein , with - out qualification or extenuation .

		No book ought at this time to be written about
Brown	PERSON	which does not clearly distinguish between his motive and his method .

		The singleness of his purpose and the pathos of his death will always make him a con - spicuous figure ; but it can not be too strongly pointed out that his method was radically and terribly wrong , and that he hurt immeasurably the cause he hoped to help .

		That method may be tested by ap - plying it to present day issues .

		It is the method of the assassin who shot
Goebel	PERSON	, or of a fanatic who would destroy a venal legislature in the manner of Guy Fawkes , involving innocent and guilty in com - mon ruin .

		The defense for
Brown	PERSON	is that he had brooded over the evils of slavery until his narrow mind lost the distinction between right and wrong where slavery was concerned .

		It was the accident of the song that worked his apotheosis .

		Of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	letter to
Floyd	LOCATION	, Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	rather ambiguously remarks : '' The identity of the man who sought to betray the secret is now pretty well known .

		It does not matter who it was . ''

		From this reference it appears that the author has missed the recent Statement , which conclusively connects this letter with
David J. Gee	PERSON	, who wrote it not to be - tray
Brown	PERSON	but to save him from himself .

		The front - ispiece portrait is from a photograph of a daguerreo - type '' supposed to have been taken in
Kansas	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	. ''


Richard J. Hinton	PERSON	, who knew
Brown	PERSON	well , tells us that the only picture
Brown	PERSON	ever had taken 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, in
Kansas	LOCATION	is the one in which he appears seated at a table and grasping a staff or pike , that
Brown	PERSON	never looked as badly as this picture represents him , and be denounces it as a pro-slavery fraud .

		Be that as it may , it hardly matches the pen pic - ture of the book .

		One or the other needs correction .

		Thackeray ' * Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	's researches anonym ` iut , , f , .

		, _ contributions among the archives of '' Punch '' to `` Punch . ''

		have enabled him to positively iden - tify as
Thackeray	PERSON	's a number of writings that ap - peared anonymously in the laborious and painstak - ing columns of that serio-comic journal between
1843	DATE	and
1848	DATE	.

		These writings , which range in length from an epigrammatic paragraph of a line or so to an article of a page or more , and from a couplet to a poem of one hundred and twenty three lines , Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	now publishes in a comely volume under the perhaps unavoidably cumbrous title , '' The Hitherto Unidentified Contributions of
W. M. Thackeray	PERSON	to ' Punch ' '' -LRB- Harpers . -RRB-

		We may say at once that the book is unquestionably one which the lover of
Thackeray	PERSON	and the collector of his works must have for the sake of its biblio - graphic and biographic interest .

		The literary qual - ity of the papers , it is hardly necessary to say , is slight , and their humor has largely evaporated with the passing away of the interest of the more or less ephemeral political and other questions that inspired them .

		As an index to the writer 's opinions on the questions and events of his day , they are of some value ; but we can hardly agree with Mr.
Spiel	PERSON	- mann that
Thackeray	PERSON	, writing under the veil of anonymity , was likely to be more frank or bluntly outspoken than when he wrote over one of his fa - miliar pen-names , or over his own signature .

		We find no indications of this additional frankness in the present volume , and this , for obvious reasons , we do not think altogether regrettable .

		There can be no question as to the authenticity of the pieces collected by Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	, since they are all en - tered as items against
Thackeray	PERSON	's name in a long - forgotten editorial day-book , and duly checked off as paid for .

		The drawings which accompanied them , where they are unquestionably from Thack - eray 's hand , are reproduced , and add much to the humor and attractiveness of the book .

		Mr.
Spiel	PERSON	- mann has judiciously supplemented the text with such comment and explanation of his own as seemed necessary to its full elucidation .

		A full and con - veniently arranged bibliography of
Thackeray	PERSON	's contributions to '' Punch '' is appended .

		The `` Temple '' Shakespeare in a new form .

		He is hard to please who can not find an edition of Shakespeare to his lik - ing .

		It would seem as if all the possible ideas and combinations of ideas in the mechanical presentation of the plays must have been exhausted long ago , and yet such are the fluctua - tions of taste and the caprices of bookish fash - ion that every year brings forth some new edition that seems to strike a responsive chord not struck before .

		The year just past , for example , has given us two editions that are in some respects more de - sirable for general reading than any that have pre - ceded them .

		One of these , the '' Eversley '' edition , superintended by Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	, has already received our praise , and for convenient handling and chaste simplicity would be difficult to surpass .

		Its ten volumes are a delight to the hand , the eye , and the scholarly sense .

		But if a more ornate edition be asked for , the new and larger '' Temple ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- seems to embody the ne plus ultra of charm and general attractiveness .

		This edition , under the care of Mr.
Israel Gollancz	PERSON	, is to fill twelve volumes , of which eight are now before us .

		The mechanical features of this edition are a typography similar to that of the earlier '' Temple '' volumes , a combination of daintiness and elegance in many matters of detail , and a series of illustrations that greatly enhance its value .

		There are full-page frontispieces to each play , and a great variety of cuts scattered among the notes .

		The method of illustration is strictly realistic , and has been made possible by access to the rich collection of materials left by J. 0 .

		Halliwell-Phillipps .

		The order of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	has been followed ; '' Peri - cles '' will appear in the eleventh volume ; and the twelfth will include , besides the Poems and Son - nets , an illustrated account of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Purchasers who acquire this charming edition will never have reason to regret their expenditure .

Pope Leo XIIL	PERSON	, his Life and Work '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Julien de Narfon	PERSON	, recently translated by
G. A. Raper	PERSON	.

		The pious and learned man who now oc - cupies the papal throne has had a distinguished career , showing himself equal to every situation to which he has been called .

		Throughout almost the entire administration of his predecessor
Pius IX.	PERSON	, he was Bishop of
Perugia	LOCATION	; in
1853	DATE	, he was made cardinal ; in
1877	DATE	camerlengo , or chamberlain , of the papal household ; in
1878	DATE	, two weeks after the death of
Pius IX.	PERSON	, he was chosen pope .

		In all of these offices , he exhibited a rare combination of learning and administrative ability .

		He is an ele - gant Latin scholar , a poet of no small merit , a founder and patron of schools and colleges ; and he has proved himself in addition an excellent man of affairs .

		In his character of supreme chief of the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	, he has put himself in relation with the principal governments of the world , and in ne - gotiations with
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and other lands , has displayed admirable intelli - gence , patience , and tact .

		Throughout his entire pontificate , Church and
State	ORGANIZATION	have been engaged in a quarrel mutually hurtful to
Italy	LOCATION	and the papacy .

		This so-called Roman question that is to say , the respective positions of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	and the Quirinal , and their relations to one another is far from being a mere Italian affair .

		It demands the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 attention of every foreign government that has any large Roman Catholic population subject to its rule .

		It has now reached a climax and a great crisis is imminent , not only in the fortunes of
Italy	LOCATION	, hut in the history of the mother church .

		This book does much towards enlightening the reader concerning the complicated situation ; but its great value is in introducing us to an intimate knowledge of perhaps the most interesting personality among living men .

		The large number of beautiful illustrations of not - able places and persons adds greatly to the charm of the volume .

United States	LOCATION	within the last two months , may be taken to mean that recent British success is not regarded with any particular enthusiasm by American lovers of liberty and free institutions .

		That both of them should side energetically with the small against the great is to be expected from those who understand the ease with which the English-speaking peoples discern motes in the eyes of others , however regard - less of beams within their own . ''

		Who Ought to Win ? ''

		-LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Spencer Randolph	PERSON	, is an energetic plea for the burghers , based on his - tory in the past as well as policy in the future .

		It is not always carefully considered , and many extracts are used which might have been omitted to advant - age , but it stands for the average American feeling in the matter with considerable accuracy . ''

		The Transvaal Outlook '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Albert Stickney	PERSON	, is a military criticism from the point of view of an expert learned in the lessons of our own civil war , with strong leanings to the Re - publicans so far as history and justice is concerned , but rather designed with a view to pointing out the real strength of their position strategically consid - ered .

		The work deals more particularly with the questions of transport and the length of the British lines , taken in connection with the proved mobility of the burghers ' forces , and the possibility of re - peating some of the deeds of
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	,
Wheeler	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	, or
Sherman	PERSON	.

		Early history The lectures contained in Dr.
Karl	PERSON	o / the religion
F. R. Budde	PERSON	's latest volume , `` The Religion of
Israel	LOCATION	to the Exile ' ; -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , form the fourth series of ''
American Lec	ORGANIZATION	- tures on the History of Religions , '' and were deliv - ered in the
fall of 1898	DATE	by the well-known professor of Old Testament exegesis in
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		A careful reading of the book confirms the impression received from hearing the lectures , that in them we have an invaluable exposition of the origin and early history of the Yahweh religion , which will do much to pop - ularize the important results of modern Biblical criticism .

		Dr.
Budde	PERSON	's point of view is that of a conservative ; he belongs to the school which rep - resents the reaction against the indiscriminate re - jection of tradition as void of all historical value .

		While he recognizes the difference between tra - dition and history , he points out that `` tradition in numberless cases clothes genuine history in forms which , at first sight , appear to deserve no confidence at all .

		The task of the true historian is , first of all , to understand the tradition .

		When it is correctly understood he will not throw it away , but will make use of it in the proper sense and in the proper place . ''

		From this point of view the Biblical tradition concerning the history of
Israel	LOCATION	as a nation appears to Professor
Budde	PERSON	to be , in its main features , trustworthy .

		He has endeavored to present the results of Old Testament scholarship not from the negative side , '' but as a thoroughly positive work of preserving , restoring , building up . ''

		He has succeeded in giving us a clear , consecutive , and eminently satisfactory view of the subject .

		One regrets that the Index is not fuller .

		Naval battle * No better subject ever lay ready for from Saiamis the historian 's hand than that taken to
Santiago	LOCATION	.

		up by Mr
Ednrar	PERSON	-LRB- J Kirk R awson j n his '' Twenty Famous Naval Battles : Saiamis to
Santiago	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Himself a professor in the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	and superintendent of the
Naval War Records	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Rawson	PERSON	had the admir - able example of
Creasy	PERSON	's '' Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World '' on which to model his own work .

		Moreover , his two octavo volumes , from introduc - tion to ending , show a profound knowledge of the problems involved and great naval erudition such as must serve to give it permanent value as a book of reference .

		The battles selected are hardly to be quarreled with , though Yalu or Wei-hai-Wei might have been mentioned .

		The inclusion of the
Bon Homme Richard	LOCATION	- Serapis , Constitution -
Guerriere	ORGANIZATION	, Monitor-Merrimac , and
Kearsage	PERSON	-
Alabama	LOCATION	duels , in addition to detailed accounts of the battles of
Lake Erie	LOCATION	,
Mobile Bay	LOCATION	,
Manila	LOCATION	, and
Santiago	LOCATION	, give the book perhaps a too pronounced American flavor .

		And no Englishman could be expended to lend his approval to omission of the battle of the Baltic or
St. Vincent	ORGANIZATION	from the list .

		But what injures the book more than anything else is the author 's ab - sence of imagination , leaving his histories , for all the vividness of action inherent in them , almost wholly without the quality of picturesqueness .

		What should have been a work to be read and re-read , becomes , in consequence , one rather to be relegated to the book-shelves for consultation as an authority upon occasions of formal historical reference .

		Among the books which take high Twelve famous ^ \ c j j English sea.fighters.P l * ce for reading and instruction , Mr.
J. Knox Laughton	PERSON	's `` From Howard to Nelson '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is henceforth destined to rank .

		Battles are alluring reading , naval wars are always to be given precedence among these , and the steps whereby
Great Britain	LOCATION	gave herself the proud position of mistress of the seas 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, are fascinating in the telling ; everything respect - ing the book , therefore , makes it of unusual interest .

		Mr.
Laughton	PERSON	, whose services for the naval histories and biographies in the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' are still remembered , has been the ed - itor here , giving a series of twelve '' lives '' of as many sea-fighters a unity of treatment and design impossible without such assistance .

		The biogra - phies themselves are from various hands , among whom are Admiral Sir
Edmund R. Freemantle	PERSON	, Admiral
Sir R. Vesey Hamilton	PERSON	, Vice-Admiral Sir
Frederick G. D. Bedford	PERSON	, Vice-Admiral
Philip H. Colomb	PERSON	, and Captain
Montagu Burrows	PERSON	, all the contributors being high in the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	with the exception of the editor himself , who writes of How - ard `` my Lord Howard '' of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's `` Re - venge . ''

		Nothing in the way of original treatment is attempted , and the absence of technicalities is marked .

		There is always to be noted the perfect comprehension and eager sympathy which adds so much to the value of such collections as this , while the reputation of nineteenth century sailors for writ - ing terse and vigorous English is fully sustained throughout .

		As a history or romance or both com - bined , the book is worth reading , even by those who know their
Southey	ORGANIZATION	by heart .

		Collected work , The loyalty with which the English of a minor stand by their lesser poets is placed Engiih poet .

		^ a b ru pt contrast with the American air of disdainful superiority concerning theirs , by the recent publication , under the editorship of Mr.
Alfred Wallis	PERSON	, of '' The Poetical Works '' of the Rev.
Robert Stephen Hawker	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	-LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Hawker is chiefly known to this generation as the writer of the '' Song of the Western Men , '' contain - ing the famous stanza , '' And have they fix 'd the where and when ?

		And shall Trelawney die ?

		Here 's twenty thousand
Cornish	PERSON	men Will see the reason why ! ''

		which was taken by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	as contemporaneous with the imprisonment of Sir
John Trelawney	PERSON	in
1688	DATE	, and subsequently became the subject of an animated discussion .

		Contrary to the usual impres - sion that
Hawker	PERSON	availed himself of an old refrain , the editor here contends sturdily for the complete originality of the poem , chorus and all .

		Though none of the poet 's verses were included in u The Golden Treasury '' of
Palgrave	LOCATION	, he had a wide pop - ularity in his day and his poems are of great inter - est. .

		During his lifetime , 1803-1875 , he published thirteen volumes of verse , many of which passed through more than one edition .

		It is certainly not for lack of instruc - tion , definite and indefinite , that any woman fails to recognize the niche she was intended to fill .

		But instructions can not undo the facts contained in lack of a training so thorough , so well rounded , that a woman , no less than a man , can face any emergency that arises , confident that a living income can be had by the More hints for women .

		work of hands or head .

		The growing thought among progressive educators makes manual train - ing , on both the art and the mechanical side , the foundation of all education .

		In such training the natural bent of the child becomes plainly discern - ible , and this forever ends that familiar condition known as the '' square peg in a round hole . ''

		Mrs.
Helen Candee Churchill	PERSON	is known as a graceful , and , on the whole , sensible , writer for women , and her little volume '' How Women May Earn a Living , '' lately issued by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	, is fairly practical , and certainly pleasant reading .

		Perhaps nothing better could be said to the untrained and rather helpless woman thrown suddenly on her own resources .

		But the need of such a book in itself emphasizes that other need the demands for an education that shall develop to its utmost capacity every power latent in the child .

		When this need is recognized , the day of handbooks for the helpless or half competent will end , and the library shelf , that now holds a series of this order , be cleared for something more in accord with life as it should be , and , as it is dawning upon us , we have power to make it .

		A manual ^ brief manual for the use of those of the British who may desire to acquire an ele -
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		mentary idea of the
British House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	of the present time has been prepared by Sir
Richard Temple	PERSON	, whose knowledge of his theme has been derived from his experience as a Member during the eventful decade ,
1885	DATE	to
1895	DATE	-LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has not attempted to recount the parliamentary history of that period , nor to discuss the merits of its great issue , the Irish Question .

		His object has been to indicate broadly the ways and character of the
House	ORGANIZATION	as at that time constituted , as they might have appeared to an im - partial observer .

		The text is divided into nine chapters , each dealing concisely and clearly with a special phase of the subject .

		The first is introduc - tory , and describes the personnel of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of
1885	DATE	, and of each of the subsequent elections dur - ing the decade treated .

		Thence , the author pro- ceeds to discuss
The House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	as a Club , The Precincts and Buildings , Life in
Parliament	LOCATION	, Manners and Customs , Scenes in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, Lead - ing Figures , The
Irish Nationalist Party	ORGANIZATION	, The Lords as Seen by the Commons .

		American readers will find in
Sir Richard Temple	ORGANIZATION	's little handbook just the modicum of general information as to the mod - ern
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	that everyone ought to have , and it is pleasantly imparted .

		We Americans have an historical interest in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	surpassing that of most of the other British provinces at the north of us .

		To the builders proper , who are treated under the heads , u Origin of the People of

Nova Scotians	LOCATION	.

		The death ,
March 21	DATE	, of
Henry Cohn	PERSON	, Assistant Pro- fessor of German in
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, has re - moved one of the most active mediators between German and Anglo-American life , as well as a teacher of re - markable gifts and enthusiasm .

		He was born in
Berlin	LOCATION	on
February 2 , 1847	DATE	, came to
America	LOCATION	as a child , and was educated at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		After graduation he taught German in the
School of Mines	ORGANIZATION	of the same institution .

		From
1871	DATE	to
1873	DATE	he attended the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	, studying Germanics , orientalia , history , and philosophy .

New York	LOCATION	; then conducted summer-schools in various parts of the country ; and after maintaining a school of languages in
Chicago	LOCATION	, became connected with
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		In addition to the regular duties of his profes - sion , which were performed with remarkable vigor , he founded societies for encouraging general interest in the German language ; and from time to time he secured the presence of distinguished German talent in
Evans	LOCATION	- ton .

		For a number of years he had charge of the sum - mer school of German at Cbautauqua .

		On
March 22	DATE	the old and honored house of
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	passed into the hands of a receiver , the result of the inability of the firm to secure extensions on notes 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, falling due on that date .

		The failure was indirectly precipitated by the recent misfortunes of the
Harper	PERSON	house , and was not in any way due to financial losses or bad judgment in business risks .

		The lenders of money holding paper issued by the Appletons , frightened by the recent revelations at the
Harper	PERSON	establishment , were unwilling to grant favors to the publishing house , and the firm promptly laid the situation before its heaviest creditors and decided on the application for a receiver as the best protection for all concerned .

		The liabilities amount to something over
a million dollars	MONEY	, but the assets are large , and of such a character that it is be - lieved all claims will be paid in full .

		The receiver is Mr.
J. Hampden Dougherty	PERSON	, a lawyer of high standing who has had intimate knowledge of the firm 's affairs for some years , and he will continue the business until plans for a re-organization can be formulated .

		The present reverses of the house will cause universal regret and sympathy , and it is to be hoped that a re-organization may soon be accomplished that will put the firm in posi - tion for continuing on a more effective basis than before .

		SCRIBNER 'S NEW BOOKS A New Novel of American Life by
ROBERT GRANT UNLEAVENED	ORGANIZATION	BREAD In UNLEAVENED BREAD , a phrase in which the character of the heroine is epitomized , Mr.
Grant	PERSON	has advanced a long step in his literary career .

		The novel , which is to have its first issue in book form , deals boldly and vigorously with the social conditions peculiar to modern life , the career of the heroine being followed as she attains to one after another of her ambitions .

		The three large divisions of the novel indicate the stages of this career `` The Emancipation , '' `` The Struggle , '' and `` The Success , '' although , as the reader of the novel will note , the '' success '' which the heroine achieves is to be taken satirically as reflecting the point of view of the clever and ambitious woman of the world who has reached her goal .

		The false opposition which many conceive to exist between religion and ethics should lead no one to infer from the title of his book that his ethical Sunday-school is not also religious .

		It rather intimates the emphasis laid on ethical teaching and character-building an emphasis not duly regarded in many a Sunday-school .

		Consequently , Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's book deserves to be reck - oned as a substantial contribution toward the improvement of Sunday-school methods ... We highly value his book as both stimulating and helpful in a line of teaching in which Sunday-schools are often deficient . ''

		Cloth , 12mo ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Like the best of Mr.
ALLEN	PERSON	'S writings , this is a story of
Kentucky	LOCATION	life , but in no degree a repetition of anything in his previous books .

		Indeed , the scenes which form the background of the story 's movement have never before been pictured in American fiction .

		The period is that at the close of the Civil War , about
1865	DATE	.

		All of the characters , but in an especial degree the young man and woman in whom the in - terest of the story centres , have felt the upheaval of standards , the social and intellectual changes , brought about by the war , and are adjusting themselves to the new conditions and relations forced on them by the war .

		Each is the child of a revolution ; she has been forced by circumstances from a high social position to obscure hard work , which she would not have been free to follow before the war ; his form of the new liberty is intellectual , where hers is social , but the two streams of revolution run together and act on each other .

		292 HEROINE AND FOIL IN MODERN FICTION .

		Among the dramatis personce of earlier novels of character , there are usually four dis - tinct types , the hero and the villain , the heroine and the feminine contrast , often desig - nated by critics as '' the foil . ''

		The villain of either sex has largely lost his identity in more recent fiction , a demise deeply mourned in clever essay by Miss Repplier and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		In current fiction , the hero and villain are sometimes indistinguishable to a casual reader , even when the author intends a subtle moral contrast .

		The modern villain has become a psychic and ethical study , not a plain criminal ; he seems merely one reflex of this unstable and speculative Zeitgeist .

		We have few sharp contrasts like those of past fiction ,
Parson Adams	PERSON	and Blifil ,
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	and
Squeers	PERSON	, Captain
Dobbin	PERSON	and the
Marquis	PERSON	of
Steyne	LOCATION	,
Earnshaw Hindley	ORGANIZATION	and
Heathcliff	ORGANIZATION	.

		A similar metamorphosis has taken place in the relations of heroine and foil .

		Perhaps more marked still is the change in the heroine her - self .

		The '' pale-lily '' type , the demure , lov - ing , suffering , opinion-shunning girl , has been succeeded by the athletic , efficient woman `` with a purpose . ''

		She may incidentally study the mirror , not that she may become a mere joy to her lover 's eyes , rather that she may find more potent means of '' wielding power . ''


Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	,
Anne Eliot	PERSON	,
Amelia Sedley	PERSON	, bear scant resemblance to their younger heroine-sisters ,
Diana Warwick	PERSON	,
Marcella Boy	PERSON	ce , Glory Quay le , and
Isabel Carnaby	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the earlier hero - ines were largely of one type , these later women ` are as diverse and paradoxical as the phases of modern life .

		They differ radically in person - ality , accomplishments , tenets of faith , but they are all self-reliant , brave , alert women .

		In earlier Victorian character-novels , the author 's ideal woman was in marked contrast to a weak or unwomanly foil .


Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, revealing her own reserve and sub - merged passion in her heroines ,
Jane Eyre	PERSON	and
Lucy Snowe	PERSON	, humbly serving boorish , selfish men , found foils in the type hated by her , the beautiful , vain schemers ,
Blanche Ingram	PERSON	and
Ginevra Fanshawe	ORGANIZATION	.


Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, heroines had Agatha 's lowly aspiration , '' Command was service ; humblest service done By willing and deserving souls was glory . ''


George Eliot	PERSON	, like
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, reflected not alone her ideals for women but much of her own personality in her heroines .

		All her great novels contain two antithetical women .

		Maggie and
Lucy	PERSON	,
Dinah	ORGANIZATION	and
Hetty	PERSON	,
Komola	PERSON	and
Tessa	PERSON	,
Dorothea	PERSON	and
Rosamond	PERSON	,
Gwendo	PERSON	- len and Mirah , they pass two by two in mem - ory !

		And these heroines , with their strong intellectual ambitions , their spiritual doubts , their renunciations and their sufferings , are progressive revelations of their creator .

		The foils from
Hetty	LOCATION	to Rosamond represent the wo - men of mental or moral weakness .

		All
George Eliot	PERSON	's women had throbbing emotional na - tures : her words on
Dorothea	PERSON	have wide applica - tion , '' All
Dorothea	PERSON	's passion was transfused through a mind struggling towards an ideal life ; the radiance of her transfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its level . ''

		Thackeray kept two distinct index-lists for his women .

		The immortal
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, whose adroitness and wit command our admiration , despite her defective moral sense , was a defiant contrast to
Amelia	LOCATION	.

		Becky Sharp had two sisters of milder adventurous trend , all names begin with B ,
Beatrix	PERSON	and Blanche .

		Bea - trix is a wonderful creature , '' whose eyes were fire , whose look was love , whose voice was the sweetest low song '' ;
Blanche Amory	PERSON	, foil in `` Pendennis , '' was embodiment of sentimen - tality and sham , who declared , '' If I can not have emotions , I must have the world . ''

		These foils are so much more alluring than their con - trasting heroines ,
Amelia	LOCATION	,
Isabel	LOCATION	, and
Laura	LOCATION	.

		Thackeray chose some apt , correlative epithets for Laura which well describe his heroines as a class , '' fair and open , kindly and pious , cheerful , tender , and true . ''

		With all these virtues , how uninteresting they are beside the clever , selfish , slightly wicked foils !

		Is it a silent comment upon the changing morals of '' the present that his foils attract us more than his heroines ?

		Is it not rather because his master-touch of delineation is far more skilful and potent in the complex studies of life ?

		Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, with his long service to literature and his wealth of women-charac - ters , represents both the older and the later types of heroines and foils . ''


Khoda Fleming	PERSON	'' and ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' present women of the past ; gradually the novelist evolved his chosen heroine , a woman of intellectual power .

		Mark his statement , '' A woman of intellect is as good as a Greek statue . ''

		Diana ,
Clara	LOCATION	,
Cecilia	PERSON	, with their mastering wit and poise and cognizance of state affairs , represent an ex - treme Amazonian type of women , whose coun - terparts are existent to-day in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In ''
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	'' the antithesis is strongly marked between the perverse , strong
Rhoda	PERSON	, and her weaker but more attractive sis - ter ,
Dahlia	ORGANIZATION	.

		In ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	, '' the heroine is environed by a group of varied women , the hypochondriac
Clare	PERSON	, the boyish
Carola	PERSON	, the faddish , strong-minded Lady
Judith	PERSON	, the adven - turess Bella , and the immortal Mrs.
Berry	PERSON	, with her maxim , '' Kissing do n't last ; cookery do . ''

		Racial traits have been media for contrasts .

		In earlier fiction
Hawthorne	PERSON	thus compared
Miriam	PERSON	and
Hilda	PERSON	.

		In the same way Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	found a foil for the thoroughly English Dora in the French Elise , though for purposes of testing
David Grieve	PERSON	she added a moral inse - curity to the keenness and charm of her foil .

		Peculiar training and inheritance also afford this novelist careful character-studies , in the intellectual , graceful Laura at
Bannisdale	LOCATION	and her foil
Polly Mason	PERSON	, with her '' fringe of hair '' and her '' crackling lemon-coloured gloves . ''


George Gissing	PERSON	has given modern fiction some matchless women-characters in his pow - erful realism .

		In the volume with the apt title , `` The Odd Women , '' the author has drawn with subtle irony the purposeful , independent
Rhoda	PERSON	, propagating the gospel of woman 's emancipa - tion , yet , with her '' lofty mission , '' she is still an erratic , jealous woman .


Mary Barfoot	PERSON	is the wise character who says to the misguided heroine , '' Guard yourself ,
Rhoda	PERSON	.

		To work for women , one must keep one 's womanhood . ''

		In recent American fiction the strongly dis - tinctive girl , with national spirit , has her foil in the woman of foreign education and standards .

		Thus Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	emphasized her heroine ,
Lee Tarleton	LOCATION	, in `` American Wives and English Husbands . ''

		Again , in '' Good Americans , '' Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	portrays the home-bred , earnest Aga - tha , versus
Sybil	PERSON	with foreign focus and customs .

		American women are of such varied types that they defy any exclusive classification .

		Some novels and contes content themselves with one or two distinctive portraits , while others are overcrowded with dissimilar characters , yet all possess the distinctive traits of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can woman , alertness , adaptability , ambition , force .

		Miss
Wilkins	PERSON	and her co-workers have depicted the old-time
New England	LOCATION	woman with a '' conscience , '' which was sometimes a mis - nomer for obstinacy , and her foil in the weak
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 sentimental '' spinster , '' with a latent poetic faculty .

		Miss Pool had a wider range of char - acter than the other
New England	LOCATION	conteurs ; in '' Red-Bridge Neighborhood '' she draws a fine contrast between the strong , loyal , wise heroine Olive and her rival , the vain , coquet - tish
Isabel Keating	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has as sure a grasp of American womanhood as he has of other phases of national life .

		Provincial
Lydia Blood	PERSON	was his pioneer among the self-reliant , sensible , unpolished American girls who have been given stronger development in
Cynthia Whitwell	PERSON	, at '' Lion 's Head , '' and
Clementina	PERSON	, the '' Ragged Lady . ''

		With coeval progression he has depicted his '' Gallery of Nervous Wo - men , '' from crude , high-strung
Marcia Gay	PERSON	- lord to
Louisa Maxwell	PERSON	, whose jealous caprices retarded and complicated `` The Story of a Play . ''

		Can we deny that both types are truly representative of modern American women ?

		Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	has photographed a delightful quartet of American women in ''
Caleb West	PERSON	. ''

		With characteristic chivalry he has made each a heroine ; Mrs.
Leroy	PERSON	and
Helen Shirley	PERSON	of society life are no more real and individual than simple , kindly '' Aunty Bell '' and pathetic little
Betty	PERSON	.

		The American matron is too strong a type to be passed by in fiction .

		In '' The Story of an Untold Love '' she stands in the shadow ,
Donald	PERSON	's mother , the home-wrecking , ambitious type .

		Miss
Lilian Bell	PERSON	, who has an acute vision of modernity , has made the prominent character in '' The Under - side of Things '' an American woman of strong yet unlovely nature .

		A vivid realism and morale commingle with the satire on Mrs.
Copeland	PERSON	's nose , a '' Code of Public Morals '' : '' After one critical look at her nose you knew why , when she sent a sick friend a potted plant , she asked her to return the pot , or , if she sent her jelly , she asked her to return the glass . ''

		Of quite dissimilar type is the woman physician , Dr.
Isabelle Herrick	PERSON	, made attractive by Mr.
Garland	PERSON	in '' Rose of
Dutcher	PERSON	's Coolly . ''

		Of all American novels presenting vivid contrasts , none surpass Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's sequential studies of city-life .

		The conception of
Carmen Eschelle	PERSON	, who , as a girl , was '' both entertaining and en - terprising , '' and who liked '' to drive very near the edge , '' with her subtle evil influence in '' A Little Journey , '' her moral apathy and legal crime in '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and her cul - minating ambition and downfall in '' That For - tune , '' forms a vivid and fo ` rceful character - sermon .

		In each book she acts as foil to a woman of pure , noble character .

		She can exert a malign influence upon
Margaret	PERSON	in the first story , but she finds resistance in the loyal reliant
Edith Delancy	PERSON	of '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Perhaps her best contrast is in the last sequel , in the character of her own pure , steadfast daughter ,
Evelyn	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	is always keen in his satire upon the vacillating tendencies of the '' new woman . ''

		In '' That Fortune '' he finds
Celia Howard	PERSON	'' a type of the awakened American woman , who does not know exactly what she wants ... She ... is distracted by the many opportunities .

		She has no sooner taken up one than she sees another that seems better . ''

		In modern fiction the representative women are strong physically as well as mentally .

		They are not alloyed to '' enjoy poor health '' in modern life or current novel .

		A desire for vital , salutary , health of body and mind char - acterize the woman of to-day , and these quali - ties appear in her fictitious portrait .

		The marvellous vigor and endurance of
Helen Sher	PERSON	- wood , the editor-heroine in '' The Gentleman from
Indiana	LOCATION	, '' impart a freshness and charm to a story that lacks many qualities of structure .

		A recent lecturer divided the modern woman into two categories , '' the woman who thinks and the woman who feels . ''

		Each class , with restrictions , has furnished material for novel - ists .

		If
Richardson	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	were disposed to apotheosize feeling and cari - cature intellectual cravings ,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
George Meredith	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	have canon - ized the woman of intellect and purpose versus the sentimental and rhapsodic type .

		In the evolution of educated womanhood , however , brain and heart must keep apace ; the woman who approximates an ideal heroine for a repre - sentative novelist and his clientele will both '' think and feel . ''

		Her foil , seldom now in very sharp antithesis and varied in traits , is the woman who '' thinks , '' or schemes , to the det - riment of healthy emotions ; or , on the other hand , she is the woman who '' feels '' without the exercise of trained mind and poised judgment .

		ART FOR MORALITY 'S SAKE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While insisting that '' in the final synthesis , beauty and truth and virtue are one and the same thing , '' and that '' the ' art 's sake ' shibboleth appears but a question - begging phrase , '' your leading article , '' The Artist and the Man , '' in the current number of THE DIAL comes perilously near to asserting , in the fashion of the day , that the only art is Art for Morality 's sake .

		This , it would seem , is a more dangerous position than the one which is there sought to be overthrown , i. e. , the position of those who hold to '' Art for Art 's sake . ''

		This latter phrase means different things to different minds .

		As a cloak for the expression of moral obliquity , it is an abomination .

		As an excuse for ignoring the canon that the highest art conceals art , it is the plea of artists who are not artists .

		But as meaning something different from Art for Morality 's sake it is not obnox - ious to criticism , in so far as it implies that the one essential thing in a work of art is its artistic quality and not its moral nor intellectual nor spiritual nor emotional nor imaginative nor any other quality taken by itself .

		In this latter sense it is surely the basis for a sound and proper criticism .

		Of these two positions , art for mere art 's sake is possible , art for mere morality 's sake incon - ceivable ; and a breadth of view which requires that form and substance , matter and manner , outward sign and inward grace , all be taken into account , is the only true critical position .

		Yet in the academic criticisms passed upon recent poets it is fairly evident that the idea implied in Art for Morality 's sake is gaining ground .

		To teachers the didactic quality of literary work is necessarily precious , and the professional point of view dominates .

		A poet who teaches , even though his didactic merit far exceed his poetic merit , is too often given the artistic rank which belong to his betters , i. e. , to those who are poets first and teachers afterward .

		No rational man doubts that the artist who has moral quality in addition to all the other qualities which go to make the true poet , is by so much the greater , any more than one doubts that , other things being equal , the poet whose numbers have the greater intellectual content is the greater poet ; but this is quite different from the assumption that writers of verses which charm by their craftsmanship rather than by their moral or intellectual qualities are to be denied the very name of artist .

		There is no more rea - son why poetry should be statedly moral than that morality should be statedly poetic : beauty and charm and rational amusement have ethical significance , as your article avers .

		Goethe 's dictum , '' read the work through the man , '' and the various quotations from
Ruskin	LOCATION	, are less than half a truth , and the complementary , '' read the man through his work , '' does not make it a whole one .

		When the art of the man greatly transcends his moral char - acter , no one holds to either or to both .

		Turner was utterly depraved , even in his art , so that scores of his pictures were given to the flames after his death ; but
Ruskin	PERSON	could still praise his better work extrava - gantly .

		When your article speaks of '' giving full ac - ceptance as poetry to the work of men whose character we may not call unblemished , '' it admits away the case , even though it says straightway that '' it would add distinctly to our satisfaction could we know them to have lived lives in stricter consonance with their ideals . ''

		The need for this justice charity it is not may be said to have been proved in such a work as '' The Insanity of Genius , '' even though its author failed in his main contention .

		But these things , after all , have to do with history and biography rather than with literary criticism as such , and are useful in settling the status of the dead rather than in adjudging the work of the living .

		If we hold , as so many do , that literary art is given primarily for instruction , we extol the preacher at the expense of the artist and , in so far , make art difficult .

		Who goes to the length of giving Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	rank over Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	?

		Yet there was once a controversy over the comparative merit of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Tupper	PERSON	, and there is to-day a pronounced disposition to apotheosize
Browning	PERSON	the Teacher at the expense of
Browning	PERSON	the Poet , and to deprecate Tennyson the Teacher because he never lost sight of his calling as a Poet .

		Probably the critical pendulum which had once swung so far toward the position of Art for Art 's sake that , as your article says , '' it seemed to hold the field against its opponents , '' has now gone near the other end of its arc in contending for Art for Morality 's sake .

		Scholars the world over are appreciative of the achievements of the late
Daniel Garrison Brinton	PERSON	, for he established on a firm basis the branches of learning to which he devoted his life .

		He is justly named the '' Founder of American Anthropology . ''

		A close student of the intricate problems of his science , he possessed the rare art of clearly and con - cisely presenting facts at their true values .

		He be - lieved in '' the general inculcation of the love of truth , scientific , verifiable truth , '' and that knowledge should subserve usefulness .

		A keen observer , a classical scholar , an adept in the methods of logic and philosophy , Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	had ever the practical application of truth in view .

		To the sys - tematic study of man he brought to bear his all-rounded culture to further the happiness and fullness of the in - dividual life .

		He regarded the individual as the start - ing point and goal of anthropology .

		Upon individual improvement , he claimed , depended group or racial improvement , social amelioration , and the welfare of humanity .

		It is proposed in recognition of the great services he rendered to the world by his teachings , numerous pub - lications , and untiring zeal in unearthing the false and proclaiming the true , to establish in his memory a
Brinton Chair of American Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	and Ethnology in the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		This proposition has received the universal commendation and approval of anthropological scholars both in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		At the Memorial Meeting the plan was favorably mentioned and grateful recognition accorded to Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	's unselfish devotion to his chosen life work .

		Provost
Harrison	PERSON	thought that to honor his memory no more worthy tribute - could be given than the founda - tion of a

		The choice of this place for the seat of the Brintou Memorial seems especially appropriate , since the Uni - versity of

Brinton	PERSON	's valuable library , his own gift shortly before his death .

		The association of
Brinton	PERSON	's name with the
University	ORGANIZATION	from

		`` THE TROUBADOURS AT HOME . ''

		A WORD FROM THE AUTHOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		Your review of '' The Troubadours at Home , '' in your issue of
March 16	DATE	, is evidently from a thoughtful and conscientious critic , and I have read it with particular interest , but it contains one inadvertence which it may possibly be worth while to have pointed out .

		The writer speaks of '' the author 's failure to achieve all the ends that he proposed to himself . ''

		What this failure is , a previous sentence explains : '' The world of the trou - badours has not risen clear , firm , coherent , and substan - tial in our minds .

		... Its parts are left too scattered , '' etc. .

		In my preface , page vii. , are these words : `` No attempt has been made , of course , to present anything like a complete account of the world of the troubadours , that alone would have required all the space at my disposal . ''

		That the parts are '' scattered '' follows from a fact explained elsewhere in the preface : while , as the reviewer says , a great deal of material of this kind is introduced , it is a means and not an end ; it is employed to make a background for the troubadours , and as these are treated one by one it is naturally divided up among them .

		Of course I am sorry to be represented in your influ - ential review as failing in an attempt to do something which for good reasons , as I thought I deliberately refrained from doing ; but I cheerfully recognize that the critic 's fault consisted only in being human .

Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	had failed `` to present a complete account of the world of the troubadours , '' but such an account as would make their world clear , credible , living , and real to the imagination .

		It seemed to him that Professor
Smith	PERSON	had but imperfectly realized the purpose indicated in the words of his preface , '' to constitute an environment and an atmosphere for the poets , '' and to induce with regard to '' the life , the events , the localities , and the personalities '' of the time '' a sense of actu - ality , '' and the reviewer endeavored to suggest an explanation of this lack of success .

		Her aunt , to whom the greater number of her epistles was addressed , as a privileged mentor urges upon her the following popular sentiment : '' Beauty in a woman is of no con - sequence , but a good carriage , a strait shape , and genteel person , mark the well-educated , and seem to me as necessary for a woman of any fashion as to know how to spell . ''

		That
Maria	PERSON	had beauty with her other engaging qualities is attested by the portraits taken at different stages of life , which are interspersed among her letters in the volumes before us .

		The young girl reflected credit upon her family .

		She was amiable , spirited , and high - bred , although from her aunt 's gentle admoni - tions we suspect her of a little more brusqueness and independence in thought and manner than accorded with the standard of polite society .

		Her time was divided between the town and the country , five months of the year in
London	LOCATION	and seven months at
Sheffield Place	ORGANIZATION	.

		In either residence she enjoyed intimate relations with the representatives of British aristocracy .

		One
summer	DATE	of her girlhood was spent at
Lousanne	LOCATION	, to which her family had resorted for the sake of renewed companionship with Mr.
Gibbon	PERSON	.

		Here as elsewhere she was in contact with per - sons of social and literary eminence .

		With her parents she was entertained at
Coppet	LOCATION	, the home of the Neckers in their exile from

		Of
M. Necker	PERSON	she writes : '' I never saw anything so broken-hearted as he ap - pears to be .

		Madam Necker is very learned , as you know , and talked a great deal with Mr.

		The young lady seldom bestows as many consecutive sentences upon any person or sub - ject as she has done in the above instance .

		Her comments are made with a swift touch and go that too often cheats the awakened interest of its due satisfaction .

		A large part of the period covered by the correspondence was marked by extraordinary unrest throughout

		Its loss was undoubtedly mourned in the mother 's heart , but there is no mention of it in her letters .

		They continue uninterrupted in their lively ac - count of days of unvarying enjoyment of the good things lavished unstintedly upon her .

		There seems from them to have been no room in the environment of Lady Stanley for the sorrows of ordinary mortals to creep in .

		Lord
Stanley	PERSON	was given to intellectual pur - suits .

		Every advantage had been afforded him in youth for education in schools and in foreign travel .

		He had profited by his privileges , and with a well-stored mind and studious tastes he preferred the life of a quiet country gentleman to the public career his rank and abilities could well have commanded .

		He lent dignity and weight to his name , yet it remained for
Arthur Penrhyn Stanley	PERSON	, Dean of Westminster , the son of his only brother ,
Edward	LOCATION	, Bishop of Nor - wich , to give it an eminence which the wide world recognizes .

		THE DIAL 275 combination of scientific training , practical ex - perience , and attractive style .

		His publica - tions have been remarkably numerous , but they have all been '' on the way '' toward his great Cyclopaedia , the first volume of which has just been issued .

		In
1881	DATE
Henderson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Handbook of Plants '' was published , in one volume , with a second edition in
1890	DATE	; and this has been the only cyclopedic work on horticulture published in
America	LOCATION	.

		It has long been in Professor
Bai	PERSON	- ley 's mind to make a complete record of the status of American horticulture , and its appear - ance at the close of the nineteenth century seems to be particularly appropriate .

		Now that the first volume is before us , the great wealth of American horticulture comes as a surprise .

		In American horticultural writings it has been the custom to draw too heavily from the experience of the Old World .

		Professor
Bailey	PERSON	says that this was necessary once , but that now it is time to break away .

		Accord - ingly , the Cyclopaedia is distinctly American in its flavor , fully setting forth American ex - perience and conditions .

		As
North America	LOCATION	is a land of outdoor horticulture , emphasis is laid upon the hardy fruits , trees , shrubs , and herbs , rather than upon the glasshouse and fanciers ' plants which occupy the chief atten - tion of most works .

		The editor aptly says that '' the most diffi - cult part of the making of a cyclopedia is to project it .

		Its scope and point of view must be determined before a stroke of actual work is done .

		This much done , the remainder is labor rather than difficulty . ''

		The first para - graph of the Preface tersely states the editor 's aim : '' It is the purpose of this work to make a complete record of the status of North American horticulture as it exists at the close of the nineteenth century .

		The work discusses the cultivation of fruits , flowers , and garden vegetables , describes all the species which are known to be in the horticultural trade , outlines the hor - ticultural possibilities of the various states , territories , and provinces , presents biographies of those persons not living who have contributed most to the horticul - tural progress of
North America	LOCATION	, and indicates the leading monographic works relating to the various subjects . ''

		To compile a cyclopaedia by using other standard works involves drudgery , but presents no special difficulties , and results in no special merits .

		It is hack work , and necessarily in - volves neither expert service nor skill in pre - sentation .

		In short , it is the dull pigeon-holing of facts more or less trustworthy .

		Upon open - ing Professor
Bailey	PERSON	's Cyclopaedia , however , one is introduced into an atmosphere totally different .

		It is the atmosphere of expert work , organized by one who is strong and original , and who has a genius for fresh and telling pre - sentation .

		The work is new from start to fin - ish , both in text and illustrations , and the long list of collaborators represents the most expert assistance .

		Horticulturists and botanists by the score have responded to the requests of the editor for help , and when the final list of col - laborators is published in the fourth volume it will probably make a roster of the leading hor - ticulturists and botanists of
North America	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations , too , deserve special men - tion for the happy combination of scientific and artistic excellence , and it has been one of the rules of the '' make-up '' that wherever the book opens an engraving will be seen .

		In this part of the work a dozen artists have been em - ployed in various horticultural centres to draw plants as they grow .

		Some conception of the details which enter into a cyclopedia of horticulture may be ob - tained from some of the following items : `` More than 10,000 species of plants in cultivation ; almost every important species phenomenally variable , sometimes running into thousands of forms ; every spe - cies requiring its own soil and treatment , and sometimes even minor varieties differing in these requirements ; limitless differences in soils and climates in our great domain , every difference modifying the plants or their requirements ; a different ideal in plant-growing and plant-breeding in the mind of every good grower ; as many different kinds of experience as there are men ; many of these men not facile with the pen , although full of wholesome fact and experience ; the species de - scribed in books which deal with the four corners of the earth ; very few botanists who have given attention to the domestic flora . ''

		One can make no selections from a work con - taining such a vast amount of miscellaneous material , but perhaps the best idea of it can be obtained by stating what one can find in it .

		One interested in horticulture can find any group of plants in cultivation , probably a genus .

		The genus is described in a general way , its essential characters , geographical range , and any notable uses being given .

		Then follows a synopsis of all the species in cultivation , with keys and brief descriptions , so that one may '' run down '' and determine any special plant , just as in an ordinary manual .

		Then full cul - tural notes follow , so that one may discover the best methods of handling his plant .

		Under the titles of the various states , territories , and provinces , one interested in horticulture finds the best possible information as to the horti - cultural possibilities of any region .

		In short , 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	r to such an one the Cyclopaedia would seem to be a sine qua non .

		But the horticulturist is not the only one who has been looking for this great work .

		Professional botanists have been expecting it eagerly , for it is a mass of most valuable infor - mation , bringing together , as it does , into avail - able and properly edited form , the immense contributions of facts from horticulturists to the whole evolutionary doctrine .

		It enables the morphologist to know not only the form he is handling , but also what it has been made to do , and what promise there is in it for further re - sults .

		It is such works that will bring together professional horticulturists and professional botanists .

		They need each other badly , and such a student as
Darwin	PERSON	was wise enough to see that horticulturists and breeders had been for years performing experiments upon a gi - gantic scale bearing upon the theory of descent .

		The editor has assured us that the second volume is going to be better than the first , not only in typography and cuts , but also in matter .

		The work was well under way before the organ - ization got down to the real way of doing things .

		One must write a book first in order to learn how to write it .

		SOME INTERESTING STAGE MEMORABILIA .

		* It was
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	who truthfully re - marked : '' The sculptor and the architect , the painter and the poet , live in their works which endure after them ; the actor 's work dies when he dies . ''

		And to those who put into perma - nent form a record of the achievements of his - trionic notabilities who are worthy of our present thoughts and later memories , we owe a debt of gratitude .

		A rare biography , exe - cuted with remarkable fidelity , is the recent life of the Kendals , by Mr.
T. Edgar Pember	PERSON	- ton .

		Direct , discriminating , and comprehen - sive , the book gives more than a mere personal sketch , in the picture of the times and condi - tions in which their work has been accom - plished .


William Hunter Grimston	PERSON	, the son of an artist , was born in
London	LOCATION	on
December 16 , 1843	DATE	.

		Though educated for the medical pro- fession , he drifted at an early age into theat - rical life ; and in
1861	DATE	a hitherto unknown * THB KENDALS : A Biography .

		By
T. Edgar Pemberton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Kendall	PERSON	'' figured in the bills of the
Koyal Soho	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now the
Royalty Theatre	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as Louis XIV .

		in a play called '' A Life 's Revenge . ''

		The stage was not recognized at that time as one of the artistic professions and it was customary to use an assumed name .

		Kendal , owing to its resemblance to the famous theatrical name of
Kemble	LOCATION	, thus owes its existence .

		Mr.
Kendal	PERSON	's advance was slow and gradual .

		After his con - nection with the famous
Haymarket	LOCATION	company , the battle was half won ; the other half was within imperceptible reach when he joined for - tunes with Miss
Margaret Robertson	PERSON	.

		From then on the course of his career is familiar to all students of the modern drama .

		He has endeavored throughout his work to elevate the stage and render it subservient to the great interests of society and morality .

		In the robust , manly , and poetical characters that he has been called upon to play , he has always seemed to portray '' Courtliness , and the desire of fame , And love of truth , and all that makes a man . ''

		According to an authority on things theat - rical , the Marylebone Theatre bill for
May 20 , 1854	DATE	, was '' The Orphan of the Frozen Sea '' ; and in this ``
Marie	PERSON	, a child , '' was represented by ''
Miss Robertson	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Kendal	PERSON	was then of such tender years that it was not easy , until this bill was adduced in evidence , to convince her at a later day that she had ever made the debut at all .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	traces her career from then on down to '' The Elder Miss
Blos	PERSON	- som , '' that essentially human and sympathetic play in which the Kendals are now appearing in this country .

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	voiced a popular sentiment when he said : '' If we are to have a
Lady Macbeth	LOCATION	, a Volumnia , a Con - stance , in the present generation , Mrs.
Kendal	PERSON	is the woman .

		Having been our Mrs.
Jordan	PERSON	, why should she not become our Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	? ''

		There are few actresses on the contemporary stage who are so engrossed in their art as Mrs.
Kendal	PERSON	. ''

		The true actor , '' she says , '' consciously or uncon - sciously , carries his art along with him .

		If I go out to a reception I am at work often unknown to myself .

		I see a certain woman is interested in a certain man ; is given either joy or grief through him .

		I watch her expression , I follow the play of nerve and muscle in her face , and thus I learn how the human face reveals the workings of the human soul . ''

		Mr.
Kendal	PERSON	, likewise , has ideals , in the dra - matic sense , and lives near to them .

		He forms his own opinions on what he sees and hears ; and when he adopts anything , he adopts it , not because ipse dixit , but because of its intrinsic
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 merit .

		There is more than passing significance in this fact .

		In criticising any actor , or actress , it is difficult , if not impossible , to separate our impressions of the acting from our impressions of the person who acts .

		In every other art the finished work of the artist is embodied in a form quite distinct from the producer , and stands or falls by itself .

		For instance , to en - joy and properly appreciate the Fifth Sym - phony of
Beethoven	LOCATION	, it is not necessary to in - quire from whence he derived his inspiration to inquire into the motives which resulted in the finished work .

		In dramatic art , how - ever , all this is reversed .

		The actor embodies in his own person , before our eyes , the passions which he undertakes to represent ; they can not be judged apart from him .

		Hence we have a yearning curiosity , as it were , to peep at his inner life to learn of the methods pursued by an actor which results in the culmination of his art .

		Regarding the stage as a career , Mrs.
Ken	PERSON	- dal has expressed her opinion totidem verbis , and her views are of more than momentary interest : '' I think acting is a most excellent field for young women , but it must be a field , not a pasture .

		It is not a pasture on which thousands can graze .

		Instead of having a hundred in the field we have ten thousand , and there is n't room for them all .

		Everybody nowadays wants to go upon the stage , and some may have advant - ages in the way of appearance and youth and education , but this particular art is not to be taught .

		Therefore , they may have good looks , they may have youth , they may have education , and yet have not acting .

		Acting is a thing that 's inside , not outside at all .

		The modern audience is apt to think that acting consists of outside attributes , but it is not so .

		Then again , when you can act and have made money , people are apt to call it luck .

		I have always been called a lucky woman , but I do n't think it 's all luck .

		I am vain enough to think that some of it is hard work very hard work constant and everlasting work .

		You must never cease to study .

		As you get older , you must fill up the wrinkles with intelligence . ''

		The volume contains many valuable views on subjects connected with the stage and on the present condition of the drama including Mrs.
Kendal	PERSON	's much discussed paper on '' The Drama , '' which was delivered by her at the congress of the
National Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Promotion of Social Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the whole , Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has succeeded in making his book interesting , as well as instructive ; it re - veals the author 's familiarity with the stage and its history ; anecdote has been interspersed , though not too freely , with fact .

		We find in it little of that convenient omission and ignor - ing of dates which make many theatrical biog - raphies exasperating .

		There are a few , perhaps , who would have preferred to have had the book written from a more impartial standpoint by one other than a life-long friend of the Kendals .

		Had we waited for this , we would have never had an accurate record ; even as the present work was nearing completion , Mrs.
Kendal	PERSON	grew nervous , declaring that except in the exercise of her art she had never courted publicity . ''

		Write my husband 's Life if you desire , '' she said , 11 and only mention me as you would any other actress he has played with .

		His career should be written , and he does not mind , only ignore me as much as you pos - sibly can !

		I prefer it . ''

		The words are characteristic of the woman she has invested her genius with greater love - liness by throwing over it the graceful mantle of humility .


INGRAM A. PYLE	PERSON	.

		AN ENGLISHMAN ON ENGLAND AND THE BOERS .

		* The condemnation of
England	LOCATION	's course in the war with the two Republics comes with the most force from precisely that element in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	which corresponds to the opponents of an imperialistic policy in the
United States	LOCATION	, and every Englishman who has expressed his open regret at the attempt to array
America	LOCATION	among '' the sly freebooters of the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' is also outspoken in his denuncia - tion of
England	LOCATION	's course in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		It seems to be true , also , that ignorance in both countries is the best support of imperialism , and the imperialistic press and censorship in
England	LOCATION	have adopted identically the same policy respecting
South Africa	LOCATION	that was adopted before them by the imperialistic press and cen - sorship of the
United States	LOCATION	respecting the
Philippines	LOCATION	: with rare exceptions , our cousins across the sea are following our vicious exam - ple to the letter .

		It is undoubtedly true that the average British subject in
Hong Kong	LOCATION	knows more about the Philippine war than any American not connected with Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	's govern - ment , just as every American knows more about the South African war than any Englishman not connected with Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's govern - ment ; and the few exceptions only prove the universality of the rule .

		One of these excep - tions , in
England	LOCATION	, is Mr.
John Atkinson	PERSON	* THE WAR IN
SOUTH AFRICA	LOCATION	: Its Causes and Effects .

		By
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		278 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	,
Hobson	PERSON	, M. A.Oxon. , the well-known university extension lecturer and economist , and the au - thor of various books of moment .

		Mr.
Hobsoii	PERSON	spent the
summer	DATE	and autumn of last year in
South Africa	LOCATION	for the purpose of familiarizing himself with the situation , and now sets forth , in '' The War in
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' all that he could learn from both sides at first hand and by persistent and intelligent inquiry among all classes of people in the British colonies and the two Republics .

		The result is a calm , dispas - sionate marshalling of facts which gives the lie to every contention of the British Jingo , while it leaves a clear and striking impression of the many faults and weaknesses of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	under Mr.
Krueger	PERSON	.

		The American public is too familiar with the various contentions to require their exposition here in any detail ; but it is well to say that no facts can be found to support the post bellum theory of the British Tory that there was ever any reason to fear an attempt on the part of the Dutch in any part of
South Africa	LOCATION	, whether Republicans or colonists , to wrest control from
Great Britain	LOCATION	of the government there ; and that the wild stories of wholesale corruption in
Pretoria	LOCATION	rest upon no assured basis of truth whatever , the merest rumor and slightest infer - ence being taken for facts to bolster up a wicked cause .

		And not merely wicked , but foolish ; for the concluding chapters of this interesting and thoroughgoing volume are devoted to an inquiry into the policy which Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	and his fellow-imperialists must pursue after the present open hostilities have ceased .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	believes there will be a long period of guerilla warfare , and that the taking of Pre - toria will no more bring peace than the taking of Bloomfontein '' it is doubtful , '' he says , '' if we can spare the strength which will be needed for keeping the
Boers	PERSON	of the Republics as a subject race . ''

		But , even assuming a firm settlement , what then ? ''

		It will evidently work out in one of two ways , '' re - plies Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	. ''

		Either the Outlanders will be dominant as a political party , in which case the mining magnates , who have organized this attack , will rule the
Transvaal	LOCATION	as De Beers rules
Kimberley	PERSON	, controlling the Outlander vote by economic force ; or , if the old burgher party should remain more numerous , or should detach enough of the non-British Outlanders , then the British , whose flag floats at
Pretoria	LOCATION	, will find themselves out - voted at the polls , and ; subjected to the practical control of their enemies , embittered by the memories of the war , and bent on every sort of constitutional reprisal .

		Such is one of the dilemmas which will be the legacy of this disastrous war : the choice between an oligarchy of financial Jews , and a restoration of Boer domination . ''

		Nor does that end the tale of the woes , like those of the Apocalypse , which are to follow the attempt to substitute catastrophe for evolu - tion and natural law on the part of the gold magnates , aided by Messrs.
Rhodes	PERSON	and Cham - berlain .

		As
Gladstone	PERSON	foresaw , as the repeated refusals of Sir
A. Milner	PERSON	to convoke the Par - liament of the
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	attest , the alterna - tive in the colonies confessedly British is fraught with equal danger to British prestige : it is government by '' military despotism and Downing Street '' on one hand , and government by the numerical majority of the Dutch on the other this latter case requiring that the Dutch be not alienated by the '' long protracted period of coercion '' which is even now frowning in the place of popular government .

		The outlook , black as it is to British imperialists , is white with hope for lovers of liberty , since British domination , based upon force , must end in
South Africa	LOCATION	, whether the issue of the present war be successful or not .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's book is the most important contribution yet made to a most important subject .

		WALLACE RICE .

		THE IJETTERS OP
CICERO	LOCATION	.

		* The text and the chronological order of the correspondence of Cicero have received so much careful study of recent years that a com - plete English translation was as inevitable as desirable .

		But a good translation , faithful to the thought and tone of the original and in lucid , idiomatic English , was what was wanted ; and here inevitability and desirability ceased to keep company .

		For it must be said that both the English of Mr.
Evelyn Shuckburgh	PERSON	's recent translation , and his rendering of the thought , leave much to be desired .

		From the standpoint of the English , there are two classes of faults frequent enough to invite criticism , an inaccuracy growing out of carelessness or bad training on the one hand , and an overstrained attempt to reproduce the easy familiarity of
Cicero	LOCATION	's epistolary style on the other .

		Under the first heading one meets such expressions as '' five cohorts ... having taken up its quarters , '' II .

		101 ; '' I came to the incident of Sestius , after receiving many wounds in the temple of Castor , having been preserved by the aid of Bestia , '' I. 216 ; '' I have not been idle , and am not being idle now , '' I. 328 ; '' What was -LRB- had -RRB- she to do with the * THB LETTERS OF

		THE DIAL 279 Latin feriae ? ''

		1 .

		10 ; '' as far as can be as yet conjectured , '' I. 12-13 . ''

		Shall '' and '' will '' are apparently regarded as universally inter - changeable , while `` farther '' and `` farther - more '' are used exclusively where any careful writer would employ '' further '' and '' further - more . ''

		And even where one can not allege specific grounds of offense , it is impossible to forget the words of
Horace	PERSON	, '' Vitavi denique culpam , Non laudem merui '' Of course it would not do to transfer the easy epistolary Latin of
Cicero	PERSON	and his corre - spondents into the English of serious and digni - fied literature , and it may be that the attempt to reproduce the peculiar tone of such Latin in - volves pitfalls beyond the detection of the most wary ; but as between overdoing and under - doing the assumed '' familiarity '' of the letters , the error of conservatism is to be preferred .

		To illustrate ,
M. Caelius Rufus	PERSON	writes to
Cicero	LOCATION	, '' Ecquando tu hominem ineptiorem quam tuum Cn .

		Pompeium vidisti , qui tantas turbas , qui tarn nugax esset , commorit ? ''

		which is rendered , '' Did you ever see a more futile person than your friend
Pompey	LOCATION	, for hav - ing stirred up all this dust , without any stuff in him , after all ? ''

		The difficulty with such translation is that it recognizes no distinction between the absence of conscious attention to dignity of expression and the presence of a con - scious preference for '' slang . ''

		In the same letter the words '' Hdbeo autem quam multa '' have not the slightest trace of anything below the dignity of the most serious and elevated literary art , and yet they are rendered , '' And what a lot I have ! ''

		Failures to catch the exact meaning of the Latin are much more numerous than the rec - ognized cases in which ambiguity in the text is admitted .

		A frequently recurring instance of this is the failure to recognize the so-called epistolary use of the Imperfect , Perfect , and Pluperfect tenses , so common in
Cicero	LOCATION	's letters and so entirely foreign to English letter - writing .

		All in all , we can but feel sorry that a trans - lation with so many flaws should have appeared and thus cut off the hope of a thoroughly good rendering for years to come .

		The ideal trans - lator of these letters should have an unusual mastery of English , and should then let his work go through the hands of experts in some half dozen different phases of the original text before submitting it to the public .

		As it is , we can only hope that the demand for this translation will be sufficient to justify an early and searching revision .

		MYTH AND FANCY OF ANIMAL , AND PLANT .

		* Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's recent `` Animal and Plant Lore '' is a continuation of her '' Current Super - stitions '' published in
1896	DATE	as No .

		IV .

		of the Memoirs of the
American Folklore Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The earlier book was reviewed in THE DIAL at the time of its appearance .

		As this volume was already planned , beliefs regarding zoolog - ical or botanical objects were omitted from '' Current Superstitions . ''

		The matter for both volumes was '' collected from the oral tradition of English-speaking folk . ''

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	has been engaged for several years upon the present collection , which fairly represents the whole
United States	LOCATION	.

		European material -LRB- in situ -RRB- is intentionally excluded from the main text .

		The individual items of belief are numbered .

		The collection includes
1397	DATE	such items , of which
1127	DATE	are animal lore and the remaining 270 are plant lore .

		From the animal list we may remove fifty-five numbers which present popular names of animals .

		These are inter - esting folk-lore , but not direct expressions of belief or superstition .

		To classify the mass of superstitions remain - ing is a difficult task .

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	recognizes thirteen classes which a folk-lore student might have been expected to avoid doing !

		These classes are : vii .

		Folk Medicine , viii .

		Various .

		PLANT LOBB .

		ix .

		Amulets , Charms , and Divinations .

		x. Omens , xi .

		Weather Signs , xii .

		Folk Medicine , xiii .

		Various .

		Some of these classes are subdivided : thus , the discussion of animal weather signs is divided into four subdivisions .

		Naturally it is difficult to always assign an item to its proper subdivi - sion .

		Still , it seems that this part of Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's work might have been more carefully done .

		It is questionable whether witches are a part of animal lore : admitting them to be so , why is No. 56 inserted under the head of ghosts and witches , and why does it appear in a collection of animal lore ?

		It states '' A man can spell a gun ' so that the gun will not hit anything . ''

		Why is No. 1180 called a divination ?

		It runs `` mountain ash , locally known as ' dogwood , ' is used to make tillers of boats for luck . ' '

April 16	DATE	, said to ' call for rain ' '' is properly placed among animal weather signs ; why is not No. 652 '' ' More wet , more wet ' the robin is said to say before rain '' put with it ?

		It is placed among Incantations and Formulae where it surely does not belong .

		We admit the difficulty in making proper location of these items ; but the greater the difficulty , the greater should be the care used .

		We can not refrain from mentioning two other examples of similar carelessness .

		In a classified and numbered list of superstitions there should be no repetitions .

		Yet there are a considerable number .

		502 and 646 are identical ; so are 653 with 654 and 495 ; so are 355 and 676 , 390 and 680 ; other cases might be pointed out .

		653 with 654 , identical with 495 , ought never to have been introduced into this collection of the lore of English-speaking folk .

		They are in an American Indian lan - guage .

		Either all such lore should be excluded or a real collection should be made from this astonishingly rich native field .

		The other point of criticism relates to a lack of system in the numbering .

		In 215 are given three variants of a common saying in reference to judging a horse offered for sale .

		They are more unlike than many variants which in other parts of the text are given distinct numbers .

		A fourth variant of this same saying is thrown into the notes instead of being placed in the text .

		Why ?

		-LRB- Perhaps it came to hand too late for proper incorporation ? -RRB-

		A still worse example of careless numbering is shown in the already objectionable Indian saying .

		In one place it appears as a simple saying and is given one number 495 : in another it is divided and two numbers are given it 653 , 654 .

		We have appeared far more critical than we feel .

		The collection is an interesting one ; the arrangement of the material is , on the whole , good .

		A valuable feature of the book is the section of Notes .

		These notes either give fur - ther information regarding the items in the main body of the text , or present similar be - liefs and superstitions from other chiefly European lands and languages .

		Mr.
Joseph Bergen	PERSON	in an introduction throws out some hints and suggestions regarding the interest and bearing of the material .

		We wish that Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	had discussed some of the inter - esting groups of superstitions which she pre - sents : no one is better qualified than she to do so .

		We may query in closing whether much of what here is labeled superstition is not really true , or was not so formerly .

		Mr.
Bergen	PERSON	himself suggests that there may be truth in some of the weather signs .

		No. 112J states a common no - tion regarding the manufacture of ammonia : the idea was amply justified by former methods .

		No doubt many items of folk-medicine are as serviceable as the recognized remedies of the physician ; there may be virtue in more of them than the critical folklorist admits .

		The use of animal oils in healing was formerly widespread .

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	gives an interesting presentation of this , in numbers 821-836 .

		We were a little surprised to find no reference to the use of human fat in dressing wounds .

		The Spaniards in the Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	made constant use of the fat of slain Indians for this purpose .

		It will be strange indeed if Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	does not come upon some evidence that English-speaking folk also believe in its efficacy .

		THE DIAL 281 cies , '' have been woven into a pleasing fabric by Dr.
Shute	PERSON	in his '' First Book of Organic Evolution . ''

		The author disclaims originality and makes no pre - tense of proving the truth of Evolution a welcome change .

		His aim , rather , has been to prepare an elementary introduction to the Development theory which should be '' interesting and easily intelligible to the general reader . ''

		In this he has succeeded .

		` Classic illustrations are freely used , though the work is quite up to date in its scope and data .

		In fresh - ness , simplicity , and comprehensiveness the book leaves little to be desired in an elementary treatise .

		The discussion of biological phenomena of general interest , such as heredity , is especially complete , and this chapter is to be commended to those who wish a presentation of rival theories now contending for supremacy .

		An elementary treatment lends itself readily if indeed it does not demand dogmatic statement of propositions .

		On some subjects , as for example mimicry , recognition marks , and regen - eration , conclusions are stated with a positiveness which many would desire to qualify until experi - mental evidence had adequately justified the hy - pothesis .

		The colored plates made by the color printing process add greatly to the attractiveness and value of the work , and exemplify the applica - bility of this method to scientific illustration .

		A work with a somewhat similar aim is '' Dar - winism and Lamarckism , '' by
Captain Hutton of New Zealand University	ORGANIZATION	, who sets forth the present status of the discussion of the factors of organic evolution in a way '' sufficiently clear to be under - stood at the first reading , and sufficiently short to discourage skipping . ''

		In this work the outlook is broader and the treatment less technical and more philosophical than it is in the book just mentioned .

		The author was one of the earliest advocates of Darwinism , and is still loyal to all the tenets of his master , candidly setting forth the arguments of the Lamarckians and the Neo Darwinian school only to oppose them and to return to the position of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		The only contribution to the subject which the author brings forward as original is the idea that diversification of primitive pelagic life was occasioned by volcanic disturbances which caused local differences in the chemical constituents of the sea water .

		The author has succeeded admirably in preparing a well-balanced and logical presentation of
Darwin	PERSON	's views in the light of current criticism , And his book easily ranks with the best of recent reviews of the subject for the general reader .

		The solution of a specific biological problem according to the principles of organic evolution is presented in Dr.
R. F. Scharff	PERSON	's '' History of the European Fauna , '' recently imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	as a volume of the '' Contemporary Science Series . ''

		The author seeks to analyze the distribution of the existing European fauna , and to indicate the orig - inal sources of its component elements , by a careful examination of the distribution of previous faunas as shown in fossil remains and by correlation of the f aunistic chronology with geological changes which conditions the migration of animals .

		The origin of the fauna of the British Isles is in itself an inter - esting problem and one in which the author is well versed , so that we are not surprised to find this theme prominent in the book .

		Much of the evi - dence necessarily pertains to the group of verte - brates , the data regarding the distribution of inver - tebrates at present , and especially in the past , being very meagre .

		These limitations , however , do not deter the author from the attempt to trace the movements of the pre-historic fauna of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The author recognizes an ancient contribution from the Arctic regions , and another from the Siberian steppes ; he also traces the invasion from the Orient and from Lusitauia , closing his work with a chapter dealing with the various explanations offered for the peculiarities of the Alpine fauna .

		The influence of biological thought has long been felt in the field of sociology , but owing to the ex - tent of the two sciences , few have attempted to make in detail an extended comparison of the opera - tion of the laws of organic evolution in the two fields .

		Various approaches have been made , it is true , but usually from the one side or the other .

		Under the stimulus of the
Brussels Institute of Sociology	ORGANIZATION	, three specialists MM .

		Jean Demoor , Jean M assart , and
Emile Vandervelde	PERSON	representing the sciences of zoology , botany , and sociology , have severally and jointly endeavored to trace and to illustrate the part that atrophy plays in the evolution of plant and ani - mal life and in the development of social institutions .

		By this coordination and combination of research , the authors hope to avoid the exaggerations which have led critics to declare the bankruptcy of bio - logical sociology .

		The work has been translated in a felicitous style by Mrs.
Chalmers Mitchell	PERSON	, and constitutes the seventy-ninth volume of the '' Inter - national Scientific Series . ''

		The authors content themselves with outlining the conception of society as an organism , developing no argument in the de - fense of this view , stating briefly the objections which may be raised to the rigid comparison of the operation of the laws of evolution in an organic aggregate bound together by the ties of physiolog - ical continuity and physical heredity , with the oper - ation of these laws in a social aggregate bound together principally by the bonds of mental relations and social heredity .

		Throughout the discussion the terms degeneration and atrophy are used in their broadest sense , and include some processes and some illustrations which lend themselves equally , if not preferably , to other categories .

		Granting that their comparisons can at the best give but analogies at least in the biological sense the authors proceed to the discussion of the universality of retrogressive processes in all modifications of organs and institu - tions .

		They show that degenerative evolution fol - lows no definite path and does not retrace the steps of progress to the primitive condition ; that an atrophied organ or institution never reappears , nor does it reassume its former or a new function ; and that degenerative evolution is brought about by a 282 THE DlAl , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, limitation of the means of subsistence , the principal agents in biology being the struggle for existence between organs and organisms , while in sociology this is replaced by artificial selection .

		The work is broad in its conception , moderate in statement , scholarly in execution , and well merits a place in the '' International Scientific Series . ''

		No single publication so promptly and adequately reflects the trend and scope of American biological work as does the annual volume of '' Lectures '' de - livered at the
Marine Biological Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	at
Woods Holl	LOCATION	.

		The topics discussed in these lectures are usually of general interest , and frequently per - tain to the latest conclusions on fundamental prob - lems of natural science .

		The volume for
1898	DATE	, for example , opens with a critical discussion of the physical structure of protoplasm , by Professor
E. B. Wilson	PERSON	.

		Other papers follow which deal with the structure of cells , with the differentiation of the various organs of the embryo in the egg , and with the first indications of the planes of symmetry of the adult .

		The phenomena of cell-life and the problems of embryology do not , however , monopo - lize the work .

		Dr.
Watase	PERSON	writes of '' Protoplasmic Contractility and Phosphorescence , '' and Professor Morgan of '' Some of the Problems of Regenera - tion '' following mutilation and amputation in the lower animals .

		A statistical study of the '' Elim - ination of the Unfit '' among the introduced English sparrows at
Providence	LOCATION	,
R. I.	PERSON	, by the great storm of
Feb. 1 , 1898	DATE	, affords Professor Bumpus the op - portunity to illustrate the action of natural selection .

		In previous studies he had shown that since intro - duction the English sparrow had developed a range of variation not found under the more vigorous conditions of European competition .

		His present work demonstrates that '' natural selection is most destructive of those birds which have departed most from the ideal type , and its activity raises the gen - eral standard of excellence by favoring those birds which approach the structural ideal . ''

		Other papers deal with pain sensations in the lower animals , with the fossil mammals of
North America	LOCATION	, and with the contribution to biological thought of Caspar Fried - rich
Wolff	PERSON	in the eighteenth century .

		The closing lecture by Professor
C. O. Whitman	PERSON	is a scholarly discussion of '' Animal Behavior '' in a new and un - conventional method based upon extensive observa - tions upon leeches , mud-puppies , and pigeons .

		He traces the primary roots of instinct back to the con - stitutional properties of protoplasm , opposes the habit theory of its origin , and regards it as the actual germ of mind .

		The volume is a fitting ex - ponent of American biological scholarship ; and although some of its pages are technical , there is much in it of greatest interest and stimulus to the reader and thinker who would be conversant with the biological thought of the day .

		At the age of eighty , Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	has brought to a successful conclusion the revision of the second volume of his '' Principles of Biology . ''

		The added matter in this volume is less extensive and less important than that made to the first vol - ume .

		It consists principally of minor changes in the text rendered necessary by the discoveries of recent years and of additions emendatory or ex - planatory of the original .

		One important chapter on '' The Integration of the Organic World '' is a generalization from the law of evolution in its most transcendental form which recognizes '' something like a growing life of the entire aggregate of organ - isms in addition to the lives of individual organisms an exchange of services among the parts enhanc - ing the life of the whole . ''

		He proposes the term constitutional units for the ultimate particles of the germ plasm formerly designated as physiological units , but retains unmodified the '' stress and strain '' argument for the segmentation of the vertebrate animal , though this view is by no means generally accepted to-day by morphologists .

		For those who look upon man as the product of evolution , Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	has prepared in his '' Man and his Ancestor '' a resume of the subject '' to enable this class of readers to test the quality and sufficiency of their belief . ''

		Another reason given for this compilation of fact and theory , is the fact that nearly thirty years have elapsed since the publication of
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Descent of Man '' and '' Sexual Selection , '' and his work is to this extent antiquated .

		We fear , however , that the general public as well as the scientific world will be sur - prised to learn that
Darwin	PERSON	's masterpieces '' at best can not be considered as well suited for general read - ing . ''

		The book affords a convenient summary but it is not complete ; for example , the discussion of vestigial organs ignores entirely Wiedersheim 's ex - haustive treatise on '' The Structure of Man '' ; nor is it critical in its acceptance of evidence .

		A con - troversial tone is apparent at times , and its pages abound in didactic and even dogmatic statement of the sheerest speculations ; for example , the chapter on '' How the Chasm Was Bridged '' presents not a figment of evidence , though it contains not a little of the stuff that dreams are made of .

		The author has woven his fact and fancy together in a very readable book , but we fear that contrary to his expectations it will only bring skepticism alike in the ranks of the believers and of the unbelievers .

		The study of botany in the home , or in the school - room where laboratory facilities are meagre , will be greatly facilitated by the suggestions of Dr.
MacDougal	PERSON	's admirable little book , '' The Nature and Work of Plants . ''

		It is intended as an intro - duction to the study of plants as active organisms , and treats of their various functions , illustrating them - by many simple experiments which anyone can perform .

		This method of approach is sure to incite and sustain the interest of the pupil , and has high educational value as a practical application of the experimental method to the elementary study of a biological science . ''

		The Honey-Makers , '' by Miss
Margaret Mor	PERSON	- ley , is written in a popular vein in the style of her previous books on natural history subjects T > In
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 simple language she describes the structure of bees , their social organization , and the products of their industry from wax to hydromel .

		She then takes her readers far afield through the literature of
India	LOCATION	and the Orient , of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, and of Christian and Mediaeval times , in search of apian myth and fancy , but descends from the slopes of Hymettus to relate the curious customs and be - liefs that have gathered about the apiary , and to report the present status of bee-culture throughout the world .

		The book is thus not only a contribution to the natural history of the bee , but also a veritable literary compendium of the '' little people . ''

		A sixth volume of the '' Science Series '' treats of '' Bacteria , '' especially as they are related to the economy of nature , to industrial processes , and to public health .

		A work of this sort is much needed for popular information upon the scope , methods , and results of bacteriological science .

		Bacteria are omnipresent . ''

		They occur in our drinking water , in our milk supply , in the air we breathe .

		They ripen cream and flavour butter .

		They purify sew - age and remove waste organic products from the land .

		They are active agents in a dozen industrial fermentations .

		They assist in the fixation of free nitrogen and they build up assimilable compounds .

		Their activity assumes innumerable phases and oc - cupies many spheres , more frequently proving them - selves beneficial than injurious .

		They are both eco - nomic and industrious in the best biological sense of the terms . ''

		The important part which bacteria play in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and in preventive medicine make an intelligent comprehen - sion of their activities imperative in all matters of public and private sanitation .

		Mr.
Newman	PERSON	's dis - cussions of bacteria and disease , of immunity , of antitoxins , and of methods of disinfection , are illum - inating , and are to be commended to all seeking information on these points .

		Any discussion of bacteria will seem technical to the uninitiated , but all such will find in this book popular treatment and scientific accuracy happily combined .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		wrought by the century is given in the contrast be - tween the distribution of the population of the
United States	LOCATION	in
1790	DATE	, and of
Australia	LOCATION	in
1891	DATE	, with a population numerically about the same .

		The contemporary
United States	LOCATION	show an increasing tendency to concentration .

		It is manifest that this tendency is largely due to modern methods of or - ganization , economic , social , and political : hence the third chapter gives the proper place to indus - trial activity as the chief cause of the concentration of the population .

		His study of vital statistics in cities presents the difficulties due to modern urban life , but gives a rather hopeful outlook for the future , due largely to transportation facilities , and the growth of suburban life .

		The book forms a very valuable scientific treatise .

		The Comptroller of
New York	LOCATION	has written an instructive little volume out of the wealth of his experience in the metropolis , '' Municipal Govern - ment . ''

		Unless one has followed his career , the natural inquiry is , '' Can anything good come out of
Nazareth	LOCATION	? ''

		To have pointed criticisms and valuable constructive suggestions from a Tammany official is a novelty , but then Mr.
Coler	PERSON	is himself a rara avis .

		It would be interesting , if space per - mitted , to apply the higher criticism to this volume .

		The author is so remarkably emancipated himself , and yet bears marks of bis association .

		He says : '' There are too many departments , too many bureaus , and too many officers .

		Authority should be centralized , responsibility fixed beyond possibility of evasion , details of administration simplified , and the machinery of gov - ernment reduced to the smallest scale consistent with perfect operation .

		No matter what division may be made of the duties and powers of municipal adminis - tration , local government really reaches the people through four channels police , sanitation , public edu - cation , and taxation . ''

		This simplification of government does not , how - ever , restrict municipal functions to the four chan - nels mentioned , as Mr. Color himself recognizes when he comes to speak of new problems .

		The chief value of the book is in its criticism of the
Greater New York Charter	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
Coler	PERSON	says has been proven by practical experience to possess the weaknesses pointed out by the political scien - tists . ''

		The bicameral Municipal Assembly , created by the charter , should be abolished ... The repeal of the chapter of the charter that created borough presidents will save to the tax-payers
$ 51,300	MONEY	a year , without in the slightest degree disturbing the general plan of gov - ernment ... Another experiment in the charter , the
Board of Public Improvements	ORGANIZATION	, should be either abol - ished or modified . ''

		There are four
Police Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	and one Fire Commissioner , one
Commissioner of Highways	ORGANIZATION	, and three
Commissioners of Docks	ORGANIZATION	and Ferries .

		Eleven or twelve commissioners at
$ 5,000	MONEY	a year could be dis - pensed with at once without detriment to the public service . ''

		Mr.
Coler	PERSON	shows himself handicapped by his polit - ical experience when he urges an increase of the 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, power of the mayor , and the enlargement of the powers of the
Board of Estimate	ORGANIZATION	, until '' It became a semi-legislative body .

		It should have power under the charter , by a unanimous vote of all its members , to build bridges , sell franchises , open new parks , construct public buildings , make and enforce through the proper department any regulation neces - sary for the public welfare . ''

		This he seems to propose without regard to the functions of the council .

		Evidently it is necessary to insure the responsibility , but the
Board of Esti	ORGANIZATION	- mate is certainly as superfluous as Mr.
Coler	PERSON	indi - cates are the commissioners .

		He makes a very valuable plea , in discussing practical matters , for the amending of the
State Constitution	ORGANIZATION	to provide that the city 's bonded indebtedness shall disregard investments which permit of pecuniary returns .

		Among the great possibilities of such increased lat - itude for municipal activity , would be the develop - ment of a great dock system , and the construction of tunnels , which , Mr.
Goler	PERSON	admirably argues , are cheaper and superior to bridges .

		His chapter on the relative cost and value of bridges and tun - nels could be studied with profit by the officials of every great municipality .

		In the final chapter on political machines , Mr.
Coler	PERSON	quite fearlessly attacks the '' boss . ''

		For this the remedy lies in getting the people to vote at primary elections . ''

		If nominations were made by the people direct there would be no bosses , and every corrupt machine would be wrecked at the first election .

		A primary law that would enable the people to nominate all candidates for office would , I believe , cause all good citizens to take some interest in politics . ''

		His bondage to his old associations is emphasized in this chapter , and makes an unhappy anti-climax to his many admirable proposals , his final word being , '' When all the people vote at party primaries , when nominations are made by the rank and file of Democrats and Republicans , we shall have better politics and better government . ''

		In spite of this limitation of the author 's vision , not many political officials in American cities could be so little blinded by the trees in their view of the forest .

		The last volume issued by the
National Munici	ORGANIZATION	- pal League is an elaboration of the Municipal Pro- gram which they have been discussing and complet - ing for over a year .

		It contains chapters of interest by well-known students of municipal government , and the entire volume is worthy of the attention of the citizen .

		The crucial points are the simplification of charters , the passage of amendments to the state constitutions when necessary , to secure greater home rule for cities , the regulation of municipal fran - chises and municipal indebtedness , the simplification and unification of public accounting , and finally , as touching the most vital problem of democracy in cities , the place of the council and of the mayor .

		The charter gives enlarged functions to the council in so far as it curtails the numberless elective offi - cers to be found in American cities to-day , but it also strengthens the hand of the mayor .

		The chief criticism which may be passed upon the '' Municipal Program '' may be found in Pro- fessor
Eaton	PERSON	's book , '' The Government of Munici - palities . ''

		This is the most thorough and constructive book we have had on municipal government .

		The analysis of municipal evils is excellent ; the criti - cisms are nearly always pertinent : the flaws of the book are incidental to the presentation of a thesis which in general will certainly be found to be sus - tained by future experience .

		It is first contended that there is no generally accepted standard of mu - nicipal government in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There was no provision made by our forefathers , because there was no general charter adopted similar to the Constitution of the States .

		No doubt one of the greatest weaknesses of American government is the multiplicity of charters , and the immense number of the subjects with which they deal ; and this con - fusion causes Professor
Eaton	PERSON	to express a satisfac - tion with the federal and state constitutions which seems not quite warranted .

		One reason for bad municipal government certainly lies in the fact that the American people suppose that government may assume a permanent form , a fallacy largely due to the existing written constitutions .

		The only func - tion of a constitution is to state the most general principles , which change slowly .

		A written con - stitution is only a historical document which , by good fortune , may have a permanent value .

		The system of checks incorporated into the American constitutions is largely responsible for the same system in municipal government , and must be changed with the simplifying of the latter .

		If sim - plicity is needed in the one , it is needed in the other ; the same principles apply to central and local gov - ernment ; and hence it seems superfluous for Pro- fessor
Eaton	ORGANIZATION	to contend , as he does in the note on page 375 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- City government deals mainly with business and administration ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and legislatures mainly with political principles and party issues ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the latter bodies are fit spheres for party action , while the cities are not ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the difference between the two spheres of action is so great as to require that city councils should be single chambers , while
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and legislatures should be bicameral bodies . ''

		Whether his analogies are correct or not , he escapes Mr.
Color	PERSON	's error and banishes national parties ab - solutely from municipal politics .

		Professor
Eaton	PERSON	says -LRB- pages 24 , 25 -RRB- among the causes of bad municipal government the following are given : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Individual selfishness ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- confusion of muni - cipal and other elections ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- centralized government and the absence of home rule ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- p. 40 -RRB- the limited powers of cities at present ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- pp. 52 , 53 -RRB- secrecy ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- chap , iii . -RRB-

		national party interference .

		This last is the fundamental evil according to Professor
Eaton	PERSON	, which he illustrates with great force in a thorough criticism of
Tam	LOCATION	- many , carried through three chapters , iv .

		to vi .

		The next two chapters include a defense of the Merit System , and a consequent criticism of spoils .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 Chapter ix .

		shows the great advantage to be derived from free voting and nomination , as illustrated es - pecially by British experience .

		He supports Mr.
Buckalew	PERSON	in the argument that free nomination and voting should be the precursors of proportional representation , and might be accepted by reformers of varying degrees of radicalism , and his sugges - tions are much more valuable than Mr.
Coler	PERSON	's re - garding the use of primaries .

		The most original portion of the book concerns the functions and rela - tions of existing councils and mayors .

		Professor
Eaton	PERSON	says of the council -LRB- p. 378 -RRB- : '' It is the continuous , stable council , representing the people and public opinion , and not the mayor repre - senting first one party and then another , which by its constant policy must uphold the just claims of the city against the state and the nation , which must cause the city to maintain an enlightened and consistent attitude toward its own interests and honor , as well as toward the great forces of charity , morality , education , and religion . ''

		The stability of the council is to be maintained by only one-third retiring at each election , and by the addition of appointed aldermen as in British cities .

		Of the mayor he says : '' The theory that a mayor may do as he pleases un - less his party arraigns him , and that he shall be respon - sible to no city authority , but only to the courts , for statutory crimes , or to the governor , is repugnant to all the analogies and conditions of public safety as it is to the fundamental conceptions of republican govern - ment .

		It could hardly find acceptance among an en - lightened people whose views of city government had not been distorted by habits of thought born of desperate municipal conditions and perverted party conceptions . ''

		The question whether mayors should be allowed a veto power substantially such as belongs to the presi - dent and governors is one of importance .

		In the nature of things , there seems to be no good reason why mayors , as well as presidents and governors , should not have this power .

		It can not fairly be said to be a power for obstruction .

		.

		It is really a power which tends to secure careful deliberation and large majorities . ''

		Nearly all that has been said in favor of giving the mayor the veto power is also applicable in favor of giv - ing him a part of the appointing power as well .

		It would certainly increase the dignity of his office and make it more inviting to men of large ambition and capacity .

		`` The experience most favorable to conferring the whole appointing power upon the council is mainly that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The councils in British , and largely in other European , cities make both appointments and removals .

		Apparently , there are no very decisive rea - sons , aside from public opinion , why the same method would not be equally successful in American cities , after good , non-partisan councils have been established . ''

		Those who desire to examine municipal government from the standpoint not of trifling present improve - ments , or even fundamental changes in municipal machinery which are concerned simply with in - creased efficiency , but who look upon the munici - pality as the great training school of democracy , because more intimately identified with the people 's interests and nearer to them , can profit by a minute examination of Professor
Eaton	PERSON	's admirable volume .

		These books all bear witness not only to the growth of interest in the municipalities which increase so rapidly in size , and whose problems become increasingly difficult , but also the growing intelli - gence of the municipal students who are sure to find the way for the reconstruction of municipal government , and who are gradually reaching toward the conception that the value of political organiza - tion in this country must be judged not only as a means of satisfying wants , but by its conformity to the standards of democracy .

		CHARLES ZUEBLIN .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Vance Thompson	PERSON	's '' French .

		book , but we are inclined to think that no one tinctured even to a slight degree with the love of letters will take it seriously .

		The au - thor himself clearly does not .

		His book is on the
Writers of Young France	ORGANIZATION	, and he presents to us the figures of wonderful leaders of literature , poetry , and such things very much as if they really were great thinkers or writers .

		But he does not himself think that they are ; indeed he candidly says as much now and then .

		He is right : with half a dozen exceptions the persons of whom he speaks are not persons of consideration ; they are , to use an old - fashioned expression , fumistes , a term which may be rudely translated '' grand-stand performers . ''

		Of this Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	is well aware .

		What he does not seem to be aware of is that the book is not representative of French letters to-day .

		It repre - sents a section of what might once have been so - called .

		To present
Verlaine	PERSON	and
Mallarme	ORGANIZATION	' ,
Catulle Mendes	PERSON	and
Jean Richepin	PERSON	, even
Maurice Barres	PERSON	and
Jean Moreas	PERSON	, as
Young France	LOCATION	, is a most extra - ordinary libel .

		Shall we call Manet representative of
Young France	LOCATION	?

		Or
Pissaro	PERSON	?

		Or Degas ?

		The fact is that
Verlaine	PERSON	is now dead and becoming fashionable ,
Mallarme	PERSON	' is dead and being forgotten ,
Catulle Mendes	PERSON	and
Jean Richepin	PERSON	are now over fifty , were discredited twenty years ago , and only continue to exist in the minds of those who have come to maturity since that time , while MM .

		Barres and
Moroas	PERSON	are and always were , as Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	indicates , solemn windbags .

		Why call attention to this matter ?

		Because it seems worth while to say that
France	LOCATION	nowadays has matters more worthy attention than those presented in this book .

		What are the ideals presented over and over again by Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	?

		In a number of cases we have what is practically affectation and need not count .

		But in the other cases we commonly find one of two types .

		One is called by Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	'' The Vagrom Man '' : the other is -LRB- to use Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's euphemism -RRB- '' the man with red corpuscles . ''

		These two types are not unknown in
America	LOCATION	: they are 286 -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, plentifully represented ; the first we call tramps , while for the second we have a variety of names none of which need be printed .

		These types we know well , hut in life we do not admire them : is there any reason why we should be attracted to them in literature ?

		There often is reason :
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, who had something of the tramp dispo - sition about him , was also dominated by very large and noble ideas ;
Byron	PERSON	, who is now again rising to influence , although much of a rake , was also pos - sessed by large and noble ideas .

		In these two men the ideas sweeten the otherwise unlovely trampish - ness or rakishness .

		Have Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's friends these preservative qualities ?

		Take them all in all with several exceptions , we should say either they have not or he is a bad interpreter .

		We advise no one to bother with any of them but
Yerlaine	PERSON	and the Belgians .

		In French literature to-day you may find one of the purest and gayest intellects of our century , one of the most classic and beautiful poets , a number of sincere and sympathetic observers of life , and the greatest dramatic romanticist since Victor Hugo .

		We think these are worth crossing the frontier to see ; the vagrants and degenerates we may study in any of our own large cities , with the advantage that our specimens lack the gift of speech .

		Now that the New Year has begun to road again .

		revive our old desires and not only old desires , but old habits and re - membrances and never-attained ideals that for six months have lain dormant , now that the snow has gone , we are once more fascinated by the great out - doors .

		In the month or so yet , before it will be quite nice to spend a day on a country road or a river , or to sit out of an evening and see the twi - light brighten up with stars , or make a fire on the beach and awake from the short
summer	DATE
night	TIME	to see the dawn over the waters , in the month be - twixt and between called
Spring	DATE	, one will do well to turn to Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's collection called '' The Open Road '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , '' a garland of good or enkind - ling poetry and prose '' for city-dwellers , as he says , who like to get into the country .

		It is a very charm - ing book from cover to cover , which means name , binding , end-papers , and letterpress , as well as the collection itself , which is a sort of textbook for the logic of the freedom of the soul .

		It runs many a good gamut , from a '' Farewell to Winter '' to '' The Reddening Leaf , '' from `` The Windy Hills '' to '' Garden and
Orchard	ORGANIZATION	, '' from '' Music beneath a Bough '' to A Handful of Philosophy . ''

		It has the voice of many a poet from
John Milton	PERSON	to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, from
Herrick	PERSON	to
Stevenson	PERSON	, from the well-assured classic to the most late-discovered singer of the
Bodley Head	ORGANIZATION	.

		We miss one or two voices which have often been with us in the open , notably those of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	on one hand and of
Thoreau	LOCATION	on another : some things are lacking but all that there is is good .

		One thing , however , must be noted .

		The little book is bound in form for the pocket , and Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	mentions its true function as to be read on the road itself , when one is out doors in the full
summer	DATE	.

		Probably Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, like many geniuses , does not see clearly the true intent of his labors .

		We are sure that his book is not rightly to be read when one is out-doors , but when one is within and is looking forward to going out ; not when one is actually walking the highway or sitting under the tree , but rather when one is not but wishes that one were ; in other words not in full
summer	DATE	but just now .

		Now it is to be read , when a roof is still comfortable , when a fire is still pleasant , when the grass is still brown and the trees still leafless , when the pleasures of
last summer	DATE	are still the only ma - terial we have for the pleasures of the
summer	DATE	to come .

Shelley	PERSON	's son - nets for the sole purpose of disclosing his use of half a line , it is impossible to suppose that the trans - lator could use Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's prose rendering of Bion or Moschus without giving credit ; yet the correspondences are many and minute throughout .

		This may be seen in the fragment to Hesperus .

		Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	sings -LRB- p. 19 -RRB- : '' O
Hesper	PERSON	, golden light of eve serene , Lamp of the lovely daughter of the foam , Thou sacred jewel of the deep blue dome , Dimmer as much than
Cynthia	PERSON	, silver queen , Who sinking slowly , yonder now is seen , As thou art brighter than all stars that roam The skies !

		oh , guide me to the shepherd 's home The while I lead the revel o'er the green .

		The moon wanes fast ; lend me thy beams divine , '' etc. .

		Italicizing the phrases used in common , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's translation reads thus : '' Hesperus , golden lamp of the lovely daughter of the foam , dear Hesperus , sacred jewel of the deep blue night , dimmer as much than the moon , as thou art among the stars pre-eminent , hail , friend , and as / lead the revel to the shepherd 's hut , in place of the moonlight , lend me thine , '' etc. .

		These coincidences are hardly less remarkable throughout Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's versions .

		cells in wh ; ch ifc ig 8tore d. '' This dictum by Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, late Keeper of Printed Books , British Museum , reminds us that much of his '' honey '' has hitherto been stored in '' treasure-cells '' beyond the easy reach of the bees that value it , and really need it for their daily con - sumption .

		In No. 5 of '' The Library Series , '' under his general editorship , he has gathered , from a
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 287 variety of sources , a collection of his '' Essays in Librarianship and Bibliography '' -LRB-
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Twenty-five of these fugitive essays are now brought within the covers of a single comely volume of 343 pages , including index .

		The Essays on Cataloguing and Classification are addressed to specialists , but such papers as The Early Italian Book Market , Book Hunting in the
17th Century	DATE	, English Paper-Making 18th Century , Preface to Blades ' '' Enemies of Books , '' and the notes on Sir
Anthony Panizzi	PERSON	and
Henry Stevens	PERSON	, are of more general interest .

		It must come as a surprise to many to learn that the paper used in fine books printed in
England	LOCATION	was manufactured on the continent , mainly in
Italy	LOCATION	, down to the middle of the eighteenth cen - tury , when its importation was interrupted by the war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The original edition of
Middleton	PERSON	's '' Life of
Cicero	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	tells us , was printed partly on paper of English make and partly on Italian .

		In the slight memorial sketch of
Henry Stevens	PERSON	, G.M.B. -LRB- Green Mountain Boy -RRB- , Dr.
Gar	PERSON	- nett makes a graceful acknowledgment of the British Museum 's debt to that remarkable Ameri - can for the general impetus he gave to the collec - tion of the literature on the
New World	LOCATION	.

		To librarians everywhere , to bibliographers and spe - cialists , Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's book is invaluable , while the bouklover who once makes its acquaintance would not willingly be without it .

		A faMy impartial No history which has yet appeared hittory o / our of the recent war between the

		States and
Spain	LOCATION	has shown one-tenth of the fairness and impartiality which inheres in '' A History of the Spanish - American War '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Mr.
Richard H. Titherington	PERSON	.

		This does not signify that his book is free from prejudice or mis - statement by any means , for it is not ; but only that he undertook his work with fewer prejudices than were the share of the other historians , and has con - trived better to maintain the judicial frame of mind to the abeyance of his sympathies throughout his long and searching narrative .

		There is a partial failure to give the Spanish side of the tragedy which overwhelmed the ''
Maine	LOCATION	, '' and the plain state - ment of fact should have been made that no Span - ish official has been connected with that calamity by any testimony ; it is not made evident that the instructions to
Commodore Schley	PERSON	concerning his remaining off
Santiago	LOCATION	were left for enforcement to his discretion , and that the conduct subsequently characterized as '' reprehensible '' in this regard had Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	's approval at the time , or that the difficulty in coaling off the harbor was due to a stormy sea ; but on the other hand there is no at - tempt to unduly glorify Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	's victory by attributing great superiority of force to the enemy ; there is no attempt to deprive
Schley	PERSON	of his just deserts in deeds actually done by him ; there is no desire to withhold the facts in respect of
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	's military alliance with the forces of the
United States	LOCATION	; and the plain contradiction between An album of Royalty .

		Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, who says that the twenty mil - lions paid
Spain	LOCATION	was for improvements in the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippines , and Messrs.
Gray	PERSON	and Day , who state that it was to purchase title , is set forth in detail .

		Mr.
Titherington	PERSON	is therefore to be complimented on his work .

		_ '' The Sovereign Ladies of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a showy volume or - nately bound and containing 153 photographic illustrations , may be described as a sort of album of European royalty of to-day , for the spouses and children of the sixteen '' sovereign ladies '' are included in the pictures .

		The pictorial ensemble , it must be admitted , is not very striking , few of the subjects being blessed with even a mod - erate share of good looks .

		The most attractive portraits , perhaps , are the earlier ones of
Queen Victoria	LOCATION	, notably the one after
Hayter	PERSON	, showing Her Majesty as a rather pretty child of eleven gazing amiably at a malevolent looking mackaw which to the fanciful eye might bear some slight resemblance to the intractable Ktuger .

		The Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	is a distinguished figure ; but the less said about
Isabella	PERSON	of
Spain	LOCATION	the better .

		The portrait of the Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- after a

Carmen Sylva	PERSON	'' is not , in point of personal appearance , all that the admirer of her poetry could desire .

		The prettiest group on the list is formed by the three eldest sons of the German Emperor fine wholesome little fellows , half English , half German , in tennis costume .

		The portraits are accompanied by a series of brief bio - graphical sketches , edited by the
Countess A. von Bothmer	PERSON	, which serve their purpose well and are sensibly written .

		doQ Souvenirs '' -LRB-
A. WeSSels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will sufficiently indicate the character of the book , but will not give the brightness , the vivacity , and the wealth of comment that make up the charm of the volume .

		Of the nineteen chapters a few are as follows : '' Witty Women and Pretty Women , '' '' Old
London	LOCATION	Coffee-Houses , '' '' Some Famous Old Actors , '' '' Queer Clubs of Former Days '' ; and not only these but the others are full of racy anecdote and story , told with such sharpness of detail that the dead days live again ; and the court beauties , the wits , the politicians and poets of the coffee - houses ,
Horace Walpole	PERSON	and Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	, Addi - son and
Johnson	PERSON	and Pope ,
Charles II	PERSON	.

		and
Nell Gwynne	PERSON	,
Garrick	PERSON	and Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	, give to the pages the color of the life they lived .

		The book gives evidence of thorough research and of the easy command of subject and material that research se - cures .

		The mustiness of old records is not here , but in its stead the grace of old manners , the joy - ousness of living in a time when life was full of the 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, glow of romance , courtly indolence jostling want , beauty and foppishness and polite elegance hobnob - bing with debauchery and intrigue .

		Everyone who enjoys English literature may have that enjoyment very much enhanced by a reading of the book , so full is it of the life out of which literature has grown ; and it will have value for all interested in English history , for its vivid picture of the life of one hundred years age .

		In mechanical execution the book leaves nothing to be desired .

		A scholarly Among Goethe 's shorter works none edition of a enjoys greater popularity than his German masterpiece mie epic
Hermann	PERSON	und Doro - thea '' : nowhere does he betray to a greater extent the simplicity born of consummate artistic mastery and more knowledge of the humbler phenomena of human life .

		The poem has consequently for many years been read by fairly advanced students of Ger - man in our colleges .

		Successfully to edit '' Her - mann und Dorothea '' is a very charming but not an altogether easy undertaking .

		Scholarship must com - bine with literary sensitiveness and pedagogic tact to make the commentator 's work valuable without being ponderous , accurate without being pedantic .

		In his new edition of the work , lately issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
James Taft Hatfield	PERSON	is at his best .

		The lucid Introduction and the careful notes show intimate acquaintance with the work of his predecessors in this field and with the contribu - tions of Goethe - philology to our knowledge and understanding of the idyll .

		His scholarship and a happy gift of expression enable the editor to inter - pret or elucidate all passages containing difficulties to the student , while his large acquaintance with literature in general often gives him an opportunity to point to striking parallels in other literatures , classical and modern .

		Special mention should be made of the care bestowed on the text proper .

		By supplementing Professor
Hewett	PERSON	's labors to restore the original text as Goethe wrote it , Professor Hat - field was in a position to offer something far more satisfactory and accurate than any editor before him .

		A readable book on Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		One of the most interesting of all personalities in English literature was , and is , Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	.

		Accordingly it is not strange that a society calling itself '' The Johnson Club '' should have been formed in
London	LOCATION	for the sole purpose of keeping green the memory of '' The Great Cham of Literature . ''

		Equally natural it is , considering the distinguished character of the club membership , that a selection from the papers read at their quarterly meetings during the sixteen years of the organization should now be gathered and published .

		The ''
Johnson	PERSON	Club Papers '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Importation -RRB- gives us fif - teen papers in all , and among the authors are names which ensure good things ,
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	,
George Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	,
A. W. Hutton	PERSON	,
George Whale	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		In these days when not everyone reads
Boswell	PERSON	's '' Life '' as certainly as our forefathers did , these bright papers will serve a good purpose on such subjects as '' Some
Johnson Characteris	PERSON	- tics , ''
Johnson	PERSON	's relations to Music , Politics , Law , Travel , etc. .


Boswell	PERSON	, too , has his ^ apotheosis at the hands of Dr.
George Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	.

		It is inter - esting to know that this indefatigible student found a finer collection of
Johnsonian	DATE	and Boswellian curiosities in the American city of
Buffalo	LOCATION	than exists anywhere on the other side of the ocean that owned by Mr.
R. B. Adam	PERSON	.

		Twenty illustra - tions have been well chosen to give the principal scenes and persons most closely associated with
Johnson	PERSON	's life , the whole making a book as hand - some as it is readable .

		A pleasant After fairly exhausting the annals of addition to Mrs. the countries of
Europe	LOCATION	during the
Latimer	PERSON	's histories .

		century now 8 li pp i ng to i ts c l O8e , Mrs.
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	has digressed , so to speak , for a moment before adding the crown to her work by a seventh volume bringing the story down to the very close of the cycle .

		The result of this digression is embodied in ''
Judea	LOCATION	from
Cyrus	LOCATION	to Titus : 537 B. C 70 A. D. '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		With charming frankness the historian tells how she was led to undertake the work , her attention having been attracted to it while translating the fourth and fifth volumes of
Kenan	PERSON	's '' History of the Jewish People . '' ''

		Before I had completed my transla - tion , '' Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	goes on to say , '' I had become deeply interested in the period of history of which it treats , and also was much surprised to find how very little I had previously known about it .

		... It therefore appeared to me probable that that part of the public , which I love to designate as ' my own readers , ' if no better informed than myself , might derive pleasure , as I had done , by being more fully acquainted with a period that had interested me greatly . ''

		Such a book , so prepared , and for such an audience , leaves nothing to be desired .

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has written in her pleasant and discursive manner , following Renan closely but not servilely , and omitting questions of criticism and doctrine which might have a tendency to take her into deep water .

		Her chance rediscovery of the deutero - canonical or apochryphal books of the
Bible	LOCATION	is cause for congratulation .

Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	, and bears witness to its admirable personnel all the more valuable because given grudgingly ; and , in general , had a valuable experience which abundantly justi - fies his rather large book .

		Yet Mr.
Millet	PERSON	succeeded in bringing back most of the prejudices against men of another speech and color with which he started , making constant correction for the personal equa - tion needful .

		The '' Reminiscences '' of
Morris Steinert	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , compiled and ar - ranged by Mrs.
Jane Marlin	PERSON	, tell the story of a German with a great fondness for music who came to this country in youth , amassed a com - fortable fortune after many vicissitudes , and found himself able to afford a delightful hobby : the col - lection of such musical instruments as can be re - garded as forerunners of the piano e forte .

		Mr.
Steinert	PERSON	is not unknown through the East for his lectures on these earlier instruments , which were repeated at the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	; and his frequent journeys to
Europe	LOCATION	for the purpose of enriching his collection led to his delivery there of many lectures which added sub - stantially to his reputation .

		In late years , convinced by his bringing a number of old spinets , hammer - claviers , harpsichords , and clavichords into a condi - tion of musical efficiency that the modern piano largely lacks in the way of sweet and sympathetic tone , Mr.
Steinert	PERSON	has himself invented what he calls a '' Steinertone , '' which carries his ideas into prac - tice .

		The story is told in the first person , and is of more than ordinary interest .

		constitutional Mr - G - L Lapsey 's The County history
Palatine	LOCATION	of
Durham	LOCATION	'' forms Volume i * miniature .

		y m o f the Harvard Historical Studies '' -LRB- Longmans . -RRB-

		Mr.
Lapsey	PERSON	says : '' During the middle ages , and in a restricted sense up to the present century , the county of
Durham	LOCATION	was with - drawn from the ordinary administration of the kingdom of
England	LOCATION	and governed by Bishop with almost complete local independence .

		But the com - munity of
Durham	LOCATION	had the same local and economic requirements and dangers as the rest of the king - dom ; accordingly there developed in the county a group of institutions reproducing all the essential characters of the central government . ''

		These facts , in connection with the further one that
Durham	LOCATION	had a much longer independent history than either
Chester	PERSON	or
Lancaster	LOCATION	, the other English County Pala - tines , give the subject a singular interest , furnishing an opportunity to study a section of English con - stitutional development under the microscope . ''

		To exhibit the growth of these institutions , their organi - zation , and their relations to the central govern - ment , '' is the object of Mr.
Lapsey	PERSON	's study , which becomes , as he says , '' the constitutional history of an English county . ''

		The study , published from the income of the Torrey Fund , bears evidence of scholarly labor in preparation on every page .

		More - over , it has an enhanced interest to students of American history from the fact that the
County Palatine	LOCATION	of
Durham	LOCATION	was selected by
King Charles I.	PERSON	as the type of government that Lord
Baltimore	LOCATION	was authorized to establish in his colony of
Maryland	LOCATION	.

Thomas Paine	PERSON	, by Mr.
Ellery Sedgwick	PERSON	.

		With an eager sym - pathy for justice and liberty , such as
Paine	LOCATION	himself stood for during a long life , the biographer catches the spirit of the time and holds it up for us to see the spirit of the man in revolt within it .

		The constant desire of the work is to exclude prejudice , and to this end the too partial periods of Dr.
Conway	PERSON	are submitted to the same judicious pruning as the scur - rility and slander of Oldys and
Cheetham	PERSON	.

		The summing up , after pages full of vivid writing which leaves little to be desired in point of clarity and picturesqueness , is masterly , showing this revolu - tionary hero and true patriot as one of the master reformers of the ages .

		To the American eye Miss
Gary	PERSON	's '' hand '' shows a somewhat over-liberal allowance of court cards ; but her heroines , from Queen to light-house keeper 's daughter , are all '' good women '' certainly , and notable enough to deserve portrayal .

		The stories are simply and sympathetically told , and with a pervading strain of pious sentiment that is evidently genuine and unforced .

		Some interesting biographic details are given , and the author 's occasional lapses of style are largely atoned for by her earnestness and abounding sincerity .

		The book is prettily made , and the portraits are acceptable .

		In spite of the fact therein recorded , that much valuable historical mate - rial has been heedlessly scattered and lost , the Rev.

James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The plan of the book includes a brief account of the civil story of that common - wealth , and the beginnings of the

Parker	PERSON	's religious views as a matter of course , and for all the rest of the world because it discloses a powerful individuality and considerable talent brought in contact with many of the best known English statesmen .

		Yet the book could not be so readable if it were not informed with a sense of humor throughout , which explains , one imagines , one of the secrets of this most popular preacher 's success .

		There is a chapter on '' Mad Folks Mainly , '' which is delightful in respect of its anecdotes .

		The '' Group of Recollections '' near the close of the book is also filled with good things to remember .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
Henry Sweet	PERSON	has done many services to the sci - ence of linguistics , and the last of them is by no means the least .

		It takes the form of a treatise on '' The Practical Study of Languages '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , being a guide for both the teacher and the taught , although the lat - ter , unless he be an exceptionally mature and scholarly person , will not find the work as useful as the former .

		What Dr. Sweet gives us is a philosophical study of method in the matter of teaching foreign languages , ancient and modern ,
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	and Oriental .

		He stands firmly for phonetics as the indispensable foun - dation of linguistic study , but otherwise is rather con - servative than radical in his recommendations .

		His book is of great value to teachers , and to many other persons .

Charles A. Lidgey	PERSON	, is the first of the series , and turns out to be a readable story , with several illustrations , and the more important bibliographical and chronological data in convenient tabulation .

		As criticism , it offers no matter of any consequence , but as a popular account of
Wagner	PERSON	's life and works , is not without merit . ''

		Some Account of the Capture of the Ship '

Philip Freneau	PERSON	, the poet of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, who was a passenger on the ship at the time it fell in with the British frigate Iris , The account is picturesque , though it shows no sign of the poetical taleut that undoubtedly was the author 's , and its value is greatly enhanced by the nu - merous illustrations , and by the admirable introductory memoir prepared by Mr.
Jay Milles	PERSON	.

		The book is handsomely printed .

		From the complexity of the Chinese alphabet , instruc - tion in reading and writing covers a period of from six to twelve years .

		The Rev.
W. H. Murray	PERSON	, principal of a school for the blind at Peking , has put into actual service the Braille system for teaching the blind to read , based on the 408 sounds of the Mandarin Chinese , the language spoken by four-fifths of the 300,000,000 in - habitants of the Chinese Empire .

		He found that with this system the blind could be taught to read in about six weeks .

		It then followed that illiterate sighted per - sons also could be instructed with equal facility , and it has become a matter of popular education .

		The details regarding the development of this application of work for the blind to the education of the sighted are told in a very interesting manner in a book by Miss
C. F. Gorden-Cumming	PERSON	, recently published in
London	LOCATION	, enti - tled '' The Inventor of the Numeral Type for
China	LOCATION	. ''

		Miss
Isa Bowman	PERSON	, the popular
London	LOCATION	actress , has written , for the special use of young readers , a loving and appreciative little sketch of the author of '' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, '' entitled '' The Story of
Lewis	PERSON	Car - roll '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		As a child
Miss Bowman	PERSON	acted the part of '' Alice '' when a dramatization of the story was performed at the Globe Theatre ; and she was one of Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's prime favorites one of the '' little girl friends '' whose companionship he loved , and for whose amusement he invented the whimsical tales that little folks all over the world now read .

		The booklet is pret - tily gotten up and contains some interesting portraits and facsimiles .

		``
Wagner	PERSON	's Nibelungen Ring Done into English Verse '' by Mr.
Reginald Raukin	PERSON	-LRB- Longmans -RRB- is not , as the title would seem to indicate , a translation of Wag - ner 's text , but rather a narrative poem in which the author has used the dialogue as far as was convenient , , but for which he has supplied connective description of his own .

		It is in blank verse , and reads prettily enough , although it takes more enthusiasm than is at our command to think of
Wagner	PERSON	's poem '' as an epic surpassed only by the ' Odyssey . ' ''

		The volume now published contains only half of the work as planned , for it ends with the parting of Wotan from Briinhilde at the close of '' Die Walkiire . ''

		Young readers especially will derive profit and pleas - ure from
Violet Brooke-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's clearly written and carefully compiled historical sketches entitled '' Pris - oners of the Tower of
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , being a series of accounts of the more notable captives who , from the earliest days down to the period of the Cato street attempt , have been confined within the walls of the old state prison .

		The opening chapter tells briefly the story of the Tower itself and its builders .

		The author writes simply and directly , and has evi - dently taken due pains to prepare herself for the task .

		The volume is plentifully supplied with views and portraits .

Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's exquisite '' Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has recently been published in a new edition with illustrations in photogravure , the work of Mr.

		Messrs.
Hinds & Noble	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a vol - ume entitled '' How to Prepare for a
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	Ex - amination . ''

		It is a volume of nearly six hundred pages , made up in large measure of sets of examina - tion questions and their answers , classified under the several departments of the service .

Harper	PERSON	's Guide to
Paris	LOCATION	and the Exposition of
1900	DATE	'' is the first book to reach us of what will prob - ably be a numerous collection before the season is over .

		It is a compact volume for the pocket , but it would have been still more compact without the entirely un - necessary feature of full-page illustrations .

		Imagine a Baedeker padded in that way ! ''

		The Foundations of English Literature , '' by Pro- fessor
Fred Lewis Pattee	PERSON	, is a text-book published by
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It brings the history down as far as
Milton	LOCATION	, and is written from a distinctly evolutionary standpoint .

L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish at once twelve new volumes in their '' Court Memoir Series , '' thus completing the set of twenty volumes , of which eight volumes were published last season .

		Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are the pub - lishers .

		A sixth volume in the '' Life and Correspondence of
Rufus King	PERSON	, '' bringing together the papers dating from the
last decade	DATE	of his life -LRB- 1816-1827 -RRB- , completes the task of Dr.

		This volume comprises upwards of seven hundred pages , and con - tains an index to the entire set .

		Messrs.
G. P. Put	PERSON	- nam 's Sons are the publishers . ''

		Hand-Camera Work '' and '' Photography Out - doors , '' two of the earlier issues in '' The Photo-Minia - ture '' magazine , published by
Messrs. Tennant & Ward	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, have been so successful as to call for re - printing in second editions .

		They are instructive little monographs , compact and well illustrated , which no amateur photographer should overlook .

		Superintendent
Horace S. Tarbell	PERSON	has had much ex - perience in the making of school geographies , and his latest book of this sort gets the benefit of them all .

		It is called '' The Complete Geography , '' and bears the imprint of the
Werner School Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is modern in method and comprehensive in scope , very attractive in its illustrations , although less so in its maps the latter having the tasteless character common to most American geographies .

		Dr.
Martha Tarbell	PERSON	has collabo - rated in the production of this book .

		Nothing could be less imitative of the ' Jungle Books '' than this story by the author of '' Wild Animals I Have Known , '' yet in a different way Mr.

		In Wahb , the Grizzly , he has added a new character to fiction , his method of characterization and description being at once realistic and romantic .

		315 A TRUL Y GREA T BOOK A MONO the manuscripts which came to us last fall was one entitled '' ^ `` Flame , Electricity , and the Camera '' -LRB- Man 's Progress from the First Kindling of Fire to the
Wireless Telegraph	ORGANIZATION	and the Photography of Color -RRB- , by
George	PERSON	lies .

		On the top of the package of sheets was a copy of a letter addressed to the author by Prof.
John Fiske	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, who had read the manuscript carefully and wrote as follows : '' I have read your book with an intense interest growing into red-hot enthusiasm .

		It is one of the most fascinating books that I have seen in the last ten years .

		Your points are so well taken , so happily and richly illustrated with examples , and their bearing on the main argument is so skilfully kept in view , that the result is to my mind a truly great book , and I venture to predict for it a great future . ''

		The manuscript was turned over to an authority whose judgment goes far with us .

		Here is his report : '' You may count yourself fortunate in having had submitted to you a book of this calibre .

		You can be sure , also , that no other publisher has ever had an opportunity to publish it as in this case you never would have seen the manuscript .

		Publish it as quickly as you can , and in the best style you can ; it is worthy of the finest work you can put into it , and it will sell for years and years and do you much credit .

		The book not only shows great research and puts forth vital twentieth century facts in a novel and impressive way , but the author 's style is extraordinarily good .

		One word more : Follow the author 's suggestions as to full illustrations he knows what he is talking about . ''

		The MS. of `` Flame , Electricity , and the Camera '' was put in hand at once ; the illustrations , which include plates showing the three-color process , half-tones , unusual photographic processes , etc. , and many other illustrations , have taken long to prepare .

		The whole work is finished and is just out .

		Mr. lies tells simply and so untechnically as to be easily understood by any reader what fire , electricity , and the camera have accomplished in the work of civilization ; he tells clearly and effectively of the latest wonders in science .

		The work stands as a most impressive end-of-the-century summing - up of the transition from the cave man , eating his food raw , to the man of the twentieth century , in whose eyes wireless telegraphy and color photography are mere commonplaces ; it is , moreover , a profoundly sug - gestive contribution to the doctrine of evolution .

		It is a book that should be in every public library in the land , and on the shelves of all who are interested in popular science , and we shall do our best to put it there .

		Price ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	net .

		We are anxious to send this book , postpaid , `` on approval '' to anyone interested .

		A DIRECTORY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLISH - ING TRADE MAY 1 ,
1900	DATE	362 THE DIAL , 1880-1900 .

		With the publication of the present number , THE DIAL celebrates its twentieth anniversary .

		We trust that the interest in this fact which is felt by editors and publishers will be shared by our readers also , and that the present anniver - sary issue , departing as to its contents from our usual custom , will prove an acceptable sub - stitute for what we offer our readers upon other occasions .

		We have thought it permis - sible , for once , to pretermit the publication of any critical notices of new books , and to pre - pare instead a series of articles dealing with the developments in literature and those other aspects of culture which constitute our prov - ince , that have taken place during the twenty years of our existence .

		With the exception of the first article , which sketches the more salient features of transatlantic literary de - velopment during the period in question , the contents of this issue deal with American subjects , with the various activities concerned in the production and distribution of books in this country , and with our recent educa - tional progress .

		We trust also that the kind words which we have received upon this oc - casion from so many quarters , and which it gives us so much satisfaction to print , will not be without interest to the wide circle of our friends .

		THE DIAL is not in the habit of speaking about itself , but we may perhaps be indulged upon the present occasion to the extent of a few words as to the external history of our twenty years of publication .

		THE DIAL was founded
May 1 , 1880	DATE	, by Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, in connection with the publishing house of
Jansen , McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, bearing the imprint of that firm .

		Under these auspices , it made a monthly appearance for a little more than twelve years .

		In the
summer of 1892	DATE	, Mr.
Browne	PERSON	purchased the periodical from its previous owners , and THE DIAL COMPANY was organized as a corporation under the
Illinois	LOCATION	statute .

		Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	and Mr.
Edward Gilpin Johnson	PERSON	, both of whom had been frequent contributors to THE DIAL for many years , became formally associated with 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Mr.
Browne	PERSON	in the editorship , while Mr.
F. G. Browne	PERSON	, who had been in charge of the busi - ness interests of the paper since
1888	DATE	, was appointed as the business manager .

		It was decided to make THE DIAL a semi-monthly publication , with a slight advance in the rate of subscription .

		The first number of the new semi-monthly issue was dated
September 1 , 1892	DATE	, and from that date until the present , THE DIAL has appeared regularly upon the first and the sixteenth day of each month .

		As twelve numbers constitute a volume , the thir - teenth volume was made up of the four num - bers from
May to August , 1892	DATE	, inclusive , and the eight numbers from
September 1	DATE	to Decem - ber 16 , inclusive , of that year .

		Since then the volumes have been semi-annual , completed in
June	DATE	and
December	DATE	of each year .

		In conse - quence of these facts ,
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	is now in its twenty-eighth volume , and the present issue of the paper is numbered three hundred and thirty-three .

		The changes made in
1892	DATE	included , besides the increased frequency of publication , a con - siderable enlargement in the scope of THE DIAL , and an increased diversification of its contents .

		Previously , it had confined itself somewhat rigidly to the reviewing of new works ; it now added such features as the regular lead - ing editorial , the occasional essay upon some literary or educational subject , the department of `` Communications '' which has proved so interesting , and the amplified miscellany .

		These new features added noticeably to its in - fluence , and evidence of the satisfaction which they occasioned was found in many expressions of personal opinion , as well as in the rapidly increasing list of subscriptions .

		THE DIAL has had four homes during the twenty years of its existence ; its editorial and business offices and its composing-rooms are now conveniently and commodiously provided for in the Fine Arts Building , which shelters under a single roof so large a proportion of the literary , educational , and cultural interests of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		These are the chief circumstances that concern our exter - nal history ; we wish particularly to call atten - tion to the fact that the editorial conduct and the business management of THE DIAL have remained practically in the same hands during the whole term of our existence , thus making possible a continuity of policy and unity of purpose not often preserved in the history of such a publication , and explaining , in no small part , perhaps , tho paper 's success .

		The principle ?

		that THE DIAL stands for are so well known to its readers that we need not reaffirm them here , except in the briefest terms .

		It stands first of all for the signed re - view , or in other words , for the responsible and authoritative criticism of current litera - ture .

		It stands for the bookseller as a civiliz - ing influence , and for the public library as an important auxiliary to the work of public edu - cation .

		It stands for the advancement of edu - cation subject to the restraints of a wise con - servatism , for the humanistic rather than the materialistic training .

		It stands in an attitude of perpetual protest toward the vulgarizing tendencies of a large part of modern journal - ism .

		It stands for music and the drama as indispensable elements of a liberal culture .

		It stands for the endowed theatre and the en - dowed newspaper , not as Utopian ideals , but as practical possibilities .

		It stands for an exten - sion of the term of copyright , and for the re - moval of those vexatious restrictions whereby this nation with one hand grants copyright to foreigners , and with the other withdraws the proffered gift .

		It stands in unalterable opposition to our barbarous tariff upon books , works of art , and the instruments of scientific research .

		Although not concerned with the narrower issues of politics , THE DIAL is un - willing to remain silent when questions arise which touch the very principles upon which our civilization is based , and in such cases its voice will continue to be raised , as it has been raised more than once during the .

		past few years , in behalf of those national ideals and international amenities which we can not ne - glect without forfeiting the most precious part of our American birthright .

		Entering now upon our second score of years , we hope to keep THE DIAL all it has been in the past , and to add to its usefulness in the future .

		If public appreciation of our efforts to maintain a high standard of literary criti - cism , and to advocate the cause of the higher culture in this country , shall continue to in - crease as it has been increasing since the scope of this journal was broadened
eight years ago	DATE	, we shall be deeply gratified .

		We already owe much to our friends , but will be glad to ac - knowledge a still greater debt .

		And we promise the public whose favor has made our existence possible , and has added to our fol - lowing from year to year , that we will continue to represent , to the best of our endeavor , and as far as our resources shall make it possible , all those intellectual interests with which we have so long been identified .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 Ctomijj fears ' TRANS A TL ANTIC LITERATURE .

		Although the chief purpose of this anniver - sary issue of THE DIAL is to consider the changes that have been wrought during the past twenty years in American literature , and in the conditions which affect those other de - partments of cultural activity with which the paper 's work is allied , yet we must not miss the opportunity now presented of making some sort of brief survey of the recent course of lit - erary history in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		When we get far enough away from any literary period to view it in the proper perspective , twenty years does not seem a very long time .

		That term of years taken almost anywhere in a past century might , ex - cept for the purposes of intensive study , be summarized in a few words .

		But when the twenty years in question are those that lie just back of the immediate present , the case is dif - ferent , and the task far more difficult .

		We have so many recollections and personal asso - ciations with the books and writers of the period in which we have lived that it is not easy to single out the things that call for special mention .

		We can not see the woods for the trees .

		We are tempted to magnify unimportant happenings , and to attach undue importance to names that may be clean forgot - ten a generation hence .

		But , making the full - est allowance for such illusions as arise from our intimate connection with the years in ques - tion , we can not help thinking that the his - torian of the far distant future will see in the closing decades of the nineteenth century a period more noticeable than others of equal length for the rapidity of its literary develop - ment and the pronounced character of the changes which it has witnessed .

		One of its most marked characteristics will be seen to have been the great losses which it has sus - tained in the death of its most forceful writers , without any corresponding compensation in the appearance of others capable of filling the va - cant places .

		How true this is of American literature will be seen from the special article upon that subject which is to follow .

		That it is equally true of English literature , using the term in its narrow sense , will appear evident upon a moment 's reflection .

		In the case of both branches of literature in the English language , the losses of the last twenty years have been so many and so great , the new writers of real force so few and far between , that we may well ask the question : Whom have we left to present to the century upon the threshold of which we are now standing ?

		Cleverness and technical mastery are indeed offered us in many forms by our newer writers ; the cleverness is almost preternatural at times , and the technique would put many of the older masters to blush .

		But the soul of literature does not live by these qualities alone , and , whatever momentary admiration they may arouse , they are not ultimately satisfactory .

		Nothing but genius gives lasting satisfaction , and to that we freely pardon those minor de - fects upon which pedagogues are wont to frown .

		Genius , however , is coming every year to be a rarer commodity in English literature , and the deficiency appears startling when we contrast the conditions of to-day with those of the sixties and the seventies .

		With the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literatures the outlook is not quite so dark .

		The latter part of the century has been marked by a strong resurg - ence of national feeling among nearly all of the distinctive peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Magyars and Czechs are no longer content to be merged in the political conglomerate of
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Finns and Poles resent with increasing vehemence their subjection to Russian influences .

		Even the Norwegians chafe under the enforced union with their Swedish kinsmen , and assert their own separate nationality in every possible way .

		Thirty years of imperial
Germany	LOCATION	have really accomplished much for that unity of feeling which was only a dream of the future when the
King of Prussia	ORGANIZATION	assumed the title of Ger - man Emperor in the palace at
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		Even
France	LOCATION	, throughout all modern history more unanimous and self-centred than the other nations of the Continent , has achieved a greater solidarity than ever before under the regime of the Republic .

		The Mediterranean countries , also , have shared in this renewal of national feeling , of which evidence may be adduced from the recent history of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	alike .

		This fortification of race sentiment , which has played havoc with so many political ambitions , has proved highly stimulating to literary activity .

		Let us enumerate a few of the developments of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature during the past twen - ty years , indicating at the same time some of the losses that have been sustained .

		Taking first the outlying countries , as distinguished from
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, which represent 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the core of present-day
Continental	ORGANIZATION	culture ^ the following are among the more conspicuous facts to claim our attention .

		There has arisen in
Spain	LOCATION	a distinctively modern school of fic - tion , which has justly challenged the admira - tion of the reading world .

		It is true that
Alarcon	PERSON	and
Senor Galdos	PERSON	occupied the field for some years before the period with which we are dealing , but even
Senor Galdos	PERSON	, in his later manner , is a very different person from the author of his earlier series of books con - cerned with the romance of Spanish history , and , taken in connection with
Senores Valera	ORGANIZATION	and
Valdes	PERSON	, with
Senora Bazan	PERSON	, and with the dramatist ,
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	, he marks a tran - sition in the spirit of Spanish literature which affords the plainest evidence that contempo - rary Spanish thought is no longer bound to the traditions of the past , but takes an active interest in all the problems of the modern world .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, the modern movement , al - though it offers the unhealthful phase illus - trated by the work of
Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	, of - fers also the sane developments represented by
Signor de Amicis	ORGANIZATION	,
Signor Fogazzaro	PERSON	, and
Signor Verga	PERSON	.


Signor Carducci	PERSON	remains what he has been for the last thirty or forty years , the one great Italian poet of our time , great , that is , in a sense that provokes comparison with the best that any literature has to give us .

		In
Hungary	LOCATION	, Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	, full of years and honors , is the one writer who is generally known to readers everywhere ; none of the younger men have thus far attracted much at - tention outside of their own country .


Belgium	LOCATION	is so closely affiliated with
France	LOCATION	that its writers do not appeal to us especially as Bel - gians , but to this statement there is the one noteworthy exception of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, whose work has had much vogue of recent years , and is particularly interesting on account of the way in which it illustrates some of the more exaggerated tendencies of what is called sym - bolism .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	writes in the French language ; the only living writer of Flemish generally known to English readers is the Dutch novelist ,
Heer Couperus	PERSON	, whose prob - lem fictions have had a deserved success out - side of
Holland	LOCATION	.

		That charming Dutch nov - elist who chooses to write under the name of ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' has made himself prac - tically an English novelist by writing his books in our own language .

		It is within very recent years , that is , within the
last decade	DATE	, that the astonishing novels of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	have come to be known throughout the world , and have restored
Poland	LOCATION	to the literary map of
Europe	LOCATION	, although the political map has no place for it .

		It would hardly be an exaggera - tion to describe this writer as the most re - markable genius who has appeared in
Conti	LOCATION	- nental literature during the period which we are now reviewing .

		In his work the conscious - ness of a noble race becomes intimately re - vealed to us more intimately , in fact , than in the poems of
Mickiewicz	LOCATION	, or even in the music of Chopin and the great part played by
Poland	LOCATION	in the history of
Europe	LOCATION	is made known to us .

		When we turn to
Kussia	LOCATION	, our first thought is of the fact that
Tourguenieff	PERSON	was living and writing twenty years ago , and of the irreparable loss to literature when he died in
1883	DATE	.

		Since then the one great name in Russian literature has been that of Count Tolstoy , but even of him , writing from a liter - ary rather than from a sociological point of view , one is compelled to say , stat magni nominis umbra , for ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	'' was published in
1877	DATE	, and since then the author 's footsteps have been straying erratically about in the morass of didacticism .

		In the
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian countries , the most important happen - ing of the last twenty years has been the im - mense widening of the bounds of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's reputation .

		Although for thirty years he had been producing play after play , including those great works upon which his fame will chiefly rest when the final account is taken , his name was practically unknown in
1880	DATE	, except in
Germany	LOCATION	, outside of the
Scandina	LOCATION	- vian kingdoms .

		It was in
1879	DATE	that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, in his '' Studies in the Literature of
Northern Europe	LOCATION	, '' first called the attention of English readers to the writer who has since become so widely read .

		Until well along in the eighties we never heard the name of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	mentioned in this country , either in con - versation or in print .


Herr Bjornson	PERSON	had for many years been known to our public as the author of certain idyllic tales of Norwegian peasant life , although even he was entirely unknown as dramatist or as lyric poet .

		The great widening of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's reputation coin - cided rather closely with the great change in method and subject-matter which came over his work about twenty years ago .

		In
1880	DATE	'' The Pillars of Society '' was three years old , and '' A Doll Home '' had been published only the year before .

		It is upon these two plays , and their ten successors , all dealing with the problems of modern society , that the author 's reputation is even now chiefly based , a caprice
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 of popular judgment which completely ignores his real masterpieces .

		The same caprice of popular judgment , which we do not believe that time will justify , makes of him at present a more conspicuous figure than his great Nor - wegian contemporary .

		But , however these critical values may be readjusted by the com - ing generation , there is no doubt that for the present generation Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	represents one of the strongest influences now operating in lit - erature .

		In Danish literature , the most im - portant name of the last twenty years has been that of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, which fact is par - ticularly interesting as a revindication of the claims of criticism to consideration as one of the branches of literature proper .

		It is a somewhat noteworthy fact that in one country , at least , a literary critic should remain for a long term of years its foremost man of letters .

		German literature in
1880	DATE	had no poets worth speaking of , unless we mention a few such writers as
Geibel	LOCATION	,
Bodenstedt	PERSON	,
Fontane	PERSON	, and the author of '' Der Trompeter von Sakkin - gen. '' It had , however , an important group of novelists in
Auerbach	LOCATION	and
Freytag	PERSON	,
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	and
Herr Heyse	PERSON	.

		To-day , as in
1880	DATE	, we still think of
Heine	LOCATION	as the last of the great German poets , although a few , perhaps , may claim for the author of '' Die Versunkene Glocke '' the poetic laurel .

		Although
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	and
Herr Heyse	PERSON	are still living and writing , their pristine fires are now little more than embers , and there can be no doubt that
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	now occupies the most con - spicuous place in German letters .

		For some years the race was close between him and
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	, but at present he seems to have outdistanced his only serious competitor .

		The prominence of these two writers , who are dis - tinctly the most serious representatives of the
Young Germany	LOCATION	of letters , is important not only because of the intrinsic value of their writing , which is considerable , but also because they have given a new impulse to that form of the drama which is both biihnenmdssig and lit - erary .

		This modern rehabilitation of the acting drama as a form of literary art has been going on in several countries , but in no other , not even in
France	LOCATION	, as noticably as in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The respect with which the playhouse and its associations are treated in that country repre - sents one of the most important things that
Germany	LOCATION	is now doing for literature .

		But in spite of all that we may say in behalf of recent German literature , the fact must be recognized that the Empire has not , in the thirty years of its existence , accomplished as much as might reasonably have been expected .

		The output has been enormous , but mediocrity has charac - terized the greater part of it .

		It is only now and then that a poem or a book , a play or a critical monograph , has risen above that dead level ; very little of the German literature pro- duced during the past twenty years has won for itself that wide cosmopolitan hearing for which no really important work , in our age of alert publishing and quickly diffused intelligence , has long to wait .

		Before closing this para - graph , we should say a word about the influ - ence exerted by the writings of
Herr Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		That influence has been unwholesome and de - moralizing , but it must be reckoned with in any attempt to trace the main currents of con - temporary thought .

		The French literature of the past twenty years resembles our own in the balance of its gains and losses , the former having been by no means commensurate with the latter .

		The greatest French writer of the century has died within the period under consideration , and , such was his vitality , and such the astonishing fertility of his genius , that even his octogena - rian years did not preclude him , up to the very last , from continuing to enrich the treasure house of French song .

		The death of
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	, although far less significant than that of Hugo , was still a heavy loss to French poetry , and there are many persons to whom the wayward and poignant note struck from the lyre of
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	came with a fresh charm that makes them sincere mourners of his death .

		Next to
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, the greatest loss of French literature during the period under con - sideration was felt when
Kenan	PERSON	passed away in
1892	DATE	, within a few days of the death of the greatest of our English poets .

		The death of Taine , soon thereafter , was also an event of more than common significance .

		Taine and
Kenan	PERSON	, however , had lived their lives and done their work .

		But it was the promise , even more than the achievement , of
James Darmesteter	PERSON	that lent a peculiar touch of sadness to his pre - mature taking-off .

		French literature has also lost the younger
Dumas	PERSON	,
Augier	PERSON	,
Labiche	PERSON	, Feuillet ,
Daudet	PERSON	,
Maupassant	LOCATION	, and
Cherbuliez	ORGANIZATION	.

		Flaubert died in
1880	DATE	, at the very beginning of the period now under discussion .

		It is obvious that no such men are now left to French litera - ture as those that have been taken away .

		To - set off against the name of Hugo we have the names of MM .

		Sully-Prudhomme and
Coppee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Against the names of the older dramatists we 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, have those of MM .

		Sardou and
Rostand	PERSON	.

		To take the place of the lost novelists we have
M. Zola	PERSON	, whose present notoriety will not avail to save his literary reputation , M. `` Loti , ''
M. Bourget	PERSON	,
M. Rod	PERSON	, and a host of other excellent second-rate men .

		We have also , indeed ,
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, that well-nigh impecable pros - ateur , but even his name can not go far toward restoring the lost balance .

		The French litera - ture of the past twenty years has been as pro- lific as ever , as far as the main departments of belles-lettres are concerned , but very few works in any of these departments command our at - tention by their preeminent excellence .

		There has been a noteworthy movement in poetry , in the direction of what is vaguely known as '' symbolism , '' much discussed by those who af - fect the cult , but not to be considered very se - riously by those who are concerned for the higher interests of French literature .

		The movement seems to be characterized by an impatience of all artistic restraint , a revolt against the chief canons of poetical form , a somewhat sickly cast of thought , and a tend - ency to exalt little men to the rank of great masters .

		This tendency is , of course , exhibited chiefly within the limits of its own clique of mutual admirers , and is not characteristic of sober criticism , as represented by such men as MM .

		Brunetiere and Faguet .

		In other words , there is in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day , as in every other country of
Europe	LOCATION	, a group of jeunes , who are trying all sorts of unregulated experi - ments in verse and prose , who are making a great pother about their doings , and who are minutely subdivided into little parties and sects , united only in their common endeavor to accomplish great things with small intellectual means .

		Far more creditable to the contempor - ary French spirit is that other and broader movement of thought which has been seeking , ever since the nadir of imperialism was reached thirty years ago , to regenerate the moral ideals of the French people , and to restore the atmos - phere of earnestness which seemed to have been lost .

		How nobly
Kenan	PERSON	and
Taine	PERSON	labored to this end is matter of familiar knowledge .

		Their efforts have born fruit in the writings of Dar - mesteter and Guyau , of MM .

		Brunetiere , La - visse ,
Wagner	PERSON	, and Rod , and of the
Vicomte de Vogue	ORGANIZATION	.

		If this movement has in some cases tended toward a reactionary neo-Catholicism , its net outcome has been for good , and its in - fluence upon the younger generation must have been great , if not at the present time exactly calculable .

		Turning now to English literature our own literature upon the other side of the ocean the capital fact confronts us that in
1880	DATE	there were six great English poets among the living , and that in
1900	DATE	there remains but one .

		During the twenty years
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, have all passed away , leaving Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in ex - alted isolation , the only great poet of the nine - teenth century whom we may hope will live to carry on into the twentieth its glorious liter - ary tradition .

		Our age of gold has to all seem - ing reached an end , and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, who a quarter of a century ago recognized in the years of the Victorian reign a distinct literary period , which even then showed signs of draw - ing to a close , must himself be a little surprised at the completeness with which his prediction has been borne out by the event .

		In the place of our major poets we have now only minor ones , and the fact that we have them in larger numbers than ever before offers us no consola - tion for the loss of the great departed .

		Aside from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, we are compelled to point , when questioned concerning our living poets , to Mr.
Aubrey DeVere	PERSON	, Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	, Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		We hold these men in es - teem , it is true , but however we may admire the delicate art of Mr. Bridges , for example , or the resonant virility of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, our sense of proportion does not permit us to set these men upon anything like the plane occu - pied by the great poets who have died since
1880	DATE	.

		And , with but few exceptions , our living poets seem to be no more than '' little sonnet-men , '' '' Who fashion , in a shrewd , mechanic way , Songs without souls that flicker for a day , To vanish in irrevocable night . ''

		Prose fiction of some sort or other we have al - ways with us , and the names of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	would lend distinction to any period , but the great age of the Victorian nov - elists ended with the death of ''
George Eliot	PERSON	'' in
1881	DATE	.

		Although frequently compared with that woman of genius , Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	may hardly be said to fill her place .

		Since her death we have also lost
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	,
Trollope	LOCATION	,
Black	ORGANIZATION	,
Blackmore	PERSON	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		When we turn to the great writers of prose , the contrast between the living and the dead is seen to be almost as pronounced as in the case of the poets .

		Within twenty years ,
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, by far the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL greatest prosateurs of our time , have ceased to appeal to us with the living voice .

		The per - suasive eloquence of
Newman	PERSON	and
Martineau	PERSON	has been hushed , and the plea for culture , voiced in such dulcet terms by
Arnold	LOCATION	and Pater , is no longer heard .

		All these men are now among '' The dead , but sceptred sovereigns , who still rule Our spirits from their urns , '' but to whose counsel we may no longer turn when new questions arise and call for new so - lutions .

		Of the four great men of science who have caught the ear of the general public dur - ing the past twenty years , and whose teachings have wrought so complete a change in the at - titude of all thinking men toward the claims of scientific culture , and the place of science in education , Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	alone remains to us .

		Darwin ,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and
Tyndall	PERSON	have died , but happily they lived long enough to witness the general acceptance of the ideas for which they fought so good a fight , and to be assured that the evolutionary principle had won for itself the suffrages of all whose judg - ment was worth having .

		The older school of historical writing , as represented by
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Froude	PERSON	, has given place to the school repre - sented by Dr.
Gardiner	PERSON	and the Bishop of Ox - ford .

		The scholarship of these men is no doubt deeper and more accurate than was that of their predecessors , but their `` literature '' is sadly to seek , and their influence consequently restricted .

		The general reader , with a taste for this sort of writing , does not turn to the '' Select Charters , '' but rather takes down from the shelf his well-worn '' Short History of the English People , '' and is not particularly con - cerned with the fact that later research has in - validated some of its positions .

		The two most conspicuous cases of personal success achieved in English authorship during the past twenty years have been those of
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		Both afford striking illustrations of the `` craze '' in literature .

		A few years ago we were told by many enthusiastic readers that in
Stevenson	PERSON	the great masters of our fiction had found a worthy successor .

		More recently we have been assured that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	is a great poet , and the ill-considered laudations of his admirers have been dinned into our ears .

		Such outbursts of uncritical applause always make the judicious grieve , but their effect soon wears away , and the men who occasion them come to be viewed in the proper perspective .


Stevenson	PERSON	has already taken his place as an entertaining novelist of the second or third class , and his singularly lovable personality is not now mistaken for literary genius by any great number of persons .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, like - wise , is fast coming to be viewed as a member of the considerable company of the minor poets of to-day , and his essential message , the more closely we examine it , is found to make much of its appeal to the more vulgar tastes and the baser instincts of human nature .

		Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	is the latest of the `` new poets '' who are discovered and exploited now and then by En - glish critics , and there is no reason thus far apparent why his case should not parallel that of all the others .

		He has , no doubt , an excep - tional gift of refined poetic expression , but there is no distinctively new note in his song ; there is merely a new blending of the notes which are already familiar to us .

		To illustrate what is really meant by a new note in English song we must go back to
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Poems '' of
1870	DATE	, or to
1866	DATE	and the first volume of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Poems and Ballads . ''

		The past two decades have witnessed no such event in English literature as was marked by the ap - pearance of eithei of the volumes just men - tioned .

		When we contrast the period of the sixties and seventies with the period of the eighties and nineties we may realize all the difference between a period in which the cre - ative imagination is at full tide , and a period in which the flood of genius is fast ebbing away .

		In the later of the two periods English literature has rounded out the great work of the earlier ; as the great writers have died , only lesser ones have appeared to take their places ; and many of the younger men , recog - nizing the futility of any attempt to carry on the old tradition upon its old lines , have be - come mere experimenters in new moods and forms , hoping to hit upon some promising line of new literary endeavor , but not as yet indi - cating with any precision the direction which will be taken by the movement of the coming century .

		This restlessness , this confusion of ideals , and this uncertainty of aim are the un - mistakable marks of a transition period in lit - erature .

		A remarkable age has rounded to its close , and it is impossible to determine with any assurance whether the age to come will be merely critical and sterile , or whether it will give birth to some new creative impulse .

		What has just been said of the last years of our English literature is generally true of lit - erature throughout the world .

		Its activities are everywhere largely experimental ; most of the younger writers in all countries appear to 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, be convinced that their only hope of making a mark lies in the discovery of new methods and new forms .

		We seem to be living in an age of literary anarchy , in which every sort of ex - cess or extravagance claims a hearing .

		There are schools and sects and cliques everywhere , but there are no controlling principles .

		This aggressive and unregulated individualism even seeks to bend criticism to its heterogeneous aims by denying the very principle of critical authority .

		It pretends that the belief in crit - ical canons is a superstition , and that individ - ual liking is the only test of good literature .

		Impressionism in criticism is so far in the as - cendant that many people no longer find intel - ligible the point of view from which a critic can say of a composition that he likes it per - sonally , but that it is nevertheless bad liter - ature .

		Yet this is the point of view that every critic must at times be prepared to take , if he have any regard for the seriousness of his call - ing .

		Few critics have ever so succeeded in eliminating the personal equation from their make-up as to bring about an absolute align - ment between their subjective impressions and their objective judgments .

		In the presence of all the diversity of purpose exhibited in the literary activity of recent years , and of all the diversity of critical opinion with which it has been greeted , the search for any principle of unity becomes well-nigh hopeless .

		There is , however , one fairly comprehensive statement which may be made , and upon which we are justified in placing considerable emphasis .

		The European literature of the last twenty years has been more distinctly sociological in char - acter than the literature of any preceding period .

		The social consciousness has been aroused as never before , and the complex rela - tions of men and women , both to each other and to society in the aggregate , have supplied themes for a constantly increasing number of novels and poems and plays .

		A large propor - tion of the writers who have been named in the foregoing pages illustrate some phase of this new or at least heightened sense of the duties of human beings toward one another .

		It was more than accidental , it was rather in obedience to an irresistible tendency of human thought , that such men as
Buskin	PERSON	,
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Herr Bjbrnson	PERSON	, and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	turned at about the same time , and with a common motive , from the past to the present , from the romantic to the real , from work in which the testhetical element was predominant to work in which the ethical element was set , sometimes far too ob - trusively , in the foreground .

		This movement resulted in a manifest loss to art , but it has accomplished much for the betterment of man - kind .

		The change of aim and method which in these writers marks so sharp a contrast be - tween their earlier and their later work is par - alleled in many other writers of less import - ance .

		And many of the younger men , following the biological law which makes the develop - ment of the individual to a certain extent an epitome of the development of the race , have started upon their career as idealists , only to succumb , after a few preliminary flights , to the tendency which has done so much to make of modern literature the handmaid of social analysis and ethical reform .

		The interests of pure literature have suffered in this transform - ing process , but life is even more important than literature , and it is possible that the final reckoning will show the gains to have balanced the losses .

		At all events , this introduction of an avowed social and ethical purpose into nearly all sorts of writing is the most charac - teristic thing that the last twenty years have done for the literature of the world .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		During the twenty years of its existence THE DIAL must have reviewed nearly twice twenty thousand books , and of these quite a large proportion must have been produced in
America	LOCATION	.

		How is such a mass of literature to be sifted and weighed ?

		And how is one who has grown to manhood during the period , who has formed friendships with contemporary writers and been influenced by contemporary books , to judge impartially of the value of a literature that is still evolving , or to describe its tendencies or fix its limitations ?

		I can not answer my own questions , for books and writers appear to compass me so thickly about that when I think of recent American literature I seem to be in a forest the range of which I can not estimate because I can see nothing but trees .

		Yet whatever may be the propriety of any contemporary 's dealing with so broad and complex a subject as American Literature since
1880	DATE	, it can scarcely be doubted that it is eminently proper for THE DIAL to celebrate its twentieth anniversary by publishing a resume of the achievements of American authors during a period in which
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 the journal itself has been a source of inspira - tion to all who care for good literature .

		Per - haps in THE DIAL 'S necessity I may find my opportunity for seeking and obtaining pardon for the rashness of which I am about to be guilty .

		It may seem to be a bad omen to begin with a necrology ; but the necrology of a period of literature is often instructive .

		More veteran authors lived into and died within the
last two decades	DATE	of our literary history than was the case , seemingly , with any two previous decades .

		Emerson ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	, Park - man ,
Curtis	PERSON	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	all these eminent writers , who had won their fame years before , passed away within our period and exerted a powerful influence upon it , not merely by their writings but by their presence in the flesh .

		Many contemporary writers doubtless feel as though they grew up among giants , and while some have been incited to emulation , others have perhaps suffered discouragement , and still others have been tempted to win fame by a revolt from established literary traditions .

		It is at least clear that certain outre tendencies among our younger writers date from years when scarcely a veteran - author of the first rank was left alive .

		Some other names in our necrology will serve to show how very different from its pre - decessors is the epoch we are studying .


Lydia Maria Child	ORGANIZATION	and Jones Very died in
1880	DATE	; yet how far away do we who applaud Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	and read ''
David Harum	PERSON	'' seem to be from the days of the Abolitionists and the Transcendentalists !

		And yet
Christopher Pearse Cranch	PERSON	, who wrote in
Emerson	LOCATION	's `` Dial '' along with
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	and other by-gone worthies , lived until
1892	DATE	, the year in which Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	published the first volumes of his History of the
United States	LOCATION	from the Compromise of
1850	DATE	.

		The long life of Judge
Gayarre	PERSON	, the historian of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, who died in
1895	DATE	at the age of ninety , takes us back equally into the ante-bellum period , as does that of the romancer
W. S. Mayo	PERSON	, author of '' The Berber , '' who died in the same year at the age of eighty-three .


Hermann Melville	PERSON	, famous for his sea tales , died in
1891	DATE	, the year that saw the publication of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's ''
Squirrel Inn	ORGANIZATION	'' and Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's ''
Balaam	PERSON	and his Master . ''

		But the gulf that separates us from the past is best revealed , perhaps , in the fact that
Albert Pike	PERSON	, who was born in the same year with Poe and whose '' Hymns to the Gods , '' published in ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's , '' de - lighted the readers of
1839	DATE	, died compara - tively unnoticed in the same year with
Mel	PERSON	- ville ,
George Bancroft	PERSON	,
James Parton	PERSON	, and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		But if veterans honored or practically for - gotten have died within our period , others have fortunately lived through it , and we have been privileged to know and admire veterans in the making .

		Mr.
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	, Dr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
Everett Hale	PERSON	, Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, Mr.
C. G. Leland	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	to mention no others belong to the first class .

		Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	, Mr.
Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry James , Jr.	PERSON	, Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, obviously represent the second .

		These lists could be easily extended , but the names given will serve our purposes .

		Other names belonging to different cate - gories must , however , be added .

		Within our period careers that seemed to promise much in preceding decades have been nipped , and oth - ers have begun and been cut short .


Sidney Lanier	PERSON	who , whatever the rank ultimately as - signed him , will doubtless be counted the most important writer the South has produced since Poe , succumbed in his brave fight against dis - ease in
1881	DATE	.


Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	, probably our greatest woman poet , died in
1885	DATE	at the age of fifty-four .


Emma Lazarus	PERSON	followed her at the age of thirty-eight .


H. C. Bunner	PERSON	,
Eugene Field	PERSON	,
Harold Frederic	PERSON	, and
Richard Hovey	PERSON	rose to distinction within our limited epoch , did their work faithfully , and passed to their rewards .

		But our concern is chiefly with the living , to whom we may now turn with the remark that it may be interesting to note that the necrology of the two decades contains be - sides the names already given those of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	,
H. W. Grady	PERSON	,
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	,
R. H. Dana , Jr.	PERSON	,
Francis J. Child	PERSON	,
John Esten Cooke	PERSON	,
Paul H. Hayne	PERSON	,
John G. Saxe	PERSON	,
James T. Fields	PERSON	,
J. G. Holland	PERSON	,
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	,
W. W. Story	PERSON	,
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	,
Justin Winsor	PERSON	,
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	,
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	,
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	,
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, Con - stance
Fenimore Woolson	PERSON	,
E. P. Whipple	PERSON	,
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	,
Joseph Kirkland	PERSON	, and not a few others .

		Are our living writers , including all our vet - erans , equal in power and variety of perform - ance to their brother writers whose deaths have just been chronicled ?

		This question naturally 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, forces itself upon us , but we may as well post - pone our answer , and perhaps evade it alto - gether .

		It is at least certain , however , that in point of mere numbers we who are writing in
America	LOCATION	to-day compose a more formidable body than any previous generation of writers has done in this country .

		This is naturally not surprising , in view of the great increase that has taken place in population ; but , when we com - pare the number of writers contemporary with
Charles Brockden Brown	PERSON	with the number con - temporary with Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, we perceive that mere growth of population can not explain the phenomenon under discussion .

		Authors have multiplied in answer to greater trade demands made by publishers , in answer to the promptings of the self-conscious spirit of the age , and also because the spread of educa - tion , especially in the vernacular , has made it possible for more and more men and women to develope a fairly good style and to master at least the rudiments of the writer 's craft .

		Our republic of letters is fast ceasing to be aristo - cratic in character and is becoming thoroughly democratic a change which is also taking place in the mother country .

		It is more possible to regret this change than to deny it .

		Beside our literary men and women of
1900	DATE	the '' Literati '' of the forties cut quite a small figure ; but where are our Poe and our Hawthorne ?

		Who among our poets has taken
Longfellow	LOCATION	's place ?

		Who equals
Lowell	PERSON	as a critic ?

		What living nov - elist is as secure of an undying reputation as that old-fashioned romancer Cooper , at whom some of the present-day purveyors of fiction delight to sneer ? ''

		Perhaps after all , '' a mali - cious observer might remark , '' the real reason you modern writers form a democracy is that you have no aristocrats no really great men among you ! ''

		Some of us might reply that such a remark would not be quite fair , that sooner or later the bell-like fame Of this or that down-trodden name will meet our eager ears , and that at least the authors of `` Huckleberry Finn '' and `` The Rise of
Silas Lapham	PERSON	'' are great enough to lend respectability to the epoch .

		But , however legitimate such an answer , few of us , doubtless , can survey our recent literary production with - out concluding that with regard to the creation of masterpieces of imaginative literature other periods have surpassed us .

		In poetry no name has attained great preeminence ; in fiction , de - spite the phenomenal sales of certain novels , we have scarcely more than one book to men - tion in the same breath with '' The Last of the Mohicans '' and '' The Scarlet Letter '' ; in lit - erary craftsmanship or art , while we can fairly say that there are ten good writers now to one in
1840	DATE	, we must candidly admit that we have not a single name worthy to be set alongside that of Poe .

		Our strength plainly lies in the number of our important writers , and in the variety and high average merit of their work ; in other words , Democracy is justified of her children even in the domain of letters .

		Let us now take a nearer view of these wri - ters and their work .

		With comparatively little trouble I have made out a list of one hundred and fifty authors living to-day within the
United States	LOCATION	with the exception of one or two exiles all or nearly all of whom would , I think , deserve to have their work considered , to a fair extent at least , by a literary historian working on the scale adopted by Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	.

		The writer of a handbook or a school manual could undoubtedly afford to pass over a third or more of these names ; but a real in - vestigator of the period would not omit nearly so many .

		It is needless to say that before this article is printed my list will have been de - stroyed , and that I have no intention of giving it here .

		After all , the individual names do not matter much ; what does matter is the large total and the classes into which it may be dis - tributed .

		I find that of my one hundred and fifty names twenty-seven are poets ; twenty - seven critics and essayists ; sixty-seven novelists ; nineteen historians ; and ten miscellaneous wri - ters whom it is difficult to classify .

		Of course some of these authors , like Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Dr. van Dyke for I do not mind saying that both are on my list , might easily be included under three of the above heads , but I have placed them where they seem primarily to be - long .

		Now what conclusions do these figures seem to suggest ?

		In the first place they tell us what we already knew , that fiction is the dominant literary form of the day .

		They show also that criticism and history are holding their own well , as we should naturally have inferred .

		They prove , too , that writers still own allegiance to poetry , even if most readers do not .

		They show furthermore , I think , that the tendency to specialization of scholarship , so marked of late years , has not had quite the deleterious effect upon the pro- duction of real literature that might have been expected .

		Not a few of the critics , historians ,
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 and miscellaneous writers included above are specialists whose minute studies have not pre - vented them from acquiring a broad , liberal culture .

		Finally , our figures seem to prove that in spite of or perhaps in reaction from our utilitarian character as a people , a decided majority of our writers who have made their marks have striven to succeed in the highest regions of imaginative literature .

		These as - piring souls may not in the end invalidate the judgment passed upon our literature , and more especially its prose , by Professor
George R. Carpenter	PERSON	, to the effect that its sound , com - mon sense , wholesome qualities make it essen - tially a '' citizen 's literature '' ; but they are doing their best to set it beside literatures rich in imaginative works , such as those of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		The literature in which such a tendency can be discovered is surely in no unhealthy state , even if it can at the time boast of few living writers of eminent origin - ality .

		But the figures given are susceptible of other manipulations more or less instructive .

		The list was made out with no thought as to the respective proportions of the two sexes rep - resented ; at the end it was found that they stood as five to one in favor of the sex that has hitherto dominated literature .

		This seems to be on the whole not a bad showing for our women , and the disparity is likely to decrease in the future in view of the large amount of reading done by women , the spread of higher education among them , and the remarkable literary activity of their various clubs .

		The showing made by them appears to be still more noticeable from the fact that with prac - tically only one exception every woman counted is doing work in either poetry or fiction that is , in the highest ranges of literature .

		The more ideal sex has the more ideal aims .

		From some points of view literature should know neither section nor country , but it is in - teresting to observe that of the one hundred and fifty names selected nearly one hundred should be credited to the North and East , and the remainder almost evenly divided between
South and West	LOCATION	.


New England	LOCATION	is still influ - ential , but does not dominate our literature as formerly .

		The
Middle States	LOCATION	have at last equaled her or surpassed her perhaps in consequence of the growth of a distinct school of literary
New Yorkers	LOCATION	; the
West	LOCATION	has proved that business prosperity is not its only ideal ; and the
New South	LOCATION	has distinguished itself in no way so much as by finding in its young writers an articulate voice .

		It is true that many of the authors credited to the West and South have found it desirable to join the im - portant group of writers that has wrested the primacy from
Boston	LOCATION	and made
New York	LOCATION	the literary centre of the country ; but they still , like Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, continue in their writings to smack of the soil upon which their youth was spent .

		On the other hand , this set - ting of the literary tide toward
New York	LOCATION	, which is paralleled by the similar movements toward
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	, is some - what counterbalanced by the facts that in the past few years
Boston	LOCATION	has shown increased ac - tivity in publishing , that
Chicago	LOCATION	has become a centre of the trade in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and that even in comparatively smaller cities numerous important firms are stimulating the energy of local authors and scouring the country to discover fresh talent .

		It seems quite certain that from
Boston	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	the future is likely to witness a fair development of local writers and publishers .

		This matter of local centres is more impor - tant than it appears at first sight .

		The great centres of artistic and literary production in the past , from
Athens	LOCATION	to the
Boston	LOCATION	of the Trans - cendentalists , have been also centres of a homo - geneous population .

		Can a really great litera - ture grow up in the midst of a heterogeneous population , and how far are we Americans a heterogeneous people ?

		These questions con - front every serious student of our literature , and it would at least seem that our literary future would be more assured if we could be certain that the growth of
New York	LOCATION	, which is quite inevitable , would not prevent the devel - opment of local centres .

		Even as it is , we may find profit in noting that the comparatively homogeneous population of the South has made the greatest relative advance in our period , and that in the South , as elsewhere , it seems in the main to be the comparatively homogeneous stocks or strains of population , like those of
Tennessee	LOCATION	and
Kentucky	LOCATION	, that have furnished both writers and subjects for literary exploita - tion .

		From local literary centres we naturally pass to local fiction , and we hardly need consult any list of our novelists to conclude that American fiction since
1880	DATE	has developed more fully the tendency that became pronounced in the sev - enties to portray with minute skill the modes of life and thought peculiar to limited classes or stocks of population inhabiting limited areas .

		The Forty-niners of
Bret Harte	PERSON	and the 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	,
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	types of
Mark Twain	PERSON	have been succeeded by
Virginia	LOCATION	negroes ,
Georgia	LOCATION	'' crackers , ''
Louisiana	LOCATION	Creoles ,
Tennessee	LOCATION	and
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountaineers ,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	farmers ,
New England	LOCATION	villagers and but the list is too formidable and the end is not yet .

		In this de - velopment of local fiction , which has been par - alleled in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, our epoch stands in distinct contrast with the ante-bellum period , although books like Longstreet 's ''
Georgia	LOCATION	Scenes '' might be cited to show that evolution rather than revolution has taken place .

		That the work done in the various re - stricted fields has been often admirable in quality it would be foolish to deny , but whether our novelists have shown sufficient knowledge of the human heart and mind to give their works currency after the manners and types they portray have ceased to be strange or have vanished before the leveling tide of civilization , is a question that the future alone can answer .

		Hawthorne 's '' House of the Seven Gables '' still holds it own ; will posterity put any of our stories beside it , no matter how accurate the dialect or how painstaking the portraiture ?

		But some of our writers of fiction have aimed at wider work and , whether consciously or un - consciously , have taken for their master Balzac , the great student of society , as a whole .

		A small group of realists is treating
New York	LOCATION	in the manner if not with the success that
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	treated
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The influence of Tourguenieff and of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has also been felt by them , and they have done work distinctive in character and far reaching in its effects .

		The general public has received this work often with slight courtesy and has turned with more relish either to religious romances like ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	'' or to stories of the Revolution that furnish appro - priate reading for the Sons and Daughters of that prolific cataclysm , or to the specifically local fiction that has just been mentioned . ''

		Give us a story that is a story '' , they say with some justice , and fall to reading a bril - liant colonial romance .

		But will the brilliant romances or the local fiction of a contracted type give the form and pressure of the time to inquiring posterity as well as the less ab - sorbing novels of our realists will ?

		With the exception of the numerous and excellent short stories , an admirable form of fiction in which Americans have succeeded since the days of Irving , Poe , and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and in which the period just closing has probably done more than merely hold its own , is not the work of the realists the most typical product of the period ?

		The reader must answer these ques - tions as he will , and , if he be wise , he will probably enjoy the good work his contempor - aries are doing regardless of the permanence or impermanence of its value .

		He may , how - ever , quite properly find it in his heart to re - gret that , in some notable cases , too great in - sistence upon theories of fiction has limited the appeal of great writers and , in one instance at least , has rendered the self-imposed exile of a distinguished novelist a matter of less regret to his country and of less loss to the literature of our period than it would otherwise have been .

		Passing now to the higher but less culti - vated form of imaginative literature known by the sacred name of poetry , we find that , as in so many other matters , we have closely paral - leled recent British experience .

		Indeed one marked characteristic of the period we are con - sidering is what may be termed the general intellectual leveling up of the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race .

		British books no longer dominate our market , and American books are no longer unwelcome in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		There is less disposition to colonial subservience in literary matters on our part and less reason for it , since modern British literature is not obviously superior to our own .

		As with us , so in
Great Britain	LOCATION	the republic of letters seems to be losing its aris - tocratic caste ; bizarre youth plays its pranks there as here ; fiction that is often good but seldom masterly is the dominant literary form , and poetry is cultivated by an increasing num - ber of surprisingly well-trained but still minor poets .

		This last phenomenon was some years since made the subject of an interesting article by the late Mr.
Traill	PERSON	.

		He showed that
Great Britain	LOCATION	possessed at the time some half a hun - dred minor poets , any one of whom was capable of doing work that in technique at least would have seemed quite remarkable in any other epoch .

		Doubtless the number of these poets has increased in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and , as I have recently said elsewhere , there is every reason to believe that there are just as many meritorious minor poets in this country .

		If the number of poets included in our list is less , this is because it seemed wise to count only those writers who had received a fair amount of public recognition .

		But anyone who has been called upon to review the annual out - put of verse in
America	LOCATION	for the last few years will readily admit that for minor poetry it often shows marked excellence of rhythm and
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 diction , distinct poetical temperaments on the part of the writers , conscientious study of the best models in short most of the virtues of good poetry except the saving one of strongly original creative power .

		If this saving virtue be demanded , it must be confessed that few living American or Brit - ish poets will stand the test .

		With the deaths of the great
New England	LOCATION	poets and of Whit - man we have been left with a few true and fairly distinguished poets and with many minor ones of varying excellence , but with no great ones , even in the limited sense in which '' great '' can be applied to any American poet .

		Every year or two a new poet is hailed by his friends , and the ear of the public twitches ; but that is about all , even though the poet sells a few thousand copies of his book and makes his appearance on the lecture platform .

		Nor is anybody to blame for this state of things .

		The public is right in not being stirred by what is obviously not stirring , although this is not saying that it can not be aroused to unnec - essary enthusiasm over the rather brazen ring of some contemporary verse .

		On the other hand , the friends of our poets are right in standing by them loyally , for many of them have distinct merits , and it is not well that the cause of the fine art they are faithfully serving should want defenders .

		After all , neither a people nor a generation need feel ashamed if great poets are conspicuous by their absence .

		Our race has known poetic interregnums be - fore , and the present one will probably cease ere long .

		Meanwhile two facts are interesting .

		The first is that even in the most out-of-the-way localities young poets , often of distinct ability , are serving the muse in spite of public neglect and of the pressure of our complex life .

		These men are influencing their communities for good and will at least help to smooth the paths of great poets when they come .

		The second fact is the attention our two most original poets , Poe and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, are receiving .

		The Poe cult has been sufficiently discussed in these columns ; that of Whitman has probably not been adequately recognized by orthodox criti - cism .

		That many of the claims made for our rugged chanter of the glories of democracy are extravagant , is doubtless true ; but it is equally true that his voice has a carrying quality that makes it penetrate ears deaf to all other poetry .

		This is but another proof of the democratiza - tion of our literature , and it is a proof that the process has its advantages as well as its disad - vantages .

		In this connection it is interesting to note that the natural
Whitman	PERSON	has found one of his stoutest champions in a student of nature and a disciple of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, whose work is typical of a kind of writing to which more and more Americans are devoting themselves and which is not un - worthy of being mentioned in connection even with poetry itself .

		The mention of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	makes the transition to criticism easy , but the space re - maining to me is limited and I must hasten to a conclusion .

		American criticism seems to be in a healthy state so far as the ability of our critics is concerned ; but , as I have tried to show elsewhere , there is still much to be done toward attaining an adequate critical philosophy .

		We have critics who are learned , critics of admira - ble taste , and critics gifted with the power of interpreting literature to the masses , but few or none of large mould and speaking with au - thoritative voice .

		Perhaps this fact is due in part to the character of the age , which has no great respect for authority of any sort ; but it is at least quite as much due to a lack of stand - ards and philosophic methods on the part of the critics themselves .

		But when all is said , the generation that has produced such a book as Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's '' Studies in Chaucer , '' and that can point to at least a dozen success - ful essayists , can hold its own in criticism with any that has preceded it .

		The same statement may be made with re - gard to history , biography , economics , and pol - itics , and classical scholarship , so far as concerns the literary character of the chief recent works in these departments of thought .

		As our great - est critic died in
Lowell	LOCATION	, so probably our greatest historian died in
Parkman	LOCATION	, yet history in general has not merely not lost in the
past twenty years	DATE	but has actually gained .

		Owing to the influence of graduate schools in connec - tion with our great universities , the spirit of accurate historical research has spread through - out the land .

		This research has been carried on in the main by specialists often deficient in literary gifts , but their methods have affected more ambitious and talented historians , with the result that a large number of elaborate his - torical works have been written within our period that would be a credit to any people and to any age .

		It is impossible to specify them all , but perhaps it will not be invidious to lay special stress upon the histories of Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	and of Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	as illus - trating the truth of what has just been said .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, As for biography , economics , and classical scholarship still less can be said here .

		Recent work in these lines has been especially note - worthy and is likely to continue so certainly in economics in which the public finds many reasons to take a vital interest .

		The taste for biographical reading is also growing , and in General Grant 's '' Memoirs '' at least the gen - eration has probably produced a classic .

		If the work of Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	in the domain of Greek scholarship and culture is less popu - larly known , it is a comfort to some of us to think that we have in him an American fully worthy to rank with Professor
Jebb	PERSON	himself .

		Several topics remain that deserve discus - sion , but they can now be mentioned only .

		The last twenty years have seen great devel - opments in periodical literature .

		The more expensive magazines have kept their standing , and cheap magazines , some good , some poor , have made literature popular as it never was before .

		The newspapers , too , are paying more attention to literature than ever and find that it pays to issue special literary supplements .

		Reviews of all sorts have been established , al - though in the main technical in character .

		Cheap libraries of books famous and infamous have had immense sales .

		Literary clubs of all sorts have fostered a taste for reading and have thus stimulated literary production .

		Pub - lishers have adopted the larger business meth - ods of the epoch and keep the presses running night and day .

		With their numerous series of all sorts they secure for new authors sales that would be otherwise impossible ; but on the other hand they are insatiate in their demands upon all available writers , and the result is hasty , immature work that is demoralizing both to author and to reader .

		Publishers are also partly responsible for the fact that their popular books , which they naturally advertise in every way possible , often overshadow and prevent the sale of more deserving volumes .

		For this state of affairs the public is , however , just as much to blame , for it allows itself to be seized by a craze or fad and devours books eagerly which in a short time it is only too will - ing to forget .

		The end is not yet , nor can any man predict with certainty what effect modern conditions of literary productivity will have on at least the higher forms of literature .

		Will our children or grandchildren take fiction seri - ously if every week in the year sees a new novel reach the hundred thousand mark ?

		But our concern is not with the future , and as for the immediate past it can be safely affirmed , in conclusion , that whether the period we have just left behind us be a great one or not , it is certainly an interesting one , as well as one that proves that we have not fallen behind in letters as we have in politics .

		From
Charles Brockden Brown	PERSON	to
William Dean Howells	PERSON	is a distinct ascent ; facilis est descensus from
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	to any living American statesman .

		Yet it seemed , years ago , that our true glory lay in the political sphere .

		WILLIAM P. TRENT .

		AMERICAN PUBLISHING AND PUBLISHERS .

		`` A thousand ages were blank , if books had not evoked their ghosts , '' wrote
Bulwer	PERSON	; and THE DIAL 'S twenty years of life crowd them - selves with the ghosts of many ages .

		Within the narrow confines of a score of years , pro- gress has been made for which the elder world waited centuries in vain .

		Great as our ma - terial advance has been in the two closing de - cades of the century , our intellectual life has kept pace with it ; and of this progress the best rec - ord and epitome is to be found in books .

		The first glance backward is therefore one of congratulation .

		But the books , their authors and publishers , have come and many of them have gone , leaving the mind overstocked with memories and crowded with reflections .

		Dur - ing THE DIAL 'S twenty years , the world of English letters has been robbed of the great names of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lanier	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and Park - man in
America	LOCATION	; of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Morris	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	; with scores of lesser authors in both lands .

		With these have passed away many of the men who made the reading public acquainted with these authors ,
James T. Fields	PERSON	,
Daniel S. Appleton	PERSON	,
Henry O. Houghton	PERSON	,
J. B. Lippin	PERSON	- cott ,
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	-LRB- second of that name -RRB- ,
Charles Welford	PERSON	,
James R. Osgood	PERSON	,
Robert Clarke	PERSON	,
Edward S. Mead	PERSON	, with other names of power and influence in the world of books .

		A score of years ago , books of poetry which attracted hundreds and even thousands of read - ers were appearing with every season ; now , more books of verse are put forth than ever before , but the names their publishers used to conjure with are absent .

		In other fields it is the same .

		To join the present and that not remote past of which we speak , Messrs. Sted -

		THE DIAL 341 man ,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Stoddard	PERSON	,
Warner	ORGANIZATION	,
Mitchell	PERSON	,
Howells	LOCATION	,
James	PERSON	,
Stockton	PERSON	, and
Eggleston	PERSON	still flourish in
America	LOCATION	; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, Mr.
Aus	PERSON	- tin
Dobson	PERSON	, Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, and several more , in
England	LOCATION	; but the times have changed , and many of the names now most prominent in current letters were unknown when THE DIAL began its course .

		In
1880	DATE	, a few great houses controlled the publishing business in
America	LOCATION	, and not many smaller houses flourished beside them .

		In other businesses centralization has since been the rule of growth , and this is no exception ; yet the number of publishers seems to have multiplied even more than the number of books .

		The great houses survive the lon - gevity of authors , almost proverbial , seeming to extend to the men whose function it is to make the author possible in his relations with the public ; and there is probably no commer - cial occupation which can show names more old and venerable than those which stand as monuments in the book-producing world .

		The repute of publishing as the trade most nearly resembling a learned profession is fully sus - tained by the new blood which has flowed into its veins .

		The older men , gone from the gen - eration now passing , were men of sound char - acter and cultivated minds , and their example has been followed , until , with rare exceptions , the American publisher stands well for Amer - ican character and culture .

		Twenty years have brought many changes in the artistic and mechanical sides of bookmak - ing , not all of them commendable , but on the whole tending toward a finer and wider devel - opment of art .

		Chiefly noticeable are the great increase in the quality and quantity , of illustra - tion brought about through improved pictorial processes , the increased attention paid to cover designs , calling into service a body of artists of which the older generation had not dreamed , and the frequent use of color , even to the point of landscape effects , on book covers .

		The use of color in illustration , particularly in maga - zines , is also a recent innovation , still some - what in the stage of experiment .

		The intro - duction of machine devices in book production , such as the linotype substitute for type-setting , has been indulged in but cautiously by the best publishers , and whatever lowering of standards has come from these processes has been more than offset by improved faces of founders ' type and by the common use of better grades of paper made possible by the cheapening of staple manufactures generally .

		In the form of the best books , the tendency has been toward simple elegance instead of costly show .

		The elaborate and ponderous editions which weighted down the book-shelves of our fathers have mostly gone their way , and in their stead thrives the sort of modest but more artistic volume which challenges comparison with the work of the old master printers .

		In the great book publishing houses of
America	LOCATION	it is peculiarly true that though the individual wither yet the firm is more and more .

		These are the houses that are built on broad and deep foundations , and though the members that compose them are taken one by one yet the house still stands .

		Even the very recent financial complications of two of the oldest and largest firms in the country , start - ling as they were , are not likely to affect seri - ously their future usefulness and prosperity , and thus while saddening are not discouraging .

		In the first number of THE DIAL there ap - peared the advertisements of just ten
Ameri	PERSON	- can publishing houses a striking contrast to the nearly one hundred firms appearing in the present issue and of these ten firms all but two are still in active existence , while there is hardly one of them but has lost meanwhile a prominent and active member .

		A few details , reviving memories of earlier days , may not be out of place in this necessarily brief survey .

		The same day that saw the birth of THE DIAL saw also the separation of the historic firm of
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Osgood & Co.	ORGANIZATION	into the two houses of
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and
J. R. Osgood & Co.	ORGANIZATION	; the former continuing to stand distinctively for literary conservatism and classic simplicity of typography and ornament , while the latter devoted itself more particularly to the heliotype reproduction of old engravings of merit , foreshadowing those extensive photo - graphic processes which have since made artis - tic illustration possible for almost every book .

		Both Mr.
Houghton	PERSON	and Mr.
Osgood	PERSON	, as also Mr. Fields their immemorial predecessor , have since passed away .

		Other
Boston	LOCATION	firms of our initial period were Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, trac - ing their origin back to
1784	DATE	, and conducting business under the present name unchanged since
1847	DATE	;
Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, absorbed by the firm just named after the death of Mr.
Niles	PERSON	of genial memory ;
Ginn	PERSON	,
Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, since divided into the two houses of
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, each since becoming far more extensive than the parent house ;
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, lately removed to
New York City	LOCATION	;
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	, continuing the firm 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, name unaffected by the death of Mr.
Shepard	PERSON	and the retirement of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	;
D. Lothrop & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, since incorporated as the Lothrop Pub - lishing Company on the death of Mr.
Daniel Lothrop	PERSON	; and
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	, who were suc - ceeded in
1898	DATE	in their publishing department by
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turning to
New York	LOCATION	, we find the house of
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, already over sixty years old when THE DIAL was born , changing from a co-partnership to a corporation in
1896	DATE	; Mr.
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	, long an active member of this firm , being included in the death-roll of our score of years .


D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	had been a firm for over half a century , having been founded in
1825	DATE	by
Daniel Appleton	PERSON	, father of the
Daniel S. Appleton	PERSON	whose death occurred a few years ago .

		The firm of
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons also began many years before our period , taking its present name in
1878	DATE	; the importing branch of its business was long done by the allied house of
Scribner & Wei	ORGANIZATION	- ford , which was merged with the parent house six years after the death of Mr.
Welford	PERSON	in
1885	DATE	.

		In
1870	DATE	Scribner 's Sons established a magazine department under the name of
Scrib - ner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, from which descended one of the present great houses ,
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in which Dr.
Holland	PERSON	and Mr.
Roswell C. Smith	PERSON	, now both deceased , were leading and vital spirits , and made the house famous not only for its magazines but for its monumental en - terprises , of which the great
Century Diction	ORGANIZATION	- ary is a fit example .


G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons took their name as a co-partnership in
1873	DATE	, incorporating in
1892	DATE	, when their manufac - turing business was turned over to an allied company called The
Knickerbocker Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dodd ,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	took their present name in
1870	DATE	, retaining it unchanged by the death of Mr.
Mead	PERSON	in
1894	DATE	.

		The business of
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	was begun in
1866	DATE	, the present name being taken in
1873	DATE	, when the firm was al - ready prominent and influential .

		Notable among the deaths of our period is that of Mr.
Frederick Leypoldt	PERSON	, one of the founders of the house last named , and ever gratefully remem - bered for his American Catalogue and other serviceable bibliographical work .


E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Fords , Howard , & Hulbert	ORGANIZATION	,
John Wiley & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
A. C. Armstrong & Son	ORGANIZATION	,
E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are recalled among the firms in existence at
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	'S initial period .

		In
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
J. B. Lippincott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	had been publishing under that title since
1855	DATE	, though tracing their origin back to
1798	DATE	.

		After the death of Mr.
J. B. Lippincott	PERSON	, in
1886	DATE	, the firm was changed to a corporation , which continues its extensive business un - checked by the disastrous fire of a few months ago .

		The firm of
Porter & Coates	ORGANIZATION	was well known long before THE DIAL was , becoming
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a few years ago .

		In
Cincinnati	LOCATION	,
Robert Clarke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	had led an honorable existence for many years among the pioneers of Western publishing houses , con - tinuing as a corporation since the recent death of Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	, the founder .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, the trade has long been led by
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, now a corporation , and the earliest pub - lishers of THE DIAL .

		Also in
Chicago	LOCATION	at the beginning of our period were the well-known religious house of
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the law firm of
Callaghan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Henry A. Sum	PERSON	- ner
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, since gone out of business , and
S. C. Griggs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, whose business was transferred , on the death of Mr.
Griggs	PERSON	, to
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who still continue it .

		Rand ,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	,
C. H. Sergei Company	ORGANIZATION	,
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the Open Court Pub - lishing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have all entered the active field since THE DIAL began its career .

		That other houses besides those we have named were in existence in this country at the beginning of the period covered by our sketch , is only too probable ; as also that other names of honor and influence have been taken from the publishing world , and are borne in mem - ory , though not set down in recollections so disconnected and fragmentary .

		But if it has been found impossible , within the necessary limits , to include all the old established houses of a score of years ago , what can be done toward mentioning the houses that have since come into being ?

		A novel feature of recent years has been the appearance of a number of firms which were , somewhat distinctively , composed of young men , ardent , confident , full of en - terprise , often with original ideas of consider - able value , sometimes expecting too much of these ideas and hoping that with them they would revolutionize or conquer the publishing world .

		They have not revolutionized it ; not all of them have even made themselves a place in it .

		But they have not been without their influence , and a certain improvement in artistic taste and a quickening of ideas may doubtless be traced to the influence of these young men .

		Prominent among houses established since the founding of THE DIAL may be mentioned the firm of
White	ORGANIZATION	,
Stokes & Allen	ORGANIZATION	, now con -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 ducting its extensive business under the more recent corporate name of the
Frederick A. Stokes	PERSON	Company ; while latest , in point of time , is the young Hercules firm of
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, founded in
1897	DATE	and growing so vigorously that one house soon became too small to hold all the members , and there re - sulted the firm of
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the McClure firm still continuing , all three big with life and enterprise .

		The newer comers who have won distinction and made their impression in the publishing field are of course too numerous to mention in the limited space at our disposal .

		A word might be given to certain names which suggest some noteworthy modern inno - vations in book production , such names as
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, El - bert
Hubbard	PERSON	and his '' Roycroft Press , '' and the '' Brothers of the Book , '' all indicating a certain tendency which is not without signifi - cance to the reading and the publishing worlds .

		It would be interesting , did space and time permit , to consider the growth and present con - dition of the subscription book trade , but this is hardly within the scope of this survey .

		Neither are text - books , properly speaking , though this field of publication has had an enormous development in the past twenty years , as shown by the organization and prosperity of the great American Book Company and other large concerns .

		The extension of many of the religious publication societies , practically every denomination now having its publishing estab - lishment , into the field of general publishing , is also a feature to be mentioned .

		Finally , if we notice the increased activity of the various
University	ORGANIZATION	presses of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and other of the large institutions of learning and culture we shall see how varied in interest and how vast in total is the book output of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Even an incomplete survey of American publishing interests for the past twenty years must not omit to mention International Copy - right , which was adopted by the
United States	ORGANIZATION	in
1891	DATE	, and must have had some important effects upon the trade , though just what these effects have been no one can very definitely say .

		Whether or not it has done all that its more zealous advocates had hoped , it was un - questionably a policy of justice , and has un - doubtedly been of help to American authors both at home and in
England	LOCATION	.

		The American market has become an object of greater inter - est to the English publishing houses , an in - creasing number of whom have found it to their advantage to maintain their business on both sides of the sea .

		The chief example of this class is of course the great house of
Mac - millau & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, whose American business has had an enormous development under the man - agement of Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	, who suc - ceeded his father , Mr.
George E. Brett	PERSON	, upon the death of the latter some ten years ago .

		The well-known houses , of
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	's Sons , of
John Lane	PERSON	, of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and of
George Routledge & Sons , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	, are also to be included among * the active and influential firms that are international in character , whose po - sition makes it easier for an author to procure the introduction of his work to those who speak the same tongue everywhere , whether in En - gland ,
America	LOCATION	, or the colonies .

		One of the results of this has been the enormous demand for novels immediately upon their production , , testifying in a remarkable manner to the close - ness of the tie that binds the English and American reading public together .

		The first American book for which a large demand was had was '' Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		But this sale was of slow growth , and for reasons other than literary .

		Not long after THE DIAL 'S birth , Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	attracted the attention of the reading public in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	with `` Robert Elsmere '' ; but here again , though the story had merit as literature , its success was due largely to the theological questions involved .

		But Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' attained an international vogue which can hardly be referred to other than a literary cause ; and this is true , successively , of Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's ``
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' and
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's '' To Have and To Hold , '' all of which deal with colonial and revolutionary times , of interest , apparently , to the English-speaking race .

		Taking leave of the past as seen in this in - adequate survey , we turn to the future which ever lies bright before us .

		So far as appears to even the experienced eye , there has never been a period of greater promise in the pub - lishing trade of the
United States	LOCATION	, and the revival waited for during many weary months shows no sign of waning , on the contrary , the indications point to a memorable series of years r in which the author , the publisher , and the rapidly-growing reading public will combine to - give the publishing trade in
America	LOCATION	a period of unprecedented prosperity .


FRANCIS F. BROWNE	PERSON	, 344 THE DIAL AMERICAN BOOKSELLING AND BOOKSELLERS .

		When
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	started its effort for the betterment of things literary , twenty years ago , its projectors had plans of their own , and ideals to be achieved , and though progress has been made and results reached , still it can be seen that contentment will not be had until more and more progress is secured .

		Truly , it is the law of life and will not be denied .

		Twenty years ago is not so very far back , and yet what a crowding of events there has been , and what a multitude of changes have come to pass since then !

		In printing we have passed from the staid and plain and solid , to the brilliant and many-tinted or more deeply colored ; and coupled with the changes there has been such attention to the details and niceties of the art that unlimited admiration has followed , and rightly too .

		It may be said at once that bookselling in
America	LOCATION	is more of a science to-day than ever before ; that the scale on which it is conducted is broader and higher , and the lines laid more intelligently and to better purpose .

		The finer and better equipped bookstores are furnished with stocks such as the world never before saw collected together for mercantile pur - poses , and the books are displayed in such inviting ways as to attract the buyer to first examine and then to purchase .

		And this is done without intent to trick or inveigle buyers , by artifice or design , to buy that which they do not need or would not otherwise invest in ; the individual items are put in convenient places to be handled , in assortments that are intelligible to any observant mind , and classi - fied so that the whole line of any one class in the stock itself can be gone over by the cus - tomer , and he readily find the special book he may be seeking , and many more covering the same field .

		It follows , of course , that cus - tomers are oftentimes astonished and delighted at finding books of equal value with the ones they came to buy , and they go happily away with one or more additional volumes to for - tify them in their reading or study of the subjects involved .

		It can be seen how by this method the bookseller is benefitted , for it not only increases the present sales from his stock , but the customer who finds himself so aided in one case is pretty certain to return in the future , as often as he can possibly do so .

		Another result in such an arrangement of stock is that the clerks become more and more intelligent and helpful .

		The very assorting of stock in classes leads to definiteness of under - standing as to what books of value there are on a given subject , and , when that is known , to the other and better point of which of them all is the best on its topic .

		It then only remains to suit the supply to the particular needs of the customer on the subject in hand , to completely satisfy the ideal requirements for which book - stores should be established .

		In the larger and finer class of bookstores referred to , as may be imagined , it is necessary that the salesmen be not only well posted , but cultivated to a high degree in the expert knowl - edge of their craft .

		Even to the most pains - taking of them this requires time and perse - verence and concentration of thought ; and it is a pleasure to record that there are now in this country a considerable number who can rightly be called masters in their field .

		To those of the readers of THE DIAL who travel , it will only be necessary to make clear the style of bookstore to which reference is made , to mention , in
New York	LOCATION	, Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ,
Messrs. G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , and Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	; in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Messrs. Little	LOCATION	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	and
Charles E. Lauriat Co.	ORGANIZATION	; in
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Burrows Brothers Company	ORGANIZATION	and Helman-Taylor Company ; and last but not least , in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Messrs.	LOCATION
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many more could be men - tioned , but these will suffice to prove that the highest intelligence is bestowed , and an al - most unlimited amount of capital invested , in these businesses ; that to every such establish - ment is given the greatest care in detail ; and that the results achieved are only secured by taxing to the utmost the energies and atten - tion of those in charge .

		All honor is due to such men , and should be liberally bestowed by those to whose wants they cater , and for whose edification and gratification they give their on - erous , though often delightful , labors .

		The buyers of books should appreciate this , and should be ready to pay for such services that which will afford a profit commensurate with the benefits bestowed .

		In the larger cities this is recognized and granted , and the best that the world produces can consequently be found on the shelves of the bookstores .

		In bookselling , as everybody knows , there are differing phases brought about by locality or other circumstances .

		A college town book - store , for instance , will be looked to for tech - nical books covering fields other than those fixed for study , and beyond or in advance of
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 them .

		These are such as will be recommended by professors for post-graduates for private study , to those who wish to go beyond the lim - its of any college or university course .

		That the bookseller should have these goes without saying ; but it must be remembered by buyers that their purchases of these must be made of their local dealer , or he will ultimately avoid keeping them .

		It is such stock that rapidly uses up capital , and without the constant sup - port of the local buyer it will prove a source of loss to the dealer , rather than profit .

		To give him that support is his just due , and the with-holding of it is that which sometimes causes buyers to inveigh -LRB- causelessly -RRB- against the bookseller .

		Every bookseller will keep a full stock if it will pay him to do so ; and the more prompt and ready the purchasers , the more varied and complete will be the stock .

		The booksellers in the smaller cities have had to face several changes .

		In not every case has the town or city grown larger , and where it has , it has not necessarily meant a propor - tionate increase of book buyers .

		The dealer has striven , under changing conditions , to keep pace with changing tastes and , where possible , to build up an enlarged trade .

		Purchases have been larger , but expenses heavier in proportion , and the profit on the increased amount has often been less than of old .

		This , of course , has been discouraging to some , and enterprise has been nipped in the bud and effort to over - come the conditions has ceased .

		Inasmuch as the population of this country is sure to in - crease everywhere , it is to be hoped that those thus affected by belittlement of results will soon find a proper reward for their enterprise and labor , and be encouraged to continue until success is renewed .

		A striking feature of recent times is the popularity of certain historical novels , some of which have reached sales of unusually high numbers .

		Of ''
Eichard Carvel	ORGANIZATION	'' there have been sold 430,000 copies ; ''
David Harum	PERSON	, '' 500,000 ; `` To Have and to Hold , '' 200,000 ; ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' 250,000 ; `` Ked Rock , '' 84,000 ; and the call for them still continues unabated .

		The definite reason for these phe - nomenal sales is not easily ascertained .

		The books themselves each have merit of a high order , and the same public is appealed to in each case by their publishers , who advertise in about the same journals .

		But the fact remains that these volumes are read by their hundreds of thousands of readers , and have become the topic of discussion in all quarters .

		They are , for the time , `` the fashion , '' and there is no knowing when the public will cease to give them attention for some newer idols .

		It would be an interesting question to settle , on behalf of good literature , if by the sale of such items a maximum could be named for the sale of a genuinely high-class novel , in this land of sev - enty-five millions of people .

		For more than the particular twenty years with which we are especially concerned , there has been a disturbing element entering into the bookselling situation , to the great and in - creasing discomfort of those whose living has depended solely on bookselling , namely , the sale of books in '' Department '' stores ; more strictly , the sale of them there at '' cut '' prices .

		It would be folly to go over the discussion again in the ways so frequently used .

		The subject is threadbare , and certainly is unpleas - ant in many ways .

		It may be said , however , that better conditions exist to-day than for - merly , and that it is possible that some routine may be followed that will bring a measure of relief .

		The complaint has been just , that in the be - ginning , and for most of the period , the De - partment stores have offered popular books which were leaders in their time at wholesale prices to retail buyers , and at times at lower prices than they could be bought for by the bookseller .

		The harm came because the book - seller was deprived of his rightful profit on books that were selling freely , and was com - pelled to eke out a living on the items that sold one by one .

		In the
Department	ORGANIZATION	stores the popular books have been sold without profit , and sometimes at a loss , that these books might be used as '' leaders '' or inducements to get patrons to come into their stores .

		A profit was then secured through the customer 's pur - chases of other goods , on which a margin could be made .

		The result was that many men were driven out of the book business , and others were compelled to change the proper methods of a lifetime to meet conditions thus wrongly thrust upon them .

		We pass all the details of this to say that it seems that to-day the book - buying public are using the bookstores more freely ; that they find that the cheaper books offered them are not of the quality that they wish to have in their libraries ; that therefore they seek the better ones where they can be had ; and that many of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	stores are thrown more upon the sales of their '' cheap '' volumes .

		It remains true , however , that every few months a furore is created by some De - 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, partment store offering the particular popular book of the moment at a very low figure , with the resulting demoralization of all local trade in the item itself .

		It looks as though the evil can not be cured wholly , but it also has appeared of late that the tendency is towards less '' cut - ting , '' and that the
Department	ORGANIZATION	stores are find - ing it to their benefit to secure a better average price on even the '' popular '' items .

		In some localities they are even agreeing not to cut prices below an average rate , the latter being quite reasonable by comparison with the ex - treme cuts made before .

		To illustrate the loss entailed on somebody by cut prices , an example might be taken of ``
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' of which 400,000 copies have been sold .

		The retail price of the book is
$ 1.50	MONEY	It sells in many
Department	ORGANIZATION	stores at ... 1.14 When sold at an extreme '' cut '' price has been .

		.81 Which shows a difference per copy of 33 Multiply the whole edition by that difference , and we have a loss of profit of
$ 132,000	MONEY	on that one book alone .

		If the
Department	ORGANIZATION	stores sold half the edition at the cut price named , they have given to the retail buyers
$ 66,000	MONEY	, or if only one-fourth the edition ,
$ 33,000	MONEY	in amount .

		It is not claimed that these quantities are known to have been sold at the lowest price quoted , but the ratio of loss is true , no matter what the quantity may be , and it is manifest folly to sacrifice stock in any such way .

		The parties effecting the larger sale of books , next to the retail bookseller , are the '' Jobbers , '' and of them only carefully chosen words should be said .

		In earlier times , if one should have tried to set down their names , he would have found almost a legion of them .

		Every large city had at least one such dealer who could be classed under that head , since he distinctly made efforts to supply his fellow booksellers with stock that he did not expect to use in his own retailing department .

		To a degree such dealers are still to be found in all sections , but owing to radical changes in the extending of population in some cases , and in the changing of people to larger centres in others , two results have been produced .

		The larger city book - sellers can buy stock in quantities great enough to secure bottom rates , direct from the pub - lishers , thus doing away with the need of the middle-man -LRB- the jobber -RRB- .

		On the other hand , the smaller booksellers have been compelled to look for very small quantities of many pub - lishers ' books from fewer jobbers , and thus the jobbers have temporarily found their number of customers increased and they themselves obliged to keep larger stocks to supply the larger variety of trade catered to .

		It can be seen that this latter method of stocking-up must drive out , as it has , the jobber of smaller means , and permit the one with larger means to take the trade .

		This has come about , and to-day there are comparatively few jobbers in the field .

		Though there are others , essentially the jobbers of to-day are Messrs.
A. C. Mc	PERSON	-
Clurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
The Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
The American News Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and
The H. B. Claflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, and Messrs. De -
Wolfe , Fiske & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		It is to be hoped that these concerns reap a proper re - ward for their toil and risk .

		It is probably the most exhausting branch of the trade , requiring large capital with which to purchase stock , unusual wisdom and discrimination in selecting and buying , and , as can easily be shown , giving but the slightest margin of profit with a very large ratio of risk .

		Truly it requires great courage on the part of new men to enter it , and gives no adequate profit for the expendi - ture of energy and money in conducting it .

		The members of the book trade , as a whole , can thank their good fortune that they are able to secure the services of the painstaking men who now supply their wants in this line , and they should pay them liberally for the efforts they put forth to fill their orders .


JOHN H. DINGMAN	PERSON	.

		AMERICAN LIBRARIES .

		The present status of American Libraries , and their significance and value in our busy life , can best be understood by a brief glance at their development .

		The school and the library have been closely connected as a part of our educational equipment , and have come up through stages of development which are closely parallel .

		We have , broadly speaking , first , the college and other institutions for higher education ; second , the private and endowed schools for secondary education ; and finally the free pub - lic school .

		On the other hand , from the be - ginning , we have had the college and other special libraries for the scholar ; then came the proprietary and subscription library , of the type of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Library Company , founded in
1732	DATE	; and finally the Library free to all , of which the oldest is the
Boston	LOCATION	Public
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 347 Library , founded in
1852	DATE	.

		Thus the college library is as old as the college itself , the first being that of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
1636	DATE	; the subscription library is well along in its second century ; and the public library is a little less than a half century old .

		The first general statistics of libraries in
America	LOCATION	were published by the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	in
1876	DATE	.

		At that time there were 12,000,000 volumes in 2,500 libraries .

		In
1896	DATE	there were 33,000,000 in 4,000 ; and , as we know that the growth has been rapid since that time , it is fair to assume that there are now in the libraries of the country about 40,000,000 volumes .

		This wonderful growth has been due in part to fostering legislation .

		Until recently this was mainly permissive , granting charters , and authorizing but not requiring the levy of taxes for library support .

		Some recent legislation gives active assistance by means of State Li - brary Commissions and travelling libraries , and finally , in
1895	DATE	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	passed the first law making the establishment and support of libraries compulsory , thus putting them on the same footing as the schools .

		The growth of libraries has been much promoted by many generous benefactions .

		Notable among these are the
Astor	LOCATION	,
Lenox	LOCATION	, and
Tilden	PERSON	gifts , now united in one founda - tion as the
New York	LOCATION	Public Library ; the gift of
John Crerar	PERSON	,
$ 3,000,000	MONEY	, and of
W. N. Newberry	PERSON	,
$ 2,000,000	MONEY	, to
Chicago	LOCATION	; of
George Peabody	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1,400,000	MONEY	, and of
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	,
$ 1,200,000	MONEY	, to
Baltimore	LOCATION	; and of Benjamin Rush ,
$ 1,500,000	MONEY	, to
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia .

		Far exceeding any of these in amount are the many gifts of Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	.

		In addition to his numerous previous donations and foundations , Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has given since the beginning of
1899	DATE	about
$ 7,000,000	MONEY	as his contribution to library extension in
America	LOCATION	.

		Most of the gifts mentioned have been made within the past twenty years , and in addition to these we might enumerate a score of others varying from
$ 50,000	MONEY	to
$ 500,000	MONEY	, and many smaller ones .

		This rapid growth of the older collections has required , and has in part received , more adequate housing .

		Twenty years ago the old
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	building was regarded as one of the best library buildingrs in the / o country , the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	occupied quarters in the
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	had poorly lighted rooms in the
Capitol	LOCATION	, crowded to the last degree of incon - venience .

		Now the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	, which is really the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, and should be so designated , occupies one of the most noble structures on the face of the planet , by far the largest and finest building ever erected for library purposes .


Boston	LOCATION	has front - ing on
Copley Square	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	looking out on the lake front , the greatest Public Li - brary buildings in the country .

		The cost of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	building was
$ 6,300	MONEY	, - 000 ; that of
Boston	LOCATION	cost
$ 2,300,000	MONEY	; and that of
Chicago	LOCATION	$ 2,000,000 ; in round numbers , ex - clusive of the sites .

		Milwaukee has just com - pleted a building costing
$ 500,000	MONEY	; and in various cities , East and West , are library build - ings costing from
$ 100,000	MONEY	to
$ 300,000	MONEY	.

		The most noteworthy American college library building is that of
Columbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , occupying a commanding location on
Morningside Heights	LOCATION	, overlooking the great city and the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		It was the gift of the president of the university , as a memorial of his father .

		Princeton ,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, and other uni - versities and colleges , have fine modern build - ings .

		All of those mentioned , with the excep - tion of the last one , have been completed within the past ten years .

		I have thus far spoken only of that which is outward and visible , the buildings , the books , the financial support .

		This wonderful increase in these material and measurable things has been accompanied by a scarcely less wonderful development and improvement of methods , an enlargement of the library field in extent , and an increase in the variety and value of its vari - ous activities .

		A comparison will best show this .

		Less than twenty years ago , when the first meeting of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	was held , the need of any special training for library work was not yet recognized , nor was there any provision for it .

		Now there are four well established library schools , those of the
State University of New York	ORGANIZATION	, the State Uni - versity of
Illinois	LOCATION	, the
Pratt	PERSON	and the
Drexel Institutes	ORGANIZATION	.

		These give courses of one , or two years , devoted exclusively to the study of library methods , and the necessary technical training .

		Their graduates may be found in libraries in all parts of the country , and they have had great influence in elevating the standard of library work .

		When the
first Association	ORGANIZATION	meeting was held , most librarians were using their own methods of charging , classification , and cataloguing , many of them cumbrous , un - reliable , and ineffective .

		There were no rec - ognized standards , or generally approved meth - 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ods .

		Now , the principles of library accounting are as well understood , and taught as definitely and exactly , as commercial book-keeping .

		Now there are approved systems of library classifi - cation , to which guides are published , and which are generally adopted .

		Then , however broad and thorough the scholarship of the cat - aloguer , much of his work failed to reach its full measure of usefulness from the lack of a well understood plan .

		Now systematic work , according to carefully devised rules , gives cer - tainty and uniformity of result , and much greater usefulness .

		Libraries of all classes have taken part in making these great improve - ments and have shared in their benefits .

		Along with this development of method has come another still more important change , that from a comparatively passive condition to one of great activity .

		The older librarian was well content to wait for people to come to him .

		The modern librarian attracts people to the library , or sends it to them .

		The older libra - rian thought the full measure of his duty con - sisted in taking care of the library , opening it at certain hours , and permitting people to use it , as well as they were able , under regulations which were often serious restrictions .

		The whole tendency has been toward greater free - dom , and attractiveness , and usefulness for the largest possible number .

		In college libraries this tendency has shown itself in less rigid rules , longer hours of open - ing , extending the use of the library to others than their own students , and in the introduc - tion of the seminar .

		In public libraries the hours have been .

		in - creased to suit the convenience of readers ; the age limit for children has been lowered or en - tirely removed , and much is done in other ways to make the library useful to the young .

		Special rooms for children , both for reading and for the issue of books , are an essential part of our modern equipment .

		Children 's needs and tastes are studied , and special col - lections of books and reading lists prepared for them .

		Bulletin boards , with pictures , and read - ing lists upon the various holidays , and other timely topics are posted .

		Children 's Library Leagues for promoting the care for and read - ing of good books , are organized in many cities .

		Close relations are maintained with the schools .

		The librarian is informed as to the courses of study , and part of the buying is di - rected to meet the needs of both teacher and pupil , for collateral reading .

		Books are issued both from the library direct and from deposits in the school buildings .

		The library also sup - plies the needs of the various clubs for literary work .

		Another important change has been in the direction of allowing greater freedom of access to the shelves of the circulating departments of our larger libraries .

		Formerly these were scrupulously closed off from the public rooms , and it was necessary to select from a catalogue and wait for the book to be brought by an at - tendant , as is , unfortunately , still the practice in a majority of our large libraries .

		In a few , however , of the largest and most successful city libraries , the shelves of the circulating departments have been thrown open with the greatest freedom to all borrowers and readers , with the most favorable results .

		The increased value of a library conducted on this plan can - not be estimated .

		Twenty years ago the sug - gestion that the shelves of a large city library might be thrown open to all users , would have been regarded as visionary , impracticable , and altogether undesirable .

		Now it is generally accepted by librarians as a desirable thing , and with proper building arrangements , and with certain obvious exceptions , is regarded as en - tirely feasible .

		I have spoken in this of the circulating departments especially , as greater freedom is generally permitted in the reference departments .

		The work of subscription and proprietary libraries has shared some of the changes noted above .

		It has occurred in many instances that a subscription library has been changed into a free library .

		Another important extension of the work has been in the establishment of branches and sta - tions in our cities and larger towns .

		The reason for this is obviously the same as that which dots our cities with school-houses .

		It is as impossible for people from all sections of a great city to get any adequate supply of books from one main library , as it would be for them to send their children all to one school ; hence , the necessity for the branch or station .

		It is a positive injustice to tax a whole city for library purposes , without providing reasonably equal facilities for its different sections .

		Another important phase of library exten - sion is the work of library commissions in giv - ing advice and active help to libraries already established , or by lending travelling libraries , which meet an immediate need in some special neighborhood , and often lead to the establish - ment of permanent libraries .

		If I have dwelt principally in the forego - ing on public library work , it is because that
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 seems to be so broad as to include in some of its phases , if the work is thoroughly done and all its possibilities understood , all library work .

		The librarian of the village , of the university , and of the city , despite the differ - ence of circumstance , have recognized the essential unity of their work ; and it is this recognition which has rendered possible that cordial cooperation among all librarians that has brought about th.e improvements in meth - ods , and the enlargement and success of the work .

		Let us sum up briefly the results of the past twenty years .

		During that period libraries have much more than doubled in volume , that is , they have made a larger growth than in all the previous years of their history .

		All of the greater library buildings in the country have been built within that time .

		The income for library purposes has greatly increased .

		The most valuable laws providing for library exten - sion have been passed within that time .

		A great share of all the large library donations have been made within that time , and a large proportion within a very few years .

		While it has been a period of growth it has been just as definitely a period of organization , a period in which systems have been devised , and stand - ards fixed .

		We have thus far dealt with the material and systematic phases of library growth , but even more important is it to inquire what has been the spirit and tendency of the work , what is its value and significance in the life of to-day , and what are its possibilities .

		The practical reason for the maintenance of libraries is the same as that for schools , namely , the necessity of education for a self-governing people .

		Libraries , like schools , are educational institutions , whose work tends to make better citizens .

		This is the only sufficient reason for their public support , the only strong attraction for private beneficence .

		They do this by fur - nishing books which give practical instruction in the arts of life , which inform as to civic duties , which appeal to the emotions and feed the intellectual and spiritual nature .

		They are broader than the schools in this scope , as they begin with the children , go with them through school and college , and give them the oppor - tunity to carry their education through life .

		The underlying motive , the compelling force , which has induced this open-handed expendi - ture of money , this intelligent and faithful work , is a generous free spirit , ever seeking to enlarge the area of freedom and enlightenment , earnest , active , and aggressive , with the kindly aggressiveness of the missionary .

		Within the past twenty years , libraries have come to fill a much larger place in our social life in many ways .

		The location of the new library of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, as the centre of the group of university buildings , is significant of the place the college library is coming to occupy as the centre of college life and activity .

		So the public library should , and I believe will , become the centre of the intellectual life of the city , the common meeting-ground , the store - house and study for all who are active for the welfare of the city in any of its various inter - ests .

		It will furnish rooms for scientific and literary societies and study clubs , and will give facilities for all educational work not provided for by the regular schools with which it will work in close harmony .

		The ` great growth of libraries during the past two decades has been a rapidly accelerating one , greater in the past few years than ever before .

		If this continues , the growth of the first twenty years of the next century will be much greater than the past .

		This will mean grander opportunities , more weighty responsibilities .

		As the success of the past has clearly been due to the cooperation of librarians with each other , so the greater work of the library in the future may be done by bringing about a broader cooperation .

		In ad - dition to its own direct work for education , may it not offer a common meeting-ground , and bring about a closer cooperation of all the forces which make for the betterment of social conditions , for higher civilization ?


WILLIAM H. BRETT	PERSON	.

		AMERICAN PERIODICALS .

		When one is asked , as I have been , to write of periodical literature , and especially about American periodicals of the twenty years dur - ing which THE DIAL has existed , one has a vision of a multitudinous swarm buzzing out from the press rooms .

		Some of them are ephemera and some come to stay with us .

		There are glimpses of illustrations , rude and good ; pen and ink drawings of lay figures which seem to have been cut out with the jag - gedest blade of an old jack-knife ; wash draw - ings of merit and demerit , occasionally leering towards the realm of
Anthony Comstock	PERSON	; much red , yellow , blue , and green ; and occa - sionally nothing but letterpress .

		So many have come and gone !

		A list of them would 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, make dreary reading unless it could be accom - panied by the secret history of some of the failures , in which event it might be amusing although it would of tener be pathetic ; for al - most all these efforts are sincere and many of them worthy endeavors to command success .

		Most of them , it is true , seek simply the mys - terious pathway to the public 's pocket .

		Their founders and conductors are ready to do any - thing to gratify what they think is the public taste , or lack of taste .

		They will flash upon the ignorant eye in color vivid enough to de - stroy a very fine optic nerve , or they will con - duct youth behind the scenes whither the vul - gar young are always ready , perhaps eager , to be led .

		Clever men will prostitute their tal - ents , and seemingly respectable men will sell their consciences and principles in order to find that mazy pathway .

		It seems to be the faith of the second-rates that large and profit - able circulations must be gained by spicing torpid minds into activity the pleasure of any emotion or of anything like an intellectual sensation being so unusual , and therefore so attractive , to large numbers of the community that they are willing to pay many small sums for it .

		The public is a good deal above these second-rates , however , as we shall see in our brief progress .

		It may be true enough that the largest circulations are gained by intellec - tual pandering , but it does not follow that pandering is the most profitable form of edi - torial , or even of publishing , activity .

		There are vulgar periodicals , and books , too , in - deed there is no monopoly of vulgarity and ig - norance in the realms of literature , that have a basis , or a grain , of sound sense or of useful - ness like a column of useful household sug - gestions , or an occasional intelligent opinion , and perhaps the makers of these would be as - tonished to know how large a part of the popu - larity of their product is due to its utility or its integrity .

		It is not true , of course , that all who are earning the wages of debasement whether the degradation be ethical or aesthetic are thereby selling intellects or consciences .

		There are some who are just dull , and these occasionally are moved by the environment of respectability into which they have been born , or married , to endeavor to be important .

		They produce for their social atmosphere , as the vulgarians produce for theirs , and with the same unconsciousness of the existence of any region of mental or moral activity outside of that of their own vestry room , or debating club , or sewing circle .

		Their editorial per - formance is imparted by the spirit of the vicin - age , like their religious observances , their serious church-going faces and walking sticks .

		Think as they may about it , however , their conduct is not nearly so respectable as that of the sixteenth century Italian cynics who used to thrust their tongues into their cheeks of
Sunday	DATE	mornings and remark to one another : '' Come , let us conform to the popular error ! ''

		But what ineffable attainder of wrong and in - jury has their dull efforts worked !

		From how many promising minds has the light been ex - cluded because of the repulsive dullness of their attempted importance !

		Having uttered this by way of notice of the vulgar ephemera , and other commercial de - signs upon the public pocket , I shall proceed to say what I think is the prevailing evidence of these twenty years as to the tendency of periodical literature .

		It is difficult to com - press a large collection of facts into a short definition , and I can not enter into critical com - parisons for fear that lack of space may lead not only to seeming but to real injustices .

		The obvious fact , however , in the history of peri - odicals of the last twenty years , is that there is in this country an increasing demand for sound information and discussion on literature , art , the bewildering achievements of modern sci - ence , and on public questions .

		The story magazine we know .

		It existed before
1880	DATE	; and the story-telling weekly ex - isted then , too , but as it was then it has largely gone .

		Perhaps it is because the ten-cent maga - zines give so much more for so much less that the ''
New York	LOCATION	Ledger '' has become a month - ly , while some of its old-time associates are not making so much noise as we once heard from them .

		There are better stories now than we used to have , and the new romancers , who write on history instead of hasheesh , are not only more improving , but are much more en - tertaining .

		The weekly story paper must be still in demand , however strongly convinced Mr.
Bonner	PERSON	was that the seventh day periodi - cal had outlived its time , for we have the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post , '' of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and it is flourishing .

		This change in the weekly field is also due to the appearance of the
Sunday	DATE	illustrated annex to the daily news - paper .

		It is ambitiously dubbed a
Sunday	DATE	magazine and it is , in most cases , a veritable magazine of explosives , dimly related to art and letters , and possessing some of the noxious effects of lyddite , if one may compare imma - terial to material stenches .

		There are some
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL \ 351 illustrated supplements , it is true , not open to the lyddite charge .

		They have been made possible by the development of the cheap pro- cesses by means of which photography has be - come so essentially the basis of modern illus - trative work .

		Cheap paper and cheap pictures are the causes of these weekly efforts on the part of the daily press , and there is little com - plaint to be made of some of them .

		When the '' color schemes '' of some of the
Sunday	DATE	spectacles are worked out , perhaps they will all be tolerable .

		For one thing we shall have eventually to thank them ; they will greatly advance the art of making the illustrated weeklies like ``
Harper	PERSON	's , '' ``
Collier	PERSON	's , '' and ``
Leslie	PERSON	's . ''

		These papers must go back to the artist , and some of them are already show - ing evidence that they recognize the fact that they can compete with the illustrated supple - ments only in quality .

		It is not , however , in these periodical pre - sentations of the arts that please the eye and the fancy , that the interesting movement in periodical literature has taken place .

		When THE DIAL was born , the
New York	LOCATION	'' Nation '' was easily the first among the weekly papers of the country , easily first in its knowledge of its subjects , in the great ability with which it dis - cussed the political , social , economic , literary , and artistic questions of the time .

		Nothing so thorough or so clever as its book reviews had been regularly published in this country .

		Here was a journal of which we could all be proud , even in our wrath , and even when we rejoiced in discovering that it was not infallible .

		It be - came the fashion .

		People who liked good read - ing on important subjects took it and enjoyed it , and people who liked to be in the intellect - ual fashion cut its leaves and had it on the centre table .

		Therefore it paid dividends , and became an inspiration and example to editors and publishers who had not otherwise attained to a comprehension of the richness of the in - tellectual mine .

		The '' Nation '' exists to-day , and is as interesting as it would be had it still a separate and an independent life , but , unfor - tunately for its urban influence at least , it is largely a re-print of the ''
New York	LOCATION	Evening Post , '' so that the feast it has to offer is in the nature of a rechauffee .

		The '' Nation 's '' influence has been of sur - prising value , and it supplements the wonder - fully increased activity of the universities and colleges .

		When we reflect that there now come about as many graduates each year from these institutions as there used to be undergraduates in all four classes
thirty years ago	DATE	, we ought readily to understand why so many periodicals are seeing and realizing the advantage of en - deavoring to attract the friendship and support of minds that do not need spice to arouse them into action .

		There is now an encouraging rec - ognition of the public 's demand for intelligent presentation of the important facts and ques - tions of the world 's current history .

		It shows that editors and publishers are not really very far behind the educated public , as well as that the educated public is increasing in numbers and exactions .

		Within the twenty years , the old and new monthlies , the '' Century , '' '' Har - per 's , '' '' Scribner 's , '' the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' the '' Cos - mopolitan , '' and ''
McClure	PERSON	's , '' have been con - sidering subjects which are topics of the daily press , and which are important .

		But this reach - ing out after subjects that , in the horrible and horrifying modern English , are called `` newsy , '' is best shown by some of the important of the re - ligious weeklies , like the '' Independent , '' the '' Outlook , '' and the '' Churchman . ''

		Doubtless there is quite as much of essential piety in these papers as when they were almost exclu - sively conveyers of church news and theological speculation .

		There is distinctly less of sermon - izing in them and much less of spiritual theor - izing .

		The truth is recognized that a large number of good people want to know what is going on in the world that is of real interest and real importance .

		Some of them live be - yond the boundaries of the daily paper .

		Some do not like the confusion of the large daily , or its idea of the relative importance of crime and lechery to the really momentous achievements and questionings of men .

		They like the clear statement and sound perspective of the events of the week , which they find in these weekly papers , and they like also clear and well-con - sidered discussion .

		There is no doubt that the periodical litera - ture of the country has greatly increased in im - portance , and what we call weight , in the last twenty years , and that the tendency is towards still greater importance .

		The growth in liter - ary and scientific periodical literature is clear evidence of this .

		Now we have THE DIAL it - self , of which I must speak , however much I may dislike to flatter it to its very face , but its successful existence , in a field little known in the
East	LOCATION	, hardly known at all twenty years ago , is a revelation , a most gratifying revelation , of the profit awaiting those who are willing and capable of doing serious work for the edi - fication of people who know books , and who 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, want to read intelligent discussion and clear thinking on topics that are worth while that give pleasure and mental and moral stimulation to rational beings .

		In
New York	LOCATION	we have the '' Critic , '' the '' Book Buyer , '' and the '' Book - man , '' and the
Saturday	DATE	supplement of the '' Times , '' giving us news and gossip of liter - ary men and women and criticism of what they have done .

		And in different paths than that of pure literature and science , in the plastic arts , in painting , in architecture , in economics , we have a periodical literature that 1 venture to say could not have found needed sustenance in the days of more than twenty years ago .

		The spirit of the times , so far as periodical lit - erature is concerned , seems to me to be repre - sented by the '' Review of Reviews , '' which stands for something more than the '' quick - lunch-for-busy-men '' principle , although that feature of it is of sound material , the best that the markets , domestic and foreign , afford .

		We have a whole host of magazines and weeklies informing and teaching us as to special and general interests like the '' Political Science Quarterly , '' '' Journal of Economics , '' '' Popu - lar Science Monthly , '' `` Science , '' the `` Forum , '' the revivified `` North American Review , '' '' Good Government , '' and the '' International Monthly . ''

		The very existence of these , the success of many of them , show that the tend - ency of periodical literature in our day is to - wards the satisfaction of a distinctly higher and finer standard than was dreamed of by most of the magazines and weeklies of twenty years ago .

		Perhaps if any subjects are demand - ing more attention than others , they are those of political administration , of good government , of municipal socialism , and of economics as they relate to social and individual prosperity and comfort .

		Notwithstanding the gains of the literary periodicals , the marked growth has been in the literature of practical subjects , and this is in harmony with the national character .

		Periodical literature is taking a livelier and more intelligent interest in the larger affairs of life , and the history of the last twenty years points to a much finer growth for the future , to a notable development of the journals and mag - azines not wholly devoted to practical ques - tions , to more and higher literary and art crit - icism , and to perhaps richer expressions of idealism .

		All of which is full of instruction to the publishers who act on the principle that only the vulgar or the stupid commonplace '' go '' with the American public .

		AMERICAN EDUCATION .

		The years
1880	DATE	and
1900	DATE	have no especial educational significance , except that
1900	DATE	rounds out the century , and so furnishes a fit - ting opportunity to review past history , to summarize results , to take an account of the present situation , and to forecast the future , while
1880	DATE	, of course , we take as a starting point in order to see what progress has been made during THE DIAL 'S twenty years .

		We do not propose , however , to take advantage of this opportunity in any particular sense , but shall use the dates merely as labels , marking two cross sections of the general educational movement of the country that are sufficiently far apart to present data for instructive compar - ison .

		We shall begin with the public schools .

		1879-80 .

		1897-98 .

		Total population 50,155,783 72,737,100 Number of persons 5 to 18 years of age 15,065,767 21,458,294 Number of different pupils enrolled in schools 9,867,505 15,038,636 Per cent of population enrolled .

		19.67 20.68 Per cent of persons 5-18 years of age enrolled 65.50 70.08 Average daily attendance ... 6,144,143 10,286,092 Ratio of same to enrollment .

		.

		62.3 68.4 Average length of school , in days .

		130.3 143.1 Average number of days attended for each person , 5 to 18 years of age 53.1 68.6 Average number for each pupil enrolled 81.1 97.8 Whole number of teachers ... 286,593 409,193 Number of schoolhouses ... 178,222 242,390 Value of school property ...
$ 209,571,718 $ 492,703,781	MONEY	Total receipts 134,194,806 199,317,397 Total expenditures 140,506,715 194,020,470 Average expenditures per capita of population 1.56 2.67 Average expenditure per pupil , in average attendance ... 12.71 18.86 Statistical tables are considered forbidding reading , but such a table as the foregoing is , nevertheless , the most effective way in which to present a comparative view like this .

		While the figures , for the most part , tell their own story , two or three brief remarks may serve a useful purpose .

		It will be seen at once that the cross-sections are not twenty years , but only eighteen years , apart .

		Unfortunately for our purpose , the sta - tistics for the current year will not be available until sometime late in
1901	DATE	, or possibly until
1902	DATE	.

		But if we assume that the gains of 1898-1900 equal those of 1896-98 , which is certainly a reasonable assumption , we shall close the century with 244,700 .

		schoolhouses and 418,000 teachers ; 15,700,000 pupils enrolled in the schools and an average daily attendance
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 of 10,825,000 ; an annual school income of 1206,230,000 and an expenditure of
$ 203	MONEY	, - 587,000 .

		The total common school expendi - ture of the country is now increasing at the rate of about
$ 5,000,000	MONEY	a year .

		Dangerous fallacies lurk in comparative sta - tistics unless great care is taken in selecting and combining them .

		Undoubtedly our edu - cational statistics have improved in quality since
1880	DATE	, and this improvement has tended in one way to increase and in another way to diminish the aggregates .

		On the whole , however , there is no reason to think that the comparison presented in the table is not a fair one .

		Moreover , the improved methods of collecting and sifting statistics are one of the improvements that have been made in educational science .

		The tests usually applied to such tables as the above show that the minor movements within the whole movement are in the right direction .

		The per cents of persons between 5 and 18 years of age enrolled in the schools , the ratio of average daily attendance to such enrollment , the average length of the school year , the average number of days attendance for each person between the ages of 5 and 18 , the average amount of schooling received per pupil , and the school expenditures per capita for both the total population and the average number of pupils attending , all show a healthy increase .

		The facts point to the increasing wealth of the country , and to an en - hanced interest in education .

		The
Commis	PERSON	- sioner of Education points out the fact that the gratifying '' increase in the length of the school year keeps pace with the growth of large villages and cities . '' ''

		Urban populations , '' he says , '' have a school session of nine or ten months , while rural districts have three or four months , or at the highest six months .

		But this view must not be pressed to the point of assum - ing that rural communities have not length - ened their terms of school .

		For example , the school term grew in
North Carolina	LOCATION
19	DATE	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	13 ,
Georgia	LOCATION	42 ,
Tennessee	LOCATION	22 ,
Louis	LOCATION	- iana 15 ,
Texas	LOCATION	19 , days in the year .

		The amount of schooling furnished in these States as measured by the length of the term is still painfully small ; but perhaps as much progress has been made as could reasonably have been expected .

		Equal gains were not to be looked for in the old States of the North , as their school terms were already well extended .

		In another respect the South shows to advantage in comparison with the North .

		The per
cents	MONEY	of population from 5 to 18 years of age in - creased in all the
South Atlantic	LOCATION	and
South Central States	LOCATION	, in
Arkansas	LOCATION	considerably more than doubling ; while in the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	and
North Central States	LOCATION	such per cents actu - ally fell off in many cases , and in none did much more than to hold their own .

		That con - siderable gains were not made is intelligible enough ; but that a loss noticeable in degree should occur in such a State as
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has never been adequately explained .

		Perhaps it is due in part to the very improvement of the schools an increasing number of the children obtaining their elementary education at an earlier age than before .

		When we pass to the average expenditure per capita of the population , and of the pupil , based on the average daily attendance , the comparison is not so reassuring .

		It is true that many States of the Old South more than doubled such ex - penditures , but so did many States at the North .

		Possibly an advance from
27 cents	MONEY	to
53 cents	MONEY	per capita of the population in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, or from 31 to
84 cents	MONEY	in
Georgia	LOCATION	, all things considered , is as significant as an advance from
$ 2.80	MONEY	to
$ 5.07	MONEY	in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, or from
$ 1.90	MONEY	to
$ 4.12	MONEY	in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; but the large ratio is overlooked in the small terms .

		In
1880	DATE	the school expenditure per capita of school population of the sixteen former Slave States and the District of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	approxi - mately classified by races was , white
$ 2,76	MONEY	, colored
$ 1.09	MONEY	.

		In
1898	DATE	the same averages were
$ 4.01	MONEY	and
$ 2.34	MONEY	.

		One of the promising movements of the times is the concentration of rural schools in sparsely populated districts at central points , such as elegible villages , which has been going on in some of the old States , whereby the peculiar advantages of the urban graded school are secured for country children ; but this movement has not assumed proportions that sensibly affect the average length of the school year , or the attendance per cent .

		The com - parative merits of the township and the district types of school organization have been under discussion throughout the period , with a steady inclination of the argument to the former ; but the practical progress that has been made in this direction has by no means been commen - surate with the discussion .

		The opinion that our methods of school ad - ministration need to be radically changed , at least in cities of considerable size , has gone abroad very widely .

		The large school board that does a great amount of the executive work which a school system requires through 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, its own standing committees , has fallen into much disfavor , and even contempt , and the small board with limited powers acting through expert executive officers is strongly preferred by the most competent judges .

		In several cities , as
New Haven	LOCATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	,
Toledo	LOCATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, the new ideas , in whole or part , have been enacted into law , and are now undergoing the test of expe - rience .

		In other cities , as
Boston	LOCATION	,
Detroit	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, strenuous efforts have not , so far , been able to effect the desired reform .

		It is much easier to deal with education ob - jectively than subjectively ; and it is never easy to extract from statistics their moral signifi - cance .

		Still , undoubted progress has been made in the subjective elements , if not as much as in the objective ones .

		The average course of elementary study has been somewhat changed for the better , and methods of teaching some - what improved .

		Instruction has been made less verbal and more real , as is shown by the extension or introduction of nature studies and manual training .

		Less stress is laid upon for - mal Grammar and Arithmetic than formerly , and more time is found for language-lessons , literature , and history .

		Teachers are slowly emancipating themselves from the old slavery to the text-book , and are gaining larger con - trol of their own minds .

		To sum up the total effect so far of child-study upon the schools would be an impossible task .

		Something we may carry to the credit of the movement .

		Moreover , when child-study has exchanged its high '' scientific '' methods for common sense , and has ceased to be a fad , it will contribute materially to our culture , but far more as a method reacting upon the minds of teachers than as a body of definitely ascertained acts or a system of doctrine .

		Slow changes have been going on in the teaching force .

		At the earlier period , 42.8 per cent , of the public school teachers were men ; at the later period only 32.2 .

		Women teach - ers have been steadily gaining ground in parts of the country where they were not formerly held in high esteem , as in the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Mixed consequences flow from the change .

		In some communities the employment of more women means higher culture and better char - acter in the teaching force ; in other commu - nities , it means a distinct loss of power in the schoolroom .

		Something depends upon the rela - tive number of men and women found in the schools , as well as upon the educational and per - sonal qualifications of candidates applying for teachers ' positions .

		When the average per cent , of men teachers in any
State	ORGANIZATION	falls below 20 , it is time to remember that men as well as women are needed in fair proportion in the schools .

		The evidence that the preparation of com - mon school teachers is improving , is convinc - ing .

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	has shown that from
1880	DATE	to
1897	DATE	the enrollment in public normal schools increased from about 10,000 to over 40,000 , or fourfold , and in private normal schools from 2,000 to 24,000 , or twelvefold .

		At the first date there were 240 normal students in every million of our population ; in
1897	DATE	there were 976 in every million .

		In the same period the total number of teachers increased from 280 , - 094 to 403,333 , or 44 per cent .

		Something has been done to improve the teachers ' tenure of office .

		In
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, for instance , after the teacher has passed a suitable novitiate he is elected for good behavior .

		The average term of service in a particular school , and the average period of service , are both lengthening .

		A number of cities have taken measures to establish teachers ' pension funds ; but unfortunately these measures have some - times been taken so clumsily that there is reason to fear that the school authorities will be obliged to go backward before they can go forward .

		It was not until ten years ago that the
Bu	ORGANIZATION	- reau of Education attempted to obtain returns from high schools that were outside of cities .

		In
1890	DATE	only 2,526 such schools , with 202,963 pupils enrolled , reported ; in
1898	DATE	the number had increased to 5,315 schools , with 459,813 pupils .

		Well may the Commissioner call this increase '' phenomenal . ''

		Still , the number of pupils he holds to be somewhat too small , as there are many secondary pupils outside the completely organized high schools whom there are no means of reaching .

		Still more ,
1990	DATE	private schools high schools , academies , pre - paratory schools , etc. furnished instruction to 166,302 pupils .

		The grand totals are , therefore , 7,305 secondary schools reporting and 626,111 pupils .

		Or if we add the sup - posed pupils in public schools not reported , we have a total of 650,000 .

		Students in commer - cial schools still remain outside the list .

		The secondary pupils were 3.75 per cent , of the aggregate enrollment in schools of all kinds , not mentioning the miscellaneous schools to be named farther on .

		In the high schools we meet an intimation of one of the most significant facts in our re - cent history ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the increasing number of women who are seeking the higher education .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 The pupils enrolled in the public schools , high schools included , were thus divided between the two sexes : males , 7,643,496 ; females , 7,395,514 .

		But in the public high schools alone the division was : males , 189,188 , females , 260,413 ; while in all the schools re - porting secondary pupils , there were 284,379 males to 341,736 females .

		The various secondary schools graduated 65,170 pupils , or nearly 12 per cent , of the total number enrolled .

		The pupils who were preparing for college were 77,559 , or about 14 per cent , of the total number .

		But of the graduates , 19,940 , or nearly 31 per cent. , had prepared for college .

		Confining the view to the public high schools , about 10 per cent , of the males and 12 per cent , of the females grad - uated , or 19,247 of the one sex , and 33,775 of the other ; while 13.5 per cent , of the males and 9.75 per cent , of the girls , or 25,627 and 25,425 , respectively , were preparing for col - lege .

		Again , of the graduates the correspond - ing per cents were 34.8 and 23.25 , and the corresponding numbers 6,699 and 7,853 .

		It is significant that while the total number of students preparing in public higher schools for college is all the time increasing , the propor - tion of such students to the total number taught in such schools is all the time falling off .

		In
1890	DATE	the latter per cent , was 14.44 ; in
1898	DATE	it had fallen to 11.36 .

		These per cents , taken in connection with other facts , show conclusively that for eight years , at least , secondary education grew much more rapidly than higher education .

		And yet higher educa - tion made a remarkable growth , as we shall soon show .

		The last observation calls up the twin func - tions of American high schools to fit one class of students for active life and another class for college .

		These schools are undoubt - edly growing more rapidly in the one direc - tion than in the other .

		They are emphasizing the people 's college idea more than the fitting school idea .

		This fact is somewhat accentuat - ing the old difficulty of so constituting courses of study as to make them answer , or well answer , both purposes .

		This problem , along with other related problems , has engaged the earnest attention of some of our ablest educa - tors .

		The
Committee of Ten on Secondary Education	ORGANIZATION	and the
Committee on College Entrance Requirements	ORGANIZATION	have both grappled with important phases of the general subject , and with good results .

		In these discussions , the purely secondary school view , or high school view , has received the recognition that it never received before .

		Hitherto secondary teachers have been an un influential body com - pared with secondary teachers in the leading countries of
Europe	LOCATION	; they are still , no doubt , inferior to them in this particular ; but they are now becoming a strong , as well as a numerous , host .

		College professors should at once face the fact , if they have not already done so , that college entrance requirements will exert much less influence upon secondary schools in the future than in the past .

		The relative number of students in colleges at different times , compared with the whole population , has fluctuated very considerably .

		In
1870	DATE	President
Barnard	PERSON	, of
Columbia Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , showed that the ratio of
New England	LOCATION	alone at four different periods was as follows :
1826	DATE	, 1 to 1,513 ;
1838	DATE	, 1 to 1,294 ;
1855	DATE	, 1 to 1,689 ;
1869	DATE	, 1 to 1,927 .

		From
1838	DATE	to
1869	DATE	, while the college ratio was falling off , the population of
New England	LOCATION	increased more that 50 per cent .

		A similar declension , Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	claims , had taken place all over the country , and his analysis of the
New York	LOCATION	statistics sustains the claim with respect to that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		These conclusions have never been impeached .

		Fortunately , however , things soon took a turn for the better .

		The
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, in his last Re - port , printed a table showing that the num - ber of students to a million of the popula - tion increased as follows from
1872	DATE	to
1898	DATE	: Undergraduate , collegiate , and technical stu - dents , from 573 to 1,193 ; graduate students , from 5 to 74 ; law students , from 49 to 163 ; medical students , from 142 to 328 ; theo - logical students , from 83 to 117 .

		The total increase was from 852 to 1,875 .

		It is not easy to discover all the causes that enter into such changes as the fluctuations in relative college attendance present to our view .

		Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	was convinced that the general adherence of colleges to the old rigid course of study had much to do with the losses from
1838	DATE	to
1869	DATE	.

		The traditionary type of col - lege education had ceased to meet , he con - tended , the demands of American society ; and he found proof of his statements in the growth of institutions where modern studies received more encouragement and where a liberal elec - tion of studies was allowed .

		He pointed to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Cornell Universities	ORGANIZATION	and
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	to enforce his argu - ments .

		Were Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	still living , he would no doubt find a clear demonstration of 356 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, his view in the later developments , and he would apparently have a perfect right to do so .

		It is certainly a significant fact that the recent extraordinary growth of the number of students attending the higher schools has ac - companied , or followed hard upon , the general modification of the old college curriculum with respect to range of studies , composition of courses , freedom of elections , and the relaxa - tion of other requirements .

		The total amount of money invested in uni - versities and colleges and schools of technology in
1898	DATE	was
$ 311,842,000	MONEY	.

		The benefactions for the year were
$ 8,204,000	MONEY	.

		All told , there were 144,477 students enrolled in the higher institutions , including professional schools 108,695 men and 35,782 women .

		In the five great sections of the Union the ratios of popu - lation to a college student were as follows :
North Atlantic States	LOCATION	, 714 ;
South Atlantic States	LOCATION	, 1,030 ;
South Central States	LOCATION	, 1,237 ;
North Central States	LOCATION	, 716 ;
Western States	LOCATION	, 532 .

		The most striking fact that appears in the college statistics of the period is the prodigious growth of the strong , and especially of the great , institutions .


Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	and
Wes	PERSON	- leyan
University	ORGANIZATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, together increased their students from 264 to 409 .


Yale College	ORGANIZATION	increased hers from 687 to 1,724 .


Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	grew from 339 to 369 ;
Williams Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege from 227 to 359 ;
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	from 886 to 2,240 .


Brown University	ORGANIZATION	advanced from 247 to 759 .

		The stronger State univer - sities of the West made similar gains .

		The
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	leaped from 521 to 1,534 in eighteen years ; its three leading com - petitors , if we may trust the tables , actually fell from 395 to 343 .


Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	in - creased four-fold ,
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	three-fold .

		These statistics , it should be re - marked , include proper college students only .

		The meaning of the facts just presented is easily read .

		They show the great advantage that the strong institutions have in prestige , strong faculties , and abundant resources , over the small ones .

		What will the end be ?

		is a question which many of the smaller colleges and universities are now asking themselves with some misgivings as to the answer .

		Full and accurate statistics of attendance upon private schools are hard ` to obtain , except in the well educated and highly policed states of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
1898	DATE	the Commissioner re - ported 1,554,725 pupils enrolled in private and incorporated schools of all kinds , to 15 , - 132,918 in public schools and institutions .

		Estimation , however , played a great part in the first of these results .

		The ratio of the one number to the other is a little more than 9 to 100 , while the Commissioner holds 15 to 100 to be the normal standard of the country .

		In
1898	DATE	the relative attendance upon private schools had already begun to increase , and since that year it has no doubt made consider - able progress toward the normal standard .

		All things considered , the prosperity of the pri - vate schools of the country is perhaps the best educational criterion that we have of the busi - ness state of the country .

		Besides the pupils and students now enumerated , the Commissioner found 485,292 other pupils attending schools of a miscellaneous character that can not be described .

		Adding this number to the pre - ceding number , we have a grand total of 17 , - 172,935 persons enrolled in schools of some kind at some time during the year .

		The ratio to the estimated population was practically 17 to 72 , or 1 to 4 .

		Such are a few of the many interesting phases that American education presents for the last twenty years .

		Perhaps they have not all been wisely preferred to others which could readily be made .

		Perhaps disproportionate stress has been placed upon external and quan - titative features , as we Americans are some - times charged with doing .

		The writer denies , however , most emphatically , that he is forget - ful of the object of education , and guards him - self against possible misapprehension with the further remark that great progress has un - doubtedly been made in subjective or qualita - tive elements .

		Defects in our national educa - tion are both numerous and serious ; but , upon the whole , the showing for twenty years is dis - tinctly encouraging .

		At the close , a word may well be given to the growth of educational associations and societies of one sort and another .

		The growth of many of these bodies in numbers and influ - ence is among the greatest surprises of the period .

		For example , an attendance of 10,000 members contributing to the treasury upon an annual meeting of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, is not now at all unusual .

		What is more to the purpose , however , is the contribu - tion to real educational progress that this asso - ciation has made through its discussions and published proceedings , and especially through the very useful series of reports embodying the results of special investigations that it has conducted through its committees .

		I read THE DIAL with interest because it does not delude me with false pretensions .

		I like it because , on the whole for it is a bit unequal , and sometimes falls below its highest standards its tone is mainly neither truckling nor captious ; be - cause it stands for ideas and principles , and does not pander to the idle whimsies of the passing hour , nor feed each baneful madness as it arises .

		I admire it because it is not only readable , but seems to me to stand for enlightened patriotism , for order and progress , for the encouragement of wholesome literature , and to be strong and brave enough to utter its opinions in the teeth of those who , whether carelessly or wilfully , strive to be - little and overthrow the institutions which are the hope of humanity .

		May it flourish until those in - stitutions have triumphed over all their foes , and may it have an honored place in the procession which celebrates the victory 1

		I can not , to tell the truth , look back over THE DIAL 'S two decades ; it is the second only that I survey , with lively feeling when I think of the continual interest and stimulus with which I have considered the results of your work .

		There are many forms of criticism , but in almost all of them there is the possibility of sincerity , scholarship , dignity .

		THE DIAL can show in the long run most of the different critical tempera - ments .

		That is due to its contributors , who will be different by nature .

		But with all such differences , there will be something that remains the same , and this it is which the paper itself supplies .

		This spirit , this character , THE DIAL has long had , nor do I think the

		THE DIAL has been for years not only a comfort but rather a mystery to me .

		Amid its time and circumstance it has seemed very much as to one scaling the Bolivian Andes would seem a hail in pure English from the cliff above .

		An adventitious piquancy is doubtless added to our surprise by the mere fact of locality ; but the intrinsic wonder is to find such a journal published anywhere , to-day .

		Even a frontiersman may be forgiven sensitiveness over the spread of insincerity , flippancy , shallow - ness , commercialism , in American letters ; and re - lief at finding here and there an undraggled stand - ard .

		For the frontier is far enough from the foot - lights to get perspective on the stage ; and near enough Nature to retain some notion of what the make-believe really all comes to .

		In such a seat even the dullest onlooker may learn .

		My first knowledge of THE DIAL came about by a personal suggestion by
Whittier	LOCATION	, who practiced what he preached .

		During all the years since , it has been a preferred creditor , putting me deeper and deeper in its debt .

		Of more than a hundred periodicals every month brings to my desk , there are two I in - variably read throughout `` The Nation '' and THE DIAL .

		Critical criticism is as valuable as it is rare .

		Sometimes I find it elsewhere .

		I can depend on finding it here .

		And with it the anti- dote for many imminent pessimisms .

		In any serious adjudication we must , I believe , rank as one of the finest and rarest achievements in American jour - nalism the upbuilding , through a changeful genera - tion and in its most fevered city , a review so cool , so sane , so competent , so unbitten with our generic new unrest ; so immune against our penny-foolish - ness and our Yellow-plush attitude to literature ; so even-handed in upholding so high standards of 360 THE DIAL -LSB-

		It has been notably free from provincialism of taste , and from the weak - ness of confusing the novel and striking with the true and the real .

		It has kept the perspective of a comprehensive knowledge of literature , and has happily combined loyalty to the great traditions with love of freedom and openness of mind .

		Its wise conservatism has been a check to eccentricity of taste ; its catholicity has kept it in touch with the best in contemporary writing .

		It has been a medium for sound scholarship , and it has steadily encouraged that quality of mind which makes way for true art even where it does not produce it .

April 9	DATE	.

		While noting the fact that
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has made its regular appearance under that name for a term of twenty full years , I think it especially worth while to bear in mind how steadfast the paper has been in its aims , purposes , and methods .

		Many periodicals have changed editors , altered their form and ap - pearance , and still more greatly changed their policies and objects .

		But THE DIAL has gone serenely forward , true as steel to its own high ideals , and faithful to its own high standards of criticism and canons of good taste .

		I have had the pleasure and advantage of a familiar acquaintance with THE DIAL ever since its first days .

		Those who have known THE DIAL do not need to be told how perfect has been the discriminating sympathy of its editor with all that has been finest and best in our literary and social progress .

		With all deference to other editors , I can not think of any in our own gen - eration , east or west , who has seemed to me so con - sistently devoted to the best ends of criticism and literary journalism , and so wholly free from com - mercialism on the one hand or passing fads on the other .

		THE DIAL has always preferred the signed review .

		It has kept itself free from that anonymous pettiness , detraction , and stabbing-in-the-back that has prevailed in some other quarters , and that has had the effrontery to palm itself off for scholarly and sincere criticism .

		THE DIAL has had no blacklist of authors whom its editor and its reviewers have conspired to write down and injure irrespective of the merits of their books .

		Those log-rolling methods so prevalent in the literary journals and book - reviewing circles of
London	LOCATION	, and to some extent sup - posed to be known also in
New York	LOCATION	, have never been countenanced by
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	.

		The paper has on the contrary sought always to be just and con - siderate .

April 4	DATE	- All health to THE DIAL !

		From no literary jour - nal , foreign or domestic , have I derived more profit during the twenty years of its existence a time in which it has been needful for me to keep in touch with current publications .

		The review has been so free from the '' diseases of childhood , '' nervous or otherwise , as to constitute it almost a species by itself .

		On the rare occasions when a reader dis - sents from its criticism , he must still recognize its good taste and style , its scholarship , and the open mind of the reviewer .

		Nothing less , I think , could have enabled THE DIAL to thrive and continue , in a country where too meagre a support is given by the book-trade and the public to our few strictly critical journals .

		THE DIAL has been of such service that it would be ill indeed if anything were to hinder its future life and increase .

		Congratulations to THE DIAL on its twentieth anniversary , to its publishers and its editors , whose good work from the far away beginning I have personally known , good because sincere , strong , refined , sane , in spite of appalling contem - porary inducements to blaze , and glare and vul - garity and the tyranny of cliques .

April	DATE	SO .

		I note with interest that you are approaching your twentieth birthday .

		My profession naturally compels me to do a large amount of reading , and therefore I can only skim many American papers that come into my hands , but of the two or three that are always attractive , I confess THE DIAL takes almost first place , as I find it keeps me au courant with American books .

		May you have many years of successful career in the interest of good literature .

		Congratulations to

		It has always stood for intelligence , hon - esty , and sobriety qualities which are still -LRB- thank heaven ! -RRB-

		More power to its elbow in these days when the sense of proportion seems to be forgotten , and hysterical enthusiasm blazes its yellow way through the book-review and the literary appreciation '' !

		THE DIAL is certainly to be congratulated upon having reached a vigorous and prosperous man - hood , and gained the solid respect of the country as a serious and impartial journal of literary criti - cism , without resorting to pictures or personalities , or mistaking the back-stairs gossip about writers for literature .

		A DIRECTORY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLISHING TRADE .

		In connection with THE DIAL 'S twentieth anniversary number , it has been thought that a complete and authorita - tive Directory of the
American Publishing Trade	ORGANIZATION	, as consti - tuted
May 1 , 1900	DATE	, would be of value and interest , and accord - ingly the following list is presented to our readers .

		The Directory has been prepared especially for this issue of THE DIAL , from information furnished for the purpose by the pub - lishers themselves .

		The data given , which is necessarily lim - ited and condensed , aims to cover the following points : Firm - name in full , successive changes in firm-name with dates of such changes , names of officers or present members of com - pany or firm , special line of publications , number of titles on list , address in full .

		It is believed that no name of any sig - nificance in the legitimate publishing trade of the country has been omitted .

		It may be mentioned that in a few instances publishers failed to respond to our request for information , and in such cases the firm-name and address only is given .

		In Ye OId = Tyme Book-Shop Competition was not very marked , and cus - tomers received little attention ; but with the advance of civilization came the demands for better methods .

		In no line has the evolution been so great as that of bookselling .

		From the old time-honored dingy shop , with its high shelves , has developed the modern book - shop , with its glass cases , convenient arrange - ments , and abundance of light .

		From a very limited class of book-buyers we have broadened out into an intelligent , book-loving and book - reading nation , and to meet the wants of thousands of book-buyers , to whom a good book-shop is inaccessible , the system of Selling Books by Mail Has been established .

		To this class of read - ers we offer our services , together with one of the best equipped book-shops in

		A TWENTIETH CENTURY BOOK .

		About My Father 's Business .

		The work treats of the present social conditions in the churches , showing the lack of force and power in spiritual life by the encroachment upon it of social pleasures ; its reasons for failing to reach the masses ; the abuses of power and influences on the part of some of its rich members , who frequently use the church as a cloak for the advancement of their selfish ambitions and designs .

		While the book has a religious flavor , at the same time it advances some very strong themes of morality and philosophy .

		410 THE STAR SYSTEM IN PUBLISHING .

		A few years ago complaint was made , in accents more or less querulous , of the fact that the books which had the largest sale and en - joyed the widest popularity in this country were novels by English writers .

		The American nov - elist seemed to have no chance at all in the competition with his transatlantic rival .

		One of the chief arguments by which the campaign for international copyright had been brought to a successful issue was that the American novelist occupied a disadvantageous position in his own country , because publishers would nat - urally give preference over his work to that of the English novelist who was not in the position to exact a royalty .

		The plea was a sound one , and there is no doubt that for many years American novelists , as well as American writ - ers in other departments of letters , were put at a considerable disadvantage by the fact that publishers of predatory instincts -LRB- and such were not lacking -RRB- might seize upon whatever English books they wished , and reproduce them without the leave of either authors or proprietors .

		As between an already success - ful English novel upon which no royalty need be paid , and an American manuscript which might or might not make a successful book and for which the author would certainly demand compensation , the balance of probable profit turned toward the side of piracy , and the American writer who had not already conquered his public found it difficult to obtain a hearing .

		At last , however , the law was passed which ac - corded the bare measure of justice -LRB- or some - thing less than that -RRB- to the English author , and placed the American author in a position to compete with him without being handicapped from the start .

		In some respects the working of the law proved disappointing .

		The cheap '' libraries , '' it is true , found their opportunities restricted , and many of them disappeared altogether from the market .

		But the anticipated '' boom '' in American literature was slow in appearing .

		English books that were worth reading , as well as those that were not , seemed to find their way 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, into our houses almost as readily as before , although it was no longer possible to purchase the latest production of Mr.
Black	PERSON	or Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	for a small fraction of a dollar .

		Such books now came to us in respectable garb , and were sold at a fair price .

		The point is that they continued to come and to be sold in large num - bers .

		Even our popular magazines continued their practice of contracting for the serial rights in works of English fiction , instead of offering that encouragement to home industry about which American novelists had raised such a clamor .

		There continued to be years in which nearly every one of our story magazines had for its principal feature the novel of some English writer , offered to readers upon the instalment plan .

		There were the stories of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, for example , and the romances of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, with which no American writer of fiction could hope to com - pete .

		Then there was the series of highly successful individual books , beginning with ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' and coming down in rapid succession to '' Trilby '' and '' The Christian . ''

		The dear public wanted these books , even if it had to pay roundly for them ; and those who had expected international copyright to effect a revolution in popular taste found that condi - tions remained very much as they had been before .

		These selfish grounds were not , of course , those upon which the serious advocates of that act of plain international duty rested their case , but they no doubt had considerable influence in securing its adoption .

		The conditions of a few years ago seem , how - ever , to have become completely changed of late , and American fiction seems at last to have come to its own .

		The most striking fact in the publishing business of the past year is that of the extraordinary success of certain novels by American writers .

		Five such novels have won the public favor to such an extent that their sale has broken nearly all recent records , that to find its match , in the case of American fiction at least , we must go back to the history of '' Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		That this success has been in all cases deserved , we are by no means willing to admit .

		Of the five novels in question , one is a homely character-study hav - ing for its passport to favor a plentiful supply of mother-wit rather than an effective plot .

		The other four are historical romances .

		One of these four , the work of a woman , deserves very high praise as representing the best type of historical fiction .

		Two of the others are at least admirable narratives , and present inter - esting phases of our colonial history with re - markable sympathy , industrious grasp of detail , and vivid dramatic force .

		The fourth is an extremely mediocre example of the class of work to which it belongs , common in both style and treatment , not noticeably better or worse than a score of other books of its sort published during the twelvemonth , and chiefly interesting as an illustration of what can be done for a poor book by shrewd and persistent advertising .

		On the whole , our cause for satisfaction in the success of these five novels is not so great as those who are interested in them would have us believe , and the record of their sales is a brilliant episode in the history of American bookselling rather than in the history of Amer - ican literature .

		Whether the publishing trade is really to be congratulated upon such a series of popular successes as this , is open to serious doubt .

		In one case , at least , the profits accruing from a sale of hundreds of thousands of copies could not avail to save a great and long-established house from serious business embarrassments .

		Such enormous sales of single books , of which the merit , even if great , is not likely to be fairly proportional to the sales , does not seem to us to betoken an altogether healthy condi - tion of the publishing trade .

		Publishers them - selves know well enough that their success in the long run depends , not upon the fortunate acquisition of an occasional book that enjoys a sky-rocket career , but upon the possession of a substantial list of works of permanent value , works that occupy a standard place in litera - ture and may be depended upon to provide a steady income for many years .

		The publisher who has a list of this sort is , of course , glad enough to get hold of an exceptionally success - ful novel from time to time ; such a book rep - resents to him so much clear gain , and he would not be human did he fail to keep an intelligent watch for productions of this sort .

		But if he allows his head to be turned by visions of this kind of luck , if he despises the more modest but safer ventures , if he bends his energies to - ward achieving an abnormal sale for a few books instead of a normal sale for many , he is likely to come to grief .

		His real interests lie in the possession of many claims to public esteem rather than in the making of a few successful appeals to popular caprice .

		It seems to us that there is an evident anal - ogy between the ideal of publishing that aims to push a few books into successful acceptance and the ideal of theatrical or operatic manage -
1900	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 391 ment which depends almost exclusively upon the popularity of a few artists .

		The star sys - tem in stage affairs has long been understood by all competent observers as being extremely demoralizing to the true interests of art .

		The recent history of our grand opera has brought this principle home to many who had not real - ized it before .

		A few singers and a few operas become established in public favor , and the short-sighted policy of the management , relying upon this fact , gathers for the time a rich har - vest .

		But presently the public wearies of its favorites , and , never having been educated to the point of healthy musical culture which can find interest and inspiration in a great variety of works , never having been made to feel that the works themselves and not the manner of their performance should be its chief concern , now deserts the opera-house , in spite of all the allurements of new voices and new productions .

		The management then complains that audiences have no taste for a varied repertoire , that the production of untried compositions spells finan - cial disaster .

		Of course it does : the public should have been prepared for these composi - tions long before ; they should have been pro- duced repeatedly , even at some temporary loss , at the time when the public was most clamor - ous for the sensations of the hour .

		The star system in publishing brings about very similar results .

		Many worthy books are neglected in order that a few may be kept well to the front .

		When the caprice is past , when the serried ranks of worn copies of '' Trilby '' gather dust upon the shelves of the public library , when the unsold copies in the hands of the publisher and bookseller become '' plugs , '' the publisher should then know better than to complain be - cause his other books do not sell .

		The fact often is that he has not tried to sell them , that he has left them unadvertised and uncared-for , that they have now lost their chance because his '' enterprise '' has seen fit to promote the sale of a few books at the expense of all the rest .

		The well-advised publisher , in our opin - ion , is the one who recognizes the evils of the star system , and is not misled by its promise of present temporary gain .

		He is the publisher who secures for his list as many books of last - ing value as he can .

		And he is the publisher who cares for the interest of all of his books , because he understands that the permanent suc - cess of his business depends upon the accept - ability of his total output rather than upon the vogue of a few books taken here and there from his catalogue .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		CHICAGO AND
LONDON	LOCATION	AS VIEW - POINTS OF LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On the twentieth birthday of THE DIAL , may I , as a Transatlantic reader , be permitted to offer my humble congratulations on the successful conduct of the paper for so many years , and my best wishes for a future as honorable as its past ?

		THE DIAL , to one who lives on this side of the water , has a twofold interest and importance .

		It keeps him acquainted with the course and current of Amer - ican literature , and with the opinions and thoughts of those who lead the country .

		It also enables him to understand how current English literature is regarded by the American critic .

		This is still more important when the judgment of the critic is influenced , as some - times happens , by a difference in the point of view a difference which the Englishman sometimes finds it hard to understand .

		The American point of view , in literature as in politics , must be apprehended , and it is too little understood .

		Perhaps the same thing might be said on the other side .

		The criticism of THE DIAL on our own writers should be , above all , valuable to ourselves as being absolutely free from personal considerations .

		There is no suspicion in its columns of log-rolling , of private friendships , of private animosities , such as disfigure too much of our criticism upon ourselves .

		THE DIAL , again , illustrates the very important fact that '' local '' or '' national '' literature is one thing , and that '' English '' or '' Anglo-Saxon '' literature is another .

		In other words , the paper enables us to realize that there exist , side by side , two distinct literatures : that of
America	LOCATION	and that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Practically , each is sufficient for its own people ; each contains all that is wanted in art , science , philosophy , history , divin - ity , and every other branch .

		But there is also a liter - ature which belongs to the whole of the English-speaking race I call it '' English '' or '' Anglo-Saxon '' on ac - count of the language , but I would rather call it
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Celtic on account of the two races which most pro- foundly influence this literature .

		It is the supreme prize of the modern writer a prize rarely achieved to speak to the whole of the English-speaking peo - ples , whether of
America	LOCATION	, the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, Aus - tralia ,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, or
India	LOCATION	.

		Never before in the history of the world has a writer had such a possible audience ; never before has his possible influence been so deep , so wide , so far-reaching .

		May we not consider it an inestimable advantage that this part the nobler part of our literature should be drawn from two sources so widely apart , as regards that point of view , as
Chicago	LOCATION	and

		HONEY OR VINEGAR IN BOOK REVIEWS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An old-fashioned acquaintance of mine complains that reading a modern Review leaves him with an un - pleasant sensation as of having dined wholly off honey .

		The book - re viewer of to-day is altogether too lenient , too considerate , too apologetic , too blandly deferential a creature to suit this reader 's robust taste .

		He laments the decay of that fine old spirit of ferocity which ani - 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, mated criticism in the palmy days when
Jeffrey	PERSON	and his merry men used to fling themselves on an aspiring '' Laker '' or '' Cockney '' with the joy of an Iroquois scalping his victim , and the fluency in insult of the late Mr.
Brann	PERSON	.

		The most readable thing in the world , he thinks , is a merciless '' roast '' of a new book some - thing in the way of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's flagellations of Croker and
Robert Montgomery	PERSON	.

		Holding these opinions , this charitable soul was naturally much gratified the other day when a well-known critic proclaimed in print the present crying need of a Review conducted on the old savage
Edinburgh	LOCATION	lines .

		The article in which this opinion is aired smells , it is fair to say , suspiciously of paradox .

		But , at all events , what the writer of it ap - pears to think is wanted in these degenerate days of critical urbanity and super-abundant human kindness is a Review whose amiable specialty it shall be to damn and disparage , to thwart the '' booms '' of publishers , to clip the wings of aspiring young authors , to knock new - born reputations promptly on the head , and , in fine , to play in the world of current letters a part not unlike that played in politics by
Marat	PERSON	's
L'Ami du Peuple	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now I , for one , should be very sorry to see a recru - descence in criticism of the spirit of ''
Maga	PERSON	, '' which was so largely a spirit of malice , not to say black - guardism , exercised by a parcel of spiteful scribblers against better men than themselves .

		An ill-natured reviewer who takes pleasure in saying things likely to wound the feelings and cloud the prospects of his author , seems to me about as respectable a person as the scamp who strews tacks on a cycle path .

		But deprecating a return to the old gall-and - wormwood style of criti - cism does not estop one from regretting a tendency in the modern Review to eschew fault-finding altogether and become a mere honey-pot .

		It can hardly be denied , I think , that the criticism of the modern reviewer is mostly of a sort that does more credit to his heart than his head .

		His eagerness to praise constantly impels him to over - praise to lavish upon mediocrity terms that should be reserved for genius .

		I have often thought that the sanguine American lady who was gently taken to task by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	for asserting that excellence is '' common and abundant '' mast have been a great reader of Reviews .

		The habit would easily account for her cheerful delusion .

		Perhaps , after all , a slight infusion into the honeyed sweetness of the new Review of the spice and vinegar of the old might not be unsalutary .

		DEATH OF A JAPANESE SCHOLAR AND EDUCATOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		The recent death of Dr.
Toyama	PERSON	, President of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	at
Tokyo	LOCATION	, is an event worthy of being chronicled in an American journal in view of his residence and education in the
United States	LOCATION	, as well as by reason of his distinguished position in literature , education , and public life in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		His study of En - glish , in which he later became so proficient , was begun at the early age of thirteen in his native laud .

		He studied abroad twice : first in the sixties , when he was sent to
London	LOCATION	, and was the first , and at that time the only , Japanese student in that great metropolis ; and second , in the seventies , when he pursued courses of study in Ann
Arbor	PERSON	-LRB-
Mich.	LOCATION	-RRB- High School , graduating later from
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Returning to
Japan	LOCATION	, he entered upon a long service in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, of which he finally became President .

		In
1898	DATE	he served as
Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION	for a few months in
Marquis Ito	PERSON	's short-lived Cabinet ; and he was also a prominent member of the
House of Peers	ORGANIZATION	, where he was known as a forcible and brilliant debater .

		It is , however , to his literary work that most general interest attaches .

		He is said by a leading Japanese journal to deserve very great credit for being '' the first to recognize the advantages which the Japanese poet might derive from a study of European models '' ; and , in collaboration with others , he developed the Shin - taishisho , or '' Poetry of New Form , '' which is properly said to mark '' an epoch in the history of poetry in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		This new style of poetry ignores the old short suggestive odes , and seeks to adapt the long poem to modern conditions .

		Dr.
Toyama	PERSON	himself brought out a poem on the great earthquake of
1885	DATE	, `` which has not only great merit in itself , but occupies a unique position in Japanese literature . ''

		This new school of poetry manifested its aspirations not only in original poems , but in translations from English verse .

		The latter include '' The Mariners of
England	LOCATION	, '' '' Charge of the Light Brigade , '' Gray 's `` Elegy , ''
Longfellow	PERSON	's '' Psalm of Life , '' and four extracts from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Aston	PERSON	, in his '' History of Japanese Literature , '' thus characterizes the style of this new school : ''
Toyama	PERSON	and his colleagues , finding the ancient classical lan - guage unequal to the expression of the new ideas -LSB- Western -RSB- , and largely unintelligible to a modern public , frankly adopted the ordinary written language of the day , which had hitherto been only used for popular poetry of the humblest pretensions .

		In their choice of themes , in the length of their poems , and in the general tone of thought , the influence of European models is plainly traceable . ''

		Regarding the unification of the written and spoken languages of
Japan	LOCATION	a measure so important to the future of that country a recent number of that influ - ential newspaper , the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail , '' says : '' It is really preposterous that a country should have two languages , one for writing and the other for speaking .

		The ques - tion bears incidentally on the position of women in
Japan	LOCATION	, for since the language used by men when dis - cussing any subject outside the daily routine approxi - mates to that of books and newspapers , it can not be understood by a woman unless she has received an ex - traordinary education , and the result is that intellectual intercourse between the sexes becomes impossible . ''

		The influence of Dr.
Toyama	PERSON	on this and other measures of vital moment to Japanese progress and culture renders his loss a conspicuous one .

		IN NORTHWESTERN HUNTING GROUNDS .

		* A book from the pen of that keen Nimrod , mountaineer , sportsman-naturalist , and very agreeable writer , Mr.
W. A. Baillie-Grohman	PERSON	, is always sure of a welcome as broad as the section of the reading public its genre appeals to .

		We are not ourselves , we admit , thor - oughly in sympathy with the instinct which impels men like Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	and our stren - uous Colonel Roosevelt to devote their allot - ment of leisure largely to hunting down and slaying the '' native burghers '' of forest and plain .

		But there is this to be said for Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	and his kind : that he is no less de - voted to the preservation than the killing of big game -LRB- paradoxical as it may seem -RRB- , and that if we are to have any big game at all in this country worth mentioning twenty-five years hence it will be largely due to the efforts of the `` gentleman sportsman '' to prevent its extinction at the hands of the game-butcher , through game laws scientifically framed and properly enforced .

		Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	has some wise words to say on this slighted theme of American game preservation which we com - mend to the special attention of those inter - ested .

		Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	's latest production , '' Fifteen Years ' Sport and Life in
Western America	LOCATION	and
British Columbia	LOCATION	, '' is of rather miscella - neous content , embracing matter of interest not only to the amateur of wild life and the chase generally , but also to those in quest of practical information from an original source as to the conditions and outlook that confront the pio - neering settler or the investor in the raw North - west Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	's knowledge in this order being derived from some stirring and pictur - esque , if not wholly satisfactory , experiences in the eighties as a land concessionnaire in the then virgin Kootenay region of British
Colum	PERSON	- bia .

		The account of the author 's pioneering in
Kootenay	LOCATION	occupies about a quarter of the volume , and forms a lively and rather instruct - ive off-hand picture of frontier life , well seasoned with stories stirring or humorous , of which Mr.
Grohoian	PERSON	has an unfailing stock .

		Certain views of one of these pig-tailed domestics , devel - oped in the course of discussions with '' Missus Gloman '' on questions more difficult even than those of frontier housekeeping , are worth quoting . ''

		Why -LSB- said the author -RSB- do you take chickens and wine and cakes to the graves of your uncles , and then bring them back to
Chinatown	LOCATION	and eat them yourself ?

		You must know , as you eat them yourself , the things can be of no good to your dead relations . '

		` You see , ' replied he quickly , taking up a cup , and holding it in front of a lamp so that a sharp shadow was thrown on the white tablecloth .

		You see that , ' pointing to the shadow , ' dead men all the same that , he eat all the same that -LRB- shadow -RRB- of food and wine , I this , ' flicking the cup with his finger ; < if I no get all the same this , me die pretty soon quick . '

		This morning I pull down one blind , sun look in that window , now he look in this window , bye and bye he look in another window , and then white man say sun he no walkee ; he walkee all the time ; white man heap liar . ' ''

		Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	's opening chapters are in his more familiar vein , and treat for the most part of sporting lore and adventure pure and sim - ple , under such captions as Travelling in the Western Hunting Grounds ; the Slaughter of
Big Game	ORGANIZATION	and the Game Laws of
America	LOCATION	; the
Wapiti	LOCATION	, its Antlers and its Chase -LRB- with illustrations taken from the now rare catalogue of the great American Trophy Show of

Moose	PERSON	,
Caribou	LOCATION	, and Deer of the
Pacific Slope	LOCATION	; the Bears and the Bison of

		A special chapter is devoted to a quasi-scientific discussion of the seal and other fur-bearing animals of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, and of the inter - national difficulties that have from time to time grown out of the pelt-hunting industry on the northwest coast .

		As to the Alaskan pur - chase , Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	observes : '' The million and a half sterling paid for

United States	LOCATION	the last remaining retreat of the pelt-bearing ferce naturae on the globe .

		To pay for a territory nine times the size of
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	what we would expend upon two first-class inonclads , was not a bad bargain .

		A fraction less than a penny per acre permits a good many of them to con - sist of barren rocks or swamps , without making it a losing transaction .

		And when we hear that on two of its tiny islands , sixty square miles in extent the famous
Prybiloffs Nature	ORGANIZATION	has created and is maintaining a unique mine of untold wealth , that has already more than repaid the
Government	ORGANIZATION	dollar for dollar the mil - lions paid to
Russia	LOCATION	, the true character of astute Brother
Jonathan	PERSON	's last ' Conquest by the Almighty Dollar ' begins to dawn upon one .

		If we add the further tri - fling detail that on another tiny isle there is a gold mine 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, that has already produced more gold than the whole country cost , our admiration for
America	LOCATION	's commercial wisdom is only increased ... What a profitable investment the purchase of
Alaska	LOCATION	has proved to be for the
United States	LOCATION	is shown by the fact that in the twenty-one years -LRB- 1870-90 -RRB- the rent and taxes of the Prybiloffs amounted to 1,250,000 and the duties on the returning dressed skins '' -LRB- almost the entire Pry - biloff catch goes to
England	LOCATION	for dressing , and about half of it returns to this country and is heavily taxed on entry -RRB- , `` amounting to over one million sterling , brought the total up to 2,250,000 .

		Verily a famous purchase ! ''

		After giving an interesting sketch of the history of the pelt-hunting industry in
Alaska	LOCATION	, including a description of the Prybiloff rook - eries -LRB- one is tempted to ask , with
David Cop	PERSON	- perfield 's aunt , '' Why rookery ? '' -RRB-

		during the breeding season , Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	goes on to de - scribe and discuss pelagic sealing , and to give his opinion touching certain vexed questions which the industry has given rise to .

		That pelagic or open-sea sealing is , as American authorities contend , infinitely more wasteful than the leisurely abattoir - like methods of killing pursued at the rookeries , where only animals of suitable age and sex are taken , he has no manner of doubt ; and the facts he ad - duces certainly seem more than sufficient to bear out his conclusion .

		The waste of pelagic sealing is the necessary result of haste , of poor marksmanship * -LRB- a large percentage of wounded animals escaping capture to die a lingering death later on -RRB- , and of conditions that prevent deliberate and accurate selection of victims many breeding females being uselessly and wastefully slaughtered .

		To the plea that defends pelagic sealing as being the more '' sportsman-like '' method , Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	re - plies with a sportsman 's indignation and a rea - sonable man 's disdain : '' One plea advanced by those blindly favoring the British case , which otherwise is such a preeminently sound and just one , is particularly unfortunate .

		When condemning the land killing as conducted on the rook - eries as ' rank butchery , ' as ' a revolting destruction of animal life , ' ' as cruel as it is unsportsmanlike , ' ' slaugh - ter of animals without giving them a chance for their lives , ' etc. , one can only shake one 's head in indignation at such unreasonable special pleading .

		Even some of those voicing their authoritative opinions in the Blue Book pander , one regrets to see , to this inhuman plead - ing .

		Par .

		610 says : ` The accusation of butchery laid against those who take the seals on shore can not be brought against this pelagic method of killing the seal , which is really hunting ' -LRB- save the mark ! -RRB-

		` as distin - guished from slaughter , and in which the animal has what may be described as a fair sporting chance for its * An entry in the log-book of the sealer `` Angel Dolly '' reads : '' Issued to-day to my boats 300 rounds of ammuni - tion ; all expended , and got one sealskin . ''

		life . '

		Was ever more mischievous nonsense written ?

		Does it not stand to reason that the method which eliminates all chances of -LRB- 1 -RRB- a lingering death from wounds , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that spares all females , -LRB- 3 -RRB- that prevents all avoidable waste of life , -LRB- 4 -RRB- that kills in a merciful way only those animals that are best suited for the uses to which their pelt is put and that can best be spared in the economy of seal life , is a better and more humane method than one which fails to regard any one of these important considerations ?

		One might just as well argue that , instead of putting our cattle to a speedy and painless death , we should turn them loose in a deep lake and shoot them or wound them from un - steady boats , letting those that are not killed instantly die a slow death and sink out of sight .

		There is no more reason for depriving a steer of a ' fair sporting chance for its life ' than a bachelor seal when its skin is at its best . ''

		The preservation of the fur seal is , Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	thinks , more feasible than that of any other wild animal . ''

		With a birth-rate of about 143,000 , as estimated by the most recent and entirely trustworthy examina - tion by Professors
D'Arcy Thompson	PERSON	for the British and
Starr Jordan	PERSON	for the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	, it js surely possible to insure the perpetuation of the race ; while 100,000 would , it is said , amply indemnify the Canadians for completely ceasing pelagic sealing . ''

		It will be gratifying to sportsmen to know that so high an authority as Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	does not at all agree with those writers who reach the mournful conclusion that American hunt - ing grounds are , in respect of big game , virtu - ally '' shot out . ''

		Prince
Wied	PERSON	, writing sixty -
five years ago	DATE	, deplored the disappearance of bighorn and wapiti , while a more recent visitor , Lord Dunraven -LRB- he of '' concealed ballast '' memory , we suppose -RRB- writes : '' An English - man going to the States or to British American territory for big game shooting , and for noth - ing else , is sure nowadays to be disappointed . ''

		Says Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	: '' Both were right so far as the country they passed through was concerned , both were wrong in their gener - alizations .

		There are even to-day countries , the size of small kingdoms , in
British North America	LOCATION	into which no hunting party ever penetrated , and where the frying - pan 's capacity of a few prospectors has , so far , meas - ured the destruction of game ; countries where moose , caribou , and antelope-goat are still unfamiliar with the sight of white-skinned human beings .

		... I enjoyed unrivalled sport in years subsequent to the period when the author of the ' Great Divide ' expressed such a pessimistic view , and that concerning localities not a hundred miles west of the country through which he passed . ''

		Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	shows much appreciation of the humor , as well as the humors , of the Far West , especially of the '' tall stories '' charac - teristic of that land where , proverbially , '' talk is cheap and lies are worth nothing . ''

		One of the `` tallest '' of the stories , taken from a

		THE DIAL 395 Western newspaper , may be subjoined as a close to our quotations . ''

		A wonderful fish is becoming numerous in
Goose Lake	LOCATION	.

		It is called by some the ' greenback ' fish , for it is certainly an inflationist .

		It has the power to fill itself with air until it becomes very much like a round ball .

		Of evenings about sundown they may be seen playing on the surface of the water .

		They will swell up by taking in the air , and the wind will blow them over the lake .

		They reflect all the colors of the rainbow , and when sporting over the lake are a grand sight .

		A hunter several weeks ago saw a crane swallow one of these fish when in its normal condition , but before the crane had got fifty feet above the lake the fish had taken in enough air to explode the crane , which , at the sound of a report like that of a gun , flew all to atoms , and the fish came lightly down on the water , no worse off for the short ride in the air .

		The fish is a great curiosity , never having been found , I believe , in other waters . ''

		What a fine item that would have made for Doctor
Goldsmith	PERSON	!

		* Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	qualifies the title of his book by stating in the preface that he did not live for fifteen consecutive years on the
Pacific Slope	LOCATION	.

		He spent the greater part of each of fifteen years there , his first four or five visits being devoted exclusively to big game shooting .

		The natural grandeur and ample promise of the magnificent domain to the west of the Rockies are glowingly and picturesquely de - scribed , for , it is fair to say , Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	views nature with the eye of a lover and an artist , and not merely with that of a hunter , and as an arena for the sportsman .

		In point of literary quality this latest production of Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	's is hardly up to the level of one or two of its predecessors , the delightful '' Sport of the Alps '' for example ; but in spite of its occasional lapses of style it is in the main crisply and pleasantly written , and is packed with information on points as to which the author is a recognized authority .

		The book is handsomely made and copiously illustrated .

		The frontispiece , a fine photo-process plate , shows the author seated contemplatively in his study at Schloss-Matzen , surrounded by tro - phies of his gun , notably the superb wapiti head familiar to readers of English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	illustrated sporting journals .

		While this noble head is doubtless a source of much pride to Mr.
Grohman	PERSON	, it should also , we should say , form something of a thorn in his conscience .

		THREE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM .

		* With the publication of the three volumes telling of the lives of Chase ,
Sumner	PERSON	, and
Adams	PERSON	, the collection of short biographies called the '' American Statesmen Series '' is complete .

		A carefully prepared index-volume is promised , which will make the thirty-one distinct books a connected whole , and will vastly enhance their value to the student of American history , who has already learned to esteem them of much importance in a consid - eration of the varied political problems which have attended the development of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The three men studied in the volumes now at hand have many traits in common .

		Each was an individual of marked personality , firm in conviction and fearless in action .

		Each one , despite many reasons which might have per - suaded to the contrary decision , broke away from old political associations and joined the forces of the '' Conscience '' voters of the North , when the slavery question was the burning one of the day .

		And when the '' irrepressible con - flict '' finally came , each one contributed a most important part to the history of his country .

		The place of Mr.
Chase	PERSON	is fairly shown by Professor
Hart	PERSON	in these words : `` At first an obscure member of a little group of anti-slavery politicians , he came to something like headship of that party in the campaign of
1848	DATE	.

		He was the first efficient anti-slavery senator , and in his management of the opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Bill showed great qualities as a parliamentary leader .

		He came forward as secretary of the treasury in the midst of chaos , and made suggestions and developed financial ideas which may have been imperfect , but which were so clear and definite that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was com - pelled to adopt most of them .

		Almost single-handed , he began the attack upon the sixteen hundred state banks , which were the entrenched fortresses of a vicious sytem , and compelled both bankers and congressmen to accept a better scheme .

		More than any other man , he seized upon the conditions of the Civil War as leading straight to the legal and political freedom of the negro , and to him more than to anyone else is due that system of negro suffrage which he advocated , not because he thought it was ideal , but because he saw no half-way place in giving to the negro his long-usurped rights .

		In his latest years he well used his opportunity to stand for the principle of limited powers , as against the conception of a sovereign legislature , both in the
State	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Union	LOCATION	. ''

		396 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, the three well-defined periods of his life : that of the leadership of anti-slavery forces in the West , that of the secretaryship of the Treas - ury , and that of the judgeship .

		Mr.
Hart	PERSON	has followed these lines of division , half the volume being taken with the first period up to the time of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's election .

		The situation in the
Middle West	LOCATION	is shown to have been a very interesting one , and the forces at work , espe - cially in
Ohio	LOCATION	, were many , all tending strongly to influence a man of Mr.
Chase	PERSON	's personality to join hands with the friends of the slave .

		The chapters devoted to cabinet membership , including the straining of relations with the President , and to the problems of Reconstruc - tion as they came before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, are full of important suggestions ; but the early parts of the narration perhaps deserve more notice , because they deal with less familiar themes .

		The faults of Mr.
Chase	PERSON	are clearly set forth , notably those which cropped out in connection with his hopes for the presidency .

		The illumination of history through biography has been Mr.
Hart	PERSON	's evident purpose , rather than the setting forth of personal details , which might have made the volume easier reading , but at the sacrifice of a prevailing method of historical writing .

		By far the most interesting narrative of the three under consideration is that concerning
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	.

		It does not cover so large a period as that of the other two states - men , Chase and Sumner .

		One paragraph sums up this period thus : `` The active public life of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	practically ended , as he had surmised it might , with the
Geneva	LOCATION	arbitration .

		It had extended over just thirteen years .

		It covered the whole period of the Civil War , including the process of Reconstruction ; and he was , in all re - spects , singularly happy in the share of the work allotted to him .

		It was important ; it was work for which he was by nature peculiarly adapted ; it was done amid congenial surroundings ; it was complete ; and it was successful .

		A public man could ask for nothing more .

		The contentions in which he was engaged were of sur - passing magnitude , and involved momentous conse - quences ; they extended through a long period of time ; they were carried on wholly with foreign nations ; and in their conduct he came in collision with some of the foremost of European public men .

		Yet his success was as final as it was complete and unquestioned .

		When he landed in
New York	LOCATION	on
November 13 , 1872	DATE	, he had a right to exclaim , as he did , ' lo Triumphe ! '

		for every issue between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	growing out of the great Civil War was either definitely settled , or was in course of early settlement .

		His work was done ; and done thoroughly . ''

		The issues with whose discussion Mr.
Adams	PERSON	was intimately associated were those connected with the treatment accorded to Confederate representatives in
England	LOCATION	, the Trent Affair , General
Butler	PERSON	's famous Order at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the Cotton Famine , the question of recognition of the Confederacy , the Emancipation Pro- clamation , the
Alabama	LOCATION	case and the
Laird Rams	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Geneva	LOCATION	Award ; some attention being paid also to the attitude of
France	LOCATION	toward the diplomatic questions of the day .

		It is ex - tremely interesting and suggestive to look at these matters from the point of view of one who was in a foreign country at the time , charged with the welfare of his native land , and yet having for his guidance neither a clear knowledge of affairs at home , nor a definite understanding of the workings of the mind of the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Oftentimes , in the ab - sence of information , the ambassador of the
United States	LOCATION	had to grope blindly .

		It was very fortunate for the country that Mr.
Adams	PERSON	was a man of prudence and good sense , else some rash step might have precipitated the trouble which above all it was his particular duty at that time to prevent .

		The slowness of means of communication very probably saved the
Union	ORGANIZATION	from serious difficulty with
England	LOCATION	; and no one can read this short story of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's experience during the Civil War with - out understanding the great change which has necessarily come over diplomacy since the lay - ing of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	cable and the introduction of other improvements in the methods of speedy communication .

		The corrective value of the account of the work of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	in connec - tion with an examination of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's career as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	will be readily appreciated by the reader of this little book ; and all will wish for a speedy publication of the promised larger work , which is to include the various letters and papers of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	.

		In a study of father by son , especially of an Adams by an
Adams	PERSON	, a tendency to overestimation might be expected ; but such a charge can not lie against this book .

		The treatment is candid and fair , and the general impression made upon the reader is that this will rank among the best of the monographs contained in the `` American Statesmen Series . ''

		If there was to be criticism of the style employed , it might attach to the constant use of illustrations from card-playing , which are so numerous as to be almost offensive .

		Two brief paragraphs from the life of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	will indicate the ideas of the author regarding the place of the third of the three friends of freedom . ''


Charles Sumner	PERSON	was a great man in his absolute fidelity to principle , his clear perception of what his
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 country needed , his unflinching courage , his perfect sincerity , his persistent devotion to duty , his indiffer - ence to selfish considerations , his high scorn of anything petty or mean .

		He was essentially simple to the end , brave , kind , and pure .

		In his prime he was a very elo - quent speaker , and his unbending adherence to the highest morality gave him insight and power in dealing with great questions and a strong hold upon the moral forces of the country ... From the time he entered public life till he died , he was a strong force constantly working for righteousness .

		He had absolute faith in the principles of free government as laid down in the Declaration of Independence , and he gave his life to secure their practical recognition .

		They were not to him glittering generalities , but ultimate , practical truths , and in this faith Lincoln and Sunnier were one .

		To Sumner more than to any single man , except pos - sibly Lincoln , the colored race owes its emancipation and such measure of equal rights as it now enjoys .

		To Sumner more than to any single man the whole country owes the prevention of war with
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	when such a war would have meant the disruption of the Union . ''

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	entered the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1851	DATE	, and soon indicated very clearly the position he was to take in the impending crisis .

		His illness as a result of the
Brooks	PERSON	assault took him abroad , and the great part of his life-work was done after he returned to his seat in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
December , 1859	DATE	.

		Mr.
Storey	PERSON	claims for him an influence in connection with the Trent affair which is not recognized at all by Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, and , indeed , taking these three books together , one finds a number of cases where the relative claims of Chase and Sumner , or Sumner and
Adams	PERSON	, seem to overlap , and to need sifting by comparative study .

		But the efforts in behalf of the negro do not need denial or limitation .

		What Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	accomplished may be indicated by quotation from his letter to the
Duchess of Argyle	ORGANIZATION	, dated
July 4 , 1864	DATE	. ''


Congress	ORGANIZATION	will disperse to-day , having done several good things : -LRB- 1 -RRB- all fugitive slave acts have been re - pealed ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- all acts sustaining the traffic in slaves on the coast from one domestic port to another have been repealed , so that now there is no support of slavery in our statute-book ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the railroads here in
Washington	LOCATION	have been required to admit colored persons into their carriages ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- greatest of all in practical importance , the rule of evidence excluding colored testimony in the
United States	LOCATION	courts has been abolished .

		All these measures are now the law of the land .

		They were all introduced and pressed by myself . ''

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	took many positions , in his later life , which angered his former friends and led to estrangements from those with whom he had often worked in harmony .

		It is possible that Mr.
Storey	PERSON	has unduly emphasized the importance of his hero in these connections .

		But the many intricate and perplexing prob - lems of Reconstruction days are discussed with sustained interest , so that this volume will be used frequently by students who desire to get information and suggestion about them .

		In fine , here are three studies of three great Americans who had much to do with making the history of their country in a time of grave national peril .

		The volumes meet a positive want .

		There have been biographies of Chase and Sumner , but they were written some time ago , and were without that fine dis - crimination which is marked in these books , which are written according to later historical methods , and will be respected because in them mere eulogy gives place to sober and thought - ful consideration of great national problems reflected in the lives of a nation 's great men .

		ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND MEN .

		* To the American , still floating in a hetero - geneous and various national life devoid of great centres of interest and incapable of habit - ual concert of action with many of his fellows , the compactness and solidarity of the national life of
England	LOCATION	is a constant wonder .

		An aris - tocratic government conspires with geograph - ical conditions to make this possible , with con - comitant age and settled institutions ; but the surprise with which the American realizes the almost literal truth that everyone in
England	LOCATION	worth knowing knows everyone else worth knowing , is never ceasing , and not without a tinge of envy .

		Such books as these under consideration show how great a part the two ancient English universities play in this unification of men and ideas .

		Mr.
J. Willis Clark	PERSON	, registrary of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, in a series of brief biographies commemorates ten men of his uni - versity with a complete understanding of and sympathy with their lives and aims which is in itself proof of the intimacy referred to .

Henry Richards Luard	PERSON	, also a registrary of Cam - bridge

		To these is added an ap - preciation of the life and work of
Richard Owen	PERSON	, the only one of the group not thoroughly identified with
Cambridge	LOCATION	, from which institu - tion , indeed , he only received an honorary de - gree .

		Such work as this , some of it brought forward by way of a review of a biography of the person commemorated and some of it by way of obituary notice following close upon death , lacks the formality and heaviness which attends the preparation of too many memoirs , and may be said to represent at its best that sort of publicly intimate account of a life which does away with the possibilities of such mis - haps as befell
Carlyle	PERSON	's memory at the hands of
Froude	PERSON	.

		Of a different nature since Mr.
Clark	PERSON	is concerned with all manner of activities , polit - ical , popular , and scientific as well is the Rev. Mr.
Donaldson	PERSON	's `` Five Great Oxford Leaders . ''

		The five include
John Keble	PERSON	,
John Henry Newman	PERSON	,
Edward Bouverie Pusey	PERSON	,
Henry Parry Liddon	PERSON	, and
Richard William Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		As is to be expected from so
august	DATE	a list of theologians , the work becomes a per - sonal history of the Oxford movement which brought the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	into possession of many long foregone uses and doctrines in the nature of a more Catholic feeling .

		The book as a whole revolves about its central figure , that of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	, in whose life alone is the detail furnished which brings the others into connection with it , chronologically and in other respects .

		Here too is that animating spirit of broad comprehension which adds so greatly to the value of Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's work .

		The Rev. Mr.
Donaldson	PERSON	is a part of the time he interprets so vividly , and he fairly makes the past , living in the successors of the five men , live in the present with them .

		In more places than one , the feeling of his pages amounts to tenderness and beautiful affection .

		More points of resemblance exist between the two books just discussed than with the third , Mr.
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	's Passages in a Wandering Life '' ; yet between this last and its predecessors there are more points of re - semblance than of difference , and the dramatis personce of the three , so to speak , are much the same .

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	is the second son of Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	of Rugby , his elder brother ,
Matthew	PERSON	, having been born
December 24 , 1822	DATE	, and himself
November 30 , 1823	DATE	, and the por - trait of the author here used as frontispiece showing a marked personal likeness .

		But Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	became a wanderer on the face of the earth soon after his graduation from Univer - sity College ,
Oxford	LOCATION	; seeking occupation in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, where he led a life in the forest remote from civilization for a time ; then pass - ing over to
Tasmania	LOCATION	to become , like his more famous brother , an inspector of schools , a posi - tion he soon lost through his union with the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	; then to
Dublin	LOCATION	, to accept the chair of literature in the newly founded uni - versity there , and to labor under
John Henry Newman	PERSON	for six years ; then to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	to prepare pupils for admission to the university , alternat - ing his residence there with life in
Dublin	LOCATION	after an appointment as fellow of the
Royal University	ORGANIZATION	in the Irish capital ; and finally , since the death of Mrs.
Arnold	PERSON	in
1888	DATE	, to roam about through
Europe	LOCATION	at intervals , writing betimes and ad - vancing the cause of his Church .

		The book which tells all these things is not so well unified as might be expected , but is often en - tertaining and never without interest , whether the author is telling of his experiences at the antipodes , defending his ideas of what a Catholic university ought to be , or enjoying a sly jest at the church of his fathers , as in this anecdote : ''
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	was strolling on the beach at
Jaffa	LOCATION	, when a boat arrived conveying some distinguished strangers .

		These were the new Evangelico-Anglican bishop Dr.
Alexander	PERSON	, who had come to take possession of the see of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and the members of his family .

		The Greeks on the shore , whose language is the lingua Franca of debased Italian commonly spoken in
Syria	LOCATION	, watched the landing with the greatest interest .

		The shovel hat , correct Episcopal attire , and knee-breeches of the bishop , who was the first to land , impressed them greatly . '

		Vescovo !

		Vescovo ! '

		they cried out in admira - tion .

		Mrs.
Alexander	PERSON	followed .

		The Greeks were puzzled , but being informed by some one that this was the bishop 's wife , they shouted , but in a lower key , Vescova !

		Vescova ! '

		Finally , four or five children of various ages came up the beach after their mother .

		Ascertaining who these were also , the Greeks threw up their hands in unbounded astonishment , exclaiming , ' Vescovini !

		Vescovini ! ' ''

		The '' Bishop , '' '' Bishopess , '' and '' all the little Bishops '' of the story were the more wonderful to the Greeks because of the Episcopate of the Greco-Russian Church being recruited exclu - sively from the monastic orders .

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	discloses an agreeable person - ality in his book , and is an acquaintance one feels glad to have made .

		THE DIAL 399 THE CL.IMAX OF
MASPERO	PERSON	'S ORIENTAL , HISTORY .

		* The third and last volume of Professor Mas - pero 's great ''
Histoire Ancienne	PERSON	des Peuples de 1 ` Orient '' appears in its English dress under the unconventional title of '' The Passing of the Empires . ''

		This , with the two preceding volumes , '' The Dawn of Civilization '' -LRB- 1894 -RRB- and '' The Struggle of the Nations '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- , give us the most scholarly , the most popular for its compass , the most complete , and the best up-to-date history of the peoples of the ancient Orient yet produced .

		Professor
Maspero	PERSON	's sci - entific methods , his command of the literature of his subject , and his power of popularization , have made this work of indispensable value both to the history-specialist and to more ad - vanced students and readers of ancient history .

		The first two volumes in English dress were provocative of sharp criticism because the au - thor 's views of biblical criticism had not been faithfully transferred and represented .

		The present volume appears not to be subject to such strictures .

		Indeed , the committee of the English publishing society assumes no respon - sibility for the positions taken by the author on biblico-critical matters .

		This third volume covers a period of over five hundred years , and the years most eventful for the kingdoms of
Israel	LOCATION	and for the great nations who swayed their sceptre over these kingdoms .

		This half-millennial period saw the decline and fall of the great civilizations located on the
Euphrates	LOCATION	and the Tigris in the

		This period , too , sur - passes all others in the abundance of its avail - able original historical documents , found in the temples , tombs , and mounds of the Orient .

		The abundance , importance , and scope of these inscriptions , and the readiness with which they yield to the efforts of the translator , have made this section of ancient oriental history pecu - liarly new and attractive .

		Each chapter is preceded by an analysis , without , however , any indication of the pagination referred to .

		This deficiency is somewhat relieved by the fact that the head - line of the right-hand page names the theme discussed on that and adjoining pages .

		Although not a recognized
Assyriologist	ORGANIZATION	, the author has fully utilized the valuable material furnished by this department of research .

		He has scanned the whole horizon of learning within his period of study .

		The evidence of his wide research , and the proof of the truth - fulness of his statements , are found in the ful - ness of the footnotes , often swollen , though in finer type , to one-third and occasionally to more than one-half of a page .

		This critical and bibliographical material is the scholar 's pride and a precious possession , but it is the disturber of the peace of mind of the conscientious pop - ular reader .

		A careful examination of several sections of the work reveal the author 's wise discrimination in the selection and marshalling of his facts .

		He has constructed the narrative with due regard to the amount and kind of available material , and has produced in proper proportions an interesting , connected , and lucid history .

		Questions of biblical criticism properly re - ceive slight attention .

		Where they touch the historical narrative , however , somewhat more would be expected .

		Belshazzar , for instance , is noticed as a son of Nabonidus -LRB- p. 635 -RRB- , but the question of his identity with the character in the book of
Daniel	PERSON	is passed over in silence .

		It is evident from the few statements made that the author is progressive in his views , and is not retarded by any immovable prepossession in his interpretation of the facts of biblical and contemporaneous history .

		The author 's com - prehensive grasp of his subject , his masterful method of arraying his facts , his transparency of style , and his candor and fairness in argu - ment , will heartily commend the work to the mind of every reader .

		The annual output or outcome of excavations in the

		highly successful in their appeal to the intelligence and the sympathies .

		The scene is the
England	LOCATION	of nearly a century ago more than a century ago at the outset , for the first scenes are placed in the time of the French Terror , and the closing episodes have to do with the events of the Hundred Days .

		The story is not , however , as one might infer from these facts , concerned other than inci - dentally with French history .

		Scarthey is on the coast of
Lancashire	LOCATION	, and the hero is an Englishman , although the heroines for there are two , mother and daughter are Frenchwomen .

		The former , loved by the hero with all the reckless passion of youth , is the victim of a Republican noyade ; the latter , who comes unexpectedly into his life a score of years later , is equally beloved , with the more restrained but really richer passion of ripened man - hood .

		There is one jarring note in the romance .

		It is not found in the difficulty of making the love for the daughter appear natural for a man in whom the fires of passion seemed to have been long burned out this difficulty is triumphantly sur - mounted .

		It is found rather in an escapade of the later heroine , for which we are wholly unprepared , and which does not accord with her character as previously revealed .

		We can not quite reconcile ourselves to this sudden transformation ; it seems like an evil dream rather than a possible actuality .

		But this one defect does not greatly mar our enjoy - ment of the book as a whole , which is picturesque in treatment and flushed with color .

		The characters are firmly and clearly drawn , and their creator has imparted to them the unmistakable breath of life .

		Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	's '' Savrola '' was published as a serial three years ago , and now ap - pears in book form .

		It is described as ' a tale of the Revolution in
Laurania	LOCATION	, '' and is a romance of the familiar '' Zenda '' type .

		The Republic of Laurania would be difficult to locate upon the map .

		It is a
Mediterranean state	LOCATION	, possessing a fleet and colonial interests in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Its President has ruled as a dictator for several years , and the people are restless .

		The revolution of which this story tells us is of the social democratic type , and ends with the death of the tyrant , and the union of his beautiful widow with the leader of the revolt .

		The story is rather dull at first , and its movement slow ; but the pace becomes quickened about midway in the volume , and there is no lack of excitement to - ward the close . ''

		The Gentleman Pensioner , '' by Mr.
Albert Lee	PERSON	, is a romance of the conventional pattern , filled with heroic emprise and desperate peril .

		It tells of the period in the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	when the Catholic plot was ripening , and called for the most energetic measures on the part of the Queen .

		An important message is entrusted to one of the Queen 's servants , to be delivered into the hands of General
Hunsdon	PERSON	.

		Since this message contains the plan of campaign against the conspirators , they seek by every means in their power to gain possession of it before it can
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 be delivered .

		The adventures of the messenger , and his successful performance of the task com - mitted to him , make up the whole story .

		The Queen of Scots figures incidentally in the closing chapters , and her removal to a place of safety eventually thwarts the rebellious Catholics .

		The story is well told , and the author deserves especial praise for knowing when to stop in the invention of new perils for the hero , and of other familiar devices for '' prolonging the agony '' at critical junctures .

		Few writers of the sort of book in question have ever learned this lesson . ''

		One Queen Triumphant , '' by Mr.
Frank Ma	PERSON	- thew , is another romance of the same period , the scene being placed only a few years later , and con - cerned especially with the
Babington	PERSON	plot and the execution of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		The hero is a soldier of fortune , steadfast in his allegiance to
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, although his loyalty is sorely taxed by his sympa - thies for the unfortunate Queen of Scots .

		The heroine is no other than the child of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	and
Bothwell	PERSON	, supposed to have died in the hour of her birth .

		But the heroine in this case counts for little , since the rival queens occupy the foreground , and claim most of the interest of the readers .

		The figures of
Burleigh	LOCATION	,
Walsingham	PERSON	, and Leicester take conspicuous places in the narrative , and illustrate , as well as those of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, the author 's really remarkable powers of character delineation .

		For this romance is far more dramatic than most works of the class to which it belongs ; it is con - cerned with character quite as much as with plot , and mere narrative , so comparatively easy of exe - cution , gives place to animated dialogue , which few writers of historical fiction know how to manage .

		Very much out of the ordinary is this reconstruc - tion of a fascinating chapter of history , and not more than one book of its sort out of a score achieves a like degree of excellence . ''

		Yeoman Fleetwood , '' by Mrs.
Francis Blundell	PERSON	, is a novel of English life in the days of the Re - gency , and has for its hero a prosperous tiller of the soil , possessed of a remarkably simple and up - right character .

		He is , indeed , almost the only person in the narrative who inspires our sympathy , for the remaining characters are representatives of county families , and the distinction of caste between
Fleetwood	ORGANIZATION	and the others is made the leading mo - tive of the tale .

		The snobbishness of all the other people concerned makes them very disagreeable , and even the heroine , lovable as she is in most re - spects , has to struggle with her prejudices for a long time before she can become reconciled to a union with the man who has won her heart .

		It seems to us that this note of class prejudice is a little forced , even for the times in which the scene is laid , for it is difficult to believe that people of any breeding at all would be capable of the sort of vul - garity which distinguishes most of the characters in their treatment of the hero .

		The scene in which the heroine , after the clandestine wedding upon which she has herself insisted , learns that her father is under financial obligations to her husband , and leaps to the conclusion that she has been made in some sort the subject of a bargain , is dramatically conceived , but here again the note seems to us forced .

		How she flees from her husband , plunges into the artificial society of which
Brummel	PERSON	is the exemplar , attracts the insulting admiration of '' the first gentleman of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and is rescued from a midnight orgy by the husband whom in her heart of hearts she really loves , all of these things are effectively recounted , and this turmoil prepares the way for a happy ending . ''

		The Enchanter , '' by Miss
U. L. Silberrad	PERSON	, is a novel of which the earlier chapters promise more than the later ones perform .

		It starts out to write the biography of a child of genius like '' Senti - mental Tommy '' or the hero of '' the Ship of Stars '' and as long as this purpose is kept in view , the treatment is successful to the point of fascination .

		But when the child grows up , his fortunes become mingled with those of the unreal person who is des - ignated by the title of the novel , and who is repre - sented as a hypnotist and a dabbler in occultism .

		This substitution of charlatanism for psychological interest , this change of appeal from intelligence to morbid curiosity , so weakens the book that the total resulting impression is rather unpleasant , in spite of the marked ability displayed in many ways by this new and promising writer .

		Among recent translations of foreign fiction there are a half dozen particularly noteworthy volumes , and the most important of them , all things consid - ered , is Count Tolstoy 's `` Resurrection , '' which comes to us in a careful version made by Mrs.
Louise Maude	PERSON	.

		The commanding position occupied in the cosmopolitan world of letters by the author of this book , and the deep sense of our gratitude to him for his great services to the cause of humanity , make the appearance of such a work in the highest degree significant , although even these considera - tions must not be permitted to blind us to its defects as a production of literary art .

		We had hoped , indeed , to find in '' Resurrection '' a worthy suc - cessor to ''
Anna Kare	PERSON	* nina , '' a book which might fairly be ranked among the great novels of our time .

		What we do find is a book which only a man of genius could have written , yet which perversely renounces most of the advantages which genius has over ordinary talent .

		There are episodes of the most poignant artistic truthfulness , there are char - acters delineated with a mastery almost absolute ; but there are also countless pages of matter having no artistic relevance whatsoever .

		The judicial pro- cesses of a Russian criminal court have their interest , no doubt , but it is not the interest that appeals to a reader of fiction .

		Neither does such a reader care to become involved in a lengthy argumentative defense of the peculiar doctrines of the late
Henry George	PERSON	.

		Yet these two elements , alien to any properly-planned work of fiction , make up a consid - 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, erable part of '' Resurrection . ''

		The story is briefly this : The hero , a Russian nobleman , has in his youth betrayed a young woman of humble rank , a dependent upon his family .

		When the story opens , ten years have elapsed .

		She has been driven to a life of shame ; he has had the reckless career of the average officer and man of the world .

		One day he finds himself summoned to serve upon a jury , and there he meets once more the woman whom he has wronged .

		She is accused of poisoning , and her case is one of those which he is required to consider .

		She is not guilty , yet she is convicted , partly through her own ignorance of the forms of law , and sen - tenced to exile .

		His nature is profoundly stirred by these happenings , for he is now old enough to take a serious view of life , and the predisposition so to do is not lacking .

		As he reviews his career , his better self is awakened , and this is the '' resur - rection '' to which the title has reference .

		In mak - ing us understand the workings of this man 's mind , at this particular juncture , the author displays his highest powers , and gives us a piece of psycholog - ical analysis which has rarely been equalled .

		The upshot of it is that he determines as far as possible to atone for his crime by making the convict his wife and sharing her banishment to
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		But he pleads his cause with her in vain , for her soul also is experiencing a sort of '' resurrection , '' and she will not accept what she can not consider to be other than a sacrifice .

		He persists , however , in making the journey to
Siberia	LOCATION	, and in doing what he can to ameliorate her condition .

		Eventually , his efforts secure a commutation of her sentence , and she marries a fellow-prisoner .

		All this constitutes a story of which the author might have made ar - tistic use within the limits of perhaps two hundred pages ; in stretching it to five hundred he has made of the book a tract , a study in applied Christianity , rather than a novel .

		That it is not absolutely dull and wearisome is the highest tribute we can pay to the author 's art .

		His sincerity is so absolute , his conviction of the faults and follies of the social organization so intense , his belief in the sanctity of human life so impressive in its statement , that he holds our attention in spite of our repudiation of his social ideals and his theories of art .

		The present translation has been made by a competent hand , and there is no indication that it is not complete .

		Count Tolstoy uses plain language at times , but the fact that a popular magazine was unwilling to con - tinue the publication of the work for fear of offend - ing the susceptibilities of its constituency affords a striking commentary upon the namby-pambyism of our purveyors of literature for the masses .

		If the masses received less coddling , and were given more of the strong meat of literature in their favorite miscellanies , there might be some hope of raising the moral tone of our society .

		No public can be in a healthy frame of mind when its dovecotes are fluttered by such a work as '' Resurrection . ''

		A few unnecessarily blunt phrases may well be forgiven a writer who brings so fundamentally inspiring a mes - sage to mankind .

		Next in importance among these translations is `` The Knights of the Cross , '' the new historical romance by Mr.
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		Only half of this work is now presented to the English public , and we are told that it is still in process of serial publication in a Polish periodical , but the remaining half is promised for an early date .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	is , as heretofore , the authorized translator .

		Admirers of the Polish novelist will learn with much satisfac - tion that he has returned , figuratively speaking , to his own soil and to the historical records of his own people .

		There are few cases in the literature of fiction in which a racial type has been portrayed with such insight and convincing art as have gone to the portrayal of Polish character in the great romantic trilogy of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, and in the almost equally remarkable delineation of modern society given by '' The Children of the Soil . ''

		These are his real works , and , however such a book as '' Quo Vadis '' may for the time being appeal to the public , it can - not have the permanent value of such books as '' The Deluge '' and '' Pan
Michael	PERSON	. ''

		The former is a brilliant exercise of the scholarly imagination ; the latter are creations in a very high artistic sense . ''

		The Knights of the Cross '' is also a creation in this sense , and , although the story is not thus far sufficiently developed to permit of judgment upon it as a whole , it may at least be said that in matters of detail the old mastery is again exhibited .

		We have the same strong types of character , the same union of fierce passion and tender sentiment , the same raciness of diction , the same blending of re - ligion with patriotism , and the same fine historical perspective that so enthralled us in the series of ro - mances to which '' With Fire and Sword '' first introduced us .

		Of the general setting of the work it suffices to say that it takes us back to the
Poland	LOCATION	of the fourteenth century , and that the order of Teutonic Knights , then grown corrupt and arrogant , is the foe against whose power the sympathies of the reader are invoked .

		There is not much fight - ing as yet , but the conflict is clearly foreshadowed , and we await the second half of the work with con - fidence that it will bring fulfilment of the vow taken by the hero , and all sorts of destruction for the ene - mies of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not easy to wait , either , for matters are reaching a very critical point as the present volume closes , and we trust that the suspense will not be of long duration .

		Two more volumes have been added to the now considerable number of translations from the most brilliant of Hungarian novelists . ''

		The Poor
Pluto	LOCATION	- crats '' is the title of one of them , and Mr.
R. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	is the translator .

		This book is a semi-barbaric romance of the wild Transylvanian region , a nineteenth-century tale which might be fitted into the sixteenth , were it not for certain incongruous accessories borrowed from modern science .

		We can not speak very highly of this work from the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 standpoint of serious criticism ; it is like most of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's productions in its violation of the most elementary principles of verisimilitude , whether in arrangement of situation or in delineation of char - acter , and the author 's determination to he startling at any cost must lose him the suffrages of the dis - cerning , although these may be made up to him ten times over by the applause of those who are satisfied with daring invention and vivid entertainment .

		The other book by this author is entitled '' Debts of Honor , '' and is translated by Mr.
Arthur B. Yol	PERSON	- land .

		The translator says that many of the author 's countrymen consider the work his masterpiece , but this statement has been made concerning so many of the other romances of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	that our suspi - cions are aroused .

		Unless all of his works are masterpieces , we can hardly account for the fre - quent recurrence of the statement . ''

		Debts of Honor '' is a story that appeals more directly to the tastes of English-speaking readers than do most of the romances of this writer .

		The bizarre effects and romantic exaggerations which we expect from Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	are not lacking in this book , but he places less reliance than usual upon invention , and more upon the delineation of credible characters and upon the portrayal of scenes which have a strong human interest .

		There are passages in this novel which stir the deeper emotions , and which display an unexpected mastery of the psychological problems involved .

		The plot is based upon what European novelists who do not know much about
America	LOCATION	are in the habit of calling '' an American duel '' that is , an agreement to decide by lot which of the two opponents shall take his own life within a stated time .

		In this case , the time is ten years , and the hero is made the victim of a trick .

		He draws the fatal lot , supposing the arrangement to be made in good faith , and not knowing that his name is writ - ten upon both the papers .

		When the ten years are up , his enemy appears upon the scene , gloating with fiendish malignity over the impending tragedy .

		Amid highly dramatic circumstances , the trick is exposed just in time to avert the disaster , and the hero learns that his debt of honor has never existed .

		The character of the hero , of the eccentric relative with whom the ten years are spent , and of the gypsy maiden who loves him , and who saves his life at the sacrifice of her own , are all delineated with skill and penetration .

		The book has a great deal of subsidiary incident , quaint domestic custom , Hun - garian folk-lore , and the like , all of which is subor - dinated to the main narrative , exhibiting a degree of restraint to which this writer has not accustomed us .

		On the whole , '' Debts of Honor '' must be accounted one of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's best books , and we take pleasure in commending it . ''

		The White Terror , '' by M. Fe ^ ix Gras , offers the conclusion of the story begun with '' The Reds of the Midi '' and continued with The Terror . ''

		Like its predecessors , it is translated from the Provencal original by Mrs.
Catharine Janvier	PERSON	.

		The fortunes of the little Comtessine , of the group of friends leagued to protect her , and of the villain who seeks to compass her destruction , are all car - ried out to an artistic , if not a humanly satisfactory ending .

		At least , it is rather distressing to think that a convent should have proved the only possible refuge for the heroine , and that the hero , on his return from the wars , should have found that her vows had made any earthly union , other than that of souls , impossible for two lovers so faithful in their devotion .

		But such is the outcome of the whole history , and we must make the best of it .

		The White Terror , it seems , is the name given to the royalist reaction which , the first fury of the Revolution being spent , took possession of the prov - inces , and vied with the Revolution itself in its frenzies and its crimes .

		None of these after - disturbances were more violent than those that took place in and about
Avignon	LOCATION	, and here the scene of the story is placed .

		Few writers of fiction have handled this period of French history with the mastery displayed by
M. Gras	PERSON	in the remarkable realistic trilogy which is now completed ; his knowl - edge is so intimate , his animation so unbounded , and the net expression of his sympathies so just ac - cepting the Revolution , despite its excesses , as in some sort a divine event that he has provided a really remarkable aid to our comprehension of the times concerned , besides telling a story that for mere narrative interest is deserving of cordial praise .


Seiior Galdos	PERSON	is best known to American readers as the author of ''
Dofia Perfecta	PERSON	, '' but in his own country he is famous rather as the historical nov - elist of the Napoleonic period and the Peninsular War .

		His ''
Saragossa	LOCATION	'' is one of a series of many works dealing with this period , and
Miss Minna Caroline Smith	PERSON	has done us a real service by trans - lating it into English .

		While we can not allow her claim that it deserves to be ranked with '' War and Peace , '' or even with '' La Debacle , '' we are bound to admit that it is a fine example of the '' dramatic war novel , '' and that its description of the famous second siege of the Aragon stronghold -LRB- 1808-9 -RRB- is both vivid and impressive .

		The heroic defence of
Saragossa	LOCATION	against the overwhelming power of the invader is one of the finest things in history , for it revealed the modern Spaniard as an undegenerate descendant of the ancient Nnmantian .

		We read in these stirring pages how the fighting was carried on from outwork to outwork , then from section to sec - tion of the city , and finally from house to house , or even from room to room .

		Valor could do no more than was done by the Aragonese in this heroic struggle , and the honors of the siege remained after all with the vanquished .

		An impassioned love story is interwoven with this web of historical happenings , but its interest is subordinate to that of the main issue of the romance , which makes the fate of any individual seem unimportant in comparison with the tragedy of a whole people .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		404 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .

		A new book Mr '
Charles Moore	PERSON	's '' The North - on the Old west Under Three Flags '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- Northwett .

		j 8 & va | ua ble contribution to an inter - esting division of history .

		It covers the Old North - west for the period of 161 years , or from
1635	DATE	to
1796	DATE	.

		It was in
1634	DATE	that
Nicolet	PERSON	, the intrepid French explorer , discovered and passed through the Straits of
Mackinac	LOCATION	, making his way to
Green Bay	LOCATION	and the region beyond , and the next year that he returned to
Quebec	LOCATION	; and it is not clear why the author should have selected the second rather than the first of these dates for his point of departure .

		For the other date the best of reasons can be given .

		That is the year when
Great Britain	LOCATION	finally relaxed her hold upon the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, surrendering the posts that she had so long held wrongfully , and with them the control of the territory .

		Although be - longing , in law , to the
United States	LOCATION	since
1783	DATE	, it was not until
1796	DATE	that the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	came prac - tically into their possession , and that the last one of the three flags was raised over it as a token of ab - solute jurisdiction .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's book has many good features .

		It is marked by conscientious study ; in some particulars it corrects earlier errors and adds to our knowledge ; while the material is well handled and is presented to the reader in an attract - ive style .

		The author 's strength lies in his gifts of careful study and pleasant narration .

		He has a quick eye for the picturesque and romantic features of his subject , and it may safely be said that his story , as a whole , has never been so well told be - fore , that is , as a story .

		But when we come to the deeper questions that the story involves , and its more serious meaning , not so much can be said .

		Several instances can be pointed out where the au - thor has not risen to the height of the argument , but has failed to appreciate , or at least to set forth , the tremendous import of the matters with which he deals .

		Still , this defect , as the historical scholar will regard it , may be an excellence in the eyes of those readers whom the author apparently has had particularly in view .

		Probably a majority of readers of history look upon it as narrative , or story-telling ; and much can be said for this view of the matter .

		To those who take this view , if they are interested in the particular subject , this book may be recom - mended almost without reservation .

		We wish , however , that Mr.
Moore	PERSON	had found a title a little less sensational , and that the publisher had put up the book in a more convenient and attractive form .

		It is well illustrated .

		Of the life of
Thomas Campbell	PERSON	, in the `` Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
J. Cuthbert Hadden	PERSON	has made an amusing book .

		Perhaps the life of a man of letters is naturally more amusing to people who read a good deal than the life of a soldier or a reformer .

		Be this as it may , we have here an entertaining sketch .

		Mr.
Hadden	PERSON	had one point in his favor , he was not forced to undue admiration of his subject .


Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's is one of those reputations which may endure for a long time , if it be carefully transmitted in the histories ; but hardly otherwise .

		Mr.
Hadden	PERSON	is quite frank in the matter .

		Of '' The Pleasures of Hope '' he says : '' The poem was at least a credit to his years '' ; of ''
Gertrude	PERSON	of
Wyoming	LOCATION	, '' that it is '' a third-rate poem containing a few first-rate lines . ''

		After such frankness , one feels safe .


Campbell	PERSON	was a figure in an interesting literary period ; he was , indeed , in the eye of contemporaries , one of the chief fig - ures .

		His life , then , is interesting to anyone who likes literary history .

		For himself , his genius was apparently not great , nor his character extraordinary .

		But for a time he occupied a chief place .

		It must be added that although Mr.
Hadden	PERSON	can not assign to
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	many literary virtues , he does bring to light or recollection some things about
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	which are not generally remembered .

		Thus , he was sincerely and devotedly a friend to
Glasgow Uni	LOCATION	- versity , where he had been himself educated ; and he was one of the most zealous promoters of
London University	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was more unaffected goodheart - edness in his active discharge of the duties of Lord Rector , and in his earnest effort to find the best principles of European education , than in all his poetry and hackwork .

		There were also other non - literary elements in his life more creditable than the literary elements , his absorption in the cause of
Poland	LOCATION	, for instance , and his invariable kindness and generosity to relations and others as well .

		We may thank Mr.
Hadden	PERSON	for rounding out the char - acter of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	the man ; his great poems will probably never be read again , but it will be some - thing of a pleasure to realize that the author of '' Hohenlinden '' and '' Lord
Ullin	PERSON	's Daughter '' was once something more than the thin literary shadow he has become .

		Wildfloweri and their insect What we understand to have been the first publication of the new firm fronds and foes .

		of
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		is the very attractive volume entitled `` Nature 's Garden , '' by ''
Neltje Blanchan	PERSON	, '' whose recent books about birds have deserved and won so large a measure of popular favor .

		It is , we believe , an open secret that Mrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	is the one to whom we are really indebted for these delightful books of popular natural history . ''

		Nature 's Garden '' is described as `` an aid to knowledge of our wild flowers and their insect visitors . ''

		The latter part of this phrase shows how the work is differentiated from the other books about wild flowers of which so many have been published during the past few years .

		The writer explains her purpose when she says : '' Inasmuch as science has proved that almost every blossom in the world is everything it is be - cause of its necessity to attract insect friends or to repel its foes ... it seems fully time that the vitally important and interesting relationship exist - ing between our common wild flowers and their
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL A brief history of
Austria	LOCATION	, winged benefactors should be presented in a popu - lar book . ''

		The writer has described , with special reference to their fertilization by means of insects , over five hundred species of our wild flowers .

		The descriptions are pleasantly written , avoiding sci - entific technicalities , yet not made offensive , as so much of popular scientific writing is , by assuming that the reader has no education worth taking into account .

		The scientific names , as authorized by the
International Botanical Congress	ORGANIZATION	, are freely given .

		The species chosen are arranged according to the colors of their flowers .

		The chief attraction of the work , however , is provided by its illustrations .

		These are photographed directly from nature , and upwards of a hundred species are pictured , about half in black and white , the rest in colors .

		These plates , and especially the colored ones , give the book a unique place among publications of its class , and amply justify its existence .

		They are beauti - ful to look at , and are of great practical assistance in the identification of the species which they rep - resent .

		The book should be found upon the library table of every country house .

		In the preface to his '' Brief History of
Austria	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr.
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	states that two alternatives presented themselves : '' either to treat of the prin - cipal historical events in proportion to their relative importance , or to give a succinct but unbroken record of the history of
Austria	LOCATION	as connected with the
Imperial House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former would have been a far more grateful task .

		On the other hand , the partly didactic character of this series , and the almost incredible fact that no consecutive history of
Austria	LOCATION	, such as this is , exists in any language , led me to forego the idea . ''

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's ambition made him proof against the temptation to take up '' the more grateful task , '' for the writing of a '' succinct but unbroken record '' presents such difficulties as to deter any but a most resolute or a most courageous historian .

		The his - tory of
Austria	LOCATION	, to a greater degree than that of any other important European state , is to be woven from disjointed facts , impossible of correlation , and defying the best efforts at condensation .

		The uni - fying principle which everywhere exists in the his - tory of other states , and serves to cement apparently detached facts , nowhere presents itself in the history of
Austria	LOCATION	, unless indeed it be the principle of race hatred , the principle of disunion itself .

		It is not surprising , then , that the result of Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's labors should be disappointing , and that his story of
Austria	LOCATION	should be lacking in the essentials of a popular instructive history .

		That really entertain - ing historical writing is possible with the author , his '' Realm of the Habsburgs '' and other less ambitious and comprehensive works amply testify .

		The book is filled with facts , generously illustrated , fairly well indexed , and reasonably accurate .

		But that the writer has entered into '' the real life of the people as they lived , labored , struggled as they studied and wrote , and as they amused them - selves , '' that can not be said .

		The story of Aus - tria which shall instruct and entertain , which shall make its people flesh and blood , which shall live as history , has yet to be written .

		Valuable additions The fame f BrOok Farm ' that New to Brook Farm England experiment toward the ' dis - literature .

		covery of a better social life , is rap - idly becoming world-wide ; yet the list of related books published as an appendix to Mr.
Lindsay Swift	PERSON	's volume describing the community -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- surprises the reader by the number of its titles .

		Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's treatise is the first attempt to gather between a single pair of covers the gist of what is now in print concerning the Rev.
George Ripley	PERSON	's courageous attempt to found an actual Utopia .

		Besides the mere collation of existing material on library shelves , the author has furnished his per - sonal quota of observation and judgment .

		Holding a position of responsibility in the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Swift	PERSON	has had the advantages of bib - liographical training and unexcelled literary facili - ties .

		He is also geographically near to the hallowed piece of ground in
West Roxbury	LOCATION	, already gradu - ally becoming enveloped in the halo of tradition .

		And he has , best of all , a descriptive pen , adapted to keen yet appreciative analysis of the characters who had part in this socialistic drama , the names of some of whom now come for the first time into the full light of public day .

		An opening chapter upon the rise of the Transcendental movement , ad - mirable in its succinct facts , is followed by a sketch of the organization , resources and occupations of the community itself .

		Twenty-five of the more prominent scholars , members , and visitors are made the subjects of brief biographical treatment and estimate , while the full index provided enables the reader to find mention of more than as many more
Brook Farmers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last chapter , devoted to the closing period , shows that the decline of the enterprise began with the arrival of
Albert Bris	PERSON	- bane and Fourierism .

		All in all , it is safe to say that Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's book is the best single volume that has yet been issued upon the subject it treats , val - uable alike to the student and the general reader .

		A year and more ago a book was An old-fashioned published called '' Potpourri from a commonplace book .

		* , r
Surrey Garden	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mrs.
C. W. Earle	PERSON	.

		It was not widely noticed in the public prints , but it must have reached the attention of those for whom it was designed , for the author very shortly began to get letters from readers who de - sired more of the same sort .

		Now appears '' More Potpourri from a Surrey Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is dedicated to the readers of the earlier volume , but we think it probable that it will reach a wider audience .

		New readers will like to see the views which old readers had of the earlier volume , and will probably want to read it themselves .

		The two are among the most curious books that have 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, appeared for some time .

		On a foundation of ideas suggested by her garden , Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has built an unconventional structure of domestic opinion and discussion -LRB- as about servants , children 's health , and receipts for cookery -RRB- , extracts of poetry and notes of travel , bits of diaries and criticisms on older men of letters .

		This is a singular combination , and the conception is at least original .

		It would seem at first as though everybody would like in it what he happened to like , and not much else .

		There is , however , another matter which the author herself once or twice remarks .

		The book is a singularly perfect mirror of the life of a cultivated woman living quietly in the country or in some small town , in her parlor and her bookroom , her kitchen and her garden .

		One place is as proper in its way as another , for each is but a province of her domain .

		She is not a gardener or a botanist , but a garden lover ; not a student of domestic economy , but a housekeeper ; not a critic , but a reader .

		She gives us what appeals to her quite simply , not because it is anything remarkable or especially to her credit , but merely because it has appealed to her .

		It is not strange , then , that the result should appeal widely to many others .

		An old-time After reading the '' Life of
Charles	PERSON	hero of the
Henry Davis	PERSON	, Rear Admiral '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as prepared by his son , Captain
Charles H. Davis	PERSON	,
U. S. N.	PERSON	, largely from original letters -LRB- and re-reading most of it -RRB- , it may be confidently stated that no career , of all the many in the American navy which deserve emulation , is better worth following than this .

		Born in
1807	DATE	, graduated from
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	in the class of
1825	DATE	, becoming a midshipman in the service at the instance of Commodore
Isaac Hull	PERSON	,
Davis	PERSON	achieved a lasting scientific reputation for himself as the virtual originator and perpetuator of the ''
American Nautical Almanac	ORGANIZATION	, '' and by his skilful work on the
Coast Survey	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are his contributions to his country 's fame as a sailor and a scholar .

		On the side of the sailor and warrior , his endeavors are not less distinguished .

		It was
Davis	PERSON	who saved
William Walker	PERSON	and his fellow-filibusters from death in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	; it was
Davis	PERSON	who planned the battle of
Port Royal for Admiral Du Pont	ORGANIZATION	in
1861	DATE	; and it was
Davis	PERSON	who fought and won the battle of
Memphis	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	, clearing the upper
Mississippi	LOCATION	from the rebels forever .

		To all this hard and faithful work is to be added a consistent desire to avoid publicity ; a feeling that duty was preeminent and self nothing ; an ardent love for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, too great to permit him to be merely politic ; and a cul - ture which makes his letters , even the most casual of them , models of literary excellence .

		We have heard much , and sometimes sorrowfully , of the scholar in politics : here is the scholar in war , a quiet , digni - fied gentleman , whose place is rather in the hearts of his countrymen than in their mouths .

		As long as
America	LOCATION	can produce men like
Charles Henry Davis	PERSON	, and enough of them , the Republic is secure .

		Mr.
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	's third publication , `` Practical Agitation '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is a continuation of his '' Causes and Consequences '' in both matter and manner .

		Broadly speaking , it is an attack on the almost universal American habit of refraining from saying the '' word in season , '' for fear of hurting someone 's feelings .

		Holding to Judge
Robert Grant	PERSON	's postulate that our national life is lacking in honesty because our commercial life also leaves much to be desired in the ethical sense , Mr.
Chap	PERSON	- man finds a remedy for both evils in the pressure which may be brought to bear upon the offender through his club , his church , and his broader social relations .

		There is only one political question be - fore the people , in his judgment , and that is the question of honesty .

		So far as Republicans and Democrats are concerned , there is only one machine behind the two parties , and the one object of this compound machine is private profit at the public expense .

		Party loyalty is merely the blind thrown over the scene of looting in order to lead the voter to think of something else anything else , if only the machine may machinate .

		In this regard he holds that very great improvement has been made in a few brief years , so that in
New York City	LOCATION	itself it has become possible to proceed along straight lines of moral purpose without a thought of tem - porizing with iniquity or deviating into an alliance with wrong enthroned .

		From the passing genera - tion of hide-bound partisans Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	looks for little help , indeed , no partisan can read the book without feeling himself a long way behind the age ; but great things are expected from the younger folk who decline to wear a collar or be labelled in respect of their political rights and conduct .

		The book is one to be read and digested in a year of presidential contest .

		It would be quite as well , in view of A Boer appeal to Th g to f th fi -LRB-

		, , .

		, - , .

		, \ .

		, now published with the authority of the two South African Republics , to let the English - men who are not dazzled by the imperial policy make the argument to their countrymen and cousins across the sea .

		For , so far as the official documents which conclude the present volume are concerned , they are to be found elsewhere for the most part , while the preliminary papers are not nearly so forceful as the occasion seems to warrant .

		Mr.
Montagu	PERSON	White prefixes an article on '' The Policy of Mediation , '' a plea to the
American Government	ORGANIZATION	for positive intervention .

		If we could mediate in the case of
Cuba	LOCATION	, we can surely do so , so far as principle is concerned , in the case of
South Africa	LOCATION	; but , as Admiral
Mahan	PERSON	has suggested , intervention when
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her affair is concerned is a very different thing from intervention in the case of a second-rate power the difference being not at all in the morals of the question , but in the comparative sizes of the British lion and the Spanish wolf .

		The principal part of the book is taken up with an
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 407 Lamb and
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		article by Mr.
C. W. van der Hoogt	PERSON	, in the nature of '' A Communication to the ` American People . ''

		It contains little that is new , and it is rambling and discursive .

		Perhaps the best point raised is in con - nection with the government of
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, wherein a few British , comparatively speaking , hold many thousands of Dutch deprived of all political rights whatever , through a property qualification which makes the
Transvaal	ORGANIZATION	's most onerous demand seem light .

		Presumably any new information about so genial and engaging a per - sonality as that of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	must be acceptable to the host of those who love the man , for his life as well as for his essays ; but the new facts which Mr.
William Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	reveals in his little volume on '' Lamb and
Hazlitt	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are neither of any great importance , nor are they told in such fashion as to stir any very lively interest .

		The special student will be glad to piece the little revelations of the book into a fuller knowledge of the man , but the general reader will find the volume disjointed and occasionally obscure .

		The same fault is observable in that part of the book which has to do with
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		A reader igno - rant of the fact that he was divorced from his first wife would hardly know what to make of the chap - ter dealing with that unfortunate production , the '' Liber Amoris '' ; and to those familiar with the circumstances it will seem a little strange that one of the name should dwell at length upon an occur - rence so little to the credit of him who gives the name its distinction .

		But as the book is meant largely for the special student , these criticisms are perhaps captious .

		It does contain no small amount of interesting matter hitherto unpublished .

		There is an account of a joke perpetrated upon
Hazlitt	PERSON	by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and his friend
Joseph Hume	PERSON	, and
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's characteristic humor sparkles in the pages of the correspondence which grew out of it .

		In mechan - ical execution the book is attractive , with its de - lightfully wide margins , heavy paper , artistic letter - press , and binding severely simple .

		Folk-lore and Th .

		e history of British imperialism magic among points to nothing with pride so great the Malays .

		or 8Q j ugt ag to the achievements of Englishmen in the
Malayan Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		For once , the selfishness of modern markets has been subor - dinated to measures purely philanthropic , while the impossibility of turning the Moslem natives to some other form of religion has left the civil administra - tors unhampered by the complications which mis - sionaries generally contrive to interject into the ordinary difficulties .

		Along with all the other ex - cellences of the resulting system has gone a care for science such as has marked the colonial admin - istration of the French and Germans to a far greater extent than that of the British up to this point .

		As proof of this may be cited the newly published vol - ume on '' Malay Magic '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a most imposing monument to the industry of its author and compiler , Mr.
Walter William Skeat	PERSON	, not the distinguished
Cambridge	LOCATION	professor of that name , but a member of the civil service of the
Federated Malay States	ORGANIZATION	.

		Profiting by all the labors of many diligent predecessors , and adding to those the re - sults of his own investigations , Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	presents an amount of material which must serve as a basis for many scholarly treatises , the more useful from his habit of recording facts without attempt - ing to account for them .

		The numerous formulae and superstitions embodied in this imposing volume are most curious survivals of paganry in a Moslem community , and are destined to early extinction through the spreading of intelligence now going on .

		Frequently a book is more interest - ? ''

		% * < > * * e glimpse it gives of the author 's character , poise , and view , than for its matter .

		Mrs.
Louise Jordan Miln	PERSON	's '' Little Folks of many Lands '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is one of that kind .

		It is written by a woman who says that she has supported herself by work in two profes - sions , and could do so again if necessary .

		Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	has been an actor and a newspaper writer ; she has travelled ; she is independent , bright , sym - pathetic , and fearless .

		The book is interesting , but wearies if taken in long sittings .

		The author loves children , and delights in saying so .

		It is almost evident that she does not love all children , though she tries to make herself believe that she does .

		She describes children of many races and peoples , of varying colors and characters , from all zones .

		Those children whom she has really seen and known , she describes interestingly ; but those whom she knows by reading , or by dim memory , she breaks down on .

		Thus , her chapters about little Hindus , Ceylonese , and Chinese are charming ; but those about the
Eskimo	LOCATION	, American Indian , and Mexican -LRB- i. e. ,
Vera Cruzan	PERSON	-RRB- children are tedious .

		Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	has gathered a remarkable collection of child - pictures from all parts of the globe .

		They are used as illustrations in the book , and are interesting . ''

		Little Folks of Many Lands '' will interest and amuse ; it will kindle sympathy .

		It is not good ethnology , but it is suggestive .

		Anyone with human feeling and a soul , who knows other peoples and other lands , will delight in Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	's keen but entirely justified thrusts at missionary meddling and foreign education among remote and '' lower '' peoples .

		Indian song * An unassuming but important con - and musical tribution to the ethnology of our notation .

		North American Indians comes to us from
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in a hand - some little volume entitled '' Indian Story and Song . ''

		The author , Mrs.
Alice Fletcher	PERSON	, has long been known as an authority on Indian folk-lore , and her work is characterized by thorough accuracy as well as the sympathy such study demands , and of which it is really the life principle .

		Some twenty stories or legends are given , with their accompany - ing songs in musical notation .

		That the music is of 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, hardly more than elementary order , is naturally to be expected .

		But it will be very interesting to the musician , nevertheless , and there is a pathetic quality in much of it which gives unexpected light as to the emotional nature of the Indian .

		It is Mrs.
Fletch	PERSON	- er 's own belief that in the motives of these songs and stories , simple and naive as they are , will be found themes worthy the attention of the American composer .

		They were given at the Trans -
American Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at
Omaha	LOCATION	in
July , 1898	DATE	, a number of
Omaha	LOCATION	Indians singing their native melodies to an audience of trained musicians .

		Thus far only the ethnological journals have had any record of Mrs.
Fletcher	PERSON	's long and patient work , and her little vol - ume is a most welcome addition to our native folk - lore , a matter of increasing interest year by year .

		Before Mr.
Rounsevelle Wildman Secrett	PERSON	of wag appointed consul of the
United	ORGANIZATION	the sanctum .

		rr , .

		_ States at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	in 189 < , he was editor of '' The Overland Monthly '' in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Though he has since been made consul - general in that important post , and in addition to his regular duties has contrived to relieve himself of the responsibility for the American alliance with
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Wildman	PERSON	's thoughts go back to his journalistic career with evident longing .

		His expe - riences , sublimed by time and a somewhat tropical imagination , now appear in a volume entitled '' As Talked in the Sanctum '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is a book wherein the curious in such matters may find disclosed some of the more esoteric features of con - ducting a magazine .

		As is usual in such cases , the editor has a number of friends who are perfectly will - ing to show him how such a periodical ought to be conducted , and the conversations which ensue are directed to that end .

		These are frequently bright , and often not so bright ; but they may serve for instruction when dullest and for entertainment at other times .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		One of the most charming books that have recently issued from the press is that in which the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have reproduced Mr.
Ernest Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's '' Biog - raphy of a Grizzly . ''

		It is not quite safe to call any writing a classic that is only a year old , but we feel reasonably confident that this piece of sympathetic de - lineation of animal life will have a longer life than most books .

		The illustrations by the author , and the decorative designs by his talented wife , present many unusual and even startling effects , but they are unfail - ingly artistic in their feeling , and no less important than the text in accounting for the attractiveness of the book .

		Two new volumes have lately been added to the
Columbia University Studies in History	ORGANIZATION	, Economics , and Public Law .

		Volume X. consists of three studies , treating of very diverse subjects , namely , sympathetic strikes and lockouts , the attitude of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	toward the adoption of the Constitution , and the cen - tralized administration of liquor laws in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Volume XI .

		is devoted entirely to a statistical study of the growth of cities during the present cen - tury .

		Of these studies , the most interesting is the one relating to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, written by Mr.
Frank Greene Bates	PERSON	, now assistant professor of history in
Alfred Uni	LOCATION	- versity .

		A review of the early history of that
State	ORGANIZATION	shows how persecution had aroused a fierce spirit of independence , and how an apparently well-grounded fear of absorption by the larger and more powerful States impelled resistance to the formation of a stronger federal government .

		Professor
E. D. Starbuck	PERSON	's work on '' The Psychology of Religion '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is the first notable attempt on any large scale to study statistically such phenomena as conversion , and to correlate them with other phases of mental evolution .

		While much that is merely commonplace is the result , yet the work has considerable value and interest as taking a stand against
Sidis	PERSON	and others who consider all religious phenomena as abnormal .

		Professor Starbuek shows with scientific clearness that such a religious manifestation as conver - sion has its normal place in the mental and physical changes in adolescence , and is a deep-seated social phe - nomenon .

		The work is one which ought to be read dis - criminatingly by parents , teachers , and ministers . ''

		The Poetical Works of
John Milton	PERSON	, '' edited for the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	by the Rev.
H. C. Beeching	PERSON	, offers us in a single handsome volume a text carefully reprinted from the earliest published copies of the sev - eral poems .

		This means that the old spelling and punctuation have been preserved , except for the correc - tion of obvious misprints .

		The editor makes an elabo - rate defense of this decision , but we are sure that most scholars and general readers will applaud what he has done , and find the defense quite unnecessary .

		The most interesting feature of the present edition is its repro - duction of the '' Minor Poems '' of
1645	DATE	, which has never before been reprinted in the original spelling .

		By way of illustrations we are provided with specimens of Mil - ton 's manuscript and with facsimiles of all the original title-pages . ''

Albert S. Cook	PERSON	.

		Professor Cook has already done a considerable amount of pre - vious work upon this poem , and has made some impor - tant discoveries in connection with its sources .

		The edition consists of an elaborate introduction , a text based upon the standard readings , a large body of notes , and a glossary .

		It offers an important and substantial contribution to our Old English scholarship .

		Mr.
James Hay	PERSON	's recent volume on Sir

		Little attempt is made at a critical estimate of

1643	DATE	and Printed before
1700	DATE	. ''

		It is the work of Mr.
W. W. Greg	PERSON	, of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The plan of the handlist arranges the plays under the authors ' names in alphabet - ical order ; then under each playwright the collected edi - tions are given first , followed by the editions of separate plays in chronological order of the first dated editions .

		Anonymous plays are listed at the end .

		It is a great help to accurate studies to find the titles given in full , with the printer 's name , the date , and the place of present possession .

		And in order to make the bibliog - raphy of the great drama complete , Mr.
Greg	PERSON	has wisely included all the works of authors who are known to have written plays , whether extant or not , up to the closing of the theatres in
1642	DATE	.

		Comparing this hand - list of English plays with
Halliwell	PERSON	's antiquated ''
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of Old Plays , '' and the wheat and chaff of
Fleay	ORGANIZATION	's valuable but exasperating `` Chronicle of the English Drama , '' Mr.
Greg	PERSON	's work is a distinct advance in bibliographical scholarship .

		It is admirably simple , concise , and businesslike , and withal modest .

		Not to look a gift horse too closely in the mouth , one might suggest that the list would be more useful if some de - vice had been adopted to make the titles stand out more clearly .

		Dates in the left-hand margin would arrest the eye , or a different type , especially for first editions .

		At .

		all events non-extant plays should have been printed in smaller type .

		So , also , the two indexes , of authors and of plays , would work better if paged .

		As it is , one must know the author 's name to be able to find any particular play .

		Plays in manuscript , masques , pageants , and triumphs , and what are called , rather loosely , `` unclassable productions , '' are purposely omitted with a view to a separate publication .

		The fact that Day 's '' Parliament of Bees '' and
Heywood	PERSON	's pastoral `` Amphrisa '' are classed as `` unclassable , '' suggests vague gaps on closer study of Mr.
Greg	PERSON	's list .

		A com - plete bibliography of the Elizabethan drama upon Mr.
Greg	PERSON	's plan would be a desideratum : Mr.
Greg	PERSON	could easily produce it by combining this first handlist with the one he promises .

		A TWENTIETH CENTURY BOOK .

		About My Father 's Business .

		The work treats of the present social conditions in the churches , showing the lack of force and power in spiritual life by the encroachment upon it of social pleasures ; its reasons for failing to reach the masses ; the abuses of power and influences on the part of some of its rich members , who frequently use the church as a cloak for the advancement of their selfish ambitions and designs .

		While the book has a religious flavor , at the same time it advances some very strong themes of morality and philosophy .

		You should read it .

CAVENDISH	PERSON	had a '' tabby petticoat of a crimson color , and a crimson satin bodice shining over her arms and shoulders like the plumage of a bird , and down her back streamed her curls , shining like gold under her gauze love-hood . ''

		This young lady certainly lends charm to the opening of Miss
Wilkins	PERSON	's first venture in the field of historical romance , nor does the rest of the story belie this auspicious beginning .

		The novel is designedly more subjective than most members of its class , but the development of personality is at no expense of movement or interest , the scene being laid just after
Bacon	PERSON	's Rebellion , and a dramatic incident being the destruction of the young tobacco crop to elude the Navigation Act .

		446 THEORY AND PRACTICE .

		Not long ago there was published in '' The Atlantic Monthly '' an account of '' The Per - plexities of a College President , '' which proved to be an exceptionally entertaining contribu - tion to recent educational literature .

		The pub - lication was anonymous , for reasons that became obvious as one read the article .

		Had it pro- vided entertainment and nothing more , it would not now concern us ; but its easy and pictur - esque style served as the vehicle for a theory of educational administration that we are bound to characterize as both perverse and pernicious , and that deserves to be disentangled from the plausible rhetoric in which it was set forth .

		The writer introduced his subject with an elaborate parallel , filling two pages of the mag - azine , between an old-fashioned stage coach and a modern university .

		The stage coach was drawn by an ill-assorted team of six horses , was itself of antique pattern , and had for passengers a crowd of light-hearted young fellows who knew that the coach was run for them and thought that it ought to be run by them .

		There was an untried driver , the coach had been repainted , and the directors of the company were on hand to witness the start under these new conditions .

		All this is supposed to be a sort of parable .

		The coach and its driver are a university with a new president , the team is the faculty , and the directors are well , they are the directors or trustees .

		The lesson to be conveyed is that , given a faculty whose members are at cross - purposes with one another , and a board of trustees who represent various degrees of ignor - ance and conservatism , the best president in the world can not develope the work of his uni - versity in accordance with the modern demand for progress , efficiency , and unity of aim .

		The theory of the writer is thus expressed : '' When the directors of a great commercial corpor - ation or of some transportation company find it necessary to call a new man to the presidency or to the position of general manager , he is at once given almost absolute authority as to all executive details .

		The
Board of Control	ORGANIZATION	determines the general policy of the company , always after counselling with the new president or man - ager , and then leaves the executive to carry out this policy his success or failure determining the wisdom of their choice of the man . ''

		The commercial analogy thus drawn is devel - 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, oped in much detail .

		The two chief points which the writer makes are that it is the pres - ident 's duty to dismiss all the men who are not likely to act in full sympathy with his ideas of university management , and , having secured a harmonious faculty by the combined processes of expulsion and replacement , to carry out his own policy without calling the `` employees '' into consultation .

		That this statement of the writ - er 's theory , monstrous as it seems , is not an unfair one , may be shown from his own words : `` The same rule ought to apply here as elsewhere : one who can not commend himself to a wisely chosen and properly restrained executive , one who can not cor - dially and enthusiastically cooperate with such an exec - utive along lines of policy determined by the authorities of the university , ought to go elsewhere and ought not to stand upon the order of his going , either . ''

		So much for the first of the writer 's two funda - mental propositions ; for the second the follow - ing quotation will suffice : '' If the manager of a cotton factory should under - take to determine by the vote of all employees where to buy raw material , when to buy , in what quantities to buy , what prices to pay , with what pattern or in what form or in what quantities to manufacture , when and where and on what terms to sell , he would bankrupt his corporation in a single year .

		The philistine idea of a university thus out - lined is already too widely current among the unthinking masses of our people , and this latest argument in its behalf should not pass without a protest .

		When the
New York	LOCATION	`` Nation '' described the article as '' conceived in the spirit and couched in the style of the educational drummer , '' the characterization was not un - duly severe .

		And a correspondent of that journal speaks only the barest truth when he declares that he has never seen a '' more mis - chievous attempt to lower the high ideal of what a college should be . ''

		If we reflect upon that exalted conception of the spirit and pur - pose of an institution for the higher education which has found expression in the writings of so many serious thinkers in
Newman	PERSON	's '' The Idea of a
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' for example we are brought to a forcible realization of the contrast between their inspiring messages and the igno - ble teaching of the writer now under consider - ation .

		A university , in
Newman	PERSON	's view , is a place of '' living teaching , which in course of time will take the shape of a self-perpetuating tradition , or a genius loci , as it is sometimes called ; which haunts the home where it has been born , and which imbues and forms , more or less , and one by one , every individual who is successively brought under its shadow . ''

		A university , in the view of that `` one of the guild '' who now contemptuously rejects all the notions of old-fashioned culture , is an institu - tion something like an insurance company , having a corps of '' employees '' whose duty it is to give unquestioning obedience to the orders of the manager , and to unite with him in set - ting a '' hot pace '' in the competition with rival establishments .

		The writer states with indignation the fact that he knows of a new university president against whom it was once actually scored '' that his methods were too com - mercial , '' and he quotes for condemnation the words , '' He is attempting to run the univer - sity precisely as he would run a woollen factory , '' in which a member of the faculty complained of that new president .

		To put the matter bluntly , our writer is evi - dently of the opinion of a fellow-president whom he represents as `` fully assured in his own mind that if it were possible to dismiss immediately every member of every faculty east of the Alleghanies , not more than one half would be reinstated , and he doubted if more than one third would be . ''

		Yet he complains in the same paragraph that `` positive teaching power is still a rare gift , '' and that `` there are not yet enough strong men to go around . ''

		Does he imagine that the number of strong men available would be greatly increased , say twenty years from now , if the power of arbi - trary dismissal which he advocates were to be held and exercised by any considerable number of college presidents ?

		The dignity of the pro- fession and the security of the tenure consti - tute the chief reasons which now persuade an able man to choose the educational calling ; these are what compensate him in part for the sacrifices that he must make ; for these consid - erations he scorns the delights of material pros - perity and lives the laborious days of the teacher and investigator .

		Anything that weakens se - curity of tenure in the teaching profession at once tends to lower its standard besides dealing a fatal blow to its dignity .

		It is not often that a theoretical .

		discussion finds so apt an illustration as is provided in this case by the affairs of the
University of Cincin	ORGANIZATION	- nati .

		At about the time when this defense of the commercial method of university adminis - tration was on its way through the press , the method was being put into actual practice in the institution just named .

		Last
summer	DATE	the
University of Cincinnati	ORGANIZATION	, having long been without a president , obtained one from a neigh - boring
State	ORGANIZATION	, and a few months later this new incumbent of the position startled the commu -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 427 nity by an arbitrary demand for the resignation of nearly all the members of the faculty .

		The Directors of the
University	ORGANIZATION	stood behind the executive in this action , although it was taken in defiance of the by-laws and before the new executive could have made any real acquaint - ance with the work of his associates .

		The men thus summarily dismissed included several scholars of long service and high distinction , whose work had been uniformly commended for many years in the annual reports of the Direc - tors .

		This high-handed proceeding aroused public indignation to such an extent that great numbers of the most respected citizens rallied to the defense of the faculty , and sought to obtain , if not a reversal of the action , at least a definite statement of the grounds upon which it was taken .

		The Citizens ' Committee was composed of men of such standing that its pro- test was entitled to the most respectful consid - eration .

		This consideration it can hardly be said to have obtained , and its efforts have re - sulted neither in the restoration of the instruct - ors dismissed , nor even in any defense of the act which is deserving of serious consideration .

		From the report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, which is signed by such men as
Rabbi Philipson	PERSON	and the Rev.
Charles F. Goss	PERSON	, we extract the follow - ing sentences : '' It has been clearly established by incontrovertible testimony that these reputable citizens , learned men , competent professors , courteous gentlemen , and life - long promoters of the educational interests of our city were , without previous notice , roughly summoned by the janitor of the building to repair at once to the President 's private office , where , in the presence of a stenographer to record what was said and in the absence of other witnesses to the interview , an imperious demand was made that they at once attach their signa - tures to already prepared resignations ... When the surprised aud mortified victims pleaded for a little time in which to consider the matter , they were promptly informed that unless the prepared resignations were signed , sealed , and delivered before five p. M. on the following day , they would be disgraced by a summary and unconditional dismissal , which he stated he had been empowered to enforce ... Finally , when such threats failed to terrify into subservient submission and abject surrender , his threats were turned to pleadings and promises that if they would sign and preserve abso - lute secrecy in regard to the whole matter he would give them the aid of his commendation and powerful influence in obtaining appointments elsewhere an offer whose ethical nature will scarcely bear investigation ... This by a man who has never had a meeting of his fac - ulty for the purpose of considering or discussing condi - tions , outlining his policy , or in any shape or form indi - cating a desire for changes of any character or kind ; a man who has never visited any of the class rooms , heard a single recitation , or taken any means whatever toward making himself acquainted with the workings of the
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These statements constitute a sufficiently scathing denunciation of a proceeding which must be viewed with apprehension by all who are concerned with the best interests of the higher education .

		Such star-chamber methods are absolutely indefensible , and should excite widespread indignation . ''

		Under the absolute despotism of the present administration , '' says one of the professors whose resignations were demanded , '' the faculty has ceased to be a free deliberative body , and its rightful prerogatives have been disregarded in respect to great uni - versity questions . ''

		That such conditions as these should be possible in any American uni - versity offers an alarming indication of a ten - dency to depart from those principles of univer - sity management which are essential to the wellbeing of every institution of learning .

		The testimony of Professor
P. V. N. Myers	PERSON	, who was not dismissed , but who promptly added his own resignation to those which had been forced from his colleagues , deserves also to be given .

		The scholarship and the character of Professor
Myers	PERSON	need no defense , and his words carry with them much weight .

		He says : '' As a believer in the eternal justice of God , and as a teacher of the supremacy of the law of righteousness in human life and history , I can not consent to work with President
Ayers	PERSON	, as he has asked me to do , in carrying on the future work of
the University	ORGANIZATION	, since by o doing , I should be giving approval to the professional assassi - nation I can not use a less accusing word by a compar - ative stranger , of my colleagues of many years , some of whom I have come to know intimately , and through such knowledge have acquired the right to declare that in their persons has been violated every principle of hu - manity and justice ... For me to remain as a teacher in the
University	ORGANIZATION	under the administration so unhappily inaugurated would be to undo the work of my past life , and to impart a false note to all my instructions I have ever held up before the young men and young women to whom I have had the privilege and honor to stand in the relation of teacher , friend , and guide , as the loftiest ideal of conduct , unswerving fidelity to conscience and the dictates of duty .

		I have told them never to follow ex - pediency , but ever fearlessly to follow close after right and justice , regardless of consequences .

		If I , myself , as I now stand at a parting of ways , should falter and fail to act in accordance with my own teachings , should hesitate , because of the pain and sacrifice that the act involves , to set my feet in the path which is plainly the path of honor and of duty , how could I ever again tell the young of the regnancy of conscience , of the majesty of the eternal laws of righteousness , of the divineness and inviolability of justice , save in words that would ring hollow as sounding brass ? ''

		No technical rejoinder , no amount of sophis - tical reasoning , can avail against the force of this sincere and dignified utterance , supported , as it is , by the respected personality of its distinguished writer .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, MEMOIRS OF ALEXANDER I. AND HIS COURT .

		* The Memoir of the
Countess Choiseul	PERSON	- Gouffier enjoyed a well-merited vogue in its day , three-quarters of a century ago , running rapidly through two liberal editions , which have now , as we learn , shrunk to the spectral dimen - sions of a brace of copies , one of them in the British Museum , the other in the possession of the translator of the comely volume now before us .

		Time has not materially dulled the interest or staled the variety of
Madame Choiseul	ORGANIZATION	-
Gouffier	PERSON	's picturesque and substantial little book ; and we are glad to see it thus revived in a form which should give it a fresh lease of life with a new public .

		The portrait it paints of Alexander I. , while not strictly in accord with the wider verdict of history , has its spe - cial features of truth and grace ; while the charm and animation of the author 's pictures of the events she saw and the circles she moved in are undeniable .

		The Countess de Choiseul-Gouffier , nee de Tisenhaus , was a Polish lady of rank , who was born at
Vilna	LOCATION	in
Lithuania	LOCATION	toward the close of the eighteenth century .

		Of her earlier life the Memoir tells us little , its burden being the writer 's personal recollections of Alexander I. during the dozen or so years of her acquaint - ance with him .

		That acquaintance began in
1812	DATE	at
Vilna	LOCATION	, on the eve of
Napoleon	PERSON	's inva - sion of
Russia	LOCATION	, of which ill-starred enterprise the Countess may be said in a way to have wit - nessed the opening and the close .

		Alexander had set up his military headquarters at
Vilna	LOCATION	, out of compliment perhaps to his Lithuanian subjects , whose loyalty showed signs of waver - ing before the allurements held out by
Napoleon	PERSON	to the quenchless sentiment of Polish national - ism .

		The Countess first met Alexander at
Towiany	LOCATION	, the beautiful country-seat of
Count Moriconi	LOCATION	, near
Vilna	LOCATION	, where the Emperor stayed over night on returning from a review .

		Of this , to her , memorable evening spent at Towiany the author gives a vivacious account filled with instances of the Imperial guest 's winning affa - bility and natural good breeding .

		Alexander , she notes especially , had an infinity of shades * HISTORICAL MEMOIRS OF ALEXANDER I. AND THE COURT OF

		of tone and manner , each nicely adapted to the station or character of the person addressed . ''

		When he addressed men of distinguished rank , it was with dignity and affability at the same time ; to persons of his retinue , with an air of kindness almost familiar ; to women of a certain age , with deference ; and to young people with an infinite grace , a refined and attractive manner , and a countenance full of ex - pression . ''

		Shortly after this meeting at Towiany the Countess had an opportunity of observing a potentate not born to the purple , who impressed her much less favorably than
Alexander	PERSON	.

		Hos - tilities between
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	began , and the Russian policy of continuous retreat was determined on .

		As the French approached
Vilna	LOCATION	the Russians evacuated it , without firing a shot , much to the chagrin of
Bonaparte	PERSON	, who divined what his easy victory portended .

		Dur - ing his stay at
Vilna Napoleon	LOCATION	'' exacted '' a presentation of the ladies of the district at the castle .

		His manners , according to the Countess , savored more of the barrack and the canteen than of the drawing-room . ''

		At the same presentation ,
Napoleon	PERSON	, after having spoken to several ladies , and , according to his custom , asking singular questions , < Are you married ?

		How many children have you ?

		Are they big and fat , hey ? '

		addressed the whole circle and said : ` The
Emperor Alexander	PERSON	is exceedingly amiable , he has gained all hearts here ; are you good Poles ? '

		A general smile served as response . ''

		Napoleon , the author states , had nothing im - posing in his face or manners . ''

		I was astonished not to feel in his presence that emotion which one usually can not prevent at the sight of a celebrated personage .

		All that glory bought with the price of men and blood could not inspire me with enthusiasm .

		The glory of conquerors is made to shine in history , but it is goodness alone which conquers the hearts of men .

		I had often pictured to myself the face of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	with a countenance -LRB- sz ` c -RRB- sparkling with genius .

		What was my surprise and disappointment on seeing only a little , short , fat , waddling man , with sleek , plastered-down hair , with good enough features but little expression in his face , not even that of hard - ness which is found in all the portraits , with the excep - tion of that by
David	PERSON	.

		On the contrary , there was something pleasant in his smile , which showed very handsome teeth .

		From a distance , I confess , his sal - low , white face without a tinge of color , and his antique profile , took on a character of severity , which disap - peared as soon as it was examined near . ''

		The author saw the entry into
Vilna	LOCATION	of the French army , then flushed with the anticipa - tion of victory and spoil ; and she saw rem - nants of it return there , after famine , the snow , and the Cossacks had done their work . ''

		During three or four days the streets of
Vilna	LOCATION	were filled again with a throng of men , I can not say soldiers , since it was impossible to recognize them in that char -

		One had thrown away his helmet and was muf - fled up in a woman 's velvet hood and black satin mantle , under which you could see his spurs .

		Another had wrapped himself in the ornaments and vestments of a church , stoles , chasubles , and altar-cloths all piled upon another to keep out the cold , from which nothing could really protect the men .

		Others , more fortunate in their booty , had thrown about their shoulders ladies ' fur dressing-gowns , with the sleeves tied about their necks .

		Others , again , trailed woolen blankets after them , or , like shades from that place whence one never returns , advanced in grave-clothes and winding-sheets . ''

		After the re-taking of
Vilna	LOCATION	by the Russians there were scenes still more harrowing . ''

		We could not stir into the streets without encount - ering the dead bodies of French soldiers , either frozen to death or murdered by the Jews , who had killed them to get their watches , money , or other articles which they had about them ... Jewish women and even children were seen robbing the dead soldiers , or if they were not quite dead , killing them by kicks with their iron-bound shoes . ''

		The imperial author of all this misery had passed close by
Vilna	LOCATION	on his return to
France	LOCATION	.

		The
Duke of Bassano	ORGANIZATION	, who had seen him , spoke , says the author , '' to me of it the same day , and said he had found the emperor very well and cheerful '' ''
Napoleon	PERSON	breakfasted near
Vilna	LOCATION	, almost at the gates , chatting and joking with the members of his suite and with the
Duke of Bassano	ORGANIZATION	, while the postilion who had driven his horses fell frozen to death . ''

		A fortnight after the retaking of
Vilna	LOCATION	by the Russians the Emperor
Alexander	PERSON	returned there , and during his stay the author had sev - eral conversations with him , which she recounts .

		On one occasion he observed : '' I am badly seconded in my views for the happi - ness of my people , in fact , sometimes I should like to break my head against the wall , on seeing myself sur - rounded by such egotists , who neglect the good and the interests of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and think only of their own for - tune and elevation . ''

		After her marriage to
M. Choiseul-Gouffier	PERSON	, cosmopolite , savant , and erstwhile favorite of
Paul I.	PERSON	, the author resided for the most part at
Paris	LOCATION	, revisiting , however , the North from time to time and renewing her acquaintance with her imperial hero .

		Her conversations with him are faithfully recorded ; and although she notes symptoms of the mental change that darkened his later years , and was so unhappily reflected in his policy at home and abroad , there is no abatement of the note of perf ervid loyalty and admiration that pervades her recollections .

		She accepts without question
Alexander	PERSON	's explana - tion of his abandonment of the cause of the Greek insurgents . ''

		I can not , and I will not -LRB- said the Emperor -RRB- , favor the insurrection of the Greeks , because that step would be contrary to the system which I have adopted , and it would certainly destroy that peace which 1 have tried so hard to establish , a peace so necessary to
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		A `` peace , '' the countess might justly have added , which would have been for the peoples as the peace of death ; for it would have been founded in the strangling of every popular and national aspiration , and the complete restoration of the old social , political , and spiritual order .

		The '' system '' adopted by
Alexander	PERSON	after the
Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle	ORGANIZATION	was indeed one which precluded him from aiding the struggling Greeks , and thus obeying whatever remnants of the generous and liberalizing impulses of his youth he may still have retained .

		The promise of that youth was ill-fulfilled by later years .

		The erstwhile pupil of la
Harpe	LOCATION	, the philanthropic prince who had dreamed of free - ing and educating his people and spreading the light and warmth of the '' new ideas '' through - out his benighted and despot-ridden empire , gradually sank , as we know , into the gloomy and distrustful tyrant , the dupe of Metternich and
Nesselrode	PERSON	, the champion of all that was reactionary and repressive in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Des - potism , said de Maistre , '' breathed from his nostrils . ''

		He died at
Taganrog	LOCATION	in
1825	DATE	, half - demented , worn out by physical excesses , beset by the strangest fancies , unlamented by the people who had hailed his accession as the dawn of a new and glorious era for
Russia	LOCATION	.

		And yet those immediately attached to his person loved him to the last .

		After his death , his old ser - vant
Ilia	PERSON	clung to his remains with dog-like fidelity , following them from
Taganrog	LOCATION	to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, '' and every night , in spite of the intense cold and his advanced age , he slept on the hearse which carried the precious relic . ''

		Madame Choiseul-Gouffier 's portrait of Al - exander is , while partial and incomplete , un - questionably faithful as far as it goes , and it contains elements of truth which must be reck - oned with in forming a well-rounded conception of his complex and enigmatic character a character compounded of strangely assorted and often contradictory qualities .

		Madame Choiseul-Gouffier painted
Alexander	PERSON	as she saw him , adding little or nothing on the credit of hearsay ; and as much may perhaps be said , though less confidently , of another female me - moirist of the Czar ,
Madame de Kriidener	ORGANIZATION	, who also supplied to the sum total of biographical facts her quota of special truths .

		THE FOUR BEST PL.A.TS OF
HAUPTMANN	PERSON	.

		* Some time ago , in writing of the plays of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, I said that it was next to impossible to see , among other plays , '' Die Versunkene Glocke , '' by
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		At that time the play had been given in this country only for a short time , in
New York	LOCATION	, by
Frau Sorma	PERSON	in German .

		Now , however , it has been presented in English .

		When first pre - sented in German , in this country , it was said that there was `` nothing for the stage '' in it .

		But Mr.

		effect on a judgment originally a little harsh .

		Whatever the play may have for the stage , certainly the stage has something for the play .

		Now that it will soon be possible -LRB- it is to be hoped -RRB- for everyone to see this play , which some call
Hauptmann	PERSON	's masterpiece , it is a good time to note that a translation of it , by Mr.
C. L. Meltzer	PERSON	, was published last year , as well as an excellent annotated edition which will be of help to those who like to read the play in German .

		There are also translations by Miss
Mary Morison	PERSON	of '' Einsame Menschen '' and '' Die
Weber	PERSON	. ''

		There is also a translation of '' Hanneles Himmelfahrt '' by Mr.
Archer	PERSON	, which , I believe , has not been republished in this country .

		It is therefore easily possible for anyone to know
Hauptmann	PERSON	's four best plays .

		And these plays are not only his best , but they are fortunately representative of the different directions of his work .

		He is an original man , and his things are by no means all of the same kind .

		In fact , it is proper to say that one of the noteworthy features of '' The Sunken Bell '' is that it is quite unlike the rest of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's work .

		He has written eleven plays .

		Of these , the first was said , by those who did not like it , to out-Zola Zola ; and the same thing might also have been said of the second .

		The third was '' Einsame Menschen '' -LRB- translated under the title of '' Lonely Lives '' -RRB- , which is not so much like Zola as it is like
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		Without laying much stress on the question of influence Zola and Ibsen were almost unescapable influ - ences ten years ago we may say that these first plays were realistic plays , plays in which the chief interest was in the characters , plays which uncovered some of the tragic possibilities of contemporary psychology .

		The first two were crude pictures of manners rather than anything else : plays of solicitous motive , char - acter , dialogue , but hardly developed into the coherence needed for tragedy . ''

		Einsame Menschen '' was more of a true drama : it brought together its dramatic possibilities into an intense focus , without losing anything of the realistic truth of character .

		The next three plays were realistic also .

		Two of them -LRB- '' Der Biberpelz '' and '' College Crampton '' -RRB- are of minor interest . ''

		Die Weber '' -LRB- '' The Weav - ers '' -RRB- , however , was
Hauptmann	PERSON	's first great suc - cess .

		It certainly was a remarkable piece , and must be well known by those who would know the man .

		But although in dramatic technique it is very different from the plays which had gone before , it is not different in spirit .

		It is
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 431 different in dramatic technique because it has no especial action and has no particular char - acters .

		Of course , something takes place , and certain people appear more than once ; but the centre of interest is not in the individuals , it is in the general movement .

		The play presents the rise and failure of a strike among the weavers ; and if the full significance of the movement be gained , the fate of particular weavers is of minor moment .

		This surely is a great departure from the fairly well-ordered tragedy of '' Einsame Menschen . ''

		Still , the two plays are the same in general method : both are realistic in manner .

		The next plays had still further differences : ''
Hannele	PERSON	'' was called '' a dream-poem , '' ''
Florian Geyer	PERSON	'' was an historical drama in verse .

		But in both
Hauptmann	PERSON	was still realistic , if we may indi - cate by that word that he was still absorbed largely in seeing how men and women actually do live and act .

		True , he chose out-of-the-way fields , fields which stretch over toward the do - main of romance .

		Hannele is a poor little girl driven by cruelty to an attempt at suicide .

		She is rescued and carried to the poorhouse , where she sees strange and beautiful visions before she dies .

		Vision and reality are some - times so intermingled that one does not know whether the stage represents the poorhouse room or the disordered brain of the dying child .

		Often , too , we may think that we have not realism , but poetry .

		But there is never a place in the play where we can deny that
Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's chief interest was in watching the rise and fall of the faint little flame of life in its last flickerings before absorption or extinction .

		And ''
Florian Geyer	PERSON	, '' too , although historical , although cast in the romantic period of mediae - val ism , was still an attempt to get at life , to figure a period of social ferment and unrest not unlike our own .

		In fact , in these eight plays we see a realist too large and too genuine to be bound by any simple formula , turning from one motive to another , from one time to another , from one phase of life to another , but always recognizing the limits of particular cases , always selecting some individual forms wherein motive and phase and time had actually manifested them - selves , always presenting these particulars with the strictest adherence to the laws of fact and the necessities of the special case which hap - pened to exhibit them .

		Now '' Die Versunkene Glocke , '' which came next after ''
Florian Geyer	PERSON	, '' is nothing of this sort at all .

		It is labelled a '' marchendrama , '' a fairy play ; its time is a half-legendary period when Christianity has not long conquered paganism ; its characters are not only flesh - and-blood villagers , but elves , woodsprites , nixies ; its action is more of a symbol of some general truth of life than a presentation of any - thing that ever took place .

		It is not realistic at all , unless we call it so from the realities it has been held to symbolize ; it is not only ro - mance , but it is the romance of
Germany	LOCATION	, which is the species farthest removed from realism .

		It is worth mentioning that '' Die
Versun	PERSON	- kene Glocke '' is not the only play of its kind in
Germany	LOCATION	nowadays .

		About one year after
Hauptmann	PERSON	had turned to history and then to romance ,
Sudermann	PERSON	did the same thing .

		First came '' Teja , '' a one-act tragedy of the later days of the Roman Empire ; then ''
Johannes	PERSON	, '' a drama founded on the life and death of the Baptist ; and lastly '' Die drei Reihefedern '' -LRB- '' The Three Heronfeathers '' -RRB- , rather more frankly romantic than
Hauptmann	PERSON	even .

		And it may also be added that although some of the younger dramatists have succeeded in realism for instance ,
Max Halbe	PERSON	in '' Mutter Erde '' others have made a name in romance , and that before '' The Sunken Bell , '' notably Lud - wig
Fulda	LOCATION	with '' Der
Talisman	ORGANIZATION	'' and Ernst Rosmer with '' Die Konigskinder '' -LRB- '' The Children of the King '' -RRB- .

		So we might view the change in
Hauptmann	PERSON	's standpoint as a change in tendency .

		A curious fact , however , is that in his next play , ''
Fuhrmann Henschel	PERSON	, ''
Hauptmann	PERSON	returned to psychologic realism ; nor does he attempt romance in '' Schluck und Jau . ''

		So that '' The Sunken Bell '' stands alone among his works .

		It is , then , not the normal
Hauptmann	PERSON	that we have in this romantic allegory .

		Who is the normal
Hauptmann	PERSON	?

		one may ask .

		Is he the author of ''
Einsame Menschen	PERSON	, '' or of `` Die
Weber	PERSON	, '' or of `` Hannele '' ?

		Neither one nor the other , would be the answer ; but he is the author of all three , and of ''
Florian Geyer	PERSON	, '' too , and of ''
Fuhrmann Henschel	PERSON	'' as well .

		He wrote '' Die Versunkene Glocke , '' doubtless , and so did Ibsen write '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt . ''

		But if one got one 's idea of
Hauptmann	PERSON	from `` Die Versunkene Glocke '' alone , one would be too like the lady who wrote a paper on Dickens after reading only '' A Tale of Two Cities . ''

		She was asked why she had not spoken of
Dickens	PERSON	as a humorist , and answered that she had not known that he had been one .

		If one could read but one play of
Haupt	PERSON	- 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, mann 's , the one to read would be ''
Hanneles Himmelfahrt	PERSON	. ''

		It has enough realism and enough of the romance that life itself has .

		It has the psychology that his admirers long for , but in such form that one is quite free to think it something else .

		It has as true poetry as '' Die Versunkene Glocke , '' and as true human sympathy as '' Die
Weber	PERSON	. ''

		It is , in fact , although the shortest , yet the greatest of its author 's plays .

		Not one other of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's plays but has been equalled by somebody else . ''

		Einsame Menschen '' is not stronger than
Sudermann	PERSON	's '' Heimat '' or
Max Halbe	PERSON	's ''
Mutter Erde	PERSON	, '' which are on something like the same subject . ''

		Die Weber '' is certainly almost sui generis : but it is not quite , being easily paralleled by
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's ' Dawn . '' ''

		Die Versunkene Glocke , '' as has been said , is one of several , even in
Germany	LOCATION	, at the present day .

		But the only drama that reminds me of '' Hannele '' is
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' Mort de
Tinta	LOCATION	- gilis '' ; and this very beautiful work of the Belgian is conceived in such a different mood from ''
Hannele	PERSON	, '' and so lacks that support of firm flesh and blood that makes '' Hannele '' so wonderfully appealing , that we really can not say that the two plays are of the same kind .

		Yet whether our present play be eminently characteristic of
Hauptmann	PERSON	or not , it is a very beautiful play , both to read and to see .

		It is full of the spirit of German myth -LRB- though occasionally with strange anachronisms which are doubtless the result of the modern spirit -RRB- ; it has much charming poetry , it has a well - developed and pathetic motive , it has original and attractive figures .

		I have less interest in its allegory , or symbolism , which has greatly interested the German critics .

		Doubtless
Hein	PERSON	- rich may be taken for one of those figures not rare in literature
Faust	LOCATION	,
Manfred	PERSON	, Brand which are representative of the restless unsatis - fied soul of humanity .

		But then so is Hamlet representative , and so is Prospero ; yet each of these last is also and more especially a per - sonal character .

		So is Heinrich a personal character , a man in whom one may concentrate interest and sympathy .

		True , he is not a very strong man ;
Hauptmann	PERSON	's men are apt to be weaklings , and purposely so :
Alfred Loth	PERSON	in '' Vor Sonnenaufgang , '' and
John Vockerat	PERSON	in ' Einsame Menschen , '' for instance .

		To me , the chief character in the play is not the
Bell	ORGANIZATION	- founder but Rautendelein the
Woodelf	LOCATION	.

		With some other of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's women
Fraulein Anna Mahr	PERSON	, say , and
Hannele	PERSON	she makes , upon me at least , the first and last impression .

		It is not an allegorical impression , or symbol - istic , but a poetic impression .

		I believe I think of
Hauptmann	LOCATION	, on the whole , not as a realist or a romanticist , but rather as a poet .

		As some poets have cast their work largely in dramatic form , so has
Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		If you would realize the matter by contrast , you may put the character of
Fraulein Anna Mahr	PERSON	, just mentioned , beside that of
Magda	PERSON	in Sudermann 's '' Heimath . ''


Suder	PERSON	- mann is a novelist ; and
Magda	PERSON	has all the strength and firmness of a skilful novelist 's work .

		But
Anna Mahr	PERSON	is more delicate , and more pathetic , and more suggestive , and more of a poetic conception .

		Doubtless poets are not apt to be realists .

		But here is one that is .

		He is a dreamer , but a dreamer who is so impressed by waking life that his dreams are not a mere phantasmagoria .

		They are still dreams , but they follow the logic of waking life , and to their author this logic is quite as interesting as anything else .

		We might apply to him the lines put into the mouth of
Heinrich	LOCATION	, with somewhat different meaning : '' I see I feel I know the smallest thing Even to the pattern of this coverlet .

		Each thread each tiny knot I could describe ; And yet I 'm dreaming . ''

American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	who have sought to deliver their liter - ary message to the world in the form of remi - niscences , none have been quite so fortunate as the Bishop of
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		His good fortune consists partly in the time he has selected for this contribution to American literature .

		The end of a century naturally finds the popular mind prepared to be entertained with historical and biographical gossip .

		Bishop
Whipple	PERSON	, by reason of the peculiar position he has main - tained in both
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	throughout half a century , by the width of his experiences , his keen sense of humor , and his unbounded optimism , is eminently qualified to gratify this popular interest .

		If the fault be found that in his sumptuous octavo volume of 576 pages -LRB- including appendices and index -RRB- he has paid little regard to chronological sequence in the * LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF A LONG EPISCOPATE .

		Being Reminiscences and Recollections of the Right Reverend
Henry Benjamin Whipple	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , Bishop of
Minne	LOCATION	- sota .

		With portrait of the Author , and other illustrations .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL arrangement of the incidents he relates , it may be replied that the book is not intended to be an autobiography nor a contribution to history .

		One of its chief charms -LRB- and it is a charming book -RRB- lies in the naive artlessness with which the Bishop tells the story , or perhaps more properly the stories , of the stirring times in which he has lived .

		Not but that the Bishop possesses valuable historical materials for which coming generations might be grateful .

		Upon the relations of our government and of our civilization to the Indians , for example , the Bishop could tell a story that would be of ines - timable value .

		To this subject he has devoted a large part of his book and more than sixty - five pages of appendices .

		His life also furnishes many elements of a successful biography .

		But the general reader has reason to be grateful that in forestalling the post-mortem biographer and taking the law in his own hands he has written reminiscences and recollections rather than an autobiography .

		Bishop W hippie belongs to a family that furnished sixteen heroes to the Colonial and Revolutionary wars and two signers of the Declaration of Independence .

		That he should hold the post of Chaplain-General of the
Socie	PERSON	- ties of the Sons of the Revolution and Colonial Wars of the
United States	LOCATION	, seems logical and appropriate .

		He is a native of the state of
New York	LOCATION	.

		He does not tell us , but it is be - traying no confidence to state , that his birth year was
1823	DATE	.

		After his school days , by the advice of a physician he entered active business .

		He was attracted to political life , was appointed
Division Inspector of Militia	ORGANIZATION	, and was once secretary of a convention for the nomination of state officers .

		His career in the ministry began in
1849	DATE	, and some fears were expressed that he might have spoiled a good politician to make an in - different clergyman .

		But he did neither .

		As early as
1853	DATE	he became acquainted with Southern life .

		In
1856	DATE	he organized a parish in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and introduced the free church system in that city .


Three years later	DATE	he was consecrated the first Bishop of
Minnesota	LOCATION	, a Diocese then including more than eighty-three thousand square miles of territory , and now reduced to twenty-six thousand square miles .

		The usual career of an
American Diocesan Bishop	ORGANIZATION	was varied in his case by winters spent in
Florida	LOCATION	, by some foreign travel -LRB- he attended the first Lambeth Conference and preached the opening sermon before that Conference in
1888	DATE	-RRB- , by building the first Protestant
Cathe	PERSON	- dral in
America	LOCATION	, by a most interesting work among the Swedes , by the founding of schools at
Faribault	LOCATION	, and by the establishment of hos - pitals and other charitable institutions .

		He had , in fact , become so well known , both at home and abroad , that in
1871	DATE	he was offered the Bishopric of
Hawaii	LOCATION	under the English Church .

		And later he became a Trustee of the
Peabody Board for Educational	ORGANIZATION	work in the South .

		But the Bishop 's chief distinction was gained by reason of the existence in his Diocese of large numbers of Indians with whom the work of the extension of the Church had but just be - gun , and was , up to the time of his consecration , meeting with but partial success .

		For a deep interest in the welfare of these people he was prepared by his ordinarily warm sympathies , and by his previous experiences he was prepared to be especially helpful .

		His efforts to better the condition of the red men were not popular .

		He had to confront government officials and make scathing exposures of their official incom - petence or worse .

		He went about armed with documentary evidence of the truth of state - ments he had to make .

		He learned the Indian character , and how to interpret the message of the Gospel so that it might be understood by them .

		As a result he not only gathered Indian congregations into the fold of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, but he trained and educated and ordained a native ministry .

		Both in
America	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	his title of '' The Apostle to the Indians '' is recognized .

		So thorough was his knowledge of the wrongs done to the Indians that he was requested to write an introduction to Mrs.
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	's '' Century of Dishonor . ''

		So efficient did he prove himself in his labors for the amelioration of the distressing condition of the Indians that he won their unbounded confidence and was many times made a member of important Com - missions sent by the government to make trea - ties with them .

		A life so full of varied incidents could not fail to furnish a fund of anecdotes , and the Bishop would have been hiding his talent in a napkin if he had not become an accomplished raconteur .

		Some of his stories are thrilling to the borders of the dramatic , as , for example , his encounter with a lunatic armed for the purpose of shooting him .

		His reminiscences abound in anecdotes from which we predict that the clergy will draw for many years to come .

		They are illustrative of the ups and downs of ministerial life , and of the Indian character .

		Those be - 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, longing to the latter class are probably of the freshest interest , and the specimens here given are selected more because of their brevity than otherwise .

		The Bishop once undertook to reprove Wa - basha for having a Scalp-Dance in front of the
Mission House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The chief was smoking , but when I had finished he took his pipe from his mouth , and slowly blowing a cloud of smoke into the air said : ' White man go to war with his own brother ; kills more men than
Wabasha	LOCATION	can count all his life .

		Great Spirit look down and says , '' Good white man ; he has My Book ; I have good home for him by and by . ''

		Dakota has no
Great Spirit	ORGANIZATION	's Book ; he goes to war , kills one man , has a foolish scalp-dance .

		Great Spirit very angry .

		Wabasha does n't believe it ! ' ''

		`` Indians are keen judges of character .

		A lawyer , who was reputed to be not over-scrupulous in his deal - ings , was employed by an Indian to draw up some papers .

		On paying his fee , the Indian asked for a re - ceipt and was told that a receipt would not be necessary .

		The Indian insisted upon having one , and when ques - tioned as to his anxiety about the matter , replied , ' Since becoming a Christian I have been very careful in all my dealings that I may be ready for the judgment , and when that day comes I do n't want to take time to go to the bad place to get my receipt from you . ''

		The Indians are quick at repartee . ''

		An Indian agent , who was a militia colonel , desired to impress the Indians with the magnitude of his dignity .

		He dressed himself in full uniform , with his sword by his side , and rising in the council told them that one reason why the Great Father had had so much trouble with his red children was that he had sent civilians to them . '' '

		You are warriors , ' he said , and when the Great Father saw me he said , '' I will send this man who is a great warrior to my red children who are warriors , and they will hear his words . '' ' ''

		An old chief arose , and surveying the speaker from head to foot , said calmly : ` Since I was a small boy I have heard that white men had great warriors .

		I have always wanted to see one .

		I have looked upon one , and now I am ready to die . ' ''

		Their sense of justice is thus illustrated : ''
Shakopee	ORGANIZATION	, one of the leaders in the -LSB-
Minnesota	LOCATION	-RSB- massacre of
1862	DATE	, was a prisoner in
Fort Snelling	LOCATION	under sentence of death .

		He said to Dr.
Daniels	PERSON	, who was visiting him : '' What will the white men do to me ? ' '

		I think you will be hanged , ' the doctor answered .

		`` With a quiet smile ,
Shakopee	ORGANIZATION	replied : < I am not afraid to die .

		When I go into the spirit world I will look the
Great Spirit	ORGANIZATION	in the face and I will tell Him what the whites did to my people before we went to war .

		He will do right .

		I am not afraid . ' ''

		A clergyman who was visiting Captain
Jack	PERSON	-LRB- head chief of the Modocs -RRB- in prison , after de - scribing heaven as a place where the streets were paved with gold and the houses built of precious stones , said : '' ' And if you repent of your wickedness in fighting good white men , the
Great Spirit	ORGANIZATION	will permit you to go to this place . ' ''

		Captain
Jack	PERSON	listened politely , and then asked , ' Do you think you will go to that place ? ' '' '

		Yes , ' was the answer , if I should die to-day , I should be there before night . ' ''

		If you will take my place , ' was the response , ' and be hanged to-morrow , I will give you forty ponies . ' ''

		The offer was not accepted . ''

		Red Cloud , having been asked for a fare - well toast at a public dinner , arose and said : '' When men part they look forward to meet - ing again .

		I hope that one day we may all meet in a land where white men are not liars . ''

		President
Cleveland	LOCATION	once asked Bishop
Whipple	PERSON	what he thought the effect would be of making the Indians voters . ''

		I told him that we had tried it , at which he ex - pressed surprise .

		We had a territorial law , ' I ex - plained , ' that Indians wearing civilized dress might vote .

		At an election some one said , ' Wait till you hear from
Pembina	ORGANIZATION	! '

		When they heard from
Pembina	ORGANIZATION	they learned that a band of Indians had been put into hickory shirts and trousers between sunrise and sunset , and had become voters .

		The President smiled and said , ' I see how it may work . ' ''

		It is due to the cheerful optimism of Bishop
Whipple	PERSON	that the lights are the more abun - dant than the shadows in his
Long Episcopate	LOCATION	.

		Among the illustrations are some facsimiles of letters which add interest to a book which is full of interest .

		THE PEOPLE AND RULERS OF THE NETHERLANDS .

		* The publication , in 1892-3 , of Volumes I. and II .

		of a '' History of the People of the Netherlands , '' by
Petrus Johannes Blok	PERSON	, Pro- fessor of
Dutch History	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Leyden	ORGANIZATION	, at once won for the author a distin - guished place among European scholars .

		This work is now offered in English in slightly abridged form , and constitutes a valuable addi - tion to historical literature for English readers .

		The scope of the work is indicated by this statement , in the preface : '' Such a history as the author wishes to write em - braces all the manifestations of the life of the people , the political history as well as the history of civilization , commerce , industry , agriculture , navigation , law , and economic development .

		To the history of the Dutch people in its widest sense this work is devoted .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 435 civilization from the past .

		Our time asks of the his - torian with ever greater emphasis , How has our society become what it is ? ''

		The author has , in the main , accomplished his purpose .

		Facts and deductions therefrom are stated for periods of Netherlandish history heretofore beyond the reach of the ordinary student .

		Characteristics and conditions im - portant to a correct understanding of the devel - opment of the people are enlarged upon , in distinct chapters , for each social class and for each element in any way instrumental in the formation of the modern Netherlandish states .

		It is safe to say that criticism is challenged only in the plan adopted , wherein Dr.
Blok	PERSON	has sacrificed the sense of historical sequence and correlation to his desire to fix the reader 's attention upon the subject-matter of each chapter .

		It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of any given social order in a particular epoch , or to grasp the inter - relation of the separate elements of the growing nations .

		Turning to the method of treatment , we find an avowed attempt has been made to use the semi-philosophical system which makes the '' Short History of the English People '' such delightful reading .

		This treatment is here not altogether successful .

		The charm and value of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's work , in spite of some inaccuracies of statement , lie in the careful elimination of all those non-essential facts of English history which do not serve to elucidate an analysis of social and political conditions .

		Then , too , the essential facts are so interwoven with the philo - sophical examination as not to tire the reader by detailed statements .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	makes his analysis of conditions a sharp , clear-cut , forci - ble analysis , which ill prepares the reader for what follows a detailed and frequently weari - some account of historic incidents .

		Still , it is so unusual to find a continental historian who recognizes any obligation beyond a classified and orderly presentation of the facts for which he has been laboriously digging , that in this case the author should rather be commended than condemned .

		His analyses are brilliant , his facts dryly stated ; he has yet to find the right system of combination .

		A point of unusual interest in the second volume is the conception of the character and influence of Charles the Rash of
Burgundy	LOCATION	.

		This chief among the opponents of French Royalty is familiar to historical readers as the possessor by inheritance of a great domain and vast wealth .

		Lacking the requisite adminis - trative ability , and impelled by a controlling impetuousness which made him blind to inevit - able consequences , he steadily dissipated his possessions .

		His schemes for a Burgundian Kingdom are regarded as chimerical , his admin - istration as directed by the chance temper of the moment , while the failure of his plans and his tragic death are but the logical result of unconsidered action .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	does not proclaim himself a de - fender of Charles the Rash , nor does he urge a new light upon his character .

		He does , how - ever , force genuine admiration for the character of that prince , in a careful examination of the results of his work .

		The details of his govern - ment and administration , noted in various chapters , with the author 's criticism thereon , exhibit in Charles an ideal of government indi - cative of statesmanlike qualities not general in the fifteenth century , a broadness of view and ambition creditable to any ruler , and a real genius in the government of his widely sepa - rated dominions .

		Like Richelieu in
France	LOCATION	,
Charles	PERSON	intended to centralize , in administra - tion , in justice , and in finance .

		His purposes and plans as viewed to-day were admirably conceived , and many of them took deep root in Netherlandish institutions .

		Thus , Dr.
Blok	PERSON	emphasizes the service performed by
Charles	PERSON	in the destruction of numerous petty judicial rights of the provinces , and the substitution of a court system imperial in its scope though not in name .

		Nor does the failure of the Bur - gundian Kingdom , for which Charles inces - santly labored , justify the conclusion generally accepted that his project was merely the dream of an over ambitious man .

		Success was , indeed , very near , and the ultimate failure seems rather the chance of mischievous ill-fortune than the logical result of an ill-considered plan .

		Unlike Richelieu ,
Charles	PERSON	did not finally succeed in crushing out those separatist tendencies which endangered the unity of his rule .

		Failing to succeed , historians have called him '' the Rash '' ; clearly he deserved the appellation in the later years of his rule , but it was then the rash - ness of despair , and of a mind distraught by the unexpected and sudden overthrow of a political edifice painfully erected by many years of patient labor .

		The true test of merit , for the claimant to historical honors , lies in the permanence of his labors and in their effect for good upon later forms of governmental insti - tutions .

		Judged by this standard , few rulers of the Burgundian territory deserve so much credit as does he who figures in history as the THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, destroyer of his Kingdom by the violence of his temper .

		The '' History of the People of the Nether - lands , '' in spite of the difficulty of details en - countered by the reader , is a scholarly produc - tion , inspiring to the student by its occasional luminous characterization and valuable by its wealth of authorities and classification of sources .

		Each volume contains excellent maps and a carefully prepared index .

		SOCIAL DISCUSSION AND REFORM .

		* In his work on '' The Development of English Thought , '' Professor
Patten	PERSON	has chosen bis economic material from the mother country because her insular position and the freedom of her government have left the process of intellectual development compara - tively unhindered .

		The theory illustrated is thus stated : '' Survival is determined and progress created by a struggle for the requisites of which the supply is insufficient .

		These requisites are the goods for which men strive or the means by which they may avert evils .

		the several objects in which the interests of the race are centred .

		With the new objects come new activities and new requisites for survival .

		To meet these new conditions , the motives , instincts , and habits of the race are modified ; new modes of thought are formed ; and thus , by the modification of institutions , ideals , and customs , all the character - istics of the civilization are reconstructed . ''

		The body of the work is given to an account of the journey of a student of philosophy into the world of the economist .

		Literature and history are seen through an economist 's eyes .

		We follow the author through the statement of his theory , a psychological and biological discussion of environment , race ideals , social stratification , stages in the progress of thought , curves of thought .

		Mankind he divides into four classes , whose odd titles provoke irreverent mirth at the first reading : the Clingers , Sensualists ,
Stal	PERSON	- warts , and Mugwumps .

		The types are described by the epithets ; and the history of English thought is the story of the struggle of these classes for exist - ence and control .

		Mandeville 's '' Fable of the Bees '' is made a new starting-point for the treatment of the writers of the eighteenth century ,
Hume	PERSON	,
Adam Smith	PERSON	, and
Whitefield	LOCATION	.

		Under the title '' Economists '' we have not only
Ricardo	PERSON	,
Malthus	PERSON	, and Mill , but also
Darwin	PERSON	, the English poets , and the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		Throughout the volume are scattered acute and ingenious interpretations of particular writers and currents of speculation .

		It is in the last chapter that the author 's position comes out most clearly .

		The key to this position is the biological phrase '' condition of survival . ''

		Certain economic conditions will dominate the future and create the economic pressure out of which the movement of thought will proceed .

		The unity of the race is said to be not environmental but psychic ; the race ideals and social standards are not the mere reflection of external conditions , but are the products of psychic activity .

		But if the advance thought does not prove of permanent ad - vantage , the race which accepts it dies out and others take the place .

		Science exercises its power by creating new economic conditions , and these modify national thought .

		A great invention changes the conditions of survival and allows a new type of man to succeed .

		The
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	did not kill superstition with lectures . ''

		Superstition died when men got regular employment and three meals a day .

		The habits of thought creating superstition come from an irregular life and from the impossibility of predicting future events or of providing for future needs . ''

		Dyspepsia creates new superstitions and inclines men to swallow quack remedies . ''

		Cheap food and a sugar diet make the conditions out of which the thought movement of the present epoch will proceed . ''

		Alcohol drinkers will be exterminated by the industrial order , and sugar-eaters will sur - vive and possess the land .

		But appetite for sweets must be held under control , or Bright 's disease and apoplexy will catch them .

		`` The elimination of sensual men , and of women made inactive by art ,
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 437 literature , and a sugar diet , are the prominent causes of modifications in the national character .

		Economic experience and thinking lead upward to religion . ''

		Such are some of the author 's positions and conclu - sions .

		We are here dealing with a man of learning and profound reflection .

		Yet there is something lacking .

		One is compelled to ask , when all has been told as to the '' conditions of survival , '' whether survival is the end of living , and whether there may not he a tolerance of many styles of character among the survivors .

		To account for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in the most complete sense , can we get all the help we need from economic conditions ?

		The translation of
Signer Loria	PERSON	's powerful hook , '' The Economic Foundations of Society , '' will ex - tend the influence of one of the ablest of Italian economists .

		It does not seem likely that his theory of the progress of society can be generally accepted as complete and final , but this work presents in a powerful light one of the forces of evolution and suggests many points of fruitful speculation .

		The point most insisted on is that the origin of society , of its institutions , its ethics , its spiritual ideals , is to be accounted for on economic grounds .

		The author 's preface is a challenge to idealists : '' The book re - vealed the secret to the world ; it boldly declared , what no one had had the courage to say , that cu - pidity , narrow , mean egoism , and class spirit ruled in our so called democracies ; it ruthlessly unmasked the political deities that the world had been in the habit of invoking with pompous phrases , and , rais - ing the veil that covered them , it showed that where we had expected to find the mystical
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, there was only a yawning , greedy crocodile . ''

		The idealist , however , may still take his stand at two lines of defense : first , when he denies that economic forces are the sufficient explanation of social origins ; and , secondly , when he insists that '' economic '' motives are themselves composed of all human desires which call for material means of satisfaction .

		While we are reading , in parallel columns of our daily newspapers , detailed accounts of street-car riots in
Berlin	LOCATION	and
St. Louis	LOCATION	, of bloody assaults and threatened bankruptcies in building trades in Chi - cago , and of ill-suppressed hate and rebellion in industrial circles almost everywhere , it is refreshing to learn of one little oasis where men can discuss their business differences without resort to duel and vendetta .


New Zealand	LOCATION	some years ago grew weary of the mediaeval barbarism of industrial war - fare , and also of modes of voluntary arbitration without legal support .

		The community did not choose a scheme of arbitration which would simply create a combination of employers and trades unions in a conspiracy to raise prices for the great con - suming public .

		They resolved to protect the com - mon welfare by legislation and judicial process .

		Mr.
H. D. Lloyd	PERSON	, in his account of '' A Country Without Strikes , '' has told the story in plain , intel - ligible , and convincing form .

		It is not probable that
America	LOCATION	will heed his lesson and prophecy at once .

		The partial and tentative methods must be further tried until their essential fallacies have been shown and their costly educational work has been done .

		The
New Zealand	LOCATION	experiment is carried on in a small country under peculiar conditions , and its law will undergo many modifications ; but it gives the only rational promise for a certain and just decision of class controversies and partisan strife .

		The timeliness and practical wisdom of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's little book should procure for it a wide reading .

		In `` The Theory of the Leisure Class , '' Mr.
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	discusses the place and value of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life .

		The grounds of class distinctions are sought in primitive institutions .

		Property and ownership had their origin in emulation during a period of predatory acquisition .

		The enslavement of women was a part of the process .

		Economic production , useful drudgery , fell to women and other slaves .

		Exploitation became the business of nobles and the reputable .

		The productive industries became shame - ful .

		Possession of wealth without labor marked the superior race and the ruling class .

		Government was instituted , and is still maintained , as the means of keeping the exploiters in possession .

		The con - ventional marks of this superiority are conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption .

		The author distinctly disavows any purpose to test the canons of taste , art , fashion , and ceremony by any standard except the economical ; and the reader must , in fairness , bear this claim in mind .

		The author pro- ceeds with the cool temper of pure intelligence , the calculation of an '' economic man . ''

		We should give him credit for absolute sincerity when he affirms repeatedly that he has no ethical , aasthetical , or transcendental criterion in mind .

		His style is chilled steel : hard , cold , and sharp .

		Its light is dry and frosty .

		The word '' socialism '' is scrupu - lously avoided , but the arguments made familiar by socialists gleam through the sentences of every chapter .

		The sole test of institutions , in this book , is their economic or industrial usefulness .

		Useful - ness , apparently , is nowhere defined ; but we may get light from the definition of '' waste '' : '' It is not to be taken in an odious sense , as implying an ille - gitimate expenditure of human products or life .

		In the view of economic theory the expenditure in question is no more and no less legitimate than any other expenditure .

		It is here called ' waste ' be - cause this expenditure does not serve human life or well-being on the whole , not because it is waste or misdirection of effort or expenditure from the stand - point of the individual consumer who chooses it . ''

		That is '' waste '' which does not enhance well-being on the whole ; which fails to promote the generically human , the collective good .

		An impartial judgment of the conclusions would be easier if the author had given us a nearer view of his standard of usefulness .

		While we must accept his disclaimer that he does not mean to apply any but strictly `` economic '' texts to contemporary customs , those who practice 438 THE DIAL these customs must be very thick-skinned if they can read his pages without wincing or revolt .

		The hook is too strong to be thrust aside .

		It is an academic , subtle , and acute phrasing of what the working men , '' conscious of their goal , '' are saying about us in every shop and
Sunday	DATE	trades council .

		Here lies a great merit of the book , in spite of a somewhat evasive manner of approach : it compels the '' respectable '' class to see themselves as others see them , if they care for that accomplishment .

		A banker , on reading about himself here , will per - haps not like to be classed among the '' predatory '' classes even if nothing '' odious '' is intended .

		A lawyer will hardly look a second time for the Pick - wickian sense of this characterization : '' The pro- fession of the law does not imply large ownership ; but since no taint of usefulness , for other than the competitive purpose , attaches to the lawyer 's trade , it grades high in the conventional scheme .

		The lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud , either in achieving or in checkmat - ing chicane , and success in the profession is therefore accepted as marking a large endowment of that barbarian astuteness which has always commanded men 's respect and fear . ''

		In the most polite way a comparison is set up between delinquents , gam - blers , and business men . ''

		Patriotism '' is identified with the martial spirit , and this with the barbarian virtues of ferocity and pitilessness .

		Boys ' brigades and athletic sports are explained by the leisure - class morality of barbarian love of cruelty and fraud .

		The training for foot-ball leads to a '' rehabilitation and accentuation of those ferine traits which make for damage and desolation . ''

		Truculence and clan - nishness are the marks of the athlete .

		There is one more mark , common to criminals , gamblers , and classical scholars , anthropomorphic worship , which is part of the leisure class machinery for holding up the regime of status and subservience , although this is without conscious purpose .

		After reading many pages devoted to this scalping and skinning process , a priest , a captain of industry , or a classical scholar may be soothed and mollified by reading -LRB- p. 265 -RRB- : '' The exigencies of the language make it impossible to avoid an apparent implication of disapproval of the apitudes , propensities , and expressions of life here under discussion .

		It is , however , not intended to imply anything in the way of deprecation or commendation of any one of these phases of human character or of the life process . ''

		Grim pleasantry aside , we have here to deal with a man who cuts deep and means to be true and candid .

		Many who need his message will not read it , or will throw it aside in anger and contempt .

		It is one-sided .

		It confessedly leaves in the background the values of the higher existence , and discusses chiefly the proximate means of welfare .

		The defi - nition of the '' economic man '' seems , save from the author 's standpoint , a very low and narrow one to one of the '' respectable '' class .

		The omission of the real aesthetic , ethical , and spiritual elements of welfare seems to leave even industry without an explanation .

		Yet here is a quiet , stern , honest man , who compels the reader to face reality in one of its aspects .

		Better to '' pick out treasure from an earthen pot '' than miss the gem through pride or fear or prejudice .

		Professor
Veblen	PERSON	has stated with unusual clearness the explanation of the famil - iar fact that many reforms have been started from the '' lower classes '' ; ideas of betterment which seemed revolutionary and even absurd to educated and cultivated men , yet were finally accepted by all as reasonable .

		The demands of the peasants in Luther 's day ; the claims of the Chartists in En - gland ; the propositions for factory legislation which were commonly rejected by upper class econ - omists and statesmen , these may be taken as ex - amples .

		Christianity may offer parallels : '' Do any of the rulers believe ? ''

		The explanation seems reasonable and adequate : the poor feel the pressure of new conditions long before the stress comes upon the sheltered leisure class .

		Professor
Veblen	PERSON	illus - trates , by this book , a new element in the move - ment of our day , the intense and profound revolt of scholars and independent thinkers against the dictation of the money power in the field of thought .

		The force of literary sarcasm may come to be felt , and the attempt to suppress it by arts known to the rulers must provoke a worse reaction .

		It is fortunate for the general reader that he has a reliable and readable translation of that one of Tarde 's recent discussions which presents his views of social psychology in a somewhat systematic form , under the title '' Social Laws . ''

		The heads of the treatise are the repetition of phenomena , the oppo - sition of phenomena , and the adaptation of phe - nomena .

		The speculations are very suggestive , and the clear and brilliant style of the author should win for him a wide reading . ''

		Better - World Philosophy , '' by Mr.
J. Howard Moore	PERSON	, is a strong plea for social control in the interest of the entire community ; an argument for the predominance of altruism in education , politics , and all life .

		The element of progress most insisted upon is education , the conscious effort of contem - porary society to shape to higher forms the mem - bers of the coming race .

		It is possible to present a very dark picture of the existence of pauperism , crime , and attendant miseries , without leaving the basis of facts . ''

		He - redity and Human Progress '' recites the story with strong realism , with the insight of a physician and with literary skill .

		The failure of charity and reformatory measures is argued from abundant resources of illustration .

		Heredity is declared to be the principal source of all the weakness and perversity which occasion dependency , defect , and crime .

		Then comes the remedy , all else hav - ing failed : the painless extermination by the use of carbonic acid gas of all those who are depend - ent on the public as paupers , degenerates , and habitual criminals .

		Most of us will think that such a wholesale slaughter of perhaps a hundred thou - sand of the feeble-minded , and nearly the same
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL number in each class of criminals , drunkards , epi - leptics , in a single day or year , is hardly to be taken seriously .

		The author does not count on very speedily obtaining a majority as friends of his panacea , because '' sentiment '' is against him .

		But sentiment is a fact which makes his scheme impos - sible , according to his own principle : '' All wise legislation has a care for expediency , and the present plan aims not at the theoretical best , but at the best which is practicable , with least resistance from the people . ''

		Most students and practical men would reject his plan quite apart from '' sentiment '' ; since they believe it is a return to processes of elim - ination which belong to unmoral nature and un - taught savages ; that there is a better method in segregation , possibly supplemented by steriliza - tion ; and that these methods , so far from having failed , are steadily reducing the evils which are here so graphically depicted .

		One can advocate '' stirpiculture '' with entire conviction , without feel - ing it necessary to kill at a stroke several hundred thousands of helpless human beings , while leaving untouched and unreformed those vicious social ar - rangements which would immediately produce an - other multitude of defectives within two generations .

		The author accounts for the transmission of traits by inheritance , but does not adequately account for the origin of defects in a bad environment .

		In Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	, the famous newspaper re - former of slums and tenement-house evils , we find a man who emphasizes environment rather than heredity , and believes that it is worth while to im - prove conditions .

		He dedicates `` A Ten Years ' War '' to '' the faint-hearted and those of little faith . ''

		The antidote for fatalism and pessimism lies in such chapters as the breezy reporter has written .

		He has studied the anatomy and pathology of crowded cities , as the author of '' Heredity and Progress '' has studied brains and physical transmission of traits ; and the conclusion is very different .

		The deterioration of physical structure , vitality , and intellectual energy , is traced to the miserable sur - roundings which are the product of neglect and cowardice .

		Very instructive and inspiring is the Account of the strategical methods of those who succeeded in correcting many of the evils which curse the metropolis .

		The resident chaplain of
San Quentin	LOCATION	prison ,
California	LOCATION	, the Rev.
August Drahms	PERSON	, has given us the results of his observation and reflection upon the phenomena of crime .

		Lombroso furnishes an introductory note , in which he declares that he finds the author in substantial agreement with his own positions , except when it is said that the American criminal differs in physiognomical type from his European contemporary .

		The topics treated are the instinctive criminal , the habitual criminal , the single offender , the demography of crime , the juve - nile offender and the reformatories , hypnotism and crime , and practical suggestions in relation to pun - ishment , reformation , and prevention .

		The very proof we have wanted to show that ' . '

		Friendly Visiting '' is practicable is given us by
Miss Richmond	LOCATION	, in her book with that title .

		She not only writes inspiringly , but she tells us just what to do and how to go about doing it .

		Charity Organ - ization is a lifeless thing without this personal service .

		The hired agent can never perform the duty of the well-to-do , vicariously and at long range .

		Those who make real reports from the unknown country of misery must travel and reside with the indigent , and become their genuine partners in struggle .

		This small volume tells the aspirant how to help the bread - winner , to gain the confidence of the home-maker , to watch over the children , to become a missionary of sanitary science , of thrift , and of rational pleasure .

		The directions in respect to relief and the relations of the Church to charity are eminently wise .

		A good discussion of methods is found in Miss
Brown	PERSON	's book on `` The Development of Thrift . ''

		The charity visitor and settlement worker should master the principles and devices of this volume , which presents in elementary form the most prac - tical aspects of schemes for saving , building and loan associations , banks , provident loan societies , insurance and friendly societies .

		The books of Miss
Brown	PERSON	and of
Miss Richmond	LOCATION	are good text - books for the students of clubs and circles of workers among the dependent poor .

		For the social student who interests himself in the temperance reform , the able and impartial work of Mr.
Koren	PERSON	on '' Economic Aspects of the Liquor Problem '' will be found indispensable .

		There is no attempt to cover ground already occupied by the Twelfth Annual Report of the
Federal Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	and the Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the
Massachusetts Bureau of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		Entirely new fields of investigation have been exploited : the re - lations of the liquor problem to poverty and desti - tution , to crime , to negroes , and the saloon as a distributing agency of liquor in cities .

		It is inter - esting to observe one of the indirect advantages of the records of the charity organization societies which many have unreflectingly denounced as `` red tape . ''

		In this volume , their painstaking study of causes of destitution becomes fruitful and instructive .

		A valuable bibliography closes this important contri - bution to the literature of the subject .

		Very much of current discussion of the negro problem is wide of the mark because it is based on fragmentary observations and inadequate materials .

		There is great need of systematic and thorough local studies of the conditions of life under which col - ored people live in our great cities .

		A model for such studies is found in the brilliant essay of a colored student and teacher who has won distinc - tion by his writings .

		Professor
W. E. B. Du Bois	PERSON	has collected a vast amount of information in relation to the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	negro , his history , domestic relations , education , occupations , health , organized associations , crime , pauperism , social consideration and opportunities , and political out - look .

		Miss
Isabel Eaton	PERSON	, fellow of the
College Settlements ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, has added a valuable re - 440 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, port on the domestic service of the colored people .

		When similar local studies are made , as they ought to be made , in other cities , and in rural communi - ties , the general plan of this investigation will be found very useful .

		The principal of the famous school for negroes at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	,
Alabama	LOCATION	, Mr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	, has rendered his race and the nation a valuable service by setting forth his views of '' The Future of the American Negro '' in systematic form .

		He urges in - dustrial education as the chief present need of his race , but he is too broad a man to ignore other factors in instruction and political action .

		Not only for the sake of the colored people , but for the sake of the na - tional honor and security , it is to be hoped that this book will have a wide reading .

		It is by no means the last word on the educational problem , but it is an important contribution and deserves public consid - eration in the North as well as in the South . ''

		Good Citizenship '' is the title of a collection of twenty - three essays on social , personal , and eco - nomic problems , edited by Messrs.
J. E. Hand	PERSON	and
Charles Gore	PERSON	.

		These papers touch , in a popular way , current topics of great interest , as the functions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, housing of the people , old-age pensions , poor laws , socialism , and the duties of religious people in relation to such matters .

		The discussion is carried on by English writers in the spirit of '' Christian Socialism . ''

		The sub-title `` The Story of a Workingman 's
Club	ORGANIZATION	, its search for the causes of poverty and social inequality , its discussions , and its plan for the ame - lioration of existing evils '' of Mr.
David Lubin	PERSON	's '' Let There Be Light '' is an indication of the wan - dering of a modern Ulysses in the world of social confusion .

		The discussions are reported in the form of a story without a plot .

		The plan is simply a skeleton of topics , and a resolution to form a kind of ethical culture society or
Universal Church	ORGANIZATION	for further discussion of schemes of betterment .

		The work affords no practical proposition within the field of economic or legal organization .

		`` The Regeneration of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
W. M. Grinnell	PERSON	, is an optimistic vision of the glory of the nation .

		Within the compass of a few short chapters , the prophet glances at many of the lessons of our past history and ventures upon prophecy in relation to our social and political future .


CHARLES R. HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Dr. wheeier ' t Numerous as are the tales of
Alex	PERSON	- new life of ander the Great and his life and
Alexander	PERSON	.

		achievements have been the inspira - tion of hundreds there has been for them all but one point of view .

		Inevitably the enthusiastic his - torian has drifted , perhaps unconsciously , from a true historical perspective into such abject hero - worship that the glory of matchless victories has settled upon a divinity rather than a man .

		It is , then , an almost unexpected pleasure to find Dr.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler	PERSON	's volume on Alexander -LRB- Putnam -RRB- giving us a true portrait of him as a human being .

		The great hero of antiquity is greater in every way as a man than as a god , and the story of his glorious achievements is here charmingly told ; indeed , it is not too much to say that very few brief memoirs of great men have been written in so delightful a fashion .

		Alexander himself is defended by Dr.
Wheeler	PERSON	from the accustomed charge of having encouraged a personal god-worship by his followers .

		He says : '' The idea that he undertook to establish a formal cult of himself , and to impose it upon the nations under his rule , par - ticularly upon the Greeks , lacks all foundation ... The notion that
Alexander	PERSON	utilized the doctrine of his divinity as a fundamental and constitutive prin - ciple of his empire is so utterly at variance with the plain historical facts , so utterly lacking in sup - port from any known facts , as to possess no interest except for its absurdity .

		It is a mere nightmare of some schematizing historians . ''

		One of the most delightful things in the book , almost humorously so at times , is the author 's pleasure in
Alexander	LOCATION	's victories as a game well played .

		To
Alexander	PERSON	, in his earlier years at least , war is a sport in which the joy of winning is foremost , the more remote result in empire-building being of secondary import - ance .

		In recounting how well Alexander played this game , Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	is as enthusiastic as if ex - tolling the merits of some great athlete , and occa - sionally even uses the terms of modern sport to describe the winning of a battle as when
Alex	PERSON	- ander by a '' flying wedge '' at
Gaugamela	LOCATION	pene - trates and destroys the solid mass of the enemy .

		Every lover of college athletics knows Dr.
Wheeler	PERSON	as a most earnest supporter of sport in its best form , and will sympathize with his admiration of
Alex	PERSON	- ander 's love of fair fighting .

		It helps , also , to an understanding of the human side of the hero 's char - acter .

		In general , this life of Alexander is excel - lently suited to the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series in which it appears , and is one of the best volumes of that series .

		The style is simple yet forcible , and the interest in the story is successfully maintained .

		The author has known where to draw the line be - tween matters of general interest and those of value only to students of antiquity , and has ex - cluded the latter class .

		There are many good illus - trations , together with numerous excellent maps and battle plans .

		The late Duchess of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps better known as Princess
Mary	PERSON	, was an estimable woman who was widely beloved in
England	LOCATION	for her gracious demeanor , sweet philanthropy , and ceaseless activity in public and private charities ; and it was inevitable , as well as eminently proper , that she should be made the sub - ject of a memorial volume .

		Yet we can not but think that Mr.
C. Kinloch Cooke	PERSON	's two bulky volumes , entitled '' A Memoir of Her Royal Highness Prin - An example of amiable verbosity .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 441 cess
Mary Adelaide	PERSON	, Duchess of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	* importation -RRB- , are , like the girth of Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	, '' out of all compass , out of all reasonable compass , '' when the relative importance of their subject , the brevity of human life , and the amount of reading that people who read must get through with now - adays , are taken into consideration .

		One moderate - sized volume , with a leaning to the side of mercy , would have been amply sufficient to tell the tale of
Princess Mary	ORGANIZATION	's virtues and benefactions , and the story of her placid , uneventful life .

		But Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	gives us nearly 900 closely printed pages quite enough for a sufficient life of a man like Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone , whose career embodied a good share of the history of his time .

		Let us hasten to say that Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's part in these volumes is mainly that of editor .

		The bulk of their contents is from
Princess Mary	ORGANIZATION	's amiable and smooth-flowing but by no means sprightly or literate pen , in the form of diary and correspondence .

		It is a chronicle largely , it must in candor be said of small beer : domestic happen - ings , little journeys , feminine prattle of charity bazaars , sewing circles , training schools , social '' functions , '' and what not .

		It is all very sweet - tempered , gracious , mildly interesting , even mildly informing in its small way ; and it deals at times with the minor doings of personages whose domes - tic life and economy even republican
America	LOCATION	likes to peep in upon .

		But there is too much of it .

		One shudders to think what Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	might prove capable of , quantitatively , were it to become his mournful duty one day to prepare a like memoir of Her Majesty !

		Apart from its sins of non - omission , Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's editing is all that can be desired .

		The work is well arranged and judiciously annotated , and there is a good index .

		Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's accompanying thread of narrative is graceful and to the point , and one by no means grudges the space devoted to it .

		The volumes are beautifully made , finely printed , and richly illustrated with por - traits mainly .

		The lovely plate representing Princess Mary bending over the infant Prince
Alexander	PERSON	-LRB- p. 72 -RRB- is a gem in its way , and might alone tempt one to buy the work containing it .

		Satis and Professor
Percy Gardner	PERSON	, in his origin of '' Exploratio Evangelica '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Christianity .

		conducts what he calls `` a brief ex - mination '' into this interesting subject .

		His stand - ing in the world of letters is a sufficient preliminary pledge of the value of the work , which thorough ex - amination fully confirms . ''

		The general tendency '' of the book , he remarks in his preface , '' is to transfer the burden of support of Christian doctrine from history to psychology , perhaps rather from the history of facts to the history of ideas . ''

		He quotes Amiel : '' What our age especially needs is a trans - lation of Christianity from the domain of history to the domain of psychology . ''

		And Professor
Jowett	PERSON	also : `` Religion is not dependent on historical events , the report of which we can not altogether trust .

		Holiness has its sources elsewhere than in history . ''

		It is needless to say that such a transfer as this is a great one .

		Traditionary Christianity prides itself on being an historical religion ; and a shift from a basis of alleged fact to subjective experience is greater than any made in the history of Christian thought , with two possible exceptions the shift from the simple ethical religion of Jesus to the philosophical religion that was set up in its room by the Greek theologians , and the shift from the authority of the Church to the authority of Scripture interpreted by private judgment , which was the great achievement of the Protestant Refor - mation .

		The transfer now proposed , which is of course in no sense original with Professor
Gardner	PERSON	, is brought forward by those who believe in what they regard as the essentials of Christianity , but who are at the same time convinced that critical investigation has destroyed forever the historical basis , as it has been held , of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The reader will find this conviction stated briefly but strongly in the present volume , and , what is more to the purpose , will find an indication of the main lines along which , as the writer thinks , the transfer from the old basis to the new must be effected .

		Apart from theories and doctrinal views , the book can be most thoroughly recommended as the work of a conscientious scholar , a trained critic , a practised writer , and a man of unquestioned religious faith and feeling .

		It is all the more significant , perhaps , coming as it does from a layman .

		The book may cause the ultra orthodox to grieve , but there is no class of persons who more need to read books of this character than the ultra orthodox .

		The Novel at seen by an evolutionist .

		Similar in form and binding to the invaluable work by Professor Cross on '' The Development of the English Novel , '' recently noticed in these columns , there now appears a volume by Professor
Francis Hovey Stoddard	PERSON	, entitled '' The Evolution of the English Novel '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		If Professor
Stoddard	PERSON	had not multiplied words had he seen fit to compress his two hundred and odd pages into half the space he would doubtless have given us a very readable and helpful brief essay upon the theory which he here expounds .

		While not without value to the student in this department of literature , the book is weakened greatly by its author 's endless repetitions and discursions .

		As a serious study it is distinctly inferior to the work of
Professor Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		The au - thor does not attempt to derive the novel in its modern manifestation by definite stages through successive historic forms of literature ; but he affirms a law of tendency , which he declares '' is , in general , that the depiction of the external , objective , carnal , precedes , in every form of expression of which we can have records , the consideration of the internal , the subjective , the spiritual . '' ''

		Fiction begins with the objective novel ; it progresses into the intro - spective and the subjective novel . ''

		In a broad and reasonably generous application of this theory , it strikes us that there is not much to provoke argu - 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, ment .

		Indeed , ordinary students of all or any of the expressed forms of literary creation have observed its very natural working before .

		It hardly calls for ten pages of profuse illustration , introducing Com - modore
Vanderbilt	ORGANIZATION	's locomotives , stage ghosts , medi - aeval penitents , the American college of seventy years ago , the early kings of
England	LOCATION	, and modern politics , to give the idea sufficient plausibility for further consideration by the reader .

		In successive chapters the author treats the Growth of Person - ality in Fiction , the Historical Novel , the
Romantic Novel	ORGANIZATION	, the
Novel of Purpose	ORGANIZATION	, the
Modern Novel	ORGANIZATION	and its Mission .

		Much of this matter is really of interest to one acquainted somewhat with the field reviewed , and there are ideas of distinct value .

		The characterizations of typical novels are well worth reading , and the chapter on the
Novel of Purpose	ORGANIZATION	is particularly commendable .

		With respect to Professor
Stoddard	PERSON	's argument in detail , we are bound to say that the choice of novels by which he supports his theory seems arbitrary ; he certainly ignores some striking examples that do not wholly harmonize with his view .

		The control of monopolies and trustt .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	continues his well - known studies of economics in his interesting book on '' Monopolies and Trusts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		His definition of monop - oly clears away much current confusion : '' Mo - nopoly means that substantial unity of action on the part of one or more persons engaged in some kind of business which gives exclusive control , more particularly , although not solely , with respect to price . ''

		He contends that monopoly must be dis - tinguished from concentration of wealth so far as accumulation is subject to competition .

		He here differs radically from the Socialists , who believe that all kinds of business inevitably tend toward monopoly .

		Mere mass of capital will not alone secure monopoly , because there is always a surplus of capital eager to find investment wherever there is a living chance in the competitive world .

		Talent for management never alone gives monopoly , but only unusual gains , since there is plenty of mana - gerial talent in the world waiting for employment .

		Real monopolies arise from social action , as the granting of patents , trade-marks , or special privi - leges ; or from natural causes , as limited supply of raw material , properties inherent in the business , or secrecy in the process of a manufacture .

		The the - oretical part of the work consists in the elucidation and enforcement of these ideas .

		The practical part deals , though briefly , with public control of real monopolies , when competition can not enter to pro- tect public interests .

		Such public control the author declares to be an urgent and pressing social neces - sity .

		Among the suggested reforms are the re - striction of monopolistic corporations to normal returns on capital , with publicity of actual invest - ments and accounts .

		As this is extremely difficult in the case of certain kinds of business , the most promising method of control would be public own - ership .

		`` Public ownership with public manage - ment renders control easy , because it is in the very nature of public property that it should be publicly controlled . ''

		It is also recommended that vast es - tates be broken up by regulation of bequests and inheritances ; that when tariffs make monopolies they should be abolished ; that patents be regulated so that inventors and the public may not be op - pressed by owners ; that governmental regulation of corporations by commissions be extended , etc. .

		Tales from the Totemt .

		Many visitors to the World 's Fair at
Chicago	LOCATION	noticed with much interest a miniature reproduction of a British Columbian Indian Town .

		The model was extremely accurate : not only the houses , but the curiously carved poles or columns standing near them , were carefully copied to scale .

		These carved columns differ in character : some are totemic , others are commemorative or mortuary .

		The little buildings were arranged in proper order upon an artifical beach , and a background of forested mountains was painted behind them .

		This interesting model -LRB- now at the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was made under the direction of Mr.
James Deans	PERSON	, who has lived in the
Northwestern Coast	ORGANIZATION	country for twenty-five years .

		He is a Scotchman by birth and a practical geologist and prospector by profession .

		He has been over the whole country from Van Couver to
Sitka	LOCATION	, and is profoundly and sympathetically acquainted with the Indians .

		Mr.
Deans	PERSON	was present at the World 's Fair in charge of his exhibit , and explained the little village with its totemic and other carved posts to hundreds of visitors .

		This experience sug - gested to him the publication of a selection of stories , which he had gathered from the Indians themselves , most of which had reference to the totem carvings .

		The stories are now issued in book form , with the title '' Tales from the Totems of the Hidery , '' form - ing Volume II .

		of the
Archives of the International Folk-lore Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Hidery usually called Haidaz are favorites with Mr.
Deans	PERSON	.

		The stories printed in this little book are mostly those connected with the carvings on the posts of the little village .

		They include stories of the raven -LRB- yethel -RRB- to whom man owes so much , of the eagle , the sun , moon , bear , frog , mountain goat , scannah , etc. .

		The list includes stories representing two great classes of legends , cosmogonic and heroic .

		In telling the stories , Mr.
Deans	PERSON	gives many interesting data re - garding the life , customs , and ideas of the Hidery .

		The style of the narration is simple and direct .

		The collection of stories is edited by Professor
Griggs	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volumes II. , III. , and IV .

		of Dr.
W. H. Fitchett	PERSON	's modestly entitled book `` How

		It is time now , in the face of hard facts , to have done with the stale prejudice as to the preternatural fighting qualities of English troops .

		You can not make a first-class fighting man and a good shot out of a cockney by clapping a red coat on him ; and the ludicrous fail - ure of the English attempt to raise in the rural dis - tricts a corps of '' rough riders '' on the American model shows what may be looked for from their `` yeomanry . ''

		The English '' yeoman , '' the bow - man of Crecy and
Agincourt	LOCATION	, belongs to ancient history , and
England	LOCATION	has long passed out of the stage that produced him .

		To get his like she must now look to ruggeder
Scotland	LOCATION	or the Colonies .

		Dr.
Fitchett	PERSON	's work is a very readable and at times brilliant popular history of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's struggle by sea and land against
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		The narrative is rapid , picturesque , and clean-cut , a little boastful perhaps , but not likely on that account to offend those for whom it is primarily written .

		Volume II .

		tells of
Nelson	PERSON	and the struggle for the sea ; Volume III. , of the war in the
Peninsula	LOCATION	; and Volume IV .

		of
Waterloo	LOCATION	and
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		No better popular history has been written of the long war that made
Nelson	PERSON	and
Wellington	LOCATION	famous .

		The work is at - tractively mounted and well supplied with portraits .

		In the preface to her pretty book on `` Salons Colonial and Republican '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , Mrs.
Anne Hollings	PERSON	- worth
Wharton	PERSON	speaks with implied approval of the '' deep and widespread interest '' now felt in the
America	LOCATION	of our Colonial period .

		Every instructed person will agree with Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	that it is , generally speaking , a good sign when people take an interest in the early history of their own country , and show a desire to acquaint themselves with the beginnings of the society they live in .

		Books on Colonial times have multiplied greatly of late .

		Some of them the pleasant studies by Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	, for example are useful and scholarly productions , written in the proper historical spirit and to a worthy end ; others merely reflect the passing attempt to make descent from the earlier immi - grants a mark of social superiority ; some of them appeal to the student , others appeal to the snob .

		The main element of general interest in Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's book is , we should say , its artistic or pictorial one , namely , the great number of beau - tiful reproductions of choice old miniature portraits it contains .

		The original pictures from which these plates are taken are in many cases from eminent hands , and the collection must be pronounced an attractive and instructive one to all who take an interest in the now reviving branch of miniature - painting .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's rambling narrative serves Portraits of Colonial worthies .

		as an index to the identities , characters , connections , pursuits , and social and family histories of the re - spectable if not very memorable worthies portrayed in the pictures .

		The book is finely printed and gayly bound .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- , may be briefly described as an attempt at the working out of the results of spiritual and other ideals in our modern life ; or , in other words , the application of scientific method and study to personal and so - cial matters which are ordinarily regarded as beyond the pale of scientific investigation .

		The first of the ten papers , all distinct in subject and treatment , yet all making to a single end , is given to '' The Scientific Study of the Higher Human Life . ''

		Successive essays bear such indicative titles as '' The Dynamic Character of Personal Ideals , '' `` The Modern Change in Ideals of Womanhood , '' and `` The Ethics of Social Reconstruction . ''

		This last takes the posi - tion that `` In all unfounded expectations of imme - diate social regeneration there are two errors : the mistake of imagining that progress can be sudden ; and the error of supposing that a condition of statical perfection is either possible or desirable in human society . ''

		From this the argument is carried through the concluding essays on `` The New Social Ideal '' and `` The Religion of Humanity , '' for a wider understanding of our intellectual possibili - ties , apart from any preliminary system of social organization .

		The strong and undeviating optimism of the book as a whole , tempered as it is by the full recognition of existing social blunders , makes it at once stimulating and wholesome .

		It is surprising , to those who knew the popularity of the books of the late
Edward Payson Roe	PERSON	, that twelve years should elapse before the appearance of any extended biography of him .

		Such a work is now published -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , prepared with loving care by his sister , Miss
Mary A. Roe	PERSON	, and is to be welcomed as an addition to American literary biog - raphies .

		So far as possible , Miss Roe has followed the safe plan of letting the author speak for himself , and more than half the book is made up of extracts from his letters and journals , given without change .

		These passages disclose a personality of great charm , and the book traces in an interesting way the career of the man who achieved the greatest literary popu - larity of his time in
America	LOCATION	.

		He was a graduate of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	and of a neighboring theo - logical school , and in
1862	DATE	, before his studies were fully completed , he became the chaplain of the
Harris Light Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Second
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- , gaining experience in writing at the same time by acting as correspondent for the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evangelist . ''

		He won golden opinions for his zeal and sympathy while in the service , becoming the chaplain of the Hamp - Biography of the late
E. P. Rof	PERSON	.

		444 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, ton Hospital at
Fort Monroe	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	, where he served until peace was won .

		He then accepted a call to the pastorate of the church at
Highland Falls	LOCATION	, on the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		It was here that he published '' Barriers Burned Away , '' his first and still his most popular hook .

		He died in
1888	DATE	, in his home at Cornwall-on-the-Hudson , universally regretted .

		We have already expressed much satisfaction with the Eversley '' edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, prepared for the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	by
Professor C. H. Herford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now that the editor is in this country , and is mak - ing many personal friends upon our side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, we are glad of the opportunity presented by a reissue of this work to call attention once more to its scholarly qualities and its attractive appear - ance .

		The original edition was in ten volumes ; the new one is in thirty-nine that is , a play to a volume , with two volumes for the poems .

		The notes are restricted to the essentials , and are found where all notes should be found , at the bottom of the page .

		This is distinctly a pocket edition of the poet , and , as such , it is a close rival of the '' Temple '' Shake - speare , appealing possibly to a severer taste , but to one no less refined .

		Professor
Herford	PERSON	, who has recently given a course of Turnbull lectures at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, is a nephew of the Rev.
Brooke Herford	PERSON	who lived for many years in this country .

		He is one of the soundest of the younger English scholars in English and German literature .

		His translations of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's `` Brand '' and `` Love 's Comedy '' are not the least of his many services to literature .

		BRIEFER MENTION .


Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	rarely , if ever , wrote anything for the mere sake of writing , and what might be called the flotsam and jetsam of his work is better worth pre - serving than much of the labored composition of more prolific writers .

		We have already had three small vol - umes of his verse ; it has now remained for the pub - lishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to collect a companion volume of his '' Prose '' from such sources as the '' Contributor 's Club '' of the '' Atlantic Monthly '' and other periodicals .

		We are given , besides a brief memoir illustrated by his letters , something like forty short pieces of prose , classi - fied under balf a dozen heads .

		They are all brief , but they are also packed with the writer 's own thought , and we are heartily glad to have them thus preserved . ''

		Makers of Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title given by Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	to a collec - tion of critical essays which is an enlarged reissue of the volume of ten years ago which was called `` Studies in Letters and Life . ''

		There are several additional chapters , however , so that the work is something more than a new edition .

		It comprises nineteen papers in all , relating almost wholly to nineteenth century writers , and includes '' all of the author 's critical work which it seems desirable to reprint . ''

		That it is a volume of unusual thoughtf ulness and weight goes almost without saying , and the reader , however much he may bring to its perusal , can count upon carrying away even more .

		THE DIAL a large class of readers , and at the same time take their place among authoritative historical writings .

		Miss
Louise C. Boname	PERSON	is both author and publisher of a small '' Hand Book of Pronunciation for Advanced Grades , '' which students of the French language will find particularly useful in supplementing the informa - tion to be had from grammars and dictionaries , and which teachers will find equally useful in their work .

		`` The
Chaucer Canon	ORGANIZATION	, '' by the Rev.
W. W. Skeat	PERSON	, pub - lished by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, is '' a discussion of the works associated with the name of
Geoffrey Chaucer	PERSON	, '' and gives the tests which scholars apply in determining the authenticity of a given work .

		The volume is an in - dispensible supplement to the seven volumes of the `` Oxford Chaucer . ''

		`` A Guide to the Trees '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Alice Lounsberry	PERSON	, is a companion volume to that writer 's pop - ular '' Guide to the Wild Flowers , '' and is provided with many illustrations , including sixty-four colored plates , besides a large number in black and white .

		These illus - trations are the work of Mrs.
Ellis Rowan	PERSON	.

		Dr.

		Messrs.

Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition , in a single volume , of '' The Complete Poetical Works of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	. ''

		The text has been edited by Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	, and the arrange - ment is chronological .

		The biography is done by Mr.

		The body of notes is considerable and the usual vignette and portrait constitute the illustrations .

		The new
Boston	LOCATION	publishing house which has just been incorporated under the name of

		The first work to bear the imprint of the new firm will be the official illustrated catalogue of the Fine Arts Exhibit of the
United States	LOCATION	at the
Paris Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, which is to be published immediately .

		Those
summer	DATE	travellers whose thoughts are turn - ing , not toward the heats of crowded
Paris	LOCATION	, but toward the rest and coolness of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, will find much to attract and interest them in the new hand book of
Colorado	LOCATION	, prepared by that experienced traveller and forceful writer , Captain
James W. Steele	PERSON	, and issued by the Passenger Department of the well-known '' Bur - lington Route , ''
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations of the little work are profuse and well executed , while the text gives not only a sense of the charm of the regions treated , but just those bits of information regarding routes of travel and points of greatest interest which the intend - ing traveller most needs .

		Mr.
A. G. S. Josephson	PERSON	, of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, sends us the following interesting note on two modern Swedish authors : In the review of European literature of the last twenty years , which was given in THE DIAL for
May 1	DATE	last , no mention was made of Swedish liter - ature .

		Of course ,
Sweden	LOCATION	can not show such a literary giant as
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, nor , perhaps , such a brilliant critic as
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		But there are two Swedish authors who , even in a very rapid survey of contemporary lit - erature , should have been at least mentioned .

		Viktor Rydberg , who died in
1895	DATE	, was without question the most commanding literary personality in
Sweden	LOCATION	since
Geijer	PERSON	, and some regard him as its greatest poet since Tegne * r. His influence may have been more as a civiliz - ing force than as a purely literary one ; but whatever its kind , his influence upon the generations which have grown up since the early sixties has been most pro- found .

		The brilliant if erratic genius of
August Strindberg	LOCATION	, combining deep ethical pathos with a coarse and cynical manner of expression , has influenced recent Swedish literature more than that of anyone else .

		He seems now to have reached greater stability , and prom - ises to give us , in his Indian
summer	DATE	, works of deeper significance and perhaps higher artistic value than any of the productions of his youth or manhood .

		473 THE COMMENCEMENT SEASON .

		This is the time of the year when schools and colleges all over the country are engaged in closing up their work , and in dismissing into the world of action the thousands of young men and women who have , as the phrase goes , com - pleted their education .

		They are , for the most part , a hopeful body of young people , and those who witness the final flourish of the exercises which mark for these graduates the `` com - mencement '' of their influence upon a wider world than that of their Alma Mater must be cynical indeed if they do not find this spirit of hopefulness contagious .

		When should we take hope for the future , if not in the presence of these young and eager minds , conscious of their rich inheritance from the past , and confident of their power to recast the future into their own glowing mould ?

		However our own gen - eration may have disappointed us , we still have faith in the generation that is to come after us , and deep down in most of our hearts there is an invincible belief that somehow , somewhere , the ideals that have been thwarted in our own time by the brute forces of selfishness and ma - terialism are destined to have a better chance of realization in the near future .

		If our own mood have become that of the ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	'' of the poet 's ripe age , we would not have it shared by the younger generation , and are glad that the mood which inspired the earlier ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	'' still invades the ardent imaginings of youth , and shapes them to the same fair dream .

		It is not alone because of the hope that springs eternal that we who have suffered the disillusionment of advancing years still cling to a belief in the promise and the potency of the youth that is just taking the world 's burden upon its shoulders .

		We are not altogether without rational grounds for that belief .

		It is to the progress of education that we must look for the accomplishment of all those things which are not , yet which ought to be , and no one can follow the educational developments of recent years without taking heart for the race , or without anticipating a marked practical out - come from so great an amount of intelligent and harmoniously concerted effort .

		Whether we examine the bare statistics , with their show - ing of increased educational opportunities , of a better appreciation of the meaning of educa - tion , of the strong hold of humanism upon our systems despite the assaults made upon it in the name of practicality , or whether we attend to the philosophical generalizations of those observers who , from year to year , survey the 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, field of recent activity and sum up the results accomplished , we are not without abundant cause for encouragement and self-congratula - tion .

		That much has been done , and done in the right way , is undeniable ; we have many reasons to believe that the young of to-day are given a better equipment with which to face the world than was provided for the young of twenty or thirty years ago .

		And yet , with all the obvious reasons for our feeling satisfied with what the educational activity of the present time is accomplishing , we must reckon with the fact that some of the prevailing tendencies of educational thought are viewed with mistrust , and even with alarm , by many of the best observers , by profound and weighty thinkers whose views command the greatest respect .

		Amid the clamor of peda - gogical novelty and radicalism the still small voice of these protestants penetrates to the attentive ear , and bids us reexamine the funda - mental articles of the current orthodoxy .

		One such voice is that of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, whose recent ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article on '' School Reform '' deserves the most careful considera - tion .

		Let us take the case of the average graduate from the school or college of to-day .

		Comparing him with the graduate of a genera - tion ago , we may admit at once that he has been in the hands of instructors of more accu - rate scholarship , that he has had better library and laboratory aids , that more helpful text - books have guided his studies .

		These things are all good , but they are not fundamental .

		What is really fundamental is , for example , what Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, writing of the tendency to allow young people to select the subjects which are the most interesting , ex - presses in the following terms : '' A child who has himself the right of choice , or who sees that parents and teachers select the courses according to his tastes and inclinations , may learn a thousand pretty things , but never the one which is the greatest of all : to do his duty .

		He who is allowed always to follow the paths of least resistance never develops the power to overcome resistance ; he remains utterly unprepared for life .

		To do what we like to do , that needs no pedagogical encour - agement ; water always runs down hill .

		Our whole public and social life shows the working of this impulse , and our institutions outbid one another in catering to the taste of the public .

		The school alone has the power to develop the opposite tendency , to encourage and train the belief in duties and obligations , to inspire de - votion to better things than those to which we are drawn by our lower instincts . ''

		For a stu - dent to choose his own courses may make his education both easy and pleasant ; it certainly does not develop the power to overcome resist - ance .

		That power is developed only by work that is not easy , and that sometimes is extremely unpleasant . ''

		The schools were bad , and the public was dissatisfied , '' says our writer ; '' now the elective studies relieve the discomfort of the children ; in the place of the old vexation they have a good time , and the parents are glad that the drudgery is over . ''

		Presently , how - ever , there is a rude awakening , and it is dis - covered that the children thus taught have acquired no mental stamina , that they do not know anything thoroughly , that they can not grapple with any hard problem of practical life .

		Then the man who is strong on psychology and pedagogy gets his chance .

		For the possession of this apparatus `` he is not a better teacher , but he can talk about the purposes of the new education till all is covered by beautiful words ; and thus parents and children are happily satis - fied for a while , till the time comes when the nation has to pay for its neglect . '' ''

		Just as it has been said that war needs three things , money , money , and again money , so it can be said with much greater truth that education needs , not forces and buildings , not pedagogy and demonstrations , but only men , men , and again men ... The right kind of men is what the schools need .

		They need teachers whose interest in the subject would banish all drudgery . ''

		One of the dialogues of Lucian speaks we quote from
Froude	PERSON	's paraphrase of '' lies related so circumstantially and by such grave authorities , with evidence of eye-witnesses , place , and time all accurately given , that the strongest mind could hardly resist conviction unless fortified with the certainty that such things could not be . ''

		Our credulous age is beset by innumerable lies of this character , lies of popular science , of political controversy , of religious propaganda , of every species of intel - lectual quackery .

		It is surely both funda - mental and vital to ask of our education whether it fortifies the mind with the certainty that such things can not be .

		Does the average product of our most approved educational sys - tems know the demonstrated facts of physics , of economic science , of the historical experi - ence of mankind , with absolute conviction , or does he stand toward them in a hazy mental attitude , doubtful of their validity , and ready
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 459 to surrender them at the behest of some plaus - ible word-monger ?

		This attitude toward fun - damental principles is so widely prevalent , even among people who have gone through the form of intellectual training , that the answer to our question does little credit to whatever agencies are responsible for such an intellectual outlook .

		For a period that boasts of enlightenment , the '' forts of folly '' are still defended by forces whose numbers are , to say the least , disheart - ening .

		Both intellectually and morally , the educational methods most in vogue in the schools of to-day , in spite of all the zeal and energy behind them , seem somehow to fail when we look below the surface of their results .

		The sterner if less ingenious methods of the past did succeed in evolving that type of '' gen - tleman and scholar '' which seems to be fast disappearing , and the passing of which from our life has recently been lamented by Pro- fessor
Emerton	PERSON	.

		The personal influence of the teacher has become lessened , and the pressure of the educational machinery has become greater .

		And there is much food for reflection in these words of the writer just mentioned : '' The highly developed machine is able by its very perfection to give to comparatively poor ma - terial an apparent finish , which may deceive the unwary ... Our machinery will enable us to turn out men trained to certain definable forms of mental activity , men who can be tick - eted off in groups and applied in various kinds of work in the world .

		It will never give us any guaranty that these are men of real intellect - ual power , whose personal quality can of itself command respect . ''

		How far our insistence upon the machine-made quality may go is illus - trated by the growing tendency among edu - cational administrators to recruit their forces only from the ranks of men having the profes - sional trade-mark .

		Professor
Emerton	PERSON	makes this pertinent quotation from Erasmus : '' For - merly a man was called ' doctor ' because he was a learned man ; but nowadays no one will believe a man is learned unless he is called 4 doctor . ' ''

		And the writer adds , in words that are none too strong , this statement of his own experience : '' I have known many a man , whose great fundamental need was intellectual refinement and culture , sacrificed to this semi - civilized demand for a certifiable kind of expert training . ''

		The educational tendency which can be content thus to substitute a narrow and easy test of ability for those broad and search - ing tests which alone are of real value , is not exactly a cause for congratulation .

		Here also a fundamental principle is involved , and we should look to it that the tendency be not suf - fered to impair our education in a very vital respect .

		The above are a few only of the re - flections that must intrude upon serious minds whenever educational questions come to the front , and that can not fail to exert a sobering influence upon our enthusiasm .

		A STUDY IN BENEVOLENCE .

		Some material for an interesting study is to be found in the list of public gifts and bequests made in the
United States	LOCATION	during
1899	DATE	or becoming oper - ative in that year , compiled by Mr.
Rossiter John	PERSON	- son , editor of '' Appletons ' Annual Cyclopedia . ''

		The compiler records only those gifts which amount to five thousand dollars or over , and only those made by private individuals ; public contributions , denominational gifts , and governmental appropria - tions are excluded .

		For obvious reasons , the list must be more or less incomplete ; yet there are here recorded donations which aggregate nearly
$ 63,000,000	MONEY	, thirty-eight per cent more than those of any previous year .

		The list is presented in such compactness that several striking facts are likely to escape the general reader , unless these facts are given the emphasis of distinct state - ment .

		In the first place , it may be noted that while the bequests of sixty-seven persons are recorded in the published list , the direct gifts of a hundred and forty , or more than twice as many , are mentioned .

		Evidently , more than ever before our wealthy classes are distributing their wealth while they live , rather than leaving their property to the uncertain - ties of an administered estate .

		Furthermore , while twenty-five per cent of these bequests those which reach or surpass the
$ 100,000	MONEY	mark amount to
$ 16,000,000	MONEY	, twenty-six of the direct gifts , similarly selected , aggregate
$ 32,000,000	MONEY	, or twice the former sum .

		Secondly , it appears that of two hundred and seven benefactors selected from the list , fifty-seven or about twenty - eight per cent are women .

		Nineteen out of two hundred and seven philanthropists , representing more than a million and a half in gifts , have not permitted public announcement of their names .

		An exact classification of all these benefactions is not easy ; but allowing for the unavoidable im - perfections of the published list , the amounts con - tributed to these specific objects are approximately correct : 1 .

		Religions and denominational organizations , missions , etc
$ 4,661,500	MONEY	2 .

		Hospitals and asylums 7,095,000 3 .

		The fine arts , public monuments ... 799,350 4 .

		Public libraries 1,599,000 5 .

		Universities , colleges , schools 31,469,000 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, It is worthy of note that of the amount devoted to public libraries , Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	gave
$ 1,130,000	MONEY	, establishing , or contributing to the establishment of , seventeen new public libraries in thirteen different states .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	was , with one exception , the largest giver of the year , the sum of his benefactions amounting to
$ 5,000,000	MONEY	.

		But the item of greatest importance in this sum - mary is the last , which records the donations to universities , colleges , and technical schools .

		Sixty - eight institutions were thus remembered ; and in the distribution of these gifts , the East , the
Middle West	LOCATION	, the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, and the
Southern States	LOCATION	are all fairly represented .

		Gifts ranging from
$ 5,000	MONEY	to
$ 100,000	MONEY	were received by thirty-three colleges and universities ; fifteen institutions re - ceived sums ranging from
$ 100,000	MONEY	to
$ 600,000	MONEY	.

		In this
last	DATE
group Yale	ORGANIZATION	was the largest beneficiary , receiving
$ 528,000	MONEY	.

		Eight colleges for women received an aggregate of
$ 311,000	MONEY	, an average of less than
$ 40,000	MONEY	.

		Of these eight ,
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	received the largest amount ,
$ 96,000	MONEY	.

		Wellesley follows with 90,000 , and the Woman 's College of
Baltimore	LOCATION	is reported with
$ 50,000	MONEY	.

		The '' big six '' among the universities were : 1 .

		Princeton , which received
$ 1,032,000	MONEY	2 .

		University of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, which received .

		1,180,000 3 .


Washington	LOCATION	, which received 1.300,000 4 .


Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, which received 1,381,000 5 .

		Harvard , which received 2,230,000 6 .


Leland Stanford	PERSON	, Jr. , which received ... 15,000,000 These gifts amount to
$ 22,123,000	MONEY	Adding the gifts to the 48 3,828,000 We have a total of
$ 25,951,000	MONEY	The benefactions of Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	to the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	are not included here because of the conditions making his gift ineffective before the present year .

		Let us now look at the amounts credited to the industrial , art , and technical schools .

		Tuskegee , the flourishing institution over which Mr.
Booker	PERSON	T.
Washington	LOCATION	presides with such marked success , was remembered to the extent of
$ 127,000	MONEY	.

		Hamp - ton
Industrial Institute	ORGANIZATION	is credited with
$ 28,000	MONEY	.

		The largest beneficiaries in this group were , as reported :
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.


$ 650,000	MONEY
Armour Institute	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	750,000
Bradley Polytechnic	LOCATION	,
Peoria	LOCATION	1,000,000
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	1,000,000
Carnegie Institute	ORGANIZATION	, Pittsbnrg 1,750,000 The remaining ten received 400,000 Making a total of
$ 5,550,000	MONEY	Adding the donations to the colleges and universities 25,951,000 We have a grand total of
$ 31,501,000	MONEY	With the exception of the sums given to establish public libraries , we have been considering thus far benefactions bestowed only on existing institutions .

		The following items are perhaps the most interest - ing in the complete list : 1 .

		For the education of deserving boys and girls unable to attend the higher schools ,
Elizabeth Larkin	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, be - queathed her entire estate of
$ 35,000	MONEY	.

		2 .

		For a free industrial school for young women , the Rev.
P. J. Daly	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, gave
$ 50,000	MONEY	.

		3 .

		For the benefit of orphan boys , a home and industrial school is provided by Mr.
Henry A. Pevear	PERSON	, of
Lynn	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, valuation ,
$ 300,000	MONEY	.

		4 .

		To establish an institution in
Ohio	LOCATION	for the free education of girls , Mr.
Wallace C. Andrews	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, gave
$ 500,000	MONEY	.

		5 .

		Mr.
George W. Clayton	PERSON	, of
Denver	LOCATION	, bequeathed to that city for an orphans ' college ,
$ 1,000,000	MONEY	.

		6 .

		To establish a school of pedagogy , comprising a kinder - garten , primary , and grammar schools , high school and junior college , situated near
Lincoln Park	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and also a thoroughly appointed school for the children of the poor , on
Milwaukee Avenue	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Enimons Blaine	PERSON	gave
$ 1,000,000	MONEY	.

		7 .

		Twenty-five years ago , Mr.
John Simmons	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, left a portion of his estate for the establishment of a college for women .

		This bequest is now effective , having amounted , under investment , to
$ 2,000,000	MONEY	.

		8 .


James Munyon	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, has given to that city thirty acres of land near
Fairmount Park	LOCATION	, whereon are to be erected buildings for a home and school for dependent girls , similar in purpose to
Qirard College	ORGANIZATION	for boys .

		These build - ings are planned to cost
$ 2,000,000	MONEY	.

		9 .


Peter A. Widener	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, has purchased thirty - six acres of land in the suburbs of that city , whereon he will erect a combined home , hospital , and industrial school for the benefit of crippled children ; to cost
$ 2,000,000	MONEY	.

		Thus the gifts of these nine persons to the cause of higher education for young women , to the protec - tion and industrial training of the children of the poor , amount in round numbers to
$ 9,000,000	MONEY	.

		Unprecedented as were the donations of
1899	DATE	, those of
1900	DATE	are almost certain to surpass them .

		Before half the year has expired , these already amount to nearly or quite
$ 20,000,000	MONEY	.

		Washing -
ton University	ORGANIZATION	has received additional gifts to the amount of
$ 5,000,000	MONEY	;
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has come into full possession of the millions secured by the latest Rockefeller gift ;
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Vanderbilt	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee	PERSON	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Bowdoin	LOCATION	, and
Brown	PERSON	have all benefited by generous dona - tions ; and to this list might be added the names of other colleges , as well as of libraries and art mu - seums similarly enriched .

		It is interesting to note that of these benefactions recorded during the five months just passed , nine-tenths of the sums are given outright by donors who are still living to see their desires fulfilled , and to take some satisfaction , doubtless , in observing the goodly results of their munificence .

		Thirty-five years ago ,
John Rnskin	PERSON	in a public lecture forcibly arraigned the English people for the spirit of commercialism which seemed to him to be sapping the intellectual and spiritual life of the nation . ''

		We have despised literature , '' he said .

		`` We have despised science .

		We have despised art .

		We have despised compassion . ''

		The spirit of commercialism is as insidious as ever .

		It may be that even in the devotion of these unwonted sums to literature , to science , to art , to compassion , some traces of commercialism may be discovered , al - though the insinuation is gratuitous , the presumption being quite the reverse .

		Nevertheless , there are developing certain economic problems in the exist -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 461 eno.e of these tremendously capitalized educational corporations , and these problems are worth consid - eration .

		It is a fact that the
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	is the wealthiest institution , privately established , in the world .

		Mrs.
Stanford	PERSON	's gift of
$ 15,000,000	MONEY	-LRB- cash value of property transferred -RRB- during the year just passed , swells the endowment of the uni - versity to
$ 45,000,000	MONEY	, although the face value of the securities which constitute its investments now amounts to
$ 80,000,000	MONEY	, and this valuation is rather likely to increase than to diminish .

		The
University of California	ORGANIZATION	,
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, as well as
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard	LOCATION	, are almost rivals with the
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	in the sums of their respective endowments , while each new year seems destined to surpass its predecessor in the amount of fresh capital which it brings to these enterprises .

		How impressive should be the thought of the tre - mendous responsibilities involved responsibilities of administration on the part of those who direct the activities of these institutions ; the responsibility of provision and recognition on the part of the people and the nation to which they belong ; the responsibility of appreciation , and , may we add , of justification , which lies upon those for whose imme - diate good they are designed and those who are actively enjoying the splendid advantages which they provide .

		THE STAGE-COACH THEORY OP COLLEGE MANAGEMENT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The leading article in your last number tempts me to call attention to a significant feature in the parallel between stage-coach and university , drawn by a recent writer in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		According to that edifying parable , the college president is a man ; the professors are horses .

		Over these essentially inferior creatures he naturally cracks his whip .

		They are horses ; and , more - over , in this typical team they are all bad horses old , blind , weak-kneed , freakish , stupid , raw , vicious .

		The driver , coming '' out of the tavern , '' jerks the reins with obvious ill - temper ; the unfortunate beasts not pro- tected , in this o'er-true tale , by any '' Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals '' must endure him as they can .

		Meanwhile , the riotous young passengers -LRB- a new method in education -RRB- are bound whither ?

		To their several lots and stations in a republican gov - ernment .

		Shades of our forefathers !

		What training and example have we here for citizens of the American republic ?

		Or is it to be the American despotism ?

		An English scholar who has been many years resident in our country says that this '' Land of the Free '' has developed the two most absolute tyrants of modern times : the Political Boss and the College President .

		But as yet not all college presidents are of the type portrayed and betrayed in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article .

		When that day comes , let them draw their faculty from something lower than mankind .

		SCHOTJL , ERS HISTORY OF THE CIVIL , WAR .

		*
Twenty years ago	DATE	, writing from North Con - way ,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, under date of
July 15 , 1880	DATE	, Mr.
James Schouler	PERSON	prepared the preface for the first volume of a '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Constitution . ''

		He planned to follow the footsteps of
Richard Hildreth	PERSON	to
1821	DATE	, and then move forward by himself to the Civil War period , thus supplementing the work of
Bancroft	LOCATION	and
Hildreth	PERSON	in making a complete story of the development of the Amer - ican people from the discovery of the continent to the close of the Rebellion .

		In this preface he declared that it was just ten years to a day since he laid aside the first draft of an intro - ductory chapter of the History which he planned to write '' without fear or favor . ''

		A whole generation , therefore , has passed away since the study was begun , a generation daring which wonderful changes have taken place in American thought and American life .

		No ex - amination of Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	's History would be fair which did not keep these great changes in mind .

		The underlying thought of the author is like - wise to be remembered .

		Recent biographical memoirs being considered as he wrote , he made these statements in his first preface : '' Political biography distorts events necessarily to give effect to a personal example ; for the public pro- gress of a new republic and of a people like ours is the advance of a swelling host whose force and direction are determined by a myriad of influences , while individ - uals who contribute their strength rise into view and then disappear .

		It is to trace this general advance , and dis - tinguish these impelling influences , whether individual or collective , political , moral , or social , that one should devote himself in a work like the present ; and in pur - suance of such an object , I have availed myself of what - ever fresh materials such writers and collectors furnish , without relying implicitly upon any one of them . ''

		This purpose to seek the '' impelling influ - ences '' which have entered into the political , moral , and social life of the

		462 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, what they contain and for what they indicate as yet available for the student who may wish to seek further light upon any phase of our country 's progress .

		And yet in connection with these chapters a marked defect is to be noted ; for again and again , as special interest is awakened by the graphic portrayal of events , an exceedingly indefinite and disappointing reference , such as to '' newspapers of the day , '' discourages personal research and checks the development of habits of additional private investigation which are so strongly advocated in these days of topical study .

		Along with this notable defect of indefinite - ness of references , the several volumes by Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	are marked by infelicities of style which mar many otherwise strong passages .

		The thought is not expressed with sufficient clear - ness , the sentences are long and involved , and very often subject and predicate are lost in a maze of words .

		Two quotations from the sixth volume will illustrate this point : '' Upon
McClellan	PERSON	's repulse on the peninsula , had been arranged , with the state governors , the new levy of three hundred thousand men '' -LRB- page 222 -RRB- . ''

		... But the latter stood obstinately and corps by corps , division by division , of the heroic and devoted Potomac army were shattered in terrible carnage '' -LRB- page 235 -RRB- .

		Infelicities of expression and indefiniteness of citations being overlooked , however , the work is a highly valuable contribution to American literature , and will probably serve for years as the standard reference for the general history of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Constitution down to
1865	DATE	.

		The second volume appeared in
1882	DATE	, the third in
1885	DATE	, the fourth in
1889	DATE	, and the fifth , intended for the final one , in
1891	DATE	.

		The preface of this fifth volume , how - ever , indicated a desire , should health and strength permit , to write a sixth volume de - scriptive of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's administration ; and it is this , bound separately also as a '' History of the Civil War , '' which has now come from the press to complete the series .

		The first pub - lishing arrangements were unfortunate , and the History did not meet favorable comment or attract general attention until the present pub - lishers took hold of it .

		Since then the several volumes have been received with interest as they have appeared .

		The volume on the Civil War begins with a portrayal of the thoughts of the people as they looked forward to the administration of a man who was untried in national life and whose capacity for the responsible position many doubted .

		It closes with the thoughts of the same people as they looked back over the four years of trial and anxiety during which the strength of the President became more and more apparent until in an unhappy hour the assassin struck him down .

		The period is by far the most difficult of American history , for the shelves are full of books written in support of this theory or that , in defense or censure of generals and commanders .

		Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	worked over the great mass of material , and reached conclusions which he made clear in the recently published fourth volume of his history .

		Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	has examined the same sources , and in quite a number of controverted matters has reached substantially the same re - sult .

		Leaving controversy out of consideration , however , several distinct features of this vol - ume are to be noted .

		There are five points connected with this History of the Civil War that are worth special attention .

		1 .

		The `` conspiracy '' idea is everywhere .

		The
Southern Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	is called a conspir - acy , planned by men who were capable of stooping to any means to accomplish their end .

		Many of them were West Pointers who violated their oath of allegiance to the
United States	LOCATION	, betrayed the country which had educated them , basely deserted it in the hour of peril , the ex - cuses which they set forth being poor ones .

		Nothing , our author thinks , can excuse the act of Lee , especially when his treason is compared with the loyalty of other Virginians .

		The ships are sent to distant ports ; representatives are sent to European cities to plead the South - ern cause ; forts are seized , and yet commis - sioners are appointed to negotiate for the division of
United States	LOCATION	property as if no overt act had been committed .

		The fears for the cause of State Sovereignty are very soon lost sight of , as President
Davis	PERSON	becomes an auto - crat of the most determined kind , ruling with a rod of iron .

		It is a conspiracy in the interest of slavery . ''

		The soul of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	revolution of
1861	DATE	, the nucleus of its absorbing passion , was historically the zeal of founding a new or reunited union of States whose corner-stone should be negro slavery , the sub - jection of the colored to the white race as a normal and natural condition . ''

		2 .

		Much attention is paid to men .

		Through - out the several volumes of the history , Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	has made it a rule to stop occasionally to look at the actors upon the stage , comment - ing upon them and describing their character - istics in terse words .

		In the sixth volume this biographical feature is marked , the studies of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	,
Stanton	PERSON	, and Chase , on the one side ,
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 463 and
Davis	PERSON	,
Lee	PERSON	, and
Toombs	PERSON	, on the other , being conspicuous examples .

		McClellan finds little favor in the final analysis .

		His organizing ability is praised , but there is constant blame for his inaction , his obstinacy , his contempt of the administration .

		`` In his sublime egotism he viewed himself as the sole preserver of the people , not in a military sense alone , but against what he deemed the political infatua - tion of the party and men in power . ''

		All through the volume there is opportunity for comparison between
McClellan and Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The one constantly magnifies the enemy 's force ; the other thinks the chances of disorganization on the part of his adversary as great as on his own , and risks attack .

		The one plans strategic movements trying to capture places ; the other cares little for places if he can capture the enemy .

		If
McClellan	PERSON	fails to win admiration , just as certainly the author has a warm spot in his heart for Grant ; and when the latter comes to the front as the great leader of the war , the reader recalls that many generals have been given an opportunity , and that at the last names appear in the relative rank which should be given them , the reasons for this ranking being plainly apparent .

		3 .

		The difficulties in the situation are ad - mirably handled .

		Not to mention others , the trials of the administration in dealing with people in the North who were disposed to give aid and comfort to the enemy , the delicacy of treatment required in the case of the
Border States	LOCATION	, and the more complex diplomatic diffi - culties with foreign powers , each of these topics is discussed in an instructive manner .

		This leads to the mention of a fourth feature of the volume .

		4 .

		Certain topics are presented with much power .

		Good examples are the fiasco of Fre - mont in
Missouri	LOCATION	, the invasion of
Maryland	LOCATION	by
Lee	PERSON	, and the corresponding movement of
Bragg	LOCATION	into
Kentucky	LOCATION	which was attended by like fail - ure of the Border States men to rise in the interest of the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		Few descriptions can be better than that of the fight at Fred - ericksburg , while on the other hand the brilliant attempt of
Pickett	ORGANIZATION	at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	does not inspire a notable paragraph .

		But as a rule the descriptions are good , and this fact keeps the interest of the reader from flagging in the midst of technicalities of campaigns .

		5 .

		A fifth feature of the work is the bold - ness of outline which remains in the mind of the student because of the reiteration of certain essential details .

		The gradual evolution of the military leaders has already been mentioned , as has been the marked predilection for Grant .

		Of like nature is the feeling of Lincoln in regard to the loyal people of
East Tennessee	LOCATION	, or the jealousies among Confederate leaders , little things apparently , and yet in the long run quite important in shaping campaigns and in affecting the purposes and performances of leaders on both sides .

		The repetition of the statements regarding such things does not weaken the narrative , because the occasions for calling attention to them are many .

		Finally , the volume is strong in the discus - sion of phases of the war distinct from the actual fighting .

		The fifty pages given to a consideration of the soldiers of the war and of general traits and industries of the people are exceedingly interesting .

		The same thing is true of half as many pages which treat specifi - cally of the volunteers , the black soldiers , the care or lack of care of prisoners , and the en - forcement of the draft .

		The same faults which appear in the earlier volumes by this author are manifested in the closing one ; the same excellences are likewise apparent .

		On the whole , students of American history are to be con - gratulated on the fact that the literature of the Civil War has been enriched by two such nota - ble additions as the histories by Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	and Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	.

		HISTORY OF MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS .

		* The aim and scope of the Rev.
Alfred Wes	PERSON	- ley
Wishart	PERSON	's '' Monks and Monasteries '' is '' to sketch the history of the monastic institution from its origin to its overthrow in the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion period . ''

		The work is distinctly a sketch , for despite its large proportions the book is but slightly over four hundred pages .

		The author in a sense disarms criticism in the beginning by frankly admitting that he has hardly touched the original sources at all , '' although interme - diate authorities have been studied as widely as possible . ''

		What these are , we may pre - sume the appended bibliography sets forth ; but in justice to Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	, this either should be enlarged -LRB- and pruned -RRB- or omitted altogether .

		It is not edifying to see text-books like Church 's '' Beginnings of the Middle Ages '' and Stille 's '' Studies in Medieval History , ''

June 16	DATE	, astery , ''
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's '' Knights of the Cross , '' and so bigoted a book as
R. W. Thompson	PERSON	's '' Footprints of the Jesuits , '' comporting with
Harnack	PERSON	and Neander and
Stubbs	PERSON	and
Schaff	PERSON	.

		Moreover , this bibliography is as unfortunate in its omissions as in what it includes .

		The author is happiest in the beginning and the end of his theme .

		The rise and develop - ment of Monasticism he traces in an interesting way , even if one does tire of too frequent quo - tation mostly from
Kingsley	PERSON	and long for an expression of opinion in the author 's own words .

		Monasticism was not entirely of Christian origin .

		Oriental religions and practices , Greek philosophy , and Judaistic influences , all had a part in its formation .

		Asceticism and isolation , its two elemental characteristics , were common to both Judaism and pagan cults before
Chris	PERSON	- tianity came into being .

		The Nazarenes of Scripture were primitive ascetics .

		Moses ,
Elijah	PERSON	,
John the Baptist	PERSON	, Christ himself , sought the solitude of the desert .

		Buddha and Ma - homet , founders of non - Christian religions , did the same .

		The new dispensation of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity could not be wholly divorced from its sources , nor could it cast off the influences of its environment .

		The union of Greek thought , which so accentuated the distinction between mind and matter , with the teachings of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity that union which made St.
John	PERSON	the mystic of the ages , gave monasticism most of its philosophic and spiritual basis .

		Rome gave it the law ; the Orient contributed that fanati - cism , amounting to a sort of hysteria , which so characterized
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	monasticism .

		It was natural , therefore , that monastic practices should gradually obtain in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was natural , too , that monasticism should originate in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The central position of
Egypt	LOCATION	, at the angle of
Europe	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, and
Asia	LOCATION	, made that country the common ground of Greek philosophy , Judaism , and Oriental thought .

		Moreover , the atmosphere and to - pography of
Egypt	LOCATION	was most favorable to monasticism .

		The numberless natural cav - erns and excavations in the low hills of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	valley provided the primitive ascetic a dwelling-place .

		The dryness of the climate and his own isolation made him independent of much clothing or furniture , and the scant sus - tenance which his life required dates and millet could be easily provided .

		The first monks , like
Paul	PERSON	of
Thebes	LOCATION	-LRB- circa 262-340 -RRB- and St.
Anthony	PERSON	-LRB- 251-350 -RRB- , adopted that manner of living without reference to others who might be doing the same .

		But the holy living and holy dying of men like these , the persecution which drbve thousands into the desert places , united with fanatical zeal , vastly increased the movement , so that at the
end of the fourth century	DATE	it has been estimated that the number of hermits and cenobites in
Egypt	LOCATION	almost equalled the population in the cities .

		It was inevitable that organization should develop out of this circumstance , and so grad - ually the hermit of the desert becomes the monk of the cloister .

		Two great names are associated with this transition from the solitary to the cenobitic life .

		Pachomius -LRB- 292-348 -RRB- established a brotherhood of monks on the island of Tabenne in the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, who lived under the triple rule of poverty , chastity , and obedi - ence .

		Basil the Great -LRB- 329-379 -RRB- , a Greek of character and ability , founded a similar clois - ter in
Pontus	LOCATION	, near the Black Sea ; and Basil 's Rule fixing the details of life within and with - out the walls of the monastery , supplemented by numerous decisions of councils and em - perors , which Justinian united into a code for the monasteries of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, became the organic law of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	brotherhoods .

		From the fourth century onwards monastic foundations multiplied rapidly in the
East	LOCATION	.

		At the death of Constantine in 337 there were fifteen monasteries in the Empire .

		In 536 there were ninety .

		The reasons of this increase are not hard to find .

		The intense and artifi - cial civilization of the
Later Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	created a craving for some new sensation or novelty , and monasticism satisfied that ennui which was eating at the hearts of so many .

		The Church saw in the enthusiasm a new means to idealize the Christian life of self-sacrifice .

		Martyrdom was no longer possible ; the live heat of that burning enthusiasm which had up - lifted the hearts of early converts in the stormy hour of torture was becoming chilled .

		But the excessive tendency to multiply the monasteries , united with the extravagance of some practices of the monks , by the middle of the fifth century had become a serious source of disquietude to the government .

		Men rushed into the cloister to evade taxes , to escape ser - vice in the army , or to find an easy means of living at the expense of pious and generous Christians .

		Relatives were confined there by their own kin .

		Fugitive slaves , runaway hus - bands , and sometimes criminals , found refuge there .

		Ambitious and frivolous monks asso - ciated with those of true faith .

		The vow of personal poverty did not prevent the acquisition
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 465 of corporate wealth by the brotherhood , so that luxury and ribaldry crept into the houses .

		Life according to the Rule -LRB- regula -RRB- became impos - sible .

		In 451 , at the
Council of Chalcedon	ORGANIZATION	, the Church and the Empire together sought to remedy these disorders by requiring episcopal sanction for every monastic foundation ; proper endowment , in order to make it independent of charity ; rigid enforcement of regulations ; and a novitiate of three years a provision which the abbots made a dead letter .

		Monasticism entered western
Europe	LOCATION	through the instrumentality of St.
Jerome	PERSON	-LRB- 340-418 -RRB- and Augustine of Hippo -LRB- died 430 -RRB- , the latter of whom established a community of clergy who renounced their property , abounded in charitable work , and lived a life of discipline .

		The first monastery in
Gaul	LOCATION	was at
Liguge	LOCATION	, near
Poitiers	LOCATION	.

		Marmoutier , near Tours , soon followed , both due to the inspiration of the famous St.
Martin	PERSON	-LRB- 316-396 -RRB- , and the list grows longer as the years pass .

		But although emanating from the East and adopted by the West , western monasticism radically differed in intent and practices from eastern monasti - cism .

		The East was given to grotesque and eccentric forms of self-discipline ; the West was practical .

		The eastern monks lived a life apart , absorbed in abortive reflections or in listless idleness , doing no work , but deriving their support from pious but misdirected char - ity .

		Those in the
Latin West	LOCATION	, on the contrary , were earnest , sane in their thinking and action , alert , industrious , and self-supporting .

		The men of the West had no patience with pillar saints , like St.
Simeon Stylites	PERSON	, or hermits who exiled themselves in swamps that the stings of insects might teach them to mortify the flesh , or prayed for days in thorn-bushes , or bent their bodies into torturing positions .

		In his chapters upon the fathers of western monasticism , Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	is disappointing .

		The personalities of
Benedict	PERSON	and
Augustine	PERSON	,
Bernard	PERSON	of
Clairvaux	LOCATION	, and
Peter the Vener	PERSON	- able , are not made impressive .

		And save the Benedictine Order proper and the Franciscans , the rest of the orders get scant treatment .

		Two pages suffice for
Cluny	LOCATION	and two for the
Cis	ORGANIZATION	- tercians !

		With the winning personality of St.
Francis	PERSON	, the narrative begins to mend .

		The best observation made regarding the founder of the Franciscans is , however , relegated to a note in the appendix , a bit worth quotation : '' In many interesting particulars St.
Francis	PERSON	may be compared with
General Booth of the Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		In their intense religious fervor , in their insistence upon obedience , humility , and self-denial , in their services for the welfare of the poor , in their love of the ' sub - merged tenth , ' they are alike .

		... It is quite possible that the differences between
Francis	PERSON	and Booth are due more to the altered historical environment than to any radical diversities in the characters of the two men . ''

		The last chapters are upon the fall of the monasteries , '' The Disestablishment by
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, '' and one upon '' Causes and Ideals , '' an attempt philosophically to account for monasticism .

		The conclusion is that it is impossible to dogmatize , for the system was never wholly good nor wholly bad .

		The social and economic influence of the monks might here have been considered at greater length .

		It remains to make two corrections .

		It is straining the usage of a term to apply the word
Saracen	PERSON	to the Arabians of the fifth century , before Mohammed was born -LRB- p. 53 -RRB- .

		If Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	had read the letters of Sidonius Apol - linaris he would never have termed the Roman - ized
Kelts	PERSON	of
Gaul	PERSON	in the time of Constantine '' rude Gauls just emerging out of barbarism '' -LRB- p. 120 -RRB- .

		It was
Benvenuto d'Imola	PERSON	who was so pained at the careless treatment pre - cious manuscripts received at
Monte Cassino	ORGANIZATION	, and used the words put in
Boccaccio	LOCATION	's mouth in p. 136 . ''

		466 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, written upon
Pompeii	LOCATION	, but with these qualities it combines the rare merit , not always to be found in archaeological works , of being inter - estingly written , attractive in form , and hand - somely illustrated .

		It therefore deserves a cordial welcome not only from the student of classical archaeology , but from the general reader as well .

		From the scholar 's point of view , there is no one better qualified to write authoritatively upon
Pompeii	LOCATION	than Professor
Mau	PERSON	.

		Half of his life has been given to the study of the ruins of the Campanian city and all that they repre - sent in the way of illustrating Roman life and art .

		For a quarter of a century his summers have been regularly spent among the ruins , his winters in working up the material so col - lected .

		He is therefore familiar with literally every stone and corner of the excavated portion of the city ; and in addition to this familiarity with the city he possesses two essential qualities an enthusiastic devotion to his work , and a strictly scientific method .

		He has already writ - ten much in German and Italian upon special subjects and special problems in connection with
Pompeii	LOCATION	.

		The present work sums up the achievements of a scholar who made his repu - tation years ago but is now first introduced to English readers .

		There are few travellers who have not re - garded their visit to the excavations at Pom - peii as one of the most interesting and profit - able of their jaunts in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Fewer still are able to form more than a vague impression of how each building , and how the city as a whole , looked in antiquity .

		Though the walls of the houses are standing , they are roofless , the wood - work has all disappeared , all the furniture and objects of artistic value have been car - ried for safe keeping to the
Naples Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and the best of the wall paintings have been removed to the same place , leaving an un - sightly break in the plan of decorations .

		It requires something more than the unaided imagination to reconstruct each house or public building as it stood before the catastrophe of 79 A. D. , and the questions which one would ask are only half answered by the guide or the guide-book .

		The grand exception among the ruins is the house of the
Vettii	LOCATION	, excavated in
1894	DATE	and
1895	DATE	.

		Here the roof has been re - stored , the paintings have been left intact , the owner 's safe stands in the atrium , the pots and kettles appear upon the hearth just as they were found , and the garden in the peristyle has been planted with flowers and shrubs , among which stand the statuary and the foun - tains just as they stood in antiquity .

		On seeing this house , one forms a more definite idea of how a Pompeian lived than he has been able to gather from all the other houses in
Pompeii	LOCATION	put together .

		What the excavators have done in the case of the house of the
Vettii	LOCATION	, Professor
Mau	PERSON	has sought to do for the reader in the case of all the important buildings of
Pompeii	LOCATION	, the city itself , and its life .

		One by one each edifice is rebuilt in the reader 's imagination in such a way that he can form a clear idea of how it must have looked inside and out .

		For the completeness of this picture every aid is furnished to the eye in the way of plans and restorations based upon care - ful measurements .

		The sectional drawings of these restorations , in particular , help to give the reader a better idea of the appearance in antiquity of many of the buildings than he could get from an actual visit to the ruins guide-book in hand .

		The decorations are then described , the mosaics , architectural ornaments , and paintings , the latter in some detail and with copious illustrations whenever they happen to be of artistic value or of interest in connec - tion with the development of Pompeian art .

		In the chapter on the house of the Vettii there are no fewer than ten illustrations of the paint - ings alone .

		A large portion of the book is nec - essarily taken up with describing the buildings of the city .

		The descriptions , however , in spite of the fact that many of the buildings possess some elements of similarity , do not grow tedi - ous ; the author has something new and enter - taining to say in the case of each , and it is no small praise to say that one finds the account of the last houses upon his list quite as inter - esting as the first .

		The enumeration of nec - essary details is relieved by passages such as the following , taken from the chapter on the house of the Faun , in which the reader is car - ried back in imagination to the days before the eruption and is given a general view of this house in a description which shows no trace of scholarly dryness . ''

		As one stepped across the mosaic border at the end of the fauces , a beautiful vista opened up before the eyes .

		From the aperture of the compluvium a diffused light was spread through the atrium brilliant with its rich coloring .

		At the rear the lofty entrance to the tablinum attracted the visitor by its stately dignity .

		Now the portieres are drawn aside , and beyond the large window of the tablinum the columns of the first peristyle are seen .

		The shrubs and flowers of the garden are rich with sunshine , and fragrant odors are wafted through the house ; in the midst a slender fountain jet rises in the air and falls with a murmur pleasant to the ear . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 467 Throughout the book , Professor
Mau	PERSON	has endeavored to reconstruct , not merely the buildings of the city , but also the life of the people which thronged in and about them .

		A description of
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, her worship and her wor - shippers , forms an integral part of the chapter on the temple of that goddess .

		The public buildings , the baths , the palaestra , the theatres and amphitheatre , are made the centre of a vivid account of the serious business and the recreations and amusements of the Pom - peians .

		In the chapters on the shops , the inns , the manufactories , and the farm buildings at
Boscoreale	LOCATION	, he describes the various trades and industrial processes concerned .

		He has thus given us in a single volume not only by far the best work upon the buildings of
Pompeii	LOCATION	, and the best guide-book of the city for those who have more than a few hours to spend there , but also the best account which we have of the details of every-day life in a Roman provincial town .

		The volume is a model of clear exposition .

		From beginning to end the author has taken the utmost pains to make it intelligible at every point with the least expenditure of effort on the part of the reader .

		Every term of a tech - nical nature is carefully explained ; the account of the different architectural periods and the styles of house decoration is beautifully clear and definite .

		Although each chapter contains a great deal of scholarly information , this is em - bodied easily in the text without detracting from its clearness or making it heavy .

		It is indeed a pleasure to review a book to which so much de - served praise can be given .

		Professor
Mau	PERSON	has made the
Pompeii	LOCATION	of fact not less interesting to the general reader than the
Pompeii	LOCATION	of fiction , and that too without sacrificing any of those qualities which render such a work valuable to the special student , who will find it the most complete account of
Pompeii	LOCATION	which has yet been published , and one which is scholarly in every respect .

		The author is fortunate in having secured as his translator a scholar who is himself so familiar with
Pompeii	LOCATION	as Professor
Francis W. Kelsey	PERSON	of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Malentendus '' is the title of a new volume of short stories by that prolific and entertaining writer , Mme.

		STORIES OF THE THOMPSON RIVER INDIANS .

		* The Salish Indians live in
Washington	LOCATION	,
Idaho	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	, and
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The group is linguistic , and is subdivided into two lesser divisions the
Coast Salish	ORGANIZATION	and the Interior Salish .

		The languages of the
Coast Salish	ORGANIZATION	are notably divergent ; those of the
Interior Salish	ORGANIZATION	are more uniform .

		The Indians whose traditions are studied in the volume before us are Interior Salish , living along the upper part of the
Thompson River	LOCATION	and in the
Nicola Valley	LOCATION	.

		In the Introduction , Dr.
Boas	PERSON	sketches the ethnography of these Indians . ''

		They are pri - marily hunters and fishermen . ''

		Their villages are small .

		Until recently , the little popula - tions moved with the seasons , which brought a varying food-supply .

		Their social organiza - tion was ill-defined .

		There were no definite chiefs , no clans , no totems , no restrictions upon marriage except that near relations might not marry .

		The religious ideas were simple , and great rituals and secret societies did not exist among them .

		The sun seems to have been the chief object of worship .

		In all these points of ethnography , the
Thompson River Indians	LOCATION	differ remarkably from their neighbors
Kwakiutl	LOCATION	, Tshimpshian , and other coast tribes north of these .

		Fully half of Mr.
Teit	PERSON	's collection of the traditions of these Indians are `` transformer stories . ''

		A '' transformer '' is a being who has brought about present conditions by the trans - formation of those previously existing .

		Such transformers are frequent in Indian traditions , but usually one transformer is sufficient for a tribal cycle .

		Here , however , there are several such beings the Coyote , three brothers called
Qoaq Lqah	PERSON	,
Kokwela	LOCATION	, and the Old Man .

		The transformer
Qoaq Lqah	PERSON	is also a culture-hero .

		Frequently in Indian legends the culture-hero is at once good and bad ; he is benevolent and helpful ; he is a trickster and a liar .

		This peculiar combination of qualities has given rise to considerable discussion among ethnographers .

		To reconcile these contradictory traits in one being was the problem .

		Dr.
Boas	PERSON	believes that the transformer is rarely an intentional bene - factor .

		He presents a series of illustrations of his operations in the stories of different tribes .

June 16	DATE	, The transformer is in all purely egoistic : he seeks his own selfish ends ; if the results are helpful to mankind , this is incidental , not pur - posive .

		While this is clearly true of the tribes discussed , Dr.
Boas	PERSON	shows the existence of a transition to stories where the altruistic efforts of a true culture hero become evident .

		From the presence of four transformers instead of one , Dr.
Boas	PERSON	infers a probably com - plex origin of the
Thompson River	LOCATION	traditions .

		By an analysis of the Coyote stories , he demon - strates that there has been transmission of tales from foreign sources .

		The elements from these different sources have not yet amalgamated .

		The various transformers are beings from dif - ferent neighboring tribes not yet fused into one great culture-hero .

		These stories have been influenced by the physical environment and by the social organization of the Indians among whom they have been gathered .

		These influ - ences are considered in detail by Dr.
Boas	PERSON	, and important generalizations are drawn from the consideration .

		Following Dr.
Boas	PERSON	' Introduction , thirty - eight stories of the
Thompson Eiver Indians	ORGANIZATION	are presented .

		To these are added two stories of the Lillooet .

		In the notes a variety of helpful mat - ter is given .

		Some of this is explanatory ; much is comparison with stories from elsewhere ; some is presentation of variants ; some is the rendering into Latin of passages considered indecent .

		A few of the stories are given in the original language , with interlinear translations .

		In the comparisons instituted a wide range of tribes is included tribes of the whole North - west Coast region , Chinook ,
Northern Atha	LOCATION	- paskan ,
Ponca	LOCATION	, and
Navajo	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is strange that with so wide a range of comparison no refer - ence is made to the Tehua stories given by Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	.

		Several elements in these strikingly resemble those found in the
Thompson River	LOCATION	tales , and well deserve consideration .

		The visits by the coyote to other animals who can do what he can not do ; the tree which by its growth carries a person up to a required point ; the wee basket of food that is inexhaustible , these are features sufficiently peculiar for their identical occurrence in tribes as separated as the
Thompson River Indians	LOCATION	and the
Rio Grande Pueblos	ORGANIZATION	to be noted .

		The book ends with a valuable series of abstracts of the stories , made by Dr.
Boas	PERSON	.

		This sort of analysis of folk-tales is the most important step prelimin - ary to serious study and comparison .

		MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE FRENCH BASTILLE .

		* Mr.
Funck-Brentano	PERSON	's interesting book of '' Legends of the Bastille '' is based on recent examination of hitherto neglected records , and proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that a certain class of popular notions about that famous prison are not well founded .

		That the
Bastille of the eighteenth century	DATE	was not half so black as it was painted , may be taken as proved .

		What people used to call the '' hor - rors '' of the Bastille have been overdrawn .

		It may be questioned if during the last half - century of the prison 's existence there were any '' horrors '' in the usual sense of the term .

		There were , for instance , no frightful subterra - nean dungeons , dank , dark , and swarming with vermin with toads , lizards , enormous rats , spiders , etc. where the starving captives lay on straw rattling their chains and uttering doleful cries .

		In point of fact , the Bastille of the eight - eenth century was a very good and humanely , even indulgently , conducted prison , as prisons then were , where the inmates appear to have been well fed and decently lodged .

		The one damning thing about the
Bastille	LOCATION	was that one might be sent there arbitrarily , at the instance of private malice , vengeance , or self-interest , and kept there as long as the powers that ruled thought fit .

		That feature of the
Bastille	LOCATION	was , to our thinking , `` horror '' enough , and a suffi - cient justification of democratic celebrations of the work that was done on
July 14 , 1789	DATE	.

		The fact is that the motive that made men of liberal opinions the world over acclaim the fall of the Bastille was not so much humani - tarian as political .

		It is ridiculous to suppose that they rejoiced over that event as over a mere jail-delivery of a parcel of ill-treated pris - oners .

		Had there been no prisoners at all -LRB- and there were only a handful of them -RRB- , the enthusiasm would have been the same .

		The
Bastille	LOCATION	was regarded as a symbol , as a tangible emblem , of the social and political system that the Revolution came to destroy .

		Its fall was hailed by Democracy as a token of the fall of the regime it stood for .

		It seems to us a very superficial view to hold that the significance , the immortal memory , of the event of
July 14	DATE	evaporates when it is proved by Dryasdust that when this prisoner wanted '' a dressing-gown * LEGENDS OF THE BASTILLE .

		THE DIAL 469 of red-striped calamanco , '' he got it ; when that prisoner wanted '' embroidered ruffles '' to his shirt , they were procured for him ; when the other prisoner wanted '' a dress of white silk spotted with green flowers , '' it was not denied her ; that there were firewood , light , pens , ink , paper , soap ad libitum , and so on , at the
Bastille	LOCATION	; that the food there was com - paratively good and plenty ; and that one pris - oner had his flute , and another his fiddle , etc. .

		All this is interesting to know , and testifies to the spirit of humanity that was already abroad in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Sensibility '' was the humor of the day , of
Rousseau	PERSON	's day , and inmates of all houses of detention had their share of the ben - efit of it .

		But such facts do not abate one jot the significance of the essential fact that the
Bastille	LOCATION	symbolized the arbitrary power of a ruling caste .

		The first blast of the gathering storm of the Revolution swept it away .

		While , to our thinking , Mr.
Funck-Brentano	PERSON	's attempt to paint the
Bastille	LOCATION	as a sort of state hotel where the guests were clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day , is , in its way , as much of an exaggeration as the grewsome old '' legends '' he assails were in theirs , there is no denying the interest , authenticity , and pertinence of the facts he adduces in evidence .

		His inductions , however , seem to us too sweeping .

		He certainly makes havoc of the '' legend '' of Latude ; and his attempt to strip off the covering from the face of the Man in the Iron Mask -LRB- which was really a velvet mask , by-the-way -RRB- is ingenious and plausible , if not quite convincing .

		The book is readable and must not be neglected by stu - dents of the subject .

M. Victorien Sardou	PERSON	has supplied a lively Introduction .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		When , as in the case of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, two
Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		tne nero ^ a nation has become the theme of epic legends , the task of a biographer becomes one of de-heroizing his hero , and the result is apt to be disappointing in measure as the work is faithfully done .

		Something of this effect must be felt by the reader of Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's volume on Charlemagne in the `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , though the picture loses vividness as a result of its extent .

		A biography which is to treat its subject as a hero should natu - rally be quite personal .

		But when all of the personal details of the life of the great Emperor which are not strictly authentic are rejected , there remains scarcely enough material for a book of 330 pages .

		Barring this discrepancy between the author 's method and the title of his book , it is a valuable work .

		The summary of conditions pre - vious to the accession of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	to the throne brings together much material necessary to a proper background .

		Only here and there a generalization seems to be too sweeping or the trust reposed in a chronicler too confiding .

		When credit is given to
England	LOCATION	-LRB- page 9 -RRB- for the evangelization of Ger - many , it would have been more exact to say
Great Britain	LOCATION	, since many of the first missionaries to Ger - many were Scotch and Irish . ''

		The ideal
Teuton	PERSON	of imaginative historians '' is doubtless to be dis - counted , but one must be cautious in attempting to correct this ideal by the descriptions of a clerical annalist like
Gregory of Tours	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , indeed , our author admits ; yet he quotes the descriptions of
Gregory	LOCATION	, while ignoring those of the '' imaginative historians . ''

		Sympathetic imagination is the desir - able quality which Mr.
Davis	PERSON	lacks in his treatment of his subject .

		It may have been wise to sift the sources scrupulously , but the sieve should not be so plainly in evidence if we are to have a hero left in the results -LRB- cf. page 26 -RRB- .

		The danger of too sweep - ing generalization is manifest in the contradictions of pages 90 and 319 : '' The Pope 's position in the Prankish realm is still that of a favored subordin - ate . '' ''

		Charles belonged in fact to no nation of modern growth , but to the only nation which in his day deserved the name , to that nation in which local and racial differences were suppressed or trans - cended , to the nation of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the servant of the Church he humbled the
Saxon	LOCATION	, treated with the
Dane	PERSON	, and cowed the Slav ; as the servant of the Church he led his armies first across the Alps and then across the Pyrenees . ''

		Similarly , on pages 32 and 46 : '' The conceptions of the fam - ily , the state , civic rights and duties , were the same throughout the realm . '' ''

		The
Neustrian Frank	ORGANIZATION	, especially when of royal rank , was frequently polyg - amous ; irregular unions unsanctioned by the Church were at all times lightly contracted and lightly broken .

		But these were a departure from the best traditions of the race . ''

		Nevertheless , the book is well worth reading , especially for those who have not access to the sources .

		It is adorned with a number of reproductions illustrating the civilization of the Carolingian period .

		Causes of the There are few visitors to

		ancient city , do not feel the desire to know what were the forces which caused the destruction of the once magnificent buildings whose remains , though still massive , form but a small portion of the original structures .

		Everyone who views the site of the Circus Maximus , which , we are informed , seated upon marble seats at the most conservative estimate 150,000 people , natu - rally wishes to know what has become of so much marble , and how so huge a structure has vanished 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, so completely as to leave hardly a trace of its ex - istence .

		The same question is asked with regard to the missing portions of the Coliseum , of the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- silica of Constantine , and of many other buildings whose ruins still seem capable of withstanding the mere forces of nature for all time .

		This is the problem which Professor
Lanciani	PERSON	undertakes to solve in his latest work , '' The Destruction of An - cient
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is a sketch of the various factors that have contributed to the demolition of the monuments of the ancient city , from antiquity down to modern times .

		The gen - eral conclusions which the author draws are not entirely new , but have been hinted at in his works already published .

		These conclusions are , in sub - stance , that the ravages of time and the invasions of the barbarians have played a much less important part in the destruction of the monuments than has generally been supposed , and that the chief de - stroyers of Ancient
Rome	LOCATION	were the Romans them - selves , who throughout the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	, and down to even comparatively recent times , not only preyed upon the monuments as quarries for the procuring of building materials , but burned many of these precious marbles to make lime .

		In the present work Professor
Lanciani	PERSON	has gone into the subject more exhaustively , and treats it systematically and in chronological order .

		Beginning with the reign of Augustus , he tells , century by century , the story of the destruction of the ancient monuments , whether due to fire , flood , the sacking of the city by hostile armies , or the vandalism of the Romans themselves , and also of the extent to which the ancient buildings suffered from each of these causes .

		The book is thoroughly entertaining , and is interesting not merely from the point of view of the problem which the author has undertaken to solve , but also by reason of the vast amount of varied information , archaeological and historical , which it gives by the way .

		The student of history in particular will find some interesting sidelights thrown upon the inva - sions of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	races by the evidence of the excavations .

		The volume is profusely illustrated , and is rendered valuable as a book of reference by a good index compiled by Professor
Walter Dennison	PERSON	of
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rapid exploitation of
Africa	LOCATION	in recent years , and the increased knowledge of that continent which has come to us , have served to bring to public notice an impending conflict between two great religions .

		Mohammedanism has lately spread with such start - ling rapidity that to-day it is the dominating reli - gious force in
Africa	LOCATION	north of the
Equator	LOCATION	.

		What is the duty of Christian nations in relation to this condition in
Africa	LOCATION	?

		Is Islamism suited in itself and in its rules of life to the best and quickest up - lifting of the native races ?

		Is it advisable to encour - age the native acceptance of Mohammedanism in order to use that religion as a stepping-stone in the progress from fetish worship to Christianity ?

		These Islam in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		are the questions which the Rev.
Ansen P. Atter	PERSON	- bury attempts to answer in his book on '' Islam in
Africa	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Though the author seems not to have had any personal experience in
Africa	LOCATION	, he has apparently studied his subject with extreme care , and has produced a scholarly monograph , eminently fair and generously appreciative of the best features of
Mohammedan	DATE	faith and life .

		In his conclusion Mr.
Atterbury	PERSON	emphatically favors Christianity under all circumstances and conditions , and is unalterably opposed to any toleration of Islamism , even when the latter religion serves as a merely temporary agency for good .

		It is in this sweeping judgment that there seems cause for criti - cism .

		Mr.
Atterbury	PERSON	does not sufficiently distin - guish between the people of northern
Africa	LOCATION	, for centuries followers of the Mohammedan faith , and those of central and equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	, for the most part converts of the present generation and largely converts by compulsion .

		Nor is due importance given to differences of race in these regions .

		The consensus of recent English opinion , including that of many missionaries , is that while energetic action will save central
Africa	LOCATION	to
Christianity	LOCATION	, the day is far distant when Christian missionary enterprise will be generally successful in northern
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The book is particularly valuable in its clear and concise estimate of the value of Mohammedanism as a civil - izing agency for the negro races .

		It should be of great interest to all observers of African affairs .

		A recent volume of '' Great Masters 5n .

		Dinting and Sculpture '' -LRB- Mac - inillan -RRB- is given to
Luca Signorelli	PERSON	, by Miss
Maud Cruttwell	PERSON	.

		We pointed out , some months ago , the particular interest attaching to the first volumes of this series those on
Luini	PERSON	and
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		We will confess that we see no especial reason for continuing the series with
Luca Signorelli	PERSON	: it would seem proper to include him , doubtless , but his appearance so early reminds one of the man who sought too high a seat at the wed - ding feast .

		It is true that it is not really a matter of importance just where in such a series any given painter may appear ; still , the fact that the volume on
Signorelli	PERSON	comes just where it does brings up more strongly than would otherwise be the case the contrast between him and the masters who have been mentioned .


Signorelli	PERSON	is not intrinsically as great a man as
Velasquez	PERSON	, nor is he representative of so much as
Luini	PERSON	.

		What is he ?

		Why does he continue to exist ?

		Why have a book about him with forty pictures ?

		The average student of the arts , if taken very suddenly with these questions , will say that
Signorelli	PERSON	is interesting as a prede - cessor of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	.

		But we must expect of a biographer something more definite than this , and something less academic .

		No one but a student or a professor will bother about a predecessor when he can have the man himself .

		We rather think that the author of this book goes far toward making out a case , does much in giving

		To the more general amateur , we do not think that spirit will ever again be of very great interest ; to the artist and the art - student it will probably always have its attraction and fascination , for it was imbued with so strong a feeling for one of the eternal things of art , the hu - man form .

		In '' The Theology of Modern Lit - erature '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , the Rev.
S. Law Wilson	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, con - siders , with reference to their theology , the writings of ten different authors , namely ,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
George MacDonald	PERSON	,
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	,
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	, Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	,
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, and
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Among the 450 pages of this volume there are many interesting ones ; the author 's analysis and discussion show considerable insight and literary appreciation , but the critical value of the volume is much impaired by the persistent intrusion of the author 's own dog - matic theology , which is of the most pronounced antiquarian type .

		In his opinion , '' there are few phases of our literature which can be considered deeply or pronouncedly religious ... The theol - ogy which the circulating library now uses its vast network of agencies to circulate is very largely a theology which empties Scriptures of their meaning , substitutes uninspired materials for inspired in the evolution of belief , sets up a defiant individualism against the historic consciousness of
Christendom	LOCATION	, resolves the grace of God into a ` sweet reasonable - ness , ' and insists that Christianity shall commit sui - cide by renouncing everything Christian . ''

		To rescue theology from becoming '' the vassal or the troll of literature ... to bring the theology of the litterateur and the belle-lettrist into comparison with the theology of
Church and Creed	ORGANIZATION	, and where the two are not en rapport , as very often happens , to indicate as accurately as possible the precise angle of divergence , '' is the author 's self-appointed task .

		There is more than a touch of medievalism in '' criticism '' of this sort .

		A one-volume geography of the world .

		Professor
Hugh Robert Mill	PERSON	's '' In - ternational Geography '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- is a work of great interest and value .

		It has seventy different contributors , chosen from among the foremost specialists in the world in their several branches of knowledge , and with particular reference to their acquaintance with the specific subjects they were to treat .

		For example , Professor
W. M. Davis	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, writes the chapters on the Continent of
North America	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, the last one being the longest in the book .

		Part I. of the work deals with the '' Principles of Geography `` under the heads , ''
Geog	PERSON	- raphy , Principles and Progress , '' `` Mathematical Geography , '' `` Maps and Map Reading , '' `` The Plan of the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' '' Land Forms , their Nature and Origin , '' '' The Oceans , '' '' Atmosphere and Climate , '' '' The Distribution of Living Creatures , '' pf modem knowiedge .

		`` The Distribution of
Mankind	LOCATION	, '' `` Political and Applied Geography '' ; and Part II. , in seven books , is given to a treatment of the Continents and the Polar Regions .

		The work will be of value even to advanced students of geography who desire to have the more important knowledge of the world brought together in one book ; but it will be found even more helpful by a far larger class of persons students of other sciences , historians and students of history , journalists , men in public life , men of let - ters and students of literature , and general readers who are frequently in sore need of some manual to which they can readily turn for information that is relatively full and perfectly authoritative .

		The illustrations , nearly five hundred in number , a ma - jority of them sketch-maps , add much to the value of the work .

		- '' The
Temple Primers	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in con - nection with the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, are designed to provide , `` in a convenient and acces - sible form , the information which the usual bulky and high-priced encyclopaedias place beyond the easy reach of the average reader . ''

		Judging by the promises of the publishers , this series of small books is likely to run into the hundreds of volumes , for nothing less than '' a complete and trustworthy Primer-Cyclopaedia of modern knowledge '' is what we are told to expect .

		The writers will be the fore - most English , French , German , and Italian special - ists , and such works are promised as '' Modern Chemistry , '' by Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	; '' Mediaeval French Literature , '' by
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	; '' Educa - tional Methods , '' by Dr. Rein ; and '' The Italian Renaissance , '' by Prof essor
Villari	PERSON	.

		The volumes , which will be illustrated when found desirable , are exceedingly attractive in form , and are sold at a low price .

		The following eight numbers have been received by us : '' An Introduction to Science , '' by Dr.
Alexander Hill	PERSON	; '' A History of Politics , '' by Professor
E. Jenks	PERSON	; '' The English Church , '' by Dean
Spence	PERSON	; '' Roman History , '' by Dr.
Julius Koch	PERSON	; ''

India	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Romesh C. Dutt	PERSON	; '' The Greek Drama , '' by Mr.
L. D. Barnett	PERSON	; and '' Ethnology , '' by Dr.
Michael Haberlandt	PERSON	.

		We wish the projectors of this enterprise every success , for its usefulness is fully attested by the volumes now published , and it is likely to do a great work for the popularization of the latest results of scholarship .

		A considerable amount of curious information of a sort not altogether justly thought to lie outside the prov - ince of history is to be found in Mr.
Tighe Hopkins	PERSON	's `` An Idler in Old
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Clio is commonly too busy with the doings of courts and cabinets , diplomats and soldiers , to pay much atten - tion to the vulgar facts of life to tell us how men and women ate , drank , dressed , and amused them - selves , what were their notions in respect of the toilet and the bath , etc. .

		It is of such and kindred Fragments of old French history .

		472 THE DIAL -LSB-

Messrs. Hachette & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume covers the year
1899	DATE	, and has been pre - pared by
M. Emile Gautier	PERSON	.

		Under the head of '' Tra - vaux Publics , '' the Exposition comes in for treatment at some length .

		The material of the work is classified , and ranges from cosmology to the death-roll of the year .

		The
National Council of Education	ORGANIZATION	offers two prizes -LRB- of
$ 200	MONEY	and
$ 100	MONEY	respectively -RRB- for the best two essays upon each of the following four subjects : the seating , the lighting , the heating , and the ventilation of school buildings .

		The limit is ten thousand words for each essay , and all manuscripts must be submitted by
February	DATE	of next year .

		Mr.
A. R. Taylor	PERSON	, of
Emporia	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, is chairman of the committee in charge , and will furnish particulars of the competition to those interested . ''

		Orators of Ancient Rome '' and '' Orators of the Reformation Era , '' both edited by Messrs.
Guy Carleton Lee	PERSON	and
Joseph Cullen Ayer	PERSON	, form the second and fourth volumes of '' The World 's Orators , '' to be pub - lished in ten volumes by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		These handsome tomes , with their portraits and their dignified typographical dress , deserve a place in every library , and we predict that the thousand sets to which this '' University Edition '' is limited will be speedily taken up by subscribers . ''

		The International Monthly '' offers a series of prizes , called `` Teachers ' Fellowships , '' of
$ 150	MONEY	each , for essays embodying some amount of original research in the following departments : history , philosophy , sociology , comparative religion , literature , fine art , biology , geol - ogy , economics , and education .

		For conditions and further particulars application should be made to the Fellowship Editor ,
Burlington	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		The resignation of Dr.
Henry Wade Rogers	PERSON	from the presidency of the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	is an event to be deplored in any case , and if , as the public prints hint somewhat broadly , the resignation was forced , and connected in any way with the manly and outspoken attitude of Dr.
Rogers	PERSON	toward the present attempt of certain politicians , temporarily in power , to subvert the foundations of the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	, it is an event of sinister significance to educational interests in general .

		If the authorities of the
University	ORGANIZATION	do not make it clear that this motive had nothing to do with the retirement of Dr.
Rogers	PERSON	, they will suffer severely in the opinion of the intelligent public , and the prestige of their institution will have been dealt a blow from which recovery will not soon or easily be made .

		To Dr.
Rogers	PERSON	, upon his departure from the scene of his recent activities , THE DIAL wishes to pay a tribute of respect and admiration for the efficient work that he has done to promote the best interests of the higher education , and for his devotion to ideals that are now being roughly attacked in many quarters .
