		It is impossible to measure the influence of a great writer upon the generation in which he fives and works .

		Certain outward signs there are , in the form of a traceable moulding of public opinion , as shown in the way in which his idealism becomes the acknowledged motive - power of men of action , or in the form of that discipleship which makes the individual the radiating centre of a school of influence propa - gating his idealism by offshoots and obviously imitative embodiments .

		These effects are always more or less manifest to the student of literary history and of intellectual affairs in the broader sense , but they fall far short of giving a full account of the matter .

		They show us the surface - flow of the current of tendency , but they leave the subtler part of its action unrevealed .

		For it is by its permeation of the sub-soil of human consciousness , rather than by its visible erosions , that the influence of a great writer does its last - ing work , making possible some unexpected and rich new product of human sympathy or enlight - enment .

		We recall what
Lowell	PERSON	once said of Emerson : '' To him more than to all other causes together did the young martyrs of our Civil War owe the sustaining strength of thoughtful hero - ism that is so touching in every record of their lives . ''

		We think also of the example of Cer - vantes , who '' smiled
Spain	LOCATION	's chivalry away , '' when he seemed to be doing no more than pro- vide entertainment for his readers , and of
Milton	PERSON	, who steeled the forces of puritanism for their warfare of spirit against sense , when he seemed to be engaged only in the poetical elaboration of an outworn mythology , and of
Mazzini	PERSON	, who raised
Italy	LOCATION	from the dead , when he seemed merely to be plotting against principalities and powers in the ordinary way of revolutionary politics .

		Such influences as these are slowly exerted , and it is a long while before their results are declared .

		They work , for the most part , upon minds without articulate power , upon the im - pressionable minds of the young , quietly but potently , until the time ripens for their trans - lation into deed .

		When that times comes , the outcome is apt to be surprising , for it is the resultant of innumerable spiritual forces , singly insignificant perhaps , but collectively irresis - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, tible , because all are exerted in the same general direction and toward the accomplishment of the same general purpose .

		We believe that the chief service done by a great writer for his fellow-men is that of thus fitting for action the generation that is growing up , of quickening the sympathies and clarifying the thoughts of the young , who will later have the shaping of the world in their own hands .

		And this incalcu - lable power to stimulate the imagination and strengthen the will of adolescent humanity is immensely heightened by the fact that it pro- ceeds from a living being , from a voice that issues , not from the tomb , but from a breathing organ of human speech .

		It is true that the voice must make its appeal to nearly all who heed it through the medium of the printed page , but as long as it is known to be the utterance of a man among men it has from that very fact an added force .

		The reader who heeds it can - not forget that it is within the bounds of possi - bility that some favored hour may bring him into the presence of its possessor , to be thrilled by its actual accents , and warmed by the glow of the living personality which is its setting .

		That faculty of hero-worship which is the attri - bute of all generous young souls instinctively demands the concrete embodiment of its object ; it is a tribute that loses much of its natural ardor when paid to a phantasm .

		The sum of all these reflections is that the world is made rich in a very special sense by the great writers who are living in it , and that no heritage of past glories can prevent humanity from seeming impoverished when its intellectual leaders cease from their labors .

		The observa - tion is especially pertinent just now , when the last leaf has fallen from the tree of genius that flourished so luxuriantly a generation ago , and when the world must face the fact that the ac - counts of a great literary epoch are practically closed .

		For it is the simple truth that there is no writer now anywhere alive who is the peer of the half-dozen who have adorned the past decade , or of the score or more who have made splendid the literary annals of the past thirty years .

		Just as in a commercial enterprise , the first month or so of the new year is needed to settle up the affairs of the old , and prepare its balance-sheet , so in the large matters of a cen - tury 's intellectual business , it takes about a decade of the new century to clear up the ac - counts of the old , and make it possible to esti - mate the achievement of the hundredyear .

		Upon this occasion , then , when the twentieth century is just ten years on its way , it may not be unprofitable to take stock in the literary world , to reckon up our quick assets , and to set down what may seem advisable to the score of profit and loss .

		Some unsettled accounts there must needs be , some overlapping activities , for centuries are artificial periods , after all , and the Weltgeist recks little of them .

		Still , the line between the
nineteenth century	DATE	, which we know in full , and the twentieth , the develop - ments of which we may only surmise , is rather more definitely drawn than is often the case with such arbitrary divisions , and the old stock -LRB- to recur to our previous figure -RRB- is pretty well dis - posed of , while we hardly know as yet what are the wares that will take its place upon our shelves .

		Among the losses of the recent past we think of such great men as
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Carducci	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		Casting our eyes a score of years yet farther back , we have the vision of such men as
Tourguenieff	LOCATION	,
Auerbach	LOCATION	,
Freytag	PERSON	, Hugo , Renan ,
Taine	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and Whitman .

		This is a cursory retrospect only ; a more particular one would disclose other losses comparable with many of these .

		But it suffices for our purpose , which is merely to show clearly that we now live in an age comparatively poverty-stricken as to the richer personalities of literature , and seemingly incapable of holding aloft the torch so long held alight by those giant runners in the race .

		It is a condition too obvious to call for demonstration ; the youth who in
1880	DATE	faced the future might count upon the living spiritual guidance of such men as the youth of
1910	DATE	look for in vain along the line of the literary horizon .

		Can it prove possible that these latter-day youth , when they in turn shall have rounded their half-century , will be able to look back during their own lives upon anything like our array of great nineteenth - century figures ?

		Let us make a comparative and somewhat more detailed survey of the situation .

		For
Russia	LOCATION	, we have , in the place of Tourguenieff and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, only such men as Andreieff and
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the Scandinavian countries , we have , in place of
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Drachmann	PERSON	and Rydberg , only such men as
Hamsun	LOCATION	and
Brandes	PERSON	and
Strindberg	LOCATION	.

		The case of
Germany	LOCATION	is better , for the veterans Heyse and Spielhagen remain , and with them there are the younger figures of
Hauptmann	PERSON	and Sudermann and Frenssen .

		But the case of
France	LOCATION	is depressing , since we may hardly
1911	DATE	- -RSB- THE DIAL find substitutes for Hugo and Renan and
Taine	PERSON	in such men as
Rostand	PERSON	and
Anatole France	LOCATION	, even throwing in
Maeterlinck	PERSON	-LRB- as a writer in French -RRB- for good measure .

		And it would be foolish even to hint that any living Italian say d'Annunzio or Fogazzaro could be held a worthy successor of
Carducci	PERSON	.


Spain	LOCATION	, indeed , offers us
Galdos	PERSON	and
Echegaray	PERSON	, fairly equival - ent to the best of their predecessors , and
Poland	LOCATION	makes a finer showing with
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	than it could boast at an earlier age .

		The greatest figure among English men of letters now living is undoubtedly that of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, the sole survivor of the company of his peers and more than peers who stood shoulder to shoulder thirty years ago .

		The case of
America	LOCATION	is the most discouraging of all .

		We admire such men as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	, and hold them in our deepest affection , but they hardly fill the places of the poets we have lately lost Sted - man and
Aldrich	PERSON	and
Moody	ORGANIZATION	and not at all the places of such seers and singers as
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Now that our hurried stock-taking is over , and we are facing the essential facts of world - activity in literature at the present day , we can not feel altogether cheerful about the situa - tion .

		The feeling does not arise merely from the fact that the list of the great recently de - parted vastly outweighs the list of the best that the world of the living has to offer .

		This fact in itself would be sufficient cause for serious reflection , and we are made still more serious when we compare the two lists more specifically , thinking of the contrast between the two sets of men in the matter of style and the general power of expression , in the matter of intellectual authority , and in the matter of moral weight .

		When we reinforce the comparison by taking into account the lesser writers , past and present the men who , while not individually of the first rank , are perhaps collectively more repre - sentative of their respective periods than the men of towering genius we have a still more depressing sense of the general lowering of standards .

		More often than not , we are offered preciosity and strained effort in the place of style , flippant superficiality as a substitute for wisdom , and a materialistic or hedonistic attitude toward the great problems of conduct instead of a rev - erent recognition of the moral law and glad submission to its behests .

		What poets of our day could say with Dante '' In la sua voluntade & uostra pace , '' what opportunist philosophers could be sharers of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's sublime faith in the good , of
Kant	PERSON	's awe in contemplation of man 's imperious inner instinct of righteousness ?

		Yet we may , after all , take heart when we think of the familiar saying about the darkest hour and the dawn , or when we recall
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer 's confutation of the counsels of despair .

		`` Die
Quelle	ORGANIZATION	, aus der die Individuen und ihre Krafte fliessen , ist unerschopflich und unendlich wie Zeitund Ratim ... Jene unendliche
Quelle	ORGANIZATION	kann kein endliches
Maass	PERSON	erschopfen : daher steht jeder im Keime erstickten Begebenheit , oder Werk , zur Wiederkehr noch immer die unverminderte Unendlichkeit off en . ''

		There may be prophets even now growing up among us , in the most adverse environment , who are destined in days to come to hold the world 's ear no less compulsively than the greatest of those whose recent loss seems to have left us so strangely bereft of inspiring guidance .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE BIBLIOGRAPHER 'S TASK , like that of the lexicographer , the index-maker , the compiler of almanacs , and many another fashioner of the tools used by other workers in literature or science , is a rather cheerless one .

		A consciousness of duty per - formed must often be the chief if not the only reward .

		In turning the leaves of the latest issue of `` The Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of
America	LOCATION	, '' which contains an appended list of '' American Bibliographical Publications '' and one of ''
Bibliog	PERSON	- raphies of Bibliographies , '' one can not but admire the zeal and self-devotion displayed in the compila - tion of many of the learned but very restrictedly useful works there mentioned .

		For example , what return in fame or fortune can be hoped for by the author of a bibliography of writings on paraphysis and hypophysis in the brain of the alligator , or by the enthusiastic aurist who has laboriously compiled a '' partial bibliography of recent papers relating to the Eustachian tube '' ?

		A little better chance for popular recognition seems probable in the case of another bibliographer who has interested himself in the literature relating to '' meals for school - children '' and has drawn up a list of references .

		And when we come to the subject of aeronautics we find ourselves in a domain comparatively rich in appeal to the average reader .

		A '' Bibliography of Aeronautics , '' from the pen of Mr.
P. Brockett	PERSON	, and published by the Smithsonian Institution , is de - scribed as reaching to the rather surprising length of nine hundred and fifty-four pages .

		But not one of these special bibliographical lists can be compared in dryness and technicality with the bibliographies of bibliographies , twenty-five of which are named in the '' Bulletin . ''

		Especially admirable in these respects is M. Leon VaUeVs '' Bibliographic des
Bibliog	PERSON	- raphies , '' containing , with its supplement , more than 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, eleven hundred pages .

		Another monumental work in the same department is the great `` Biblio - graphic pale `` ographico-diplomatico-bibliographique ge ` ne ` rale , '' in two volumes , by
P. Namur	PERSON	, published at Lidge in
1838	DATE	.

		In good truth , there seems to be no sort of book , however remote from ordinary human interests , that can not be written if one will but follow
Johnson	PERSON	's example in the making of his dictionary , and set oneself doggedly to it .

		Never - theless , it is not likely that bibliography will ever be one of the crowded professions .

		AN ECCENTRIC AND ASCETIC CLASSICAL SCHOLAR , of vast learning and striking originality , was re - moved from our corporeal vision in the recent death of Professor
J. E. B. Mayor	PERSON	, of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		Best known to the world of letters by his magnum opus , his erudite edition of Juvenal , he was known to his friends as a vegetarian , a tee - totaler , a bachelor recluse , a lover of old authors , and the possessor of one of the finest libraries in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, all bought with the money saved on food , as he took pride in declaring .

		On his semi - starvation diet , which he succeeded in bringing down as low as twopence a day , he reached the ripe age of eighty-five and over , having in the strenuous days of his editorial labors on Juvenal proved to his own satisfaction that the less he ate the better he could work .

		It was only medical intervention that cut short a rather prolonged period of no eating at all .

		Omniscience was his foible , and he could quote from the classics in a way that might have made old
Robert Burton	PERSON	turn green with envy .

		The special - ization of modern science he had small regard for , holding that the man of science could not see life steadily and see it whole .

		He was fond of lecturing , being a frequent speaker at the
Victoria Institute	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, and he was a pulpit orator of marked originality .

		His studies in Juvenal of the luxury and corruption of
Rome	LOCATION	had led him , his friends averred , to adopt the simple life ; but he himself denied that even in the worst days of the Empire the Romans were any more addicted to luxury than some modern nations .

		Whatever the cause , he adopted a mode of life that made him a singularly interesting and attractive figure in the university world in which he lived .

		THE HEROIC END OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL PERIODI -
CAL	LOCATION	is chronicled in an open letter from Mr.
C. D. Spivak	PERSON	, 240-242 Metropolitan Building ,
Denver	LOCATION	,
Colorado	LOCATION	, addressed '' to medical librarians and all booklovers . ''

		The periodical in question died game , as the following extracts from the letter will show . ''

		The year
1898	DATE	will be known in the annals of medicine by an epoch-making event .

		In that year ` Medical Libraries , ' a bi-monthly publication de - voted to the interests of medical libraries , first saw the light of day in the city of
Denver	LOCATION	.

		For several years it made its irregular and spasmodic appear - ance , and closed its career in a blaze of glory ,
A.D. 1902	DATE	.

		Its circulation reached the astounding num - ber of 120 .

		What it lacked in quantity it made up in quality .

		Among its admirers , subscribers , and contributors it counted the foremost librarians of the day -LSB- here a brilliant galaxy of names -RSB- .

		Now comes the proud editor and publisher of said defunct periodical and offers to send to all medical librarians and to all who are interested in freak medical journalism , complete sets of vols .

		2 , 3 , and 4 , and incomplete sets of vols .

		1 and 5 , for the asking .

		All the said sad editor asks in return is that these , his dear departed ones , be reverently laid out , decently shrouded , adequately coffined , properly epitaphed , securely inhumed , and be unostenta - tiously gathered unto their fathers in God 's acre .

		He devoutly and prayerfully hopes for their resur - rection . ''

		Who now will give these '' dear departed ones '' a reposeful abiding place where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest ?

		THE BY-PRODUCTS OF DR.
HENRY VAN DYKE	PERSON	'S INDUSTRY as preacher and teacher , which have mostly taken the form of poems , essays , short stories , and chapters on religion and ethics , are so considerable in volume that all sorts of extravagant estimates have been formed concerning the annual amount received by him in royalties on his more than thirty volumes of prose and verse .

		Probably his revenue from this source has now become suffi - ciently large to render his salary as professor of English literature at
Princeton	LOCATION	not exactly indis - pensable to him , and to make irresistibly inviting the prospect of a life free from the irksomeness of regular lectures , weekly faculty meetings , and stated examinations .

		At any rate the published report of his resignation from the chair which he has held since
1900	DATE	most of that time in connection with the pastorate of the
Brick Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	need not greatly surprise the world , and to his readers the announcement will bring hope and expectation of an even more rapid suc - cession of books from his pen than hitherto .

		In enumerating the activities of this versatile pastor - professor , one should not fail to mention his appoint - ment as American lecturer at
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	in
1908-9	DATE	, when he chose for his subject '' Le ge `` nie de 1 ` Ame ` rique '' and , incidentally , disap - pointed some of his admirers by not , as they thought , making the most of his opportunity .

		It will be interesting to note what effect his greater leisure will have on his literary productivity .

		AN AGE OF REASON IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT was entered upon , in this country at least , as long ago as the formation of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at the centennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence .

		The mediaeval chain - ing of books and the much more recently prevalent jealous suspicion of library visitors and readers have in our own times given way to cordial and trustful relations between library administrators and library users .

		In the latest issue of the ''
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Public Library Handbook '' one notes approvingly
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL the extreme liberality with which that library is conducted .

		Its privileges are open to '' any resi - dent of Greater
New York	LOCATION	or any non-resident in business in the city . ''

		Its travelling libraries are delivered free of all expense to any society , club , charitable institution , or similar organization , within the Borough .

		The library and all its branches are open for the circulation of books every day in the year .

		Works in several volumes are counted as single books and are lent as such .

		Special cards , entitling the holder to six books at a time in addition to the two books obtainable on the regular card , are issued to teachers , students , and others engaged in special study .

		Vacation privileges are liberal .

		Books for the blind are '' delivered through the mail to the nearest
Branch Post Office	ORGANIZATION	free of charge , and may be returned in the same way . ''

		One remnant of bureaucratic unreason , however , still lingers in this admirably administered institution : '' No book will be exchanged on the same day on which it is taken out , unless a mistake has been made by the Library assistant . ''

		-LRB- But '' a book may be returned at any time , '' which is well . -RRB-

		The defense of this regula - tion is plausible enough , but the fact that some very busy libraries , including the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, permit as frequent exchanges as the borrower wishes , tends greatly to weaken its force .

		The vigorous growth of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	library since its small beginnings of thirteen years ago speaks vol - umes -LRB- some six hundred thousand , we believe -RRB- for the wisdom and efficiency of its management .

		THE INCREASING DIGNITY OF COLLEGE JOURNAL - ISM manifests itself from time to time in noteworthy ways , and rejoices those who see in the student periodical a most valuable and efficient school of authorship as well as an institution for the training of administrative and business talent in the publish - ing field .

		Not long ago one of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	under - graduate publications -LRB- the '' Lampoon , '' we believe -RRB- erected a fine building for its own use and moved into it with appropriate ceremonies ; and now word comes of the incorporation of the Daily Princetonian Publishing Company , with Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	, of the class of
' 75	DATE	, Mr.
Bayard Stockton	PERSON	,
' 72	DATE	, and three members of the senior class , constituting a board of directors , and Dr.
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	,
' 79	DATE	, Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, ' 79 , and Mr.
Andrew C. Imbrie	PERSON	,
' 95	DATE	, as further members of the corporation .

		The purpose of the incorporating act is to establish a fixed policy for this student daily and to give it the benefit of advisory aid and support from a cer - tain number of directors chosen out of the alumni .

		EMIL
REICH	PERSON	, HISTORIAN , ESSAYIST , AND OPTIM - IST , Hungarian by birth , cosmopolitan in culture and tastes , and a most stimulating writer on a great variety of subjects , died in
London	LOCATION	the llth of
December	DATE	.

		After receiving his academic training at
Prague	LOCATION	,
Budapest	LOCATION	, and
Vienna	LOCATION	, he devoted him - self to that self-education which is the beginning of real wisdom , and which he hoped to acquire for him - self in the great libraries of the world .

		But by the time he was thirty years old he decided that for the true comprehension of history , his chosen study , something besides books was necessary ; but he started on those travels which brought him to this country for a five-years ' sojourn , and thence turned him toward
France	LOCATION	for another four years , and to
England	LOCATION	for twelve , in the course of which he lec - tured frequently at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and in
London	LOCATION	, and was employed by the British govern - ment in the preparation of the
Venezuela	LOCATION	boundary case .

		His published writings are many , but we shall name here only his '' Hungarian Literature , '' '' History of Civilization , '' '' General History , '' '' Foundations of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' '' Success among Nations , '' `` Plato as an Introduction to Modern Life , '' and `` Success in Life . ''

		A breezy , buoyant , optimistic tone characterizes his work and has con - tributed not a little to his success in letters and in life .

		...
THE NEWARK MUSEUM ASSOCIATION	ORGANIZATION	, which has issued its First Annual Report , was organized in the
spring of 1909	DATE	`` to establish in the City of
Newark	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, a Museum for the reception and exhibition of articles of art , science , history and technology , and for the encouragement of the study of the arts and sciences . ''

		Incorporated under the laws of a State that has sanctioned the incor - poration of many less beneficent societies , the
Newark Museum Association	ORGANIZATION	has begun its educa - tional and uplifting work by opening rooms in the city library building , under the active supervision of the librarian , Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, for the free exhibition of permanent and loan collections of paintings and other art objects , and of such other articles as may properly find a place in the cases and on the shelves of a museum .

		This movement for increasing the usefulness of
Newark	LOCATION	's fine , large library building in every legitimate way calls to mind the similar educational activities entered upon years ago by the
City Library Association of Spring	ORGANIZATION	- field ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, where , as it happens , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	was librarian immediately before his call to
Newark	LOCATION	, and where a handsome white marble structure has just been added to the library-museum group of buildings .

		It seems not unlikely that
New Jersey	LOCATION	may be here somewhat indebted to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	for a valuable suggestion .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	, we note , is the secretary of the board of trustees of the new association .

		... THE TRIUMPH OF THE HELLENISTS AT
OXFORD	LOCATION	, in the recent vote of the
Congregation	ORGANIZATION	to retain compulsory Greek , after a year of discussion as to the advisability of yielding to the `` practical '' trend of education and abolishing the prescribed study of the noblest of literatures , will rejoice all true friends to the cause of letters .

		The
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	action is of world-wide interest and will exert world-wide in - fluence .

		Especially will the English-speaking world take note of this momentous decision of a long-vexed question , and will pause in its impetuous eagerness 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, to substitute what it imagines to be pecuniarily gain - ful studies in the place of what it is disposed to regard as the mere frills and foolish adornments of elegant culture .

		Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, it is interesting to learn , favors a certain degree of re - laxation in Greek requirements , and would have the schools of science and mathematics relieved from the compulsory study of that language .

		Further , in answer to the gibe that Greek is a class badge , '' So , a short time ago was French , '' he says , `` and , a short time before that , the alphabet .

		We want Greek to be a class badge no longer . ''

		This Oxford decision , retaining Greek and thus causing its re - tention in the secondary schools , will tend greatly to prevent its soon becoming a mere class badge .

		To DISCOURAGE BOOK-STEALING from libraries any helpful suggestion can not fail to be always welcome .

		From
Lewiston	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, there comes , through the columns of '' Public Libraries , '' an ingenious and original plan for the diminution of unregistered book-borrowing .

		The librarian at
Lewiston	LOCATION	writes that with a circulation of about sixty thousand volumes an annual loss of more than one hundred and seventy-five from the open shelves had been sadly noted , until the following preventive device was adopted : '' Into the card-pocket in the back of each book is thrust a long card of some brilliant-colored stiff cardboard which extends two inches or so beyond the cover when the book is closed .

		These cards are stamped conspicuously with consecutive numbers , thereby keeping tally and suggesting method to the borrowers .

		They also bear the request stamped with rubber type , ' Please exchange this card at the desk . '

		... The long cards effectually prevent anyone from forget - ting to register his book , and their vivid color ren - ders them so conspicuous that he hesitates to dis - pose of them if he is not entirely alone . ''

		This plan has so far worked admirably at
Lewiston	LOCATION	.

		For further details see the
December	DATE	number of the above-named periodical .

		AN EXTRAORDINARY EDITORIAL RECORD has been made , in his busy life of letters , by Sir
Wil	PERSON	- liam
Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, better known , before his knighthood of this year , as Dr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	.

		From a speech of his published in `` The British Weekly , '' of which he has long been editor , it appears that in the omniscience and omnipotence of his early prime that is , in the year
1886	DATE	, when he must have been about thirty-six years old he undertook the editorship of some half-dozen periodi - cals at the same time .

		They included '' The Brit - ish Weekly , '' `` The
Bookman	PERSON	, '' `` The Expositor , '' '' Woman at Home , '' and certain other publications issued by the book-publishing house with which he is still connected .

		That he is now content to drive a team of fewer horses may indicate that with ad - vancing years he has become a wiser even though not a sadder man .

		A continuation and publication of these literary reminiscences of a remarkably busy and successful literary man would gratify his wide circle of readers .

		* LIBRARY BOOKS BY SPECIAL DELIVERY may now be had from the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, which has made arrangements with the
Missouri District Telegraph Co.	ORGANIZATION	to send books by its messenger boys to such card-holders as care to avail themselves of this service .

		The charge for delivery or return of books within the city limits varies according to dis - tance from ten to
sixty cents	MONEY	, and covers simply the cost of carriage .

		If the innovation meets with favor , the library may institute a messenger service of its own and thus considerably reduce the cost to the card-holder ; but such mode of delivery will prob - ably never become inexpensive enough to be other than an emergency service .

		Strictly speaking , this is really no innovation in the library world .

		For many years the
Philadelphia Library	LOCATION	, a semi-public institution , has employed district telegraph messen - gers to deliver and bring back books , at the mem - ber 's expense and upon his request .

		And many other libraries must have had more or less frequent recourse to the same convenient service .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		LINCOLN AS A STATESMAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the review of
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's '' Reminiscences , '' in your issue of
December 16	DATE	, Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is commended for his freedom from the '' popular rage '' with regard to Lincoln on the ground that '' Lincoln 's chief merit lay in his unfailing honesty . ''

		The reviewer maintains that
Lincoln	PERSON	was not a statesman , and did not even have an appreciation of the effect of his own position , in its national as well as inter-national bearings .

		He says : '' He -LSB- Lincoln -RSB- entertained the apologetic and partial reasons which occupied public attention and concealed in part the true force of events .

		The working classes in
England	LOCATION	had a more thoroughly correct view of the war than most Americans .

		The question was not whether we should allow another nation to spring up on the soil of the
United States	LOCATION	, but whether a slave-holding nation should establish itself at our side with exacting and hostile claims . ''

		In
1858	DATE	, in the well-known debates , Lincoln laid the basis of his position in a scriptural principle that de - feated him for the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	that year and elected him President
two years later	DATE	.

		That principle found its first great impulse , under our government , in
Webster	PERSON	's and
Corwin	PERSON	's opposition to the Mexican War 's development into a greed for '' more space . ''

		But neither
Webster	PERSON	nor
Corwin	PERSON	, appreciating as they did the effect of more territory as a menace to fratri - cidal strife , dared recognize the real condition of
the State	ORGANIZATION	as
Lincoln	LOCATION	did .

		And while
Seward	ORGANIZATION	announced the '' irrepressible conflict , '' Lincoln saw in the conflict a principle beyond : this nation could not endure , one-half free and one-half slave .

		This found utterance in
1858	DATE	.

		And here we have what our reviewer says Lincoln should have appreciated and did not .

		When the war came , his position as President was , to obey the Consti -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL tution , suppress the rebellion , defend the union , preserve the government .

		The war developed the opportunity to issue the Proclamation of Emancipation without vio - lating the Constitution .

		Lincoln was not a soldier ; he was a statesman .

		Lincoln never believed '' a slave-holding nation should establish itself at our side with exacting and hostile claims . ''

		He warned us that , if it did , that nation would either absorb the nation to the north or be ab - sorbed by it .

		The states would continue to be one household , even though a new house must be built and new regulations adopted .

		Further ,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	announced a principle of states ` man - ship in
1859	DATE	, applying it to the impassioned conditions then existing , which any student of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, contemplat - ing him as detached from the '' indiscriminate lauda - tion '' that sees little but his honesty or his Republic - anism , can not but appreciate in a Lincoln attitude towards the impassioned conditions uppermost in our present political agitations .

		This principle appears in a letter of
April 6 , 1859	DATE	, declining an invitation to speak at a
Thomas Jefferson Birthday	ORGANIZATION	function in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The entire letter should be read to appreciate the force of the principle .

		That principle is that man must be considered above the dollar .

		It is truer now than it was then : '' It is now no child 's play to save the principles of
Jefferson	LOCATION	from total overthrow in this nation . ''

		Litterateurs can profit by a sane study of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's type of mind and style of expression as much as can those property-intoxicated Republicans who seek justifi - cation for their policies and methods by a use of the magic name of
Lincoln	LOCATION	as a Republican .

		In the pre - face to
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Parnassus , '' the seer says that poetry teaches the enormous force of a few words .

		Poetry teaches this as much by its enormous waste of words as it does by its occasional use of a unique word or phrase or verse that charms the ear or mind forever .

		Lincoln teaches the meaning of a few words as poetry can not .

		There must always , of necessity , be more waste than wisdom in versifying .

		But
Lincoln	PERSON	was brief , and his words , '' candid as mirrors , gave the per - fect image of his thought . ''

		Time can not change their fundamental value to any student of organized society .

		His
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address said what was most needed to be said .

		And it is fortunate that it was said in a '' per - fectly simple and straightforward way . ''

		And , strange as it may seem , the literary quality of pathos is here in its sombre beauty as I have not seen it noticed by the '' critics , '' as it is not in much of his more lauded ex - pressions .

		One word more .

		We should cease trying to hammer honesty into the exquisite natures of our budding men in their childhood by the use of the names of Lincoln and
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is as childish for grown-up men to do this as it is to do that other childish thing that Lincoln ridiculed , doing things '' under the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consider - ation do otherwise . ''

		Talk to the children about
Lincoln	PERSON	's shrewdness more and his honesty less and we will appre - ciate the force of honesty more , will realize that he who is single-minded can see what humor meant to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and in the new light will feel a new patience and faith , helpful to our children , helpful to our pens , helpful to our citizenship , because we have been born again in new minds as well as hearts .

LAFCADIO HEART	ORGANIZATION	'S LAST LETTERS .

		* The profound impression made by the publi - cation , four years ago , of '' The Life and Letters of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	'' is deepened and strength - ened by the printing of another volume of his letters .

		Those now given to the world were , for the most part , written to Professor
Basil Hall Chamberlain	PERSON	of the Imperial Japanese Univer - sity , a friend for whom
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	felt high respect and warm affection .

		They form a connected series extending from early in
18 90	DATE	, when
Hearn	PERSON	first arrived in
Japan	LOCATION	, to the latter part of
1894	DATE	.

		In them he poured out his inmost thoughts , feel - ing sure of intellectual sympathy whatever might be the subject that happened to engage his at - tention at the moment .

		The charm of these letters is manifold .

		The wide range that they cover is remarkable , and especially so considering the isolated life that
Hearn	PERSON	led .

		A mind so keenly alive as his and so extraordinarily sensitive would have found food for thought in any environment .

		That he should crave novelty is not strange .

		Nor is it cause for wonder that the shyness that held him aloof when in personal contact with his fellows should have as its correlative poignant longing for companionship with friends whom he could recognize as his intellectual equals .

		Such com - panionship Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	gave him .

		In return he let few days pass during the years of his residence in
Matsue	LOCATION	and
Kumamoto	LOCATION	without a chat with him on paper .

		These outpourings are the fruit of a mind surcharged with thought and impelled by inner necessity to its expression .

		With delightful absence of self - consciousness the writer tells of the happenings about him , comments upon the curious lore he has picked up , and describes lovely scenes he has chanced upon in his wan - derings .

		From these he turns to thoughts sug - gested by books he has read , or evoked by memories of past experiences of men and things .

		Now he discourses upon
Balzac	LOCATION	and Zola , then upon gothic architecture , or the utility of super - stition , or the impermanence of opinions , and anon he recalls a dramatic episode about a Polish brigade in the Franco-Prussian war .

		Again he is captivated by some Japanese folk - tale , or provoked by the stupidity of the mission - aries , or concerned with the rhymes in ProvenQal * THE JAPANESE LETTERS OF

		10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, poetry .

		But whatever his theme he never fails to exemplify his ideas about letter writing . ''

		What you say about letters that coulent de source I feel strong sympathy with for two reasons .

		In the first place letters not spontaneous give one the notion that the writer feels a certain distrust in abandoning his thoughts to paper , and consequently has not toward his friend that perfect feeling which casts out fear .

		The second is that the receiver is also forced into a certain constraint and artificialness in his replies ; then the matter becomes a mere drudgery .

		Of course there are other cases , such as the very curious one you suggest , which I take to be ruled by a sort of sesthetic formality , the reluctance of the artist to be for a moment in - artistic , like The'ophile
Gautier	PERSON	answering a reproach about not writing by the phrase : ' Ask a carpenter to plane a few planks for fun . ' ''

		It is easy to see how this phrase of
Gautier	PERSON	's must have amused
Hearn	PERSON	, for writing was his chief recreation as well as his life work .

		His letters to his friends were written with the utmost ease and pleasure .

		His books , on the contrary , were the product of unremitting effort . ''

		I never write , '' he confessed to Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	, in a letter describing his method of work , '' without painfully forcing myself to it . ''

		Every page was rewritten at least four or five times , and one much admired paragraph was recast no less than seventeen times before he could accept it as an adequate vehicle for the expression of his thought . ''

		Composition becomes difficult only when it becomes work , that is literary labour without a strong inspira - tional impulse or an emotional feeling behind it . ''

		Being written without any expectation that they would ever be printed , his letters have less refined subtlety of phrase than his books , but neither this quality nor that of style is wanting , and they have also the directness and vivacity of the sketches of a master painter .

		In them his delight in the '' physiognomical beauty '' of words to quote his own phrase finds full vent .

		Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	's condemnation of the use of Japanese words in
Hearn	LOCATION	's books called forth this outburst : `` For me words have colour , form , character ; they have faces , ports , manners , gesticulations ; they have moods , humours , eccentricities ; they have tints , tones , personalities .

		That they are unintelligible makes no difference at all .

		Whether you are able to speak to a stranger or not , you can ' t help being impressed by his appearance sometimes , by his dress , by his air , by his exotic look .

		He is also unintelligible , but not a whit less interesting .

		Nay !

		he is interesting BECAUSE he is unintelligible .

		I won ' t cite other writers who have felt this same way about African , Chinese , Arabian ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, Tartar , Indian and Basque words , I mean novelists and sketch writers . ''

		To such it has been justly observed : ' The readers do not feel as you do about words .

		They can ' t be sup - posed to know that you think the letter A is blush - crimson , and the letter E pale sky-blue .

		They ca n't be supposed to know that you think KH wears a beard and a turban ; that initial X is a mature Greek with wrinkles ; or that '' no '' has an innocent , lovable , and childlike aspect . '

		All this is true from the critic 's standpoint .

		But from ours , the standpoint of The dreamer of dreams To whom what is and what seems Is often one and the same , To us the idea is thus : '' Because people can not see the colour of words , the tints of words , the secret ghostly motions of words : '' Because they can not hear the whispering of words , the rustling of the procession of letters , the dream - flutes and dream-drums which are thinly and weirdly played by words : `` Because they can not perceive the pouting of words , the frowning and fuming of words , the weeping , the raging and racketing and rioting of words : '' Because they are insensible to the phosphorescing of words , the fragrance of words , the noisesomeness of words , the tenderness or hardness , the dryness or juici - ness of words ; the interchange of values in the gold , the silver , the brass , and the copper of words : '' Is that any reason why we should not try to make them hear , to make them see , to make them feel ?

		Surely one who has never heard
Wagner	PERSON	, can not ap - preciate
Wagner	PERSON	without study !

		Why should the peo - ple not be forcibly introduced to foreign words , as they were introduced to tea and coffee and tobacco ? ''

		Unto which the friendly reply is , ' Because they wo n't buy your book , and you wo n't make any money . ' ''

		And I say : ' Surely 1 have never yet made , and never expect to make any money .

		Neither do I expect to write ever for the multitude .

		I write for beloved friends who can see colour in words , can smell the per - fume of syllables in blossom , can be shocked with the fine elfish electricity of words .

		And in the eternal order of things , words will eventually have their rights recognized by the people . ' ''

		Notwithstanding his love for the mere ab - stract sound of words ,
Hearn	PERSON	was too much of an artist in their use and too clear a thinker to find satisfaction in the sound if there were even a suspicion of failure to convey the precise shade of meaning intended .

		The qualities he perceived in them existed for him because he recognized the possibility of portraying the most intangible and evanescent nuances , because he felt their power of suggestion , of connotation ^ of poetic imagery more convincing than direct statement .

		Yet he realized also the value of simplicity . ''

		After attempting my utmost at ornamentation , '' he wrote , '' I am converted by my own mistakes .

		The great point is to touch with simple words . ''

		The letters printed in this volume reflect the varying moods of the writer .

		The pendulum swings first this way and then that .

		As he him - self says , '' they are certainly a record of illusion and disillusion . ''

		So many are the themes touched upon that a dozen extracts would not suffice to give an idea of their variety and inter -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE 11 est. .

		There is a great deal in them about
Japan	LOCATION	and the Japanese , but much less on the whole than one would expect to find .

		He was , how - ever , addressing those who knew
Japan	LOCATION	better than he did , and the thing that most fre - quently crops out is his detestation of '' the frank selfishness , the apathetic vanity , the shallow vulgar scepticism of the
New Japan	LOCATION	that prates its contempt about Tempo times , and ridicules the dear old men of the pre-meiji era . ''

		Mrs.
Wetmore	PERSON	's preface and introduction are devoted to a warm appreciation of
Hearn	PERSON	as a man and a writer , and to an impassioned vindi - cation of her friend from the aspersions cast upon him by the circulation of what she stig - matizes as `` un veracious legends '' about his early life . ''

		Among the legends , '' she tells us , '' is a great deal of fanciful nonsense wrapped up in the technical verbiage of the specialist , which always daunts and convinces the ignor - ant . ''

		On the facts as related by her she makes out a good prima facie case .

		But
Hearn	PERSON	's readers will not need this testimony .

		For them the nobility of his character shines forth in his writings .

		Mrs.
Wetmore	PERSON	does not overstate the truth when she asserts that '' his preoccupa - tion with all visible fairness is the most salient character of his genius , and a careful study of his books and of his great mass of letters will show that he is singularly free from all gross - ness not once in any word of his , written or printed , is found the leer of the ape , the repul - sive grin of the satyr . ''

		Grapes are not gathered from thorns .

		The significant quality in all of
Hearn	LOCATION	's writings is the mental and moral uplift .

		As happily phrased by his biographer : '' To those who can see no purpose in giving one 's whole life to attain artistic excellence in the expression of thought and emotion
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's personality will convey no meaning .

		But those capable of being touched and stirred : by such a nature will brush away the ' imperti - nences ' and find inspiration and stimulus in !

		CULTURE AXD BVSIXESS .

		* With praiseworthy directness , and on regret - table paper , Mr.
Crane	PERSON	assembles all his resour - ces for an annihilating assault upon all kinds of higher schooling for young men who have to make their own living and who expect to pursue !

		* THE UTILITY OF ALL KINDS OF HIGHER SCHOOLING , j An Investigation .

		By
R. T. Crane	PERSON	.

		Chicago : Published by j the Author .

		a comiercial or industrial career .

		No one can read t.e entire book without getting the im - pressioi of wholesome independence and of a blunt aid business-like purpose of going straight at the f ; cts as the author grasps them .

		I take strong exception to Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's statement , `` I shall rec.ive neither the thanks nor the sym - pathy of tie college clique for this investigation , '' for every ` riend of culture must welcome all the light whici can be thrown upon the seamy side of our educational system : would to God there were less < f truth in these indictments !

		Here , for example , is the charge that our colleges are exerting an influence in the direction of `` hedg - ing '' and way from frankness ; while nothing less than fatal , if true , is the accusation that '' educated people take just as much interest in worldly nutters as others . ''

		Is it worth while to pay attention to this sort of challenge ?

		If I read the signs rightly , I think we 'd better !

		Like
Lord Byron	PERSON	, whose '' young mind was sacrificed to books , '' enormous numbers of our best youth , in Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's opinion , are being condemned to miserable failure by our academic practices .

		Not only is the author quite right in his opinion that the atmosphere of most Ameri - can colleges is charged with little of the serious - ness of business , but there are a good many other vreak points which might equally well be noticed .

		Comparing the English universities , we must bitterly lament the paralysis of the American student 's personal interest in govern - mental and other high responsibilities ; even worse is the charge , which might sometimes be laid against our universities , of capitulation to barbarism and impiety , their ill-bestowed hos - pitality toward those who show no allegiance to supreme values .

		Our higher schools often harbor a set of students whose doings might better be the subject of consideration by that publication of the Carnegie Institution which presents Contributions to the Study of the Behavior of Lower Organisms ; after years of toleration , specimens whom no amount of curry - ing can ever groom are turned forth to be - come leaders of
Philistinism	LOCATION	, High-priests of the Unimportant .

		The acceptance of size as the canon of efficiency is nothing short of wicked .

		While we pay full tribute to the author 's candor , we are not without disturbing suspicions that his dialectic method is not quite impec - cable : certain definite statements are deficient in complete accuracy , as when he attributes to the president of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- page 322 -RRB- a well-known remark of the distinguished governor-elect of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		His way of collecting facts , by 12 : E DIAJL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, a series of peremptory categorical questions , would be more convincing were it notior his sovereign unconcern in brushing aside wie pre - ponderance of the direct evidence su/mitted ; those who take pains to answer seem to / prevail - ingly `` evasive , '' or `` prejudiced , '' 01 '' liars . ''

		Yielding to none in our welcome of I publica - tion which is announced as a `` live wire , '' we must still regret to see it spluttering useless sparks and at times endangering the Connections of its trolley .

		One statement , at tast , I be - lieve to be cruelly unjust : '' College men are seldom found to be conspicuous invthe great moral questions affecting the welfare and happi - ness of mankind . ''

		The author 's concession in favor of a universal grammar-school course would seem arbitrary in logic , at least to some of my best Greek and Italian friends residing on Halsted Street ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		I feel sure that if letters had been addressed to a hundred of the leading business men , they would have given strong testimony to their conviction that there is '' nothing in it '' when it comes to cutting off the potential wages which a normal child could earn at shoe-blacking parlors or news-stands .

		Many of them go back to the analphabetic felicities of '' a time when we had little of it , '' and have small opinion of any betterment of the race by such conventional sophistications as reading and writing .

		A year in the business itself , or in some wage-paying factory , they pretend , is worth for their purposes any three years in a public grammar-school .

		Interpreter
Kelly	PERSON	reports that the Alaskan Eskimos , who have as yet seen no outsider who can equal them in fishing and shore-whaling , assert stoutly that the whole tribe of white men is '' ilualok '' or '' unfit for anything . ''

		The author frankly delimits his cultural con - fession by the following definition : '' By edu - cation I mean knowing important things . ''

		Yet even when we reduce the whole problem to these simple terms , organized scholarship still offers the only way by which to discover and hold in check the infinitely expanding body of facts .

		Even '' the fellow with the flying-machine bug , and the person attacked by the archasological germ '' -LRB- page 227 -RRB- have a way of showing themselves not in the least contemptible in the estimate of our race .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	is now and then generously inconsistent to the bald and utilitarian doctrine which he preaches , as when he is lenient enough to imply an approval of some `` general education , '' apart from profes - sional studies , in the case of physicians .

		The man who covers only his own field never does quite cover it , the web of human relations is too intricate for that , and the educated man must be quick to infer the larger whole from a concrete symbol .

		The rise of
Germany	LOCATION	and the rapid progress of
Japan	LOCATION	are victories for the professor ; the significant generals of our Civil War were trained at West Point ; our
State	ORGANIZATION	universities are making investigations which will result in saving millions of dollars to farmers who have been paying from four to ten times as much as they ought to do for plant - food .

		The average net earnings of an acre of wheat amount to less than
eight dollars	MONEY	an acre , which the information gained at the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	increases by more than twenty dollars an acre .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's nihilistic skepticism reaches a point of simplicity which is no less than pathetic , and makes one wish to cover , rather than indelicately expose , the touching and childlike innocence of such statements as '' A teacher can tell his pupils nothing more than they can find for themselves in the books '' ; '' every feature of the farming industry was thoroughly understood long before agricultural colleges were started '' ; '' as all libraries have the various subjects tabulated , I can see no reason -LSB- this is credible -RSB- why persons desiring any special knowledge can not be placed in the way of finding it by the librarians . ''

		But one can not discuss with heart-felt interest a book whose scope ends at a point a long way this side of where the handling of so supremely vital a matter as education should begin .

		This plausible and crepitant work never comes within range of the thing which matters most to a lover of his kind .

		It has frankly to do with financial success as a goal . ''

		Start with the boy , and make your own help '' ; '' the only thing that interests business men is whether a man under - stands their business and can promote it '' ; '' breadth and theories are just what the young man does not need for business success '' ; '' can a foreman do his work better if he be on in - timate speaking terms with the azimuth ? ''

		It is simply impertinent to set up as a final norm the standards of the
Chicago	LOCATION	market-place , a centre of hustling and bustling activities , but hardly a place which has done much to '' Give to barrows , trays and pans Grace and glimmer of romance ; Bring the moonlight into noon , Hid in gleaming piles of stone ; On the city 's pav ^ d street Plant gardens lined with lilacs sweet . ''

		However forcible the putting of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's contention may be , it is far too individualistic and self-centered .

		Conceding , if need be , all
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DLL	ORGANIZATION	13 that he would prove , and more , we still enter a demurrer against his conclusion .

		We do not admit that '' the greatest pleasure a man can have arises from the feeling that he has been a success in a creditable occupation . '' ''

		If money is not the whole thing , I think it is safe to say that it is probably seventy-five per cent of the whole thing '' can this be the ethics of that
America	LOCATION	whose infancy endured so full a , bap - tism of sacrifice and privation ?

		Let us assert in a very clear tone that with the mere accumula - tion of money an idealist has simply nothing to do .

		This does n't imply that money has no value : because I insist on a little salt in my breakfast-food , it is not to be inferred that a five-pound bag of it is to be upset into the oatmeal-boiler .

		If it be true that the law of business success in
Chicago	LOCATION	demands a sur - render to worldliness , all the more is it forever our plainest duty to challenge , defy , and insult that law .

		The '' hard-fisted battle '' which we are invited to enter neither satisfies our taste nor enjoys our respect .

		As Remain
Holland	PERSON	says in his monograph on Beethoven : '' I. do not call heroes those who have triumphed by thought or force ; I call heroes those who were great by their heart . ''

		Not for all the spoils of that clangorous field will we part with the sense of finer values , that delicacy , tact , and refine - ment which belong to the education of a gentle - man : Adde quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes Emollit mores , nee sinit esse feros .

		There is indeed , thank Heaven , `` something better than mechanical pursuits and the ordi - nary drudgery of life . ''

		If these matters be lightly esteemed by the
Chicago	LOCATION	business world , so much the worse for the world of business in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		If a leaf of autobiography be permissible , I should like to add that I was fairly started and sufficiently successful in a
Chicago	LOCATION	business from which every one of my immediate peers among the office-boys of that era -LRB- as far as I have kept track of them -RRB- has since gained a fortune ; no one of them any longer can experience my own romantic thrill of magic novelty in taking a turn in a motor-car , but I believe that I have always been glad that I turned to making my own living in a less remunerative career , for the simple reason that all other pleasures are not worth its pains .

		I can not envy even the augmented resources of my sometime cronies : '' He gave them their request , but sent leanness into their soul . ''

		If a humanist has no luxuries , he has , it is to be hoped , the gift to let them go by , ad to addjess himself blithely to rolling the Syphus-sfcAie of daih tasks .

		In the volume now published , Mr.
Mony	PERSON	- penny carries the narrative down to
1887	DATE	, the year that saw Disraeli 's first election to
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment .

		The period covers thirty-three years of the future prime minister 's life , a period of con - siderable interest and of some romance .

		The chapters devoted to ancestry , childhood , anct youth , early training and influences , and similar matters , are written in the < - aaventional way , It may be said in found no evidence that his family was of the Inquisition to

		What we know for certain is that the grandfather ,
Benjamin D'Israeli	PERSON	, who ' became an English denizen in
1748	DATE	, ' had his Italian home not in
Venice	LOCATION	but at Cento in
Ferrara	LOCATION	. ''

		The author concludes that the name and the family may be either of Spanish or of Levantine origin .

		In addition to the Disraeli papers , Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	has used letters in the possession of families that were closely associated with the Disraelis .

		Some use has also been made of a fragmentary diary which does not seem to have been published before .

		However , as most of the materials are already accessible to students , the value of the biography -LRB- at least so far as the first volume is concerned -RRB- will lie principally in the author 's method and interpretation .

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	has adopted the plan of citing docu - ments very extensively , so extensively that some of the chapters are scarcely more than a series of epistolary extracts bound together by brief but illuminating comments .

		Of eighteen pages devoted to the '' Tour in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' less than four are of the author 's own writing .

		Disraeli 's first successful political campaign is described in sixteen pages , of which all but about two pages is composed of extracts from documents .

		Other chapters are written on the same plan .

		Whether these statements are to be regarded as favorable or unfavorable criticism , will de - pend on the purpose of the volume .

		Students of history will welcome a biography of this type , one that permits further study of personality , motives , and circumstances from the document - ary sources included with the narrative .

		On the other hand , the general reader is scarcely well served with a biography of this sort .

		To him there will always be much in letters and diaries that has little significance .

		Not knowing the circumstances under which they were writ - ten or the times that they reflect , he fails to get the deeper impressions that such extracts are intended to convey , and the reading soon be - comes tiresome .

		It is always desirable that a biographical narrative be flavored with bits of c.onten \ porary writing and generously provided with illustrative extracts from the author 's sources ; \ but it is a question whether the practice has not open overdone in this particular case .

		While ihe author is sympathetic , he is not effusive : aU through the narrative he maintains a strictly juojcial attitude and writes with admir - able reserve .

		\ No attempt is made to slur over such episodes as reflect on Disraeli 's good sense and judgment or to suppress information as to embarrassing situations .

		In this work for the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 first time , perhaps , do we get definite impres - sions of the financial distress in which the future chancellor of the exchequer found himself just before his elevation to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1836	DATE	his debts almost prevented his appearance in public ; fears of his creditors and the officers of the law seem to have haunted him continu - ously .

		Writing to his lawyer concerning his appearance at a political dinner , he remarks : '' I have been requested to move the principal toast , * The
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I trust there is no danger of rny being nabbed , as this would be a fatal contretemps , inasmuch as , in all probability , I am addressing my future constituents . ''

		But the author also bears testimony to
Disraeli	LOCATION	's financial integrity ; though his embarrassments were numerous and frequent , `` nothing that seriously touches his character is to be deduced from the records as they have been preserved . ''

		Travel , literature , and politics were the chief matters of interest to Disraeli during these years .

		His journeys in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands and in the Orient are important chiefly as fur - nishing experiences that later were worked into his novels , though it is likely that the Oriental tour did much to develop in the future states - man the interest that he always showed in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	politics .

		Several of
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's novels date from these years ; but the world has long ago passed judgment on his literary efforts , a judgment that the new court has not reversed .

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	finds that so long as the novel - ist is able to draw on his own experiences , he produces readable , often brilliant , chapters ; but when he has to draw on the resources of his imagination , the product becomes what Glad - stone once called '' trash . ''

		The most satisfactory parts of the work are the sections dealing with
Disraeli	PERSON	's frantic efforts to get into
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author makes it very clear that there was nothing meteoric in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's later appearance as an influential poli - tical leader .

		During the five years between his first unsuccessful candidacy at Wycombe and his election for
Maidstone	LOCATION	in
1837	DATE	, he was regarded by his Tory friends -LRB- and they formed an im - portant group -RRB- as a coming leader .

		Much of his time and energy was given to political pamphleteering and editorial writing for such journals as the
London	LOCATION	'' Morning Post '' and '' The Times . ''

		In some of this work he de - scended to a low literary plane . ''

		The articles , which have been preserved in a book of cuttings , are in the strain of reckless vituperation which was then the fashion even in responsible journals , with only here and there a flash of wit or a happy phrase to redeem the personalities . ''

		But there can be no doubt that they were widely read .

		They were important also in that they gave the young writer an opportunity to review and clarify his own political ideas and to build up a theory of practical government that later became the conservative creed .

		The most important of these writings is a yplume of 200 pages entitled '' A Vindication of the English Constitution . ''

		In this he develops the old theory that representation is , and should be , not a matter of numbers or territorial areas , but of estates .

		The Lords represent one estate , the Commons another . ''

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons is no more the house of the people than is the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The peerage represents the church , the law , the counties and boroughs , the land , '' and as the hereditary leaders of the nation , especially of the cultivators of the land , the genuine and permanent population of En - gland , its peasantry . ''

		Much is made of the ancient character of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Lords : '' Their names , office , and character , and the ennobling achievements of their order must be blended with our history and bound up with our hereditary sentiment . ''

		Still , both the peerage and the commonalty must be democratic at the roots : it must be possible for any subject to gain legal admittance to either estate .

		And the estates themselves he conceives as '' the trustees of the nation , not its masters . ''

		This defence of the peerage was written in
1835	DATE	by a young man who three years earlier had sought admittance to Parliament as a radi - cal .

		There was , however , nothing very startling in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's early radicalism : it consisted chiefly in a determination to stand apart from the old party organizations . ''

		His political stock in trade consisted , in fact , of a sincere and ardent patriotism , genuine popular sym - pathies , a strong and apparently instinctive antipathy to
Whiggery	LOCATION	, and an hereditary disposition to Toryism derived from his father with an imaginative interest in its romantic aspect that was native to himself . ''

		When he was convinced that only within one of the historic parties could he hope to achieve anything , his choice was quickly made .

		But he carried with him into the Tory camp his ideas of democracy and moderate reform .

		In this apparent passage from one political extreme to the other , his biographer sees noth - ing strange .

		He calls attention to the fact that nearly all the greater English statesmen have had ambiguous party records . ''

		If we are to measure consistency by ideas ,
Disraeli	PERSON	is the most consistent of them all , and yet more than 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	^ any of the others he was to suffer throughout his career from the reputation of political time-server and adven - turer acquired in these early and errant years . ''

		Perhaps we have in these lines a clue to the author 's treatment of the
Beaconsfield	LOCATION	policies in the volumes to come .

		Disraeli 's political career , as Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	seems to view it , is an effort to work out and realize in practical measures a system of political ideas developed in his younger days while he was still suspected of radical tendencies .


LAURENCE M. LARSON	PERSON	.

		N ENGLISH ESTIMATE OF
POE	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is related of the
Mormon Bible	PERSON	that when it was discovered it was in the unintelligible letters of an unknown tongue ; but that with it was found a pair of iron-bound spectacles , seen through which the strange script translated itself into plain English .

		Mr.
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	, an English critic , is the fortunate possessor of such a magic aid for interpreting the hitherto misunderstood works of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	.

		So , in effect , he tells us in his brief preface , in which he calmly brushes aside all that has yet been done in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	to make
Poe	PERSON	clear to the world .

		When we consider that among those he thus disposes of are Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, whose essay in the '' Letters to Dead Authors '' is the classic of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	criticism ; Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, who twenty years ago broached the subject of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's supremacy in American literature ; Mr.
Sted	PERSON	- man , who if not altogether sympathetic was always kindly and intelligent in his treatment of Poe ; Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, Mr.
Trent	PERSON	, Mr.
Peck	PERSON	, Mr.
Didier	PERSON	, and many others ; it seems a large order for a new critic to try to fill .

		As Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is superior to all these writers , he is naturally superior to the author he is dealing with .

		Criticism is one thing , con - descension another .

		We are inclined to think that
Poe	PERSON	would have preferred the foulest calumnies of his enemies to Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's patronizing way of waiving these aside , not because they are in the main untrue , but be - cause they really do n't matter , you know .

		And we are certain that
Poe	PERSON	would have raged like the maddened Ajax at being led forward by the hand , so to speak , and presented to the world , not as a great poet , not as the supreme master of the short story , but as the critic whose wavering thought dimly glimpsed the *

		light which has since shone forth in
Walter Pater	PERSON	,
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Lascelles Aber	PERSON	- crombie , whoever the latter may be .

		About a fourth part of Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's book is taken up with long extracts from
Poe	PERSON	's writ - ings .

		This affords one an agreeable chance to refresh one 's memory though , really , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's own prose is so good , that , as far as wording goes , it does not need such rein - forcement .

		The meaning of it is another mat - ter .

		We confess that we do not find any such revelations as Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	seems to promise in his preface .

		Practically all the points he touches upon have been brought out by previ - ous writers .

		Poe 's loneliness of mind , the an - tagonism between him and his countrymen , his mathematical and metaphysical bent , his mor - tuary turn of mind -LRB- as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	terms it -RRB- , his business ability for others , the comparative inferiority of '' The Raven '' to some of the other poems , the unique character of four or five of the colloquies and philosophical compositions , all this , and much else which Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	men - tions , has been already fully treated .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is hardly more than tepid in his praise of the Tales .

		He considers
Poe	PERSON	in this field inferior to
Balzac	LOCATION	and an imitator of
Lytton	LOCATION	.

		To count the noses of an author 's readers is a poor way to judge his rank , but influence on other writers is a pretty sure test .

		Poe has probably had twenty imitators to one that either of the above-named men can boast of .

		That
Poe	PERSON	is supreme in the short story , and that he gained for this kind of art a place with the great forms of literature , is the claim of the true believers .

		For
Poe	PERSON	's poetry , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	has more respect , though he thinks that many others since have done equally well .

		The bulk of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verse is not great , but there are fifteen or sixteen pieces of the first rank .

		Shelley can hardly show more gems of the purest water , and
Burns	PERSON	certainly not twice as many .

		Yet these two are the greatest English lyric poets .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	comes , in fact , to about the same conclusion that Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	reaches .

		The latter began by asking what American litera - ture would be without
Poe	PERSON	, and ended by declar - ing that
Poe	PERSON	did not belong to literature at all .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	trips his way through
Poe	PERSON	's works on tiptoe , rather holding his nose by the way ; and as he views piece after piece he dismisses it as a failure , a good intention , or a half suc - cess .

		Yet he allows that in
Poe	LOCATION	there passed through the world something wonderful and

		THE DIAL , 17 unique .

		This is the very folly of criticism .

		A man is not a great writer unless he writes something great .

		The bees know where there is honey , and the swarm of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's imitators is plain proof that his work has the secret of immortality .

		In reality , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's sole interest in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is in the criticism .

		He fastens upon
Poe	PERSON	's definition of poetry as the rhythmical creation of beauty , and on the many dicta in which
Poe	PERSON	proclaims beauty as the end and aim of art .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	finds these opinions in consonance with his own views , and with those of the new - est school of art thought ; and he hails
Poe	PERSON	as an early prophet .

		We believe that
Poe	PERSON	's criticism was false , but that his work trans - cended his theory .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	praises him for his bad doctrine , and puts aside the saving deed .

		It is impossible to give any precise definition of beauty .

		We all know that when we use this word in common parlance we do not mean power , or grandeur , or sublimity , or awfulness , or horror , or ugliness , or the grotesque and comical .

		Yet all these things are sensations of the mind ; they all enter into the creations of art .

		Why anyone should want to reduce all these fractions of thought and feeling to a common denominator and call that beauty , is a mystery I have never been able to fathom .

		The Greeks in their best estate did pretty well in literature , but they were guided by no such idea .

		Aristotle , the first and greatest literary critic , knows nothing of it .

		Plato possibly glimpsed such a concep - tion as coming , which may in part explain his hostility to poetry .

		Come the conception did , but not until Greek life and Greek art lay in ruins together .

		The great German critics ,
Lessing	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schiller	PERSON	, accept no such narrow limitations of literature .

		They knew the complexity of life , and of art 's consequent report of it , and they allowed many elements and aims to poetry .

		In the house of art there are many mansions .

		That of beauty , however attractive , is not the greatest or the most important .

		Is the Book of Job great poetry ?

		What possible beauty is there in the spectacle of the patriarch , bowed down with misfortunes , covered with sores , sit - ting on a dunghiJl exposed to the mosquito-like boring of his comforters ?

		What beauty , in any sane sense of the word , is there even in the tremendous and appalling utterance of the Almighty in answer to Job 's cries ?

		Is '' King Lear '' great poetry ?

		There is beauty in the apparition of
Cordelia	LOCATION	, and by stretching the meaning of the word we may possibly make it cover the devotion of Kent and the fortitude of
Edgar	PERSON	.

		But all the rest of the play is a whirl - wind of horror and terror and desolation .

		Surely the critics who preach the doctrine that beauty is the sole aim and end of art do art and literature the greatest disservice .

		The world regards them as Alceste regarded Oronte , or '' as
Hotspur	PERSON	did the perfumed courtier who recommended spermaceti for an inward wound .

		No one has fought longer or more fiercely against the domination of the didactic in litera - ture , the cult of the commonplace , than the present writer .

		But if it is a question between the rule of these things and the reign of the Precieuses , I should not hesitate in my choice .

		My attitude of mind would be like that of the outspoken lady confronted by the statue in the Vatican : '' So that is the
Apollo Belve	PERSON	- dere , is it ?

		Well , what I say is , give me Ruggles ! ''

		If what our new critics mean by their creed of beauty is merely workmanlike , adequate , and perfect execution , then there may be something said for the doctrine .

		In ordinary speech we use the word `` beauty '' loosely .

		We say that a street-sweeper cleans a crossing , or a laundress does up linen , or a surgeon performs an opera - tion , beautifully .

		What we mean is that they do their tasks as well as they can be done ; that they do them perfectly .

		The authors of the Book of Job and of ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' also did their tasks perfectly .

		They gave the ultimate ex - pression to the terrors and profundities with which they deal .

		But if this is the meaning of the creed , it is only a truism ; for unless a work of art is adequately done it had better not be done at all .

		And there are so many kinds of adequacy that the word '' beauty '' is the most unfortunate nomenclature that could be applied to them .

		The prose of Swift or
Defoe	PERSON	is just as adequate for the purposes for which it is used as the prose of Shakespeare or Congreve or De Quincey or Pater .

		Pope has in his verse as brilliant an instrument for what he wants to do as
Poe	PERSON	has in his .

		But
Poe	PERSON	certainly would not have called Pope 's poetry the rhythmical creation of beauty .

		Yet in the mind of Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, and critics like him , there hovers an idea other than mere adequacy the idea of absolute beauty , the something different from power or horror or ugliness , as the aim and end of art .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	of course approves
Poe	PERSON	's di - alectic against long poems .

		The same examples that served me above may answer here .

		The 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Book of Job and ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' are works of con - siderable dimensions .

		They are certainly not what
Poe	PERSON	meant by a short poem .

		But just as certainly they are not collections of distinct and separate episodes .

		Each is unitary .

		Every word in them goes to build up a great effect , create one tremendous impression .

		And this impression , whether we read the pieces at a single sitting or not , is overwhelming .

		The same is true of still longer works like the Iliad or the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The impression , indeed , of such works stamps itself on whole nations and ages .

		The
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	is four or five times as long as the Iliad , and the Mahabharata three times longer still ; yet it may be said of these poems , not that
India	LOCATION	possesses them , but that they possess
India	LOCATION	.

		That the inequalities in a long work are more apparent than those of a short poem , is of course to be expected .

		But few indeed are the lyrics of the world which are of even and perfect execution throughout .

		Under the microscope the razor 's edge is a saw .

		Last of all , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	praises
Poe	PERSON	's study of versification .

		As this is based on the idea of quantity , and as quantity does not exist , or exists only in a weak and limited manner , in English poetry , it is difficult to accept either
Poe	PERSON	's text or Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's comment as of much value .

		The age of littleness is on us .

		Among the newest critics , of whom I should say Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- some must be quite a distinguished talent , there is only the worship of exquisite words , charming cadences , lovely images .

		It is the culto estilo of
Marini	PERSON	and
Gongora	PERSON	over again .

		Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- some re-states what I have seen mentioned in print a number of times as if it were a matter of some importance the fact that
Ernest Dow	PERSON	- son 's favorite line of poetry was
Poe	PERSON	's '' The viol , the violet , and the vine . ''

		It is a pretty line , but that
Dowson	PERSON	should select it from all the splendors and ineffable glories of English verse , speaks volumes for the limitations of
Dowson	ORGANIZATION	's mind .

		What
Poe	PERSON	, who , however he may have erred in theory , reached out in practice to the boldest and most daring designs to the boundaries of thought and conception , whose aim always was to dec - orate his construction , not to construct his decoration , would have said of the attempt made in this book to father upon him the modern school of weakness , can only be con -

		WASTE AND CONSERVATION .

		* Youth thinks all things possible ; senility finds the light grasshopper a load .

		Science seeks to be free from illusions and to confront reality .

		Americans have mis-read the meaning of nature , and have imagined soils to be inex - haustible , mines to be deep as
China	LOCATION	, forests to be positive obstacles in the way of civiliza - tion .

		As soon as industry was organized , it began to exploit women , girls , and children ; to rob the future race for present profit ; to squeeze the life out of vigorous immigrants in a single generation , and to cast degenerates and alcoholics into insane asylums or the grave .

		This was the folly of uiiinstructed youth , heed - less of remote consequences , myopic to all but immediate profits .

		The habit of waste runs through all conduct ; the reckless abuse of coal and timber and soil confuses man 's judgment about himself ; the spendthrift , while he is scattering his miserly and unscrupulous father 's wealth , is squandering his own nerves and blood .

		There are numerous indications of the coming of more mature and more scientific and sober consideration of natural resources , things , and men .

		Some sources of evidence are suggested in the volume entitled `` The Conservation of
Natural Resources	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by the President of
Wisconsin University	ORGANIZATION	, who is a distinguished representative of science , and a man of vision and of patriotism .

		One can fol - low such a guide with confidence ; his warnings are clothed in exact statistical form ; his coun - sels are all the more likely to be heeded because they are deliberate and expert , and point out at each step the best known methods of re - covering losses and avoiding future waste .

		He does not scold or declaim ; he teaches convinc - ingly .

		Thus to conserve our limited supply of coal , which , once used , is gone forever , the author recommends not only better technical methods of mining , but legislation regulating the forms of leases and the basis of royalties .

		If the prices are exorbitant ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has power to regulate them ; the people are defenceless only while they remain ignorant and supine .

		THE DIAL 19 Monopolies are powerful , but government is supreme ; a reasonable profit is necessary to encourage production , while robbery of the people can be prevented .

		When the disastrous consequences of forest fires are portrayed , the reader is not left in gloom .

		He is told that under government ownership mountain - sides may be made to return profits on planted trees : that a forest patrol saves vastly more than it costs ; that waste branches can be utilized for firewood , pulp , and chemical products ; that a gradual change in the tax law would remove the motive of forest owners to destroy the timber at once and leave the permanent property for their own families .

		After demonstrating to the prosper - ous farmer that he is robbing his heirs by im - poverishing the soil , he is taught how erosion may be diminished by a curved furrow ; how nitrogen can be extracted from the air and transformed into plant-food ; how potassium may be procured when it is lacking ; and how phosphorous is lost and won .

		Then , when , with ample and exact learning , the author has pointed out the blunders of waste and the methods of wise economy , he passes to the in - terpretation of ultimate values .

		Conservation reduces the expenditure of human energy , it - self strictly limited in amount , upon mere sub - sistence , and thus leaves time and power free for intellectual and spiritual activities , satis - factions , and development .

		A true scheme of conservation includes the application of sci - entific and preventive medicine to the task of prolonging human life and raising its quality .

		Narrow and selfish individualism is no longer adequate ; egoistic exploitation of many by a few is national bankruptcy .

		Posterity has claims upon us .

		The criterion of right , justice , law , is the permanent welfare of the race .

		A new and larger creed is now formulated by the conservation conferences .

		The argument of Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	's volume on '' The Fight for Conservation '' is political , economical , and patriotic .

		It asserts that the chief danger to our civilization lies in the at - tempt of great corporations to monopolize the rapidly vanishing forests , mines , pasture lands , and especially the water-power .

		It is certainly an earnest and eloquent appeal , and there are many facts which give it plausibility .

		The conclusion , however , is reached without any elaborate array of facts from the author 's own special scientific storehouse , and by a method of which economists rather than physicists are the more competent judges .

		One would not turn to this little volume for information about the scientific aspects of conservation of forests and mines , startling as are some of its illustra - tions of national wastefulness and recklessness .

		A very attractive picture of the theory of national and state conservation policies is found in '' The Conservation of Water , '' by Mr.
John L. '' Mathews	PERSON	; but more topics are covered than the title indicates .

		Beginning with the '' water farm , '' or storage of water near the head waters of streams , we travel on through the processes of swamp drainage , irrigation , the development of power , the revetment of the bank , the purification of rivers , the establish - ment of navigation , the conservation of the soil .

		The result promised is a splendid Utopia .

		The political philosophy is the same as that of the volumes by Dr.
Van Hise	PERSON	and Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	, national and state control of the natural sources of power and fertility in the interest of the nation .

		For many years the scientific men employed by the
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	governments , by universities and by corporations , have been exploring and measuring the resources of the country mines , forests , water , soil .

		For years their discoveries were hidden in museums and offices ; their words of warning were apparently unheeded .

		But the facts were on record .

		Men of business studied them and turned them to private account ; they acquired title and legal claim to use the national wealth as they pleased ; and the popular ethical creed offered no hin - drance to their policy .

		If it is a race in which every man is for himself , then who can blame the swiftest and strongest and most cunning if he grasps the lion 's share ?

		But science is not the tool of a clique ; it belongs to humanity , and soon or late its service will be offered to all .

		Since the politicians have found that the con - clusions of science are popular war-cries there is danger that the careful students of nature who first made this movement possible may be ungratefully forgotten and their advice be ignored .

		The books here called to notice will help to prevent this danger of f orgetf ulness and neglect of competent guides .

Benson	PERSON	explains in an Introduction , '' is an attempt , or rather a hundred attempts , to sketch some of the details of life , seen from a simple plane enough , and with no desire to conform it to a theory , or to find anything very definite in it , or to omit anything because it did not fit in with prejudices or predilections . ''

		The quiet mode of life he has chosen for himself in a retired spot which he rather fancifully likens to an island , was not adopted , he declares , in any attempt to shirk his fair share of the natural human burden ; but feeling that he had borne an unprofitable load long enough , and that it was high time to let down the pack and untie it and see what it contained , he discovered that its contents were mostly designed , like the furniture of the White Knight 's horse in `` Through the Looking-Glass , '' to provide against unlikely contingencies .

		And so he concluded that he might live life , of the brevity and frailty of which he had become suddenly aware , on simpler and more rational lines .

		How he has been doing this and hopes still to do it , the subsequent pages of the book very entertainingly set forth .

		Apposite anecdote and illustration , passing reminiscence and pertinent reflection , with here and there a touch of quiet humor or gentle sarcasm , enrich and adorn the pages and beguile the reader from chapter to chap - ter until , all too soon , the end is reached .

		But it is a book that one can turn back and read over again with little or no decrease of zest .

		Studies in the
Psychology of Religion	ORGANIZATION	.

		The psychological study of the * .

		J .

		J expressions of the religious impulse b ^ jg f a j r t o become an American specialty .

		The '' Varieties of Religious Experience '' of our master psychologist ,
James	LOCATION	, brought its re - cognition to scholarly and popular attention abroad and at home .

		The emphasis of variety and the contrast of experience drew attention from trees to forest .

		The vigor , tolerance , independence and unconvention of American and Americanized ex - pressions of religion furnished the abundant material and the panoramic outlook .

		Starbuck ,
Coe	PERSON	,
Pratt	LOCATION	,
King	PERSON	, and others , have contributed specifically , and other psychologists such as
Stanley Hall	ORGANIZATION	,
Dewey	LOCATION	,
Royce	PERSON	generically , to the consummation of the American position .

		To these is now added ''
The Psychology of Religious Experience	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
E. S. Ames	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The work forms a notable addition to the literature and to the statement of the position .

		It may be recommended as an inviting and satisfying approach to the gen - eral field .

		The volume is distinctive in its combin - ation of an anthropological survey the clues afforded by custom , magic , spirits , sacrifice , myth with a survey of the developmental sequences in the individual , the religion of childhood , adoles - cence , and the normal adult reactions ; and an analysis of the vicissitudes of religious experiences in their social and historical settings .

		The domi - nant conception is that of religion as a sense of intimate social obligation , an enlargement of the outlook and activities , and an enhancement of life 's values through sacrifice in favor of non-personal though not depersonalized ends .

		Whether the direction of attitude , contemplation , fervor , service , restraint , is of one kind or another , whether enforced and directed by one set of conditions or another , whether drawn from its orbit by the em - phasis of events or distorted by anomaly , fanati - cism , or dogma , to unusual contours , the essential conformity of the varied expressions to the satisfac - tions of fundamentally analogous needs persists .

		It emerges plainly , in so far as we look away from the exaggerations and irrelevancies of sect and schism and heresy , or construe their more legitimate expression as but differentiations of conventionalized social appeal to different classes or temperaments , and avoid the confusion of pietistic and unquestion - ing conformity to dessicated ritual with significant religious impressibility . ''

		Getting religion '' proves to be so differently significant from maturing religiously .

		In the end , and conspicuous in the immediate horizon , such forces as democracy and science , and the illumination of cultural sensibility and humane tolerance , determine and measure religious attitudes ; and the normal exemplar of future society will be more wholly and consistently religious , when the channels of his religious expres - sions shall be adjusted more nearly than the present traditional stage makes possible , to the consumma - tion to be effected by the radical alteration of the social and industrial life .

		The transient inconsist - encies of preaching and practice are inevitably misleading .

		The wider and deeper survey of the religious life directs the view to essentials , and clarifies the perspective of interpretation .

		Pro- fessor
Ames	PERSON	's volume is a stimulating and reassur - ing aid to the performance of this service for the sympathetic and progressive idealist .

		THE DIAI , 21 Thediarvof romance of adventure , the joy a daughter of of young love , the sweetness of friend - the Confederacy .

		s hi p > an -LRB- j the horror of war are all depicted in the pages of an absorbing little book that can be read through , without haste , in a sitting , '' The Diary of a Refugee '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
Frances Fearn	PERSON	, editor of this vivid chronicle of stirring events -LRB- which she has also dramatized under the title , `` Let us Have Peace '' -RRB- , explains in an Introduction that the Diary is of her mother 's writing and is only now made public in response to an appeal from a historical society for the bringing to light of any material bearing on the Civil War .

		The writer was the wife of a
Louisiana	LOCATION	planter who with his family was driven by the advance of the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	forces in
1862	DATE	to take refuge first in
Texas	LOCATION	, then in
Havana	LOCATION	, and soon afterward in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The history of hardships endured , and of the loss of loved ones in the war , is relieved by incidents of a romantic or chivalrous or amorous description , in which a beautiful daughter
Clarice	PERSON	is the heroine .

		A near view of life in
Paris	LOCATION	under the Empire is also afforded , and we read how the fair Clarice at - tracted such attention from the Emperor that her mother felt it necessary to carry her off to
London	LOCATION	until the imperial ardor should cool .

		General
Grant	PERSON	, a kinsman of the family , is made to appear in an attractive light and to show the family characteristic , kindness .

		Lincoln too is introduced , on the occasion of his assassination , and that tragedy is frankly ad - mitted to be '' the greatest misfortune '' and '' more disastrous in its effects upon the South than any - thing that could have happened . ''

		Mrs.
Fearn	PERSON	has well performed her editorial duties -LRB- even though at the outset she makes `` data '' a singular noun -RRB- , fill - ing in sundry gaps in this old journal and making it into a book well worth reading and of real his - toric value .

		A few family and other portraits are given , as also several drawings by Miss
Rosalie Urquhart	PERSON	.

		Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, in a commendatory letter printed in the Introduction , acts as sponsor to the book .

		A journalistic Mr -
Edwin E. Slosson	PERSON	's book on treatment of '' Great American Universities '' Universities .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must not be taken too seriously .

		When the several articles appeared in '' The Independent , '' they attracted local and general interest , of the kind that makes for publicity .

		In a book of 500 pages , with appropriate introduction and conclusion , the result invites other and more critical standards than attend its reception by casual readers .

		Doubtless universities must be content to be subjects for -LRB- or invite -RRB- journalistic treatment ; and Mr.
Slosson	PERSON	's review of fourteen of the large universities embodies considerable information in regard to them , statistical , critical , biographical , administrative , and miscellaneous .

		Nor can it be urged that the space is devoted to externals only ; they figure unduly but naturally .

		Yet an earnest attempt is made to set forth inner tendencies , and reflect local color and college spirit .

		The articles made good journalism , and , indeed , a high order of journalism , as such things go .

		As educational criticism , to which the volume pretends , it will per - form some service and perhaps as much disservice .

		It will help many to get a far better idea of the univer - sities described than they could or would otherwise secure ; and it will prevent some from getting a true conception of the real American university , and de - bar them hopelessly from a like understanding of the ideal one .

		A university is a complicated machine ; but when you describe it as such , particularly to the non-mechanical , you create an illusive impression that they understand it ; and you have distracted atten - tion from the far more important fact that a university is something other than a complicated machine .

		To this distorted perspective , Mr.
Slosson	PERSON	's straining for journalistic effect adds a needless touch of bur - lesque .

		It varies from good-humored banter to very bad taste .

		It affords illumination ; but it suggests the glare of the footlights , not of the lamp of learn - ing .

		It is hoped that the public seriously interested in universities will not take the volume for more than a sheaf of impressions .

		This should be done in fair - ness to Mr.
Slosson	PERSON	and to the universities .

		One may have misgivings concerning the discernment of the general reader .

		If so , one may find consolation in the reflection that it shows well for American universities , that even the skilful photographer does not find on his films the features worthy of record .

		These are reserved for the artist-painter .

		Dr.
Dickie	PERSON	is almost as inveterate a story-teller as Dr.
Depew	PERSON	; and by dint of telling not only his own experiences but the stories that have been told to him , and stories that he has elsewhere heard of those whom he has casually met , he has brought together an interesting collection .

		Add to these some really first-hand observations regarding the condi - tions of living abroad as , for instance , the oppor - tunities and the dangers of unattended girls and we have the best features of the book .

		The chapters on
Stoecker	PERSON	,
Harnack	LOCATION	.


Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	,
Curtius	PERSON	,
Hermann Grimm	PERSON	,
Rahel	PERSON	and
Henriette Herz	PERSON	, are of very un - equal value , on the whole promising more than they yield , and sometimes strangely empty or wandering .

		The last two , of course , can be little else than trans - lation , and the translation is sometimes lame .

		The good clergyman 's breathless reverence for royalties , who are never introduced without two or more cap - itals , is almost unpleasant when in the presence of the imperial family .

		The Emperor 's eye `` beams and glows and glistens as no other eye can into which I have been permitted to look . ''

		The Empress is '' that noblest of all women . ''

		And neither of them appears but Dr.
Dickie	PERSON	comes to '' attention '' with his hat off .

		But one can forgive this when he knows 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, that the Emperor has been very nice to Dr.
Dickie	PERSON	, even permitting him to copy into the book one of his own sermons , and , still more gracious , one of his prayers .

		And with all his projecting personality , one can not deny geniality and some charm to the author .

		The small fisherman of the English the ` longshore coast -LRB- the
South Devon	LOCATION	coast , ap - ftsherman .

		parently -RRB- is painted to the life in Mr.
Stephen Reynolds	PERSON	's '' Alongshore : Where Man and the Sea Face One Another '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a book to be read and pondered by those of whom the Devonshire fishermen scornfully say , with not a little truth , `` The likes o ' they ca n't tell what the likes o ' us got to contend wi , ' nor never wo n't . ''

		Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	, by taking a hand in the work of these toilers of the sea and by sharing their hardships , has fitted himself to write understandingly of them , and he has the artistic temperament necessary to impart something of ideal beauty to the hard real - ities of ` longshore fishing , where a shifting beach , scanty resources and other adverse conditions com - bine to make life a very serious matter to the dimin - ishing remnant of a hardy and once numerous class .

		The organization of industry and the spread of modern commercial methods have dealt unkindly with the small fisherman , whose total extinction is feared and deprecated by Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	.

		Valuable suggestions for the improvement of his lot are made by the author , especially in an appended article reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' and en - titled `` Small Holdings on the Sea . ''

		A small and inexpensive motor boat , of ingenious construction and of tested serviceability in ` longhore fishing , where all boats have to be beached every night , is described as offering '' some chance , at all events , of arresting the otherwise almost hopeless and wholly deplorable decline in small fishing . ''

		Character sketches , amusing or otherwise interesting incidents , fishermen 's yarns , abundance of snappy dialogue in quaint but easily intelligible dialect , with other pleasing features , including half-tone reproductions of photographs -LRB- rather misleadingly described on the title-page as `` illustrations by Melville Mackay '' -RRB- , contribute to the attractiveness of the book .

George W. Bagby	PERSON	, a
Virginia	LOCATION	physician who early adopted the profession of letters , arid , as journalist and lecturer , never tired of voicing the praises of the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, chiefly in the form of realistic sketches of characters and scenes dear to his heart .

		Some of the best of these abundant and swiftly - written pieces have been collected and provided with an introduction by Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, and appear in a volume entitled `` The Old
Virginia Gentleman	PERSON	, and Other Sketches '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		A portrait of Dr.
Bagby	PERSON	, with a sketch of his life by Mr.
Edward S. Gregory	PERSON	, is fittingly provided .

		Both Mr.
Page	PERSON	and Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	are enthusiastic in their praise of Dr.
Bagby	PERSON	's genius . ''

		Next to
Poe	PERSON	, '' de - clares the former , '' the most original of all
Virginia	LOCATION	writers was he whose reputation in his lifetime rested mainly on humorous sketches of a mildly satirical and exceedingly original type , but who was master of a pathos rarely excelled by any author and rarely equalled by any American author .

		But these adored him . '' ''

		He is certainly possessed of humor and pathos , of an admirable facility in the use of epithet , and a rich fancy in dressing out the reproduced characters of his well-stored memory ; while his easy colloquialism of style is suited to the tastes of the great mass of readers .

		This proper curiosity or interest is min - istered to by the reminiscences of Colonel

White House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Through Five Administrations '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- shows the personal side of
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Hayes	PERSON	,
Garfield	PERSON	, and
Arthur	PERSON	, with glimpses into their family life and the personality of their wives .

		Mr.
Crook	PERSON	was made body-guard of President Lincoln three months before his assassination , and attended him every - where .

		The account of this association is interest - ing , but no new traits or characteristics are pre - sented .

		.

		Mrs.
Lincoln	PERSON	, however , is set before us in a much more favorable light than by many writers of her time .

		President
Johnson	PERSON	won the respect and affection of his office force ; Mr.
Crook	PERSON	's ac - count tallies with that of Secretary Welles in that respect , and the two stories of the struggle with the radicals and of the impeachment proceedings are much the same in tone .

		The author loved
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, and labors hard to free him from every suspicion of unworthy favoritism ; but he is less convincing here than in any other part of the book .

		The reminiscences are exceedingly interesting , and are valuable as side-lights on the history of the time .

		In those years of excitement and passion ,
Sumner	PERSON	was one of the greatest figures ; and it is important that he should be more than a name to us of these later times and
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 quieter days .

		The work shows an earnest purpose , and contains much that is valuable ; yet its defects are obvious .

		It contains more than seven hundred large and closely printed pages that are trying to the eyes of the reader ; and it is overloaded with detail , making the reading a matter of time and effort .

		The author 's style is not attractive , and he has introduced moralizings and many matters but loosely connected with
Sumner	PERSON	's life and work .

		The treatment is from what may be called the traditional
New England	LOCATION	point of view ; no trace appears of the new light shed on the characters and events by recent material .

		For example , it is the old
Stanton	PERSON	and the old
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	that we see in these pages , as well as the old motives and the old judgments with which contemporary writings were filled .

		The Sumner here portrayed is a demigod ; the author sees no failings in him .

		In spite of these drawbacks , the book is interesting , for no careful narrative of these years of storm and stress can lack interest , and the great personality of
Charles Snmner	PERSON	will always command attention .

		For the student who is not especially concerned with the discussion as to the meaning of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's words , but wishes to know the meaning in as direct and simple a manner as possible , Mr.
R. J. Cunliffe	PERSON	's '' New Shakespearean Dictionary '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will be a very useful handbook .

		It is much less bulky than
Schmidt	PERSON	, even less so than
Littleton	LOCATION	's Dyce ; and yet it gives all that the student needs to know about the words whose meanings are un - familiar to him .

		Thus , to take an illustrative ex - ample , ``
Lebanon	LOCATION	'' is disposed of thus : `` Identified variously , and quite uncertainly , with ebony -LRB- which does not appear to be poisonous -RRB- , henbane , and yew . ''

		Then follows the quotation from '' Hamlet . ''

		Little - ton discusses the various interpretations to the extent of half a page , and does not enlighten the general reader to any greater extent .

		The work aims to treat all words which are not part of the modern lan - guage ; this is done by means of succinct definitions and illustrative quotations , limited in the case of frequent occurrence to three or four .

		The author has been able to make use of the splendid work of the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, and thus to put within easy reach the results of its exact scholarship .

		Such a method is pretty sure to produce a good text-book , and there is no better of its scope , and for its purpose , than the one now briefly described .

		The number of entries is not specified , but it seems to be about equal to the number in the
Scott	LOCATION	volume .

		A German text of unusual interest and importance is provided by
Professor William Guild Howard	ORGANIZATION	in a volume of selections entitled '' Laokoon '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The text includes the '' Laokoon '' itself , of course , together with
Lessing	PERSON	's '' Entwiirfe zum Laokoon , '' and besides these

		One concluding remark : Noticeable in our library literature is the increasing use of '' she '' and '' her '' as the pronoun of common gender .

		For instance , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	writes : `` The person in charge is always ready to give assistance to any one who seems to have difficulty in locating the material she wants . ''

		Why not '' the desired material '' ?

		or even '' the material he wants '' ?

		Are library-users , like church-goers , becoming confined to the weaker sex ?

		The
Summer School of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	announces an interesting innovation in the teaching of Fine Arts , namely , a course on
Turner	PERSON	and the landscape painting of his time to be given in
London	LOCATION	next
summer	DATE	by Professor Pope .

		The course will begin on
July 5	DATE	, and end on
August 15	DATE	, and will be open to women as well as men .

		It will be conducted by means of lectures , con - ferences , visits to galleries , and reports .

		The chief aim will be a study of the works of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	in the galleries in and near
London	LOCATION	, together with a study of his en - vironment and development , in order to learn as much as possible of the mental processes involved in the pro- duction of great imaginative works of art .

Constantine	PERSON	to the close of the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principles which have guided the conception of this work are those laid down by the late
Lord Acton	PERSON	for the ''

Jan.	DATE	l r The One Indispensable Medium for Publishers of Worthy Books ` T'HIRTY years of continuous publi - cation under the same management speak for THE DIAL 'S stability and success .

		It is preeminently a book journal , published solely in the inter - ests of the book class , the literary and cultivated class , the class that buy books .

		It is issued from the second largest city in the country , the centre of the immense book-consuming region of the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		HTHE DIAL is more generally con - sulted and depended upon by librarians in making up orders for books than any other American critical journal ; it circulates more widely among retail booksellers than any other journal of its class ; it is the accustomed literary guide and aid of thousands of private book-buyers , covering every section of the country .

		T ^ HESE facts make THE DIAL indis - putably the foremost medium for high-grade advertising , - the one indispensable medium for the publisher of worthy books .

THE CHICAGO OPERA	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new chapter has been added to the history of opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Until the present year , this city has been dependent upon visiting com - panies for its supply of this particular form of artistic satisfaction , and the supply has been uncertain in quality and narrowly limited in quantity .

		Some years we got one week , some years two , and there was now and then a barren year when we got none at all .

		In the season of
1909-10	DATE	, there arose the hope of better things , for an entire month of opera was then vouch - safed us by the magnates who control the out - put of that forced musical product .

		A year ago , also , there was promise in the air , for an enterprise was set on foot to supply the long - felt need of a permanent organization which should make
Chicago	LOCATION	its centre , and which should give us what might fairly be called an opera season .

		That season , covering ten weeks , is just now ending , and its success is a matter of recorded history .

		To the faith , the determi - nation , and the devotion of the group of men who made the enterprise possible , and who offered to bear the loss , if loss there should prove to be , we pay our tribute of grateful recognition .

		The fact that they have closed the season with no loss to shoulder does not detract from our sense of obligation .

		They assumed a heavy risk for the public good ; it is a matter for general congratulation that the public rose to the height of its opportunity , and proved itself unwilling to become otherwise than morally indebted to its benefactors .

		Among the elements which have contributed to the success of a venture which caused many wise heads to wag doubtfully a few months ago we may mention those of major importance .

		The interprise was set in operation by the right sort of driving force , the quality of energy which is put into their work by men of prac - tical affairs .

		These men are not accustomed to failure , and they have now shown that even in the untried field of artistic endeavor the far-sighted and sagacious methods which bring business success are applicable to other than strictly business interests .

		Then the exploita - tion of the venture , in the form of preliminary heralding , reports of progress , and continuous publicity during the actual opera season , was very skilfully managed .

		Finally , the artistic 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, forces assembled were such as to win confidence from the start , a confidence which we need hardly say has been more than justified by the ten weeks of actual performance .

		Not only were we provided with an array of soloists capable of meeting an exacting demand and of adapting themselves to a great variety of parts , but also with a completely adequate chorus and orchestra , and with stage-settings that might fairly be described as sumptuous .

		We have only to add that as director general or field marshal of all these forces and material adjuncts we were given the services of
Signer Cleofonte Campanini	PERSON	, a great leader , to whose genius we have been indebted for the artistic unity and impressive totality of effect without which the best efforts of the most accomplished individual performers would have proved unavailing .

		This much may fairly be said in the way of whole-hearted praise .

		There remains the task of indicating , less for reproof than in the hope of future correction , what seem to us to have been instances of mistaken judgment in the planning of the work and in its business man - agement .

		It has been frankly an opera season upon a French-Italian basis , with
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	,
Puc	ORGANIZATION	- cini ,
Massenet	ORGANIZATION	,
Charpentier	PERSON	, and
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	for its supporting pillars .

		This has meant the pro- production of several works hitherto unknown to our public `` La Fanciulla del West , '' `` Thai 's , '' `` Louise , '' and `` Pelleas et
Melis	PERSON	- ande '' for which we are extremely grateful .

		They are not great works , but they are interest - ing ones , and it is well that they should have been performed ideally , because it is only by the test of performance that new works may be appraised ; practically , because the appeal of novelty is one that the box-office may not ignore .

		With these works we must also mention the over-discussed `` Salome , '' which calls for special consideration .

		This opera was announced long in advance , was given two performances , and was then withdrawn in deference to a storm of protest .

		Whether or not that protest was of a kind that deserved to be effective we are not now inclined to say .

		But no gift of prophecy was needed to know that it would be made , and exactly what form it would take .

		The management should have taken this into ac - count , and can not offer surprise as their defence .

		They should have determined either not to pro- duce the work at all , or to keep on producing it no matter how loud the outcry from the hosts of philistinism .

		This lack of decision in this matter is not altogether to their credit .

		With the exception of `` Salome , '' and possibly of '' Les Huguenots , '' no work by a German com - poser was given during the entire season .

		This exclusion was deliberate , and did not result from a lack of the requisite forces ; it had only the effect of alienating a large section of the opera-going public , the section whose tastes are the most deserving of consideration .

		To many of the most serious lovers of music , a season of opera without
Wagner	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	, without
Beethoven	PERSON	or
Weber	PERSON	or
Humperdinck	PERSON	, is not opera at all .

		We can not think it a far-sighted policy which filled ten weeks with French and Italian works alone , and which drew its entire repertory from two classes of works more or less sensational novelties and hackneyed popular favorities .

		Before the beginning of the season , we ex - pressed the hope that a moderate scale of charges would be adopted , as the only means of building up a steady and warmly-attached following .

		We regret to say that this hope was not realized ; the high scale that was fixed upon had the inevitable consequence of packing the theatre upon some nights , and leaving it half - empty upon others .

		What is needed is a tariff which will not be thought exorbitant by most lovers of music , and which will keep the house practically filled for all the performances .

		We believe that a lower tariff would have had pre - cisely this effect , and would have yielded about the same aggregate returns .

		Even if there were some risk in the experiment , it would be worth making , because its success would mean a public support ungrudgingly given and likely to be found lasting .

		The tariff actually adopted has proved , it is true , measurably successful , but it has left many of the supporters of the enter - prise with a sense of detachment and even an irritation .

		Irritation is not a strong enough word to express the feeling of the public toward the policy which , not content with adhering to the scale of prices -LRB- already unnecessarily high -RRB- officially announced , has grasped every possible opportunity to extort two or three additional dollars from the purchaser of a ticket whenever a sensational novelty or an exceptionally pop - ular vocalist was the attraction offered .

		This policy has resulted in a few crowded houses , but it has nearly killed the goose that should lay the golden eggs of future seasons .

		It is a policy which has come perilously close to bad faith with the public , in one instance notably , when the augmented schedule was not even ad - vertised , but was left to be discovered at the box-office by applicants for tickets .

		We are glad that it is possible in some degree to offset these unpleasant facts by calling attention to
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 37 the wise and happy policy that provided a Sat - urday night performance every week at greatly reduced prices , and a series of
Sunday	DATE	afternoon concerts of which no one could maintain that they did not give good measure of value for the moderate prices asked for the seats .

		Next year 's opera is already assured us by the success of the season now ended .

		We hope that it may prove no less profitable , and may achieve success without resorting to devices that will be more sharply resented upon repetition than they have been by the public in this year 's tolerant and receptive mood .

		We think that the scale of prices should be lowered ; we are quite certain that , whatever it may be , no de - parture should be made from it when it is once announced .

		We trust that the half-price per - formances and the
Sunday	DATE	concerts may be con - tinued .

		We believe that the management will not again make the mistake of ignoring German opera in the interest of the inferior French and Italian forms .

		And we urge upon them with all the emphasis at our command not to give heed to the ill-advised plea for opera in the En - glish language , if that is to mean the wrenching of the score from the forms of foreign speech with which it is perforce most vitally linked .

		To deal in this brutal fashion with such a work as '' Tristan '' or * Aida '' or '' Pelleas '' would be an artistic indignity of which we do not like to think any true musician capable .

		Those who ask for it have only the shallowest of argu - ments to advance in its favor , and they ignore the most fundamental aesthetic considerations .

		The only opera that has a right to be sung in the English language is opera which English composers have fitted to English words .

		When such works are given to the world , we shall be among the foremost to welcome their appearancej But to anyone for whom an opera is a work of art , an attempt to sing it with translated words is simply unthinkable .

		JOHN SYNGE AND HIS PLATS .

		The picture lover who thinks that in admiring the French luminists '' impressionists , '' we used to call them he is welcoming painting 's last word , is no more behind the times than the reader who supposes that , in knowing something of
Lady Gregory	LOCATION	, Mr.
George Russell	PERSON	-LRB- `` A.E. '' -RRB- , and Mr.
`` William Butler Yeats	PERSON	, he keeps pace with the Irish literary movement .

		The dim distances and elusive charm of these writers remain ; but if I may be permitted to mix my metaphors some of the Irish playwrights prepare an altogether different palette .

		Such new arrivals as
Pdraic Colum	ORGANIZATION	and
S. L. Robinson	PERSON	and
Rutherford Mayne	ORGANIZATION	are inter - ested , above all , in the vivid
Ireland	LOCATION	of the hour .

		And yet , beside the work of one who was their elder brother , the richly actual work of these dramatists either seems almost trifling or betrays an unchecked dalliance with the wraiths peopling the Celtic shadow - land where
Ossian	PERSON	was magnified and
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	tarried .

		In
London	LOCATION	, this greater Irish playwright great in achievement as well as by comparision has been acted by those same Abbey Theatre play - ers who were , at
Dublin	LOCATION	, his original interpreters .

		His '
Deirdre	PERSON	, '' the text of which has only recently been published , was lately presented at the Court Theatre ; his `` Tinker 's Wedding '' was acted a year ago at
His Majesty 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Here , however , he has held no stage f ; nor has he had , like Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, his American editions .

		His plays are u literature '' all the same ; and must -LRB- notwithstanding -RRB- hold spell - bound the American audience before which they are adequately produced : so admirably theatric they are in essence and in spoken line .

		Yet it is only to-day , with the presentation of his one-act play , '' In the Shadow of the Glen '' t by Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	, that he is coming into his own .

		n.
John Millington Synge	PERSON	pronounced sing was born in
1871	DATE	; being -LRB- I quote from a letter of his brother 's writing -RRB- '' the youngest son of the late
John Hatch Synge	PERSON	, barrister-at-law , and owner of landed property in
County Galway	LOCATION	. ''

		He died thirty -
eight years later	DATE	, the author of six plays and a few poems and translations , and standing on the thres - hold of what promised to be a happy marriage .

		For this man of vigor , struck down by an incurable malady , death was announced some months at least before it came ; in the interval he worked at his play ''
Deirdre	PERSON	. ''

		* ' Death is a poor untidy thing at best , though it 's a Queen that dies , '' he wrote on his sick-bed ; and to
Naisi	LOCATION	, the
Paris	LOCATION	of this Irish Helen-drama , he gave this line : '' It 's a hard and bitter thing , losing the earth . ''

		* '' The Tinker 's Wedding , '' a comedy in two acts , was published by
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Dublin	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
1907	DATE	.

		A four-column edi - tion of the dramatist 's entire contribution , including his verse , has just been issued by the same publisher .

		t The professional stage , that is .

		His one-act '' Riders to the Sea '' was produced by amateurs before the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, in
Boston	LOCATION	, five years since ; and was subse - quently discussed in a paper by Professor
Vida D. Scndder	PERSON	, of
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lecture and play were published in '' Poet-Lore , '' in the
spring of 1905	DATE	.

		The three-act comedy , '' The Playboy of the Western World '' -LRB-
Dublin	LOCATION	: Mannsel ;
1907	DATE	-RRB- was acted in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
April 13 , 1909	DATE	, by
Hart Conway	PERSON	's pupils in the School of Acting of the
American Conserva	ORGANIZATION	- tory of Music .

		t With '' Riders to the Sea , '' this comedy is issued by the
London	LOCATION	publisher ,
Elkin Mathews	PERSON	, in his '' Vigo Cabinet Series . ''

		See `` The Curse '' ; a poem whose full title is , `` To a Sister of an Enemy of the Author 's who disapproved of the ' Playboy , ' '' in the preface to
Synge	PERSON	's '' Poems and
Transla	PERSON	- tions , '' beautifully printed at the
Cuala Press	ORGANIZATION	,
1909	DATE	.

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, The family that bred this man gave more than one bishop to the established church of
Ireland	LOCATION	, more than one man of law to the
Dublin	LOCATION	Courts .

		Did the Synges pass on to their one poet-playwright something of the Protestant spirit that they had so strongly , that something purged , however , of dogma ?

		If so , the inheritance took form as a pro- test against Protestantism .

		For here was one who accepted this world for what it was , and in it found , without reforming it , plenty to love and to hate .

		Though Mr.
J. B. Yeats	PERSON	has described him on the margin of my copy of the '' Playboy '' as '' an ardent home-ruler and Nationalist , '' he was obliged to add , `` yet so little pugnacious that he never declared his opinions unless under some sort of compulsion .

		A resolute peaceful man . ''

		Also , '' a solitary , undemonstrative man , never asking pity , nor seeking sympathy , but ... folded up in brooding intellect . ''

		If something of inherited independence and op - position entered into the composition of even the boy Synge , it may be well to note that he never suffered from a plethora of inherited goods and chattels , for all that '' landed property in
County Galway	LOCATION	. ''

		Most men would have considered his tiny income quite too small a fund for travel and literary work .

		But of his education he could not complain .

		First of all , he was prepared by tutors for
Trinity Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ,
Dublin	LOCATION	, which he entered in
1888	DATE	.

		There he took prizes in
Hebrew	LOCATION	and Gaelic , and was grad - uated in
1892	DATE	.

		He studied music , too , and ob - tained a scholarship in Harmony from the Royal Irish Academy a year before his college graduation .

		In
1893	DATE	, he continued these musical studies in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The eternal wanderlust that had stung men like
Bamfylde	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Carew	PERSON	,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	calls the roll -RRB- was in his blood , too .

		He was , for some years now , the gypsy-scholar , or another
Goldsmith	PERSON	, if you will .

		Doubtless he played the fiddle better than that other Irishman : the fiddle which , years later , he scraped in
Mayo	LOCATION	cottages for peasants to dance and sing by .

		He was , also , to play for Italian sailors ; to hear story - telling in Bavarian woods .

		But , after spending a year in
Germany	LOCATION	, he `` gave up music for litera - ture , '' as the brother writes in the letter I have before me .

		From
1895	DATE	, he was in
France	LOCATION	prin - cipally at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It was his intention to fit himself for criticism : he went at the task with more thor - oughness than is used in Anglo-Saxon countries .

		His gift for languages had declared itself at
Dublin	LOCATION	; at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		he sought to master Romance phi - lology no less than French literature and the world 's best criticism .

		His was no Bohemian ideal : he joined no band of cafe '' - poets or sect of mutual admiration .

		The symbolists seem never to have deeply impressed this solitary student , who knew the
Paris	LOCATION	of their noisy decadence .

		Racine was his favorite among French poets .

		For some years after
1895	DATE	, he spent a part of each year in
Paris	LOCATION	; he had , too , friends in the country , whose homes he visited .

		All of which sounds most conventional for a poet .

		A shade less conventional is the circumstance that this student of philology and of literature whether in
France	LOCATION	or elsewhere on the Continent commonly lived with a family of the working class .

		To these folk he paid a small sum to share their table-room and attic ; he shared in their conversa - tion , too , and learned something of their private ways and thought .

		Two advantages , at least , this programme afforded .

		First of all , economy .

		Fur - thermore , it helped him in the mastery of languages , and satisfied , for the moment , a certain impulse that he strongly had to study , not books and speech alone , but human nature : human nature at home .

		Later , we shall see , he followed the same regimen in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		And , impersonal as his literary method is ,
Synge	PERSON	's plays are , almost consequentially , rich in personality : for this sympathy of the writer for his characters , attained , not in the study , but in living with them on equal terms , gives his people roots in the soil they stand on .

		They are , indeed , no less real than the incidents and homely details of his plays are vividly suggestive of their proper setting .

		But it was not of home that he was thinking while he lived on at the
Paris	LOCATION	shoemaker 's , now and again helping out the housewife , who was a couturier , with a rush order , and taking calmly , as a matter of course , a scolding for his clumsiness .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, in an introduction contributed to one of
Synge	PERSON	's plays , five years ago , tells us of finding this fellow-countryman in
Paris	LOCATION	, and of the end of this phase of his life this unique preparation for literary fruitf ulness .

		Six years earlier which must mean the winter of 1898-1899 he writes , he had been staying at a students ' hotel in the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	, and someone introduced him to an Irishman , '' who , even poorer than myself , had taken a room at the top of the house .

		It was
J. M. Synge	PERSON	, and I , who thought I knew the name of every Irishman who was working at literature , had never heard of him ... He had , however , nothing to show but one or two poems and impressionistic essays , full of the morbidity that has its roots in too much brooding over methods of expression , and ways of looking upon life which come , not out of life , but out of literature ; images reflected from mirror to mirror . ''

		Life had cast no light into his writings ; he had lost , too , the Irish that he had learned at the University : '' for the only language that interested him was that conventional language of modern poetry which had begun to make us all weary . '' ''

		Give up
Paris	LOCATION	, '' counselled the fellow-poet to this uncertain seeker of romance ; '' you will never create anything by reading
Racine	LOCATION	, and
Arthur Symons	PERSON	will always be a better critic of French literature .

		Go to the
Aran Islands ... Express	ORGANIZATION	a life that has never found expression . ''

		Now , the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, bare platforms and hag - gard steepes of rock , lie '' about thirty miles from
Galway	LOCATION	, up the centre of the bay , but they are not far from the cliffs of
County Clare	LOCATION	, on the south , or the corner of
Connemara	LOCATION	, on the north . ''

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE D1AJL 39 in .

		The
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	which become the stage of all but one or two of
Synge	PERSON	's dramas , also the chief source of their plots and their types are three in number : '' Aranmor , the north island , about nine miles long ; Inishmaan , the middle island , about three miles and a half across and nearly round in shape ; and the south island , Inishere . ''

		All this and more one learns from the preface of that book of
Synge	ORGANIZATION	's to which he gave their name as title .

		* It is no less a book of travel with decided merits than a document bearing upon the author 's work for the stage , and upon the manner of life that he took up after leaving behind him the schools and garrets of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The scene is a bleak one , '' yet perhaps no other area speaks so eloquently , through ruined forts and churches , of thousands of pagan and Christian years lived painfully against the challenge of winds and waves and hunger .

		`` f Part one of the book shows us
John Synge	PERSON	sitting over a turf fire , listening to the murmur of Gaelic that rose from the little public-house under his room .

		In Aranmore occurs this scene .

		But soon we find our author setting out for Inishmaan , '' where Gaelic is more generally used , and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The natives are Irish , but chastened in their laughter ; these are '' dark '' people , i.e. , reserved , as compared with the mainlanders .

		In Inishmaan , one morning , stories are told round the kitchen fire ; and the author confesses to being strangely moved at hear - ing an illiterate old man , a native of that wet rock lost in the sea , telling a tale of a bargain for a pound of human flesh , and stories reminiscent of '' Cym - beline '' and other legends laden with European associations .

		From the mouths of just such old men the play - wright who had as yet all his playwriting before him took down the argument of more than one of his dramas , told in the picturesquely vivid lan - guage of the islanders : and all in the first person .

		It was thus that he heard the story which he later made into the one-act piece , `` In the Shadow of the Glen . ''

		I name that play particularly , not on ac - count of Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	's recent `` discovery '' of its possibilities , but because the playwright has so closely followed the narrative of the island story - teller ; and because it is one of the earliest of
Synge	ORGANIZATION	's productions : having been produced at the Moles - worth
Hall	PERSON	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, in
October , 1903	DATE	.

		There are but four personages :
Dan Burke	PERSON	, an old fanner ;
Nora	PERSON	, his young wife ;
Micheal Dara	PERSON	, a young herder ; and a tramp .

		The scene is '' the last cot - tage at the head of a long glen in County Wicklow . ''

		It is characteristic of
Synge	PERSON	's daring that his tramp , who comes to the cottage only to beg '' a sup of new milk and a quiet decent place where a man could * `` Tlie Aran Islands . ''

		sleep , '' leaves it accompanied by '' the woman of the house , '' whose husband had found her '' a hard woman to please , '' and '' a bad wife for an old man . ''

		It is characteristic of his powers , no less , that his reader accepts as natural , and perhaps as necessary , the changes brought about in four lives and in all their relations by the events of only a few moments .

		At th * opening of the piece , woman and tramp are total strangers ; they go out hand in hand , to sleep in a wet ditch .

		At the opening , the husband is jealous of a doltish young `` herd , '' and sets a trap to catch his wife in sin with him .

		At the end of it , old
Dan	PERSON	and young
Micheal	PERSON	toast each other out of one bottle , and , '' God help you , I do n't mind you at all , '' says the ex-husband to the supplanted lover .

		One knows various writers who , with the tale of '' The Shadow of the Glen '' ready to hand , could have made a passable farce of it .


John Synge	PERSON	has written pure comedy : and comedy that remains clean , albeit merciless , stripping its figures stark naked to the eyes of body and soul .

		But in that stripping , it is not the sordid alone that is uncovered .

		The restlessness , the vague dissatisfaction of the '' hard woman to please , '' is as limitless as
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	's restlessness and introspection .

		Above all , one 's sense of justice is quite satisfied with the denouement .

		This last assertion holds good , equally , for all
Synge	ORGANIZATION	's theatre .

		On reflection , it seems to us that everyone gets his deserts in these Irish dramas : in blows , in wettings , and in caresses .

		This is true of '' The Shadow of the Glen '' no more than of the much greater tragi-comedy , '' The Play - boy , '' which I shall not spoil by trying to condense .

		The principal figure of that piece runs the whole gamut of natural timidity and tearfulness , heroism -LRB- of its sort -RRB- , and braggadocio .

		Like the woman who lived in the shadow of the glen , he has suffered from the loneliness and emptiness of life .

		His mood is murderous , but it is also amorous ; and when it is amorous the poetry of a starved soul sings out unafraid .

		The Playboy experiences beatings and adulation , mockery and love and praise ; and all these things belong to the youth to whom
Synge	PERSON	has given substance and shadow .

		There is the same lyric beauty , heightened by contrasting irony , in `` The Shadow of the Glen , '' with the tramp 's invitation to '' come along with me now , lady of the house , and it 's not my blather you 'll be hearing only , but you 'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes , and you 'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them , and the big thrushes when the days are warm '' ; there is the same lyricism , and also the same justice , in '' Riders to the Sea , '' the most per - fect piece of them all , where not only a deep sense of the sea 's power and pitilessness is conveyed , but where this power and pitilessness throw into relief the fatalism in which old
Maurya	ORGANIZATION	is wrapped as in a garment : relaxed , at last , in her sense of the futility of struggle .

		This woman is much more than a widow of the wet west coast , mourning her lost mate and her lost children .

		Through this piece 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, rises , in her keening for the dead , a note of tragedy unalloyed : the tragedy of the sea , but also the tragedy of the Irish temper .

		In love with sorrow , and branded with sorrow 's mark ,
Maurya	ORGANIZATION	loses the last of her sons even before the sea has closed above him .

		And , satiated with grief , she mourns his death less than she has grieved , during nine days , at death 's premonition .

		The chapter is ended , and `` I 'll have no call now to be crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south , and you can hear the surf is in the east , and the surf is in the west , making a great stir with the two noises , and they hitting one on the other , '' is her comforting thought .

		`` No man at all can be living for ever , and we must be satisfied . ''

		But if , in reading '' Riders to the Sea , '' we have been purified by the quintessence of tragedy , its terror and pity , every one of these plays has its tragic comedians , idealists each in his way or hers , who all do , momentarily -LRB- and only momentarily -RRB- escape through the windows of the imagination from bitter and binding circumstance .

		Their theme is the yearning after beauty , or love , or heroism ; the end is disillusion .

		Even of this bitterness is his comedy finally purged .

		Its purges are honest sympathy and pervasive humor .

		IV . ''

		All art is a collaboration . ''

		Anyone happening upon this sentence in the brief preface to
John Synge	PERSON	's `` Playboy of the Western World '' might fancy that here was a preaching playwright .

		Wrongly , beyond a shred of doubt , albeit
Synge	PERSON	was a loyal member of the group of Abbey Theatre writers and players whose devotion to their artistic faith is as stout as their nationalism .

		But
Synge	PERSON	, with no theses to lay down , took the world as he found it , as playwright and as citizen .

		He found it a world full of interesting surfaces ; but he held that the drama , like the symphony , `` does not teach or prove anything . ''

		* Instead of that , and in spite of a kind of brood - ing sadness that is seldom wanting ,
Synge	PERSON	's work expresses a certain quality of the Irish realistic drama well brought out in the remark of a
London	LOCATION	play-reader to one of my friends .

		Their theme was the English-speaking stage .

		u Among the thou - sands of plays I have gone through in the last few years , '' said the play-reader , `` a fair proportion have been the work of Irish men and Irish women .

		I have only to read a few pages of one of these plays to differentiate those posted to me from Lon - don , and those from across the Channel .

		Techni - cally , the Irish pieces often stand below the English ; * After writing these paragraphs , I had the pleasure of reading in the `` New Quarterly '' for
February , 1910	DATE	, in a paper by Mr.
Francis Bickley	PERSON	, entitled `` Synge and the Drama , '' the statement that ''
Synge	PERSON	was not part and parcel of the Irish Revival in the same way that Mr.
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, for instance , is part and parcel of it .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	, it may be affirmed , has as an artist , been created by the movement , bynge became affected by it , but he was neither its parent nor its son . ''

		but invariably they have an individual flavor , a kind of interest in life and in living , that stamps them instantly recognizable . ''

		This quality is most in evidence in the work of the playwright who died so recently , at the height of his powers .

		Ageless as are his characters and their aspirations , the sun of to-day beats almost cruelly upon the actual landscape : landscapes that are , withal , very dear both to characters and to the playwright .

		In his comedies , he tells us of realities ; in his verses , he bids his reader to '' stretch in Red
Dan Sally	PERSON	's ditch , And drink in Tubber fair . ''

		Except in one play and that scarcely completed * Synge celebrated , not the kings and queens of old
Ireland	LOCATION	, but tinkers who guzzle and swear , and tie up priests in sacks ; blind beggars ; a playboy , or '' sport , '' who is acclaimed a hero for having killed his own father , and loses caste only on being proved a liar .

		The love-making of these pitilessly rendered types is , withal , as romantic as their oaths are eloquent .

		Romance was never more insistently demanded by a sophisticated public than by these simple-minded characters themselves .

		Pegeen , the publican 's daughter , rejects her most promising suitor for no better reason than that he is '' a mid - dling kind of a scarecrow , with no savagery or fine words in him at all . ''

		The blind beggars of '' The Well of the Saints '' are satisfied , `` smelling the things growing up , and budding from the earth , '' sniffing the furze sprouting on the hill , and hearing the lambs of Grianan , `` though it 's near drowned their crying is with the full river making noises in the glen .

		`` f To find such irrepressible poetry and nature-love as penetrates this prose , or so unbound an imagination , or such ceaseless conflict of native idealism with base realities ,
John Synge	PERSON	's readers must journey back to the Elizabethan drama at its most fiery .

		One remembers
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's tribute to Celtic romance : '' full of exquisite touches , showing how deeply nature lets him -LRB- the Celt -RRB- into her secrets . ''

		And yet , spontaneous , ebullient even , as his plays are , the preface to
Synge	PERSON	's `` Playboy , '' to which I have referred , does , however , very perfectly develop one line of theory .

		The playwright confines himself to discussing dialogue . ''

		When I was writing ' The Shadow of the Glen , ' some years ago , '' he tells us , '' I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying , that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen . ''

		The anecdote is not reproduced simply for the light * ''
Deirdre	PERSON	of the Sorrows '' : A Play in Three Acts .

		By
John M. Synge	PERSON	.

		Cuala Press ,

1910	DATE	.

		The same tale out of Irish folk-lore has been treated dramatically by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, and others : and as a narrative by Lady
Gregory	PERSON	and by
William Sharp	ORGANIZATION	.

		Synge 's play was given its first performance at the Abbey Theatre ,
Dublin	LOCATION	, in
January	DATE	of this year .

		Since then it has been performed by the same Irish players in
London	LOCATION	.

		t '' The Well of the Saints , '' a comedy in two acts , was published -LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1905	DATE	-RRB- by
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 it casts upon one author 's processes , nor yet because it reminds us of Moliere and his
Laforet	PERSON	; it serves to point out the happy chance that made of Synge an Irish playwright , not a Londoner , or a cosmo - politanised Yankee .

		Yes , in
Ireland	LOCATION	two languages are spoken : one of them
Ireland	LOCATION	's by birthright , the second , falsely called English , falsely , since this monument , though the bricks are English , was planned by Irish architects , and is quite unlike any - thing of English construction .

		Such a monument is Synge 's .

		And , in finding new words for great themes , in this age when thought and words alike are all impotently stereotyped , as it were , a tremend - ous service is accomplished for English speech itself , as well as for the stage .

		It is not merely that homely phrases are used the combinations of fisher-folk and farmers .

		It is that they are used without a loss of dignity , where dignity is demanded .

		The purely ridiculous , is , for that matter , never aimed at ; even in the most boisterous of the comedies .

		Synge 's humor , like all of humor that is ripest and best , is a shade too sad for noisy mirth .

		As for his language , and its freshness , it is worth our while to read on in that preface of which a word has already been spoken . ''

		In a good play , ''
Synge	PERSON	writes there , '' every speech should be as fully flav - ored as a nut or apple , and such speeches can not be written by anyone who works among people who have shut their eyes on poetry . ''

		And yet , if
Ireland	LOCATION	alone , of English-speaking lands , still uses '' for a few years more '' a speech that is , by turns , fiery and magnificent and tender , even
Ireland	LOCATION	shows no writers who share with
Synge	PERSON	that fully flavored diction .

		As for the greater world , and the litera - ture of towns , the linguistic sweetness of a Mallarme or a Huymans lacks -LRB- as Synge himself expressed it -RRB- roots in the profound and common interests of life , while the realities of an Ibsen or Zola are coined in words joyless and pallid .

		The one thing is , however , no less essential than the other : the reality , and what Synge called '' joy , '' what
Hazlitt	PERSON	called ' gusto . ''

		The dead playwright had them both .

		True , the casual visitor to
Ireland	LOCATION	may complain that never did he hear peasants use speech so telling as
Synge	PERSON	's and that these peasants of the dramatist 's make no discrimination between the natural and the super - natural .

		Yet
Synge	PERSON	drew his peasants only after knowing them in their huts and by their hearths ; the ringing speech of his rustics is the unhackneyed speech of that people , heard and reported by a poet .

		Indeed , their imagery is no literary exercise , but is only sufficient to the expression of unshamed emo - tion .

		This language belongs by right to a race of men who speak in English , but who think in
Gaelic	LOCATION	.

		Nor do the more primitive among contemporary Irishmen and Irishwomen much more critically discriminate between the natural and the miraculous than do the persons of '' The Well of the Saints . ''

		Finally , to the sense of reality and the sense of full rich life and gusto which are found here in rare union is joined the skill of one who visualizes all that he has seen or heard of , and manages all with a hand which , seemingly careless , is none the less sure of its virtuosity .

		Whether or not Synge '' re - wrote his plays entirely perhaps twelve or thirteen times , '' * I have no personal knowledge ; but not for nothing went those
Paris	LOCATION	years of study and experi - ment .

		To-day , few Americans know the vigorous and racy Speech of
Synge	PERSON	's ; his strong nationalism and scarcely less strong regionalism ; his grasp of character generally , and of the Celtic character first of all .

		Have I conveyed to some few readers the invitation directly to interest themselves in
John Synge	PERSON	in his fearlessness without gross ness , his tenderness without sentimentality , his untamed energy of action and his rare pungency of phrase ?

		It was denied to Synge to live long enough to gain an international audience in his own lifetime ; and he died without achieving all the good work he promised to do in a world he loved well , in spite of seeing it clearly .

		But so far as he went , he walked firmly ; there need be offered for his fulfil - ment no word of apology .

		Nor can we mean any - thing to him , now , we and our enthusiam : in spite of all that he may mean to us .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE PENDING ENGLISH COPYRIGHT BILL contains one clause of preeminent importance , the others re - lating to details of comparatively minor significance .

		By the statute of
1842	DATE	, which is still in force , the term of copyright is at present forty-two years , or the lifetime of the author and seven years thereafter , whichever period shall be the longer .

		If the new bill is passed the term will be the lifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter , in accordance with the recommendations of the
Berlin	LOCATION	Convention of
1909	DATE	.

		This term is now in force in
Austria	LOCATION	, Bel - gium ,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	; while
Italy	LOCATION	grants copyright protection for the author 's lifetime or for forty years , whichever term be the longer ;
Germany	LOCATION	for the author 's lifetime and thirty years ;
Spain	LOCATION	for the author 's lifetime and eighty years .

		The proposed English law would apply to citizens or residents of the kingdom or empire , and to citizens of states in copyright rela - tions with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It would be for the Crown to ascertain whether this country , under its statute of
1909	DATE	, is granting such copyright protection to British subjects as to entitle it to claim the protec - tion of the proposed law for its own citizens .

		Not unnaturally or unjustly would our manufacturing requirements and other petty restrictions be con - sidered as barring us from the copyright privileges extended to other nations .

		Deplorable and humili - ating is it that this country , because of its absurd * See

		THE PASSING OF A NOTED RHETORICIAN was chronicled in the death , on
Christmas	DATE	day , of Pro- fessor
Adams Sherman Hill of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		How many a student of that admirable textbook , Hill 's '' Rhetoric , '' has fondly dreamed of writing his way to fame by a careful observance of those beautiful laws so clearly laid down and so aptly illustrated by the author !

		If it were not for the embarrassing necessity of having something to say before one can write with both power and correctness , Professor Hill would have created a multitude of eminent authors .

		In addition to his `` Principles of Rhetoric , '' which appeared in
1878	DATE	, and in a revised edition seventeen years later , he wrote '' Our En - glish , '' `` The Foundations of Rhetoric , '' and an elementary textbook of rhetoric and composition .

		Born in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1833	DATE	of good ancestry on both sides , he struggled along for five years under the distasteful Christian name of Abijah , but was re - lieved of the incubus by legislative enactment in
1838	DATE	.

		Harvard was , naturally enough , his college , and the law his first profession , which was early dropped for journalism , which in tnrn yielded to the more dignified attractions of the professorial chair .

		Assistant professor of rhetoric at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	from
1872	DATE	to
1876	DATE	, he was made Boylston profes - sor of rhetoric and oratory in the latter year , and professor emeritus in
1904	DATE	.

		To have held the Boylston professorship of rhetoric , to the teachings from which famous chair so many of our celebrated earlier writers have acknowledged their indebted - ness , is surely glory enough for any man .

		MR.
SHAW	PERSON	POKES FUN AT SHAKESPEARE , and gratifies his well-known desire to dig up Shake - speare 's bones and throw stones at them , in the recently acted and more recently published one-act farce , ' `` The Dark Lady of the Sonnets . ''

		The humor of this latest Shavian drama can hardly equal the humor of its being presented as part of a benefit performance in aid of the projected Na - tional Shakespearean Memorial Theatre .

		The real if not the ostensible motive of the play can not be mistaken as a desire to make Shakespeare ridiculous by representing him as a snapper-up of other men 's good sayings , a picker of other men 's brains .

		In the opening scene a warder on the terrace at White - hall Palace , whither
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has come to keep an appointment with
Mary Fitton	PERSON	, the Dark Lady of the Sonnets , happens to utter the phrase , `` Angels and ministers of grace defend us ! ''

		Thereupon Shakespeare : ''
Well	PERSON	said ,
Master Warder	ORGANIZATION	.

		With your leave I will set that down in writing ; for I have a very poor and unhappy brain for remem - brance ... Stare not so amazedly at me ; but mark what I say .

		I keep tryst here to-night with a dark lady .

		She proposed to bribe the warder .

		I gave her the wherewithal ; four tickets for the Globe Theatre . ''

		The Warder : `` Plague on her !

		She gave me only two . ''

		Shakespeare -LRB- detaching a tablet -RRB- : '' My friend , present this tablet , and you will be admitted at any time when the plays of Will Shakespeare are in hand .

		Bring your wife .

		Bring your friends .

		Bring the whole garrison .

		There is ever plenty of room . ''

		The broad humor , not to say horse-play , of the piece is in harmony with its author 's published expressions of modified admiration for the author of '' Hamlet . ''

		The play may be read in full in the
January	DATE	number of '' The Red Book . ''

		THE INANITY OF OUR CURRENT DRAMA receives scathing condemnation at the hands of Professor
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsyl	ORGANIZATION	- vania , the well-known student of the early English stage .

		Induced in an idle moment to transfer his attention to the American stage of a quarter-millen - nium later , he decided it to be the part of wisdom for him still to remain two centuries and a half behind the times . ''

		Our popular drama of to-day , '' he affirmed in a recent public address , '' is vulgar , flippant , and inane ; as a picture of life it is for the most part absurd .

		It would be difficult to find an art of any former degenerate age so devoid of ideas , so repetitious and preposterous , as the popular syndicated stage of to-day . ''

		Nor is it all to be accounted for by '' commercialism , the want of an educational and established theatre , and the in - herited antipathy of the godly . '' ''

		There are hun - dreds who sit in open-eyed wonder before the glitter of tinsel decking a bevy of painted ' stage ladies ' to one who could follow a dialogue of any subtlety with understanding .

		This is why our theatrical plots revolve in tedious repetition about the thirteen original situations , none of them original any longer , and why we continue to perpetrate on the stage , with bland , unblushing iteration , the eleven ances - tral witticims . ''

		And yet the time-honored '' situ - ations '' have lost none of their virtue , given only a man of genius to infuse them with fresh life and interest .

		It is the new treatment of the old and familiar that the story-reader and the theatre-goer will always delight in , even as each man 's life is of significance and worth to him just so far as it is a fresh presentation of universal experience .

		Shake - speare 's '' situations '' were almost without exception already old in his own day , and scores of Greek tragedies were based on the calamitous history of a single family .

		... COLONEL

		And it is the same with the questions of to-day .

		They will look simple enough a generation hence , per - haps , although they do not look simple to us to - day .

		... It is impossible to tell how our present problems will be settled , but I am satisfied that the future is safe . ''

		And this hopeful outlook is taken even though the speaker is fully aware that `` our civilization is vastly more complicated to-day than it was sixty years ago . ''

FRANCE	LOCATION	ON THE QUESTION OF WOMEN ` IMMORTALS '' says some things of interest to a writer in '' Le Temps . ''

		In view of
Madame Curie	ORGANIZATION	's reported desire to become a member of the
august	DATE	body into whose assembly-room no petticoated person is at present allowed to so much as peep , what her distinguished compatriot has to say concerning the election of women to membership will not fail to command attention . ''

		Yes , '' he declares , `` I should call it perfectly legitimate for the Acaddmie to elect women of talent and quality .

		Nothing seems to me more logical and traditional , and among the reasons that arise in my mind , as I examine the question without previous reflection , I see this argument at once : the very purpose of the Acade ` rnie Francaise .

		What is that purpose ?

		Unquestionably this : To conserve Beauty and Tradition in
France	LOCATION	, to repre - sent genius and good manners , to associate them in a select company who thus incarnate the eminent qualities of this country , or at least what its founders believed to be its essential virtues .

		Now , woman is no stranger to good manners or French traditions ; and a woman of talent , of nobility , of supreme dis - tinction , may well deserve a place in the company who , in the eyes of certain people , represent the flower of the French virtues . ''

		That a country which has produced a
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	, a SeVign , a Re ` camier , a
Roland	LOCATION	, a George Sand , and , finally , a scientist like
Madame Curie	PERSON	, should seriously con - sider the propriety of creating academiciennes , is scarcely surprising .

Asquith	PERSON	and Mr.

		Referring to his study of a volume of `` The New England Re - view '' for 1830-31 , Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	said , as reported in the press : '' While it was edited by

		The signature was the odd one , '

''

		The recent annual blue-book report of the
London	LOCATION	commissioner of police reveals a great variety of talents and accomplishments among the eighteen thousand quiet and gentlemanly guardians of the law in that vast metropolis , but contains no mention of any such critical taste and power of literary ex - pression as are possessed by Sergeant Quackenbos of

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, THE LIFE OF AX EMPIRE-BUILDER .

		* The flood of hasty biographies and other sketches of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	that was let loose by his death in the
spring of 1902	DATE	has long since subsided , and the season has arrived for a more deliberate and careful chronicling of the life - history of that remarkable man .

		A detailed ac - count of him and his phenomenal achievements as financier and empire-builder is presented in Sir
Lewis Michell	PERSON	's two-volume work , '' The Life and Times of the Right
Honourable Cecil John Rhodes	PERSON	, '' and simultaneously a personally reminiscent view of the man in his prime , as he was known to one much older than he but interested in the same problems of public policy and statesmanship , comes from the pen of Sir
Thomas E. Fuller	PERSON	in his volume entitled `` The Right
Honourable Cecil John Rhodes	PERSON	: a Mono - graph and a Reminiscence . ''

		South Africans both of them , these two authors have brought together enough details to make up a fairly complete portrait of their former friend and associate , painted however , as was to be ex - pected , with every advantage of a favorable light and a becoming posture , and with the almost inevitable softening of harsher lines .

		The main events of
Rhodes	LOCATION	's public life have long been too familiar to the world to render necessary here any recapitulation of them .

		Less stale and far more interesting will be a few glimpses of the inner workings of his mind , in boyhood and manhood , so far as they can be discerned , and an attempt to get clearly before us the ideals that inspired him and sustained him amidst the herculean labors he imposed on himself from an early age .

		That the two works above named furnish the material for forming a just estimate of the largeness of his ideals and of the vigor and originality of the mind that entertained them , will not be doubted when it is learned that the first-named of his biographers , as an executor and trustee under the will of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, has had free access to his private papers , while the other was on terms of some - * THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CECIL

		thing like intimacy with him for more than twenty years .

		Sir
Lewis Michell	PERSON	makes his hero 's '' dream of Empire '' so early take possession of his thoughts that even as a child in plaided frock at Bishop 's Stortford -LRB- where he was born in
1853	DATE	, being the fifth of nine sons presented to the Reverend
Francis William Rhodes	PERSON	by his second wife ,
Louisa Peacock	PERSON	, a lady of good family -RRB- , he is conceived of as already planning enterprises of imperial scope .

		At any rate , it appears true that he was early given to periods of abstraction , that the ordinary pursuits of his fellows failed to engross him , that when once interested in any project his concentration of thought and energy was remarkable , and that , as his biographer says , '' to the last he was a shy and solitary spirit , full of strange silences , and with a reserve difficult to break through . ''

		Early symptoms of the ailment that finally over - came him sent the boy
Cecil	PERSON	in
1870	DATE	to
Natal	LOCATION	, where an elder brother was already breaking virgin soil as a cotton planter .

		The compara - tive loneliness of the new life and the vastness of the new lands open to colonization and con - quest could not but favor the nursing of any projects of empire that the young English im - migrant may have been disposed to cherish .

		The discovery of diamonds in the
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	about the time of his arrival in
South Africa	LOCATION	, with the subsequent opening of large diamond-bearing tracts to the inrushing miners , must have still further inflamed the youth 's imagination .

		Seeing clearly the power of money to forward his schemes of British dominion , he very soon forsook the humdrum of farming and engaged in the fierce excitement of diamond - hunting , buying and selling claims , forming and consolidating mining companies , and in a won - derfully short space of time proving himself the coolest , boldest , most successful of all that host of strenuous and not too scrupulous wealth - seekers .

		Side by side with these plans of wealth and power , and rudely jostled by them , one would think , there were entertained other projects and wholly different ideals .

		When in the autumn of
1871	DATE	young
Rhodes	PERSON	turned his back on farm - ing and started for
Colesberg Kopje	ORGANIZATION	in a Scotch cart drawn by a yoke of oxen , he carried with him , beside a bucket and spade , several volumes of the classics and a Greek lexicon surely the strangest outfit known to the mining fraternity .

		An
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	course and an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	degree were what the boy had set himself to obtain ; not that he was consumed with any burning thirst for
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 academic knowledge , so far as can be judged , nor that he felt irresistibly drawn to the classics of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, but because he had calmly reasoned the matter out and decided that an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	degree would help him in the path he had marked out for himself .

		The charm of the ancient university , and the value of associa - tions there formed by the undergraduate , he felt and acknowledged to the full ; and throughout his life any reminder of his college days was sure to move him .

		The course at
Oxford	LOCATION	, much in - terrupted by necessary visits to
South Africa	LOCATION	, was at last completed and the coveted diploma obtained ; and the college -LRB-
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that had con - sented to receive so irregular a student , after he had elsewhere been repulsed , profited thereby in due time , to the extent of one hundred thou - sand pounds .

		The story of the
Rhodes	LOCATION	scholar - ships , a fitting sequel to the tale , is now of course an old one .

		The young diamond-digger 's sublime confi - dence in his future is splendidly attested in the magniloquent terms of a will that he caused to be drawn as early as
1877	DATE	, when he was but twenty-four years old .

		In this remarkable document he leaves his entire estate -LRB- before he has acquired it -RRB- to
Lord Carnarvon	LOCATION	, then Secre - tary of State for the Colonies , and to his suc - cessors in office , and to his friend
Sidney Godolphin Shippard	PERSON	of the Inner Temple , '' in Trust , '' the purpose of the trust being , as formally stated , '' to and for the establishment , promotion , and development of a Secret So - ciety , the true aim and object whereof shall be the extension of British rule throughout the world , the perfecting of a system of emigration from the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, and of colonization by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy , labor , and enterprise , and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of
Africa	LOCATION	, the Holy Land , the Valley of the
Euphrates	LOCATION	, the Islands of
Cyprus	LOCATION	and
Candia	PERSON	, the whole of
South America	LOCATION	, '' and so on , leav - ing scarcely a square foot of the uninhabited or uncivilized globe to other countries , and even providing for the '' ultimate recovery of the
United States of America	LOCATION	as an integral part of the British Empire , '' and , best of all , seeking '' finally , the foundation of so great a Power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity . ''

		Of
Rhodes	ORGANIZATION	's political honors and offices in the
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and of his amazing success in amassing a fortune , with all the interesting and intricate intertwining of his political and his money-getting schemes and activities , nothing can here be said .

		Sir
Lewis Michell	PERSON	's book goes into all that quite adequately , and the shorter work of
Sir Thomas Fuller	ORGANIZATION	contains some additional particulars .

		The famous Jame - son Raid figures also as an important topic in ttoth books , the first-mentioned devoting nearly fifty pages to it and ending with the assertion that `` the idea prevalent in some quarters that the inception of the
Raid	ORGANIZATION	is still wrapped in mystery is wholly erroneous .

		The vital facts are all in print , and there are no unrevealed secrets . ''

		The two authors agree in making Rhodes by no means free from responsibility in the affair , but its importance as precipitating the Boer War is emphatically denied by one of them .

		Touching on the much - discussed ''
Kruger	PERSON	telegram '' from the German Emperor at the time of the raid ,
Sir Lewis	PERSON	has this to offer respecting the subsequent interview between
Rhodes	PERSON	and his Imperial Majesty : '' I imagine that a verbatim report of the interview between
Rhodes	PERSON	and the
Emperor	ORGANIZATION	will never see the light of day , bat there is reason to believe that during their conversation the Emperor asked for his opinion of his famous '
Kruger	PERSON	telegram ' at the time of the Raid , and that
Rhodes	PERSON	replied , ' I will tell you , your Majesty , in a very few words .

		It was the greatest mistake you ever made in your life , but you did me the best turn one man ever did another .

		You see , I was a naughty boy , and you tried to whip me .

		Now , my peo - ple were quite ready to whip me for being a naughty boy , but directly you did it , they said , '' No , if this is anybody 's business it is ours . ''

		The result was that your Majesty got yourself very much disliked by the English people , and I never got whipped at all ! ' ''

		An interesting consequence of this momentous interview , and a substantial proof of the favor - j able impression then made upon his South African guest by the
Kaiser	PERSON	, was the inclusion of
Germany	LOCATION	among the
Rhodes Scholarship	ORGANIZATION	beneficiaries , and the leaving of the selection of German Rhodes scholars entirely in his Majesty 's hands .

		So , at least , we are led to believe .

		Turning from the larger work , whose author does not hesitate to acclaim his hero as '' the greatest of modern Englishmen , '' we must say a few words in commendation of the smaller .

		Its evidences of the intimate acquaintance en - joyed by its author with
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	give it unquestioned value and vivid interest to the reader .

		Let us quote from an early page its description of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	: '' Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	was a tall , broad-shouldered man , with face and figure of somewhat loose formation .

		His hair was auburn , carelessly flung over his forehead , his eyes of bluish grey , dreamy but kindly .

		But the mouth aye , that was ' the unruly member ' of his face .

		With 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, deep lines following the curve of the moustache , it had a determined , masterful , and sometimes scornful ex - pression .

		Men can not , of course , think or feel with their mouths , but the thoughts of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	soon found their way to that part of his face .

		At its best it expressed determined purpose at its worst , well , I have seen storms of passion gather about it and twist it into unlovely shapes .

		Neither sculptor nor painter knew just what to do with it . ''

		The indifference to small matters always shown by this large-patterned man is refreshing to read about .

		In dress , while he was at home in any costume , he took so slight heed of con - vention and fashion that , unless watched and warned by careful friends , he would many a time have shocked Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	by appearing in
Scotch	LOCATION	tweeds where broadcloth was de rigueur .

		The account of his home life and bachelor habits at
Groote Schuur	ORGANIZATION	is agreeable reading , and the description of his library , where at great expense he had collected all the authorities consulted by
Gibbon	PERSON	in writing his '' Decline and Fall , '' forms one of the best chapters in the book .

		With its emphasis on the human and the more lovable side of the man , this fragmentary account of him admirably sup - plements the longer and more ambitious work .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A CRITICISM OF MODERN ART .

		* Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	has produced , in '' The New Laokobn , '' a delightful and stimulating book .

		I recall nothing in recent years in the literature of aesthetics which is of the same interest .

		It has the charm of a broad view of historical changes and conditions , and the value of a soundly developed thought on matters of theory .

		It is an excellent book for people who feel mixed up or puzzled at the chaotic condition of ideals now current in music , painting , litera - ture ; who want a clue to find their way out of the labyrinth of dissolving views offered us by the latest excitements in each of the arts .

		And those who are not puzzled , and who like the excitement of constant experiment and change , will be interested in this effort to make matters a little more regular and systematic .

		Even the most extravagant may well enjoy this survey of their eccentricities , though they may not sym - pathize with the spirit which animates it .

		The Laokoon of
Lessing	LOCATION	, although a book of unique position , has not been so powerful an influence as a good many works which in * THE NEW LAOKOON .

		An Essay on the Confusion of the Arts .

		By
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		themselves could not claim the same eminence .

		There are many books or many critics , to be more exact that have impressed themselves on men 's minds and action far more powerfully .


Ruskin	PERSON	has been a far more powerful influence than
Lessing	PERSON	, I should say ; and so has
Taine	PERSON	.

		Indeed , one could count a score of rivals begin - ning with
Winckelmann	PERSON	or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and coming down to
Morelli	PERSON	and
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		The chief idea of
Lessing	PERSON	that was expressed in the
Laokobn	LOCATION	, the distinction between the functions of the different arts , was not heeded .

		On the other hand , the period following
Lessing	PERSON	shows very great confusion between the aims and methods of the different arts , and very great enthusiasm in trying to make all the arts only different ways of doing the same things .

		Poets have emulated painters , and musicians poets .

		Painters have in general been content to paint ; but even among the painters there have been those who aimed at symphonies on the one hand , and those who were anxious to tell stories on the other .

		The immense production of art in the nineteenth century has resulted in an almost intoxicated delight in trying to do anything and everything with every or any art and in any and every way .

		It is this continued confusion and grand hurly burly that gives occasion to Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	for his survey of the conditions of artistic theory as we see it in the work of art since
Lessing	PERSON	, and for his presentation of some critical can - ons designed to offer , if not a shelter in the time of storm , at least a breathing-space in a time of general artistic exhilaration and excitement .

		I think such an effort will be greeted with pleasure by many .

		The mere idea of there being such a book will , I am sure , be a relief to not a few who may never read it .

		There surely must be many who would be glad to stop looking at some grey thing of
Whistler	LOCATION	's and trying to find any symphony or any white in it , who would be glad to stop thinking they ought to find in
Strauss	LOCATION	anything philosophic or like
Nietzsche	PERSON	, people who will like to stop skip - ping passages on persons or landscapes which mention all the colors of the rainbow but do not enable us to see any , or who will be glad to think it respectable to read a story or see a play that has no problem or message or criticism of life in it .

		Lessing failed to impress his contention upon the generations that followed him .

		He had a clear idea that there were definite forms of art which owed their charm and their power to being themselves and not something else .

		He
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 spoke of the arts of poetry and painting , and distinguished between their possibilities ; but his understanding of what each should do or could do was based upon his understanding of what both tried to do .

		He believed that poetry must deal with things as viewed in the relation of time , and that painting should deal with them as they appeared in space ; but he held that both should present an imitation of nature .

		And , further , he was a classicist , in that he believed in having things clear-cut , rational , definite .

		To him , the main thing in poetry was a well-ordered fable ; in painting , a well-ordered composition .

		It is not unnatural , then , that a century like the nineteenth , in which the classic tradition was by no means binding in which , in fact , the rejection of classic aims and methods was almost an aim in itself , that such a time should have lost sight of the distinction whereby one might attain to classic result .

		Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	finds the key to all this confu - sion of effort and effect in the influence of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		Rousseau exalts the imagination ; and one penetrated with the spirit of
Rousseau	PERSON	, though he might be devoted to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, would scarcely endure the discipline of imitating or following her closely .

		It is not a picture of the world that romantic art is to give us : it is a record of the sensations of the romanticist as he views the world , and such a record of sensa - tions may easily stimulate our powers even to things that never were or could be in the world .

		The romanticist had not so much in mind to give an idea of what others were doing or had done as to stimulate one to do some - thing oneself or to think of doing it . ''

		His aim , '' in Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	's words , '' is not so much to paint action as to suggest reverie . ''

		In following out this idea , Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	deals especially with two directions of nineteenth century art , namely , word-painting and pro- gramme music , and handles them in a broad and excellent way .

		Programme music is some - thing which some think is the only music , and some think hardly music at all .

		It would cer - tainly seem that the fact that few people as a rule can tell what the music means unless they have the programme in hand or in mind , would make it doubtful if music was here dealing with what music could deal with ; but Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	presents many interesting examples , of which the one I like best is that of the man who was enthusiastic over the way that the master had indicated in his tone-poem '' the whistling of the wind through the arms of a mill , but was told that what the master had really tried to render in this passage was the bleating of a flock of sheep ! ''

		Word painting includes the whole range of suggestive prose , as well as much modern poetry , where the idea of the writer is not to convey any definite idea of something he has seen or known , but to stimulate in the reader an imaginative range more or less like that which he experiences himself .

		We do not need to be told how im - portant these two forces have been in nine - teenth century art .

		Even more important , because the element is more penetrating , is Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	's discussion of the question of form and expression .

		Ro - manticism is lyric , in that it has always honored self-expression : even the realists who believed in the most detailed views of environment allowed that such views must be modified by the artist 's temperament .

		And here Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	speaks of the novel , the most prolific if not the most important of the art-forms of the century : he says it is the form '' that lends itself most naturally to all the meanders of feeling , '' to a vast overflow of '' soul '' in the romantic sense .

		But he is satisfied with suggesting this oppor - tunity for the triumph of expression over form -LRB- and certainly anybody can think of enough examples -RRB- , and deals for the most part with scientific or philosophic manifestations of the same thing in nineteenth century thought .

		It is certainly a most interesting review , * and , as I have said , there must be many who will want to read it .

		It is a book that has some - thing for various classes of readers .

		Those who know the subject well will find it inter - esting , with much to agree or disagree with .

		Such a view of periods in literature or art is always interesting when done by a competent man , and we have here the addition of a theo - retical position on a burning question .

		But the book is by no means a mass of generaliza - tions ; in fact , Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	more commonly deals with special cases .

		So there will be many who will not be so much interested in the sweeps of aesthetic theory , who will be inter - ested in considering whether sky-scrapers are beautiful .

		Indeed , perhaps the ranging of many minor points into one general discussion is quite as valuable for the general reader as the making of large generalizations .

		What shall we think , for instance , of the vitality and ugliness of much * In what goes before 1 have allowed myself as a rule to use Mr.

		Was he all Greek ?

		Is the subject of

		What did Beethoven try to do in the '' Pastoral Symphony '' ?

		And so on .

		Those things , or others of the same kind , are such things as people often argue about , with no idea of any principle to give them a starting-point .

		Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	's survey of romantic art gives them at least something to agree or disagree on .

		I have said but little , perhaps not enough , of the constructive part of this book .

		It is evident from the title that Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	believes that art can do most for the human spirit when each art does that for which it is especially adapted .

		The greater part of the essay is devoted to a con - sideration of what has happened when every artist did whatever he fancied at the moment .

		But the last part of the essay is more construc - tive , and presents something of an ideal of a right joining of appropriate form and genuine expression .

		The reader with some tincture of aesthetic will probably find this part of the book most interesting .

		Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	stands for an ideal of Humanism that is growing in charm every day ; though , as he admits , it can not even now see the prospect of early dominance .

		I wish him good luck !

		I must confess that I do n't quite know whether I agree with him or not .

		I am just now rather confused in my ideas in aesthetics .

		But I can at least appre - ciate such a brilliant and original study as this , even though it tries to overturn some of my favorites .

		history .

		In previous volumes he has pictured in detail the economic and social aspects of early times in the Old Dominion ; while in these two large volumes of 700 pages each he describes those institutions and conditions with which he has not already dealt .

		The work is therefore confined to a description of the politi - cal and administrative phases of colonial his - tory .

		But governmental activities had a wide range in those days , even though in a frontier community ; and they are here described in 125 chapters which are arranged to cover the five general subjects of Religion and Morals , Education ,
Legal Administration	ORGANIZATION	, Military System , and
Political Condition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each subject is treated exhaustively , with a wealth of fact and illustration that may be somewhat weari - some to the general reader but will be eagerly welcomed by the student and the historian who may use this work , and the previous volumes , as the ultimate authority on the period treated .

		Nothing of importance has been neglected , and much that would be unimportant in the history of a later time is here developed at length as throwing light on the formative period of the first Anglo-American colony .

		None of the sources have been overlooked ; the author says that he has made '' a personal examination of all the original documents bearing on the sub - ject preserved not only in this country but in the great English depositories . ''

		The work will be valuable not only for the immense amount of information which it contains , but also for the general conclusions not too many at which the author arrives after his thorough examination of the sources .

		Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	looks upon his subject from the imperialistic the British point of view , not from the narrowly colonial standpoint ; that is , he considers seventeenth century
Virginia	LOCATION	as an outlying district of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, an expansion of
England	LOCATION	in men , in manners and customs , and in institutions .

		The English inheritances were modified , though not radically , by the necessities of a frontier environment , and not by intention .

		No other of the Anglo-American colonies was so like Mother
England	LOCATION	.

		The author says of this fact : '' In considering retrospectively the different condi - tions prevailing in
Virginia	LOCATION	during the seventeenth century , the historian is deeply impressed with its close resemblance in all the varied aspects of its life , save the agricultural alone , to the mother country .

		The colony had been settled , not , like
New England	LOCATION	, by the representatives of a single section of the English people , namely , those in sympathy with a special phase of relig - ious belief and its austere social influences , but by rep -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 resentatives of the English people at large , who were profoundly devoted to the monarchical principles , to the doctrines of the Anglican Church , and to the liberal and generous social traditions of their race .

		The con - ditions observed in
Virginia	LOCATION	were , as a consequence , much nearer to those which , in these early times , gave a distinctive character to an English community ; it was much more a segment of the mother country , because more reflective of the typical diversities of life and thought there , indeed , it can be justly said that Vir - ginia , in the seventeenth century , resembled
England	LOCATION	as closely as it was possible for a sparsely settled colony of small wealth , situated in a remote quarter of the globe , to do . ''

		In nothing did the colony resemble
England	LOCATION	more than in its religions establishment and in its moral standards .

		The church organization , with its parish , vestry , tithes , and glebe , was the Anglican establishment on a small scale ; the chief but important difference being that the clergymen held their places not permanently , but by the year , at the pleasure of the vestry .

		Of the beginning of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in
English America	LOCATION	, the author gives some details of in - terest .

		The first church edifice consisted of a sailcloth tied to the trunks of trees . ''

		As thus spread out , it afforded an ample shelter from the rays of the sun .

		The walls of this impover - ished sacred edifice were made of rails mauled from timber procured on the spot ; the seats , of round and unhewed logs ; and the pulpit , of a bar of wood nailed to two trees .

		When the sky became overcast and rain fell , the services were held in a large tent brought over from
England	LOCATION	... -LSB- The second church -RSB- was made apparently of rough sawn planks or unhewed logs , in the shape of a barn ; the roof was covered with rafts , sedge , and earth ; and so , we are informed , were the walls ; while the weight of the whole rude structure rested upon crotchets . ''

		Church-going was enforced by law , and any breaches of morality were punished by severe penalties .

		After careful study , Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	con - cludes that on the whole the
Virginia	LOCATION	clergy were not generally '' of loose lives and ungodly conversation , '' but averaged as good as those of
England	LOCATION	at the same time , and that the people were religious , and more moral than their En - glish contemporaries .

		Since the Church was a department of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, the activity of the government in ecclesiastical affairs is fully described .

		The following quotations show that
New England	LOCATION	had no monopoly of stringent church rules : '' Whoever omitted going to church was punished for the first offence by the loss of his day 's allowance ; for the second , by a severe whipping ; and for the third , by his condemnation to the galleys for a period of six months .

		Profanation of God 's name by an unlawful oath was , for the second offence , to be punished with a bodkin 's thrust through the tongue ; and for the third , with death ; and the penalty of death also was to be paid by whoever stole one of the sacred articles belong - ing to the church building ... During the seventeenth century the supervision exercised by the authorities to ensure a proper observance of the Sabbath was , in some respects , quite as strict in
Virginia	LOCATION	as it was in
New England	LOCATION	, where the stern and austere code of the
Puri	PERSON	- tans was so rigidly enforced in all the departments of life .

		Even the most trivial violations of the sacred character of the day were invariably punished ; and this seems all the more remarkable in a community where all the amusements and pleasures within the people 's reach were heartily encouraged provided they were not carried to a point dangerous to the peace and moral health of society . ''

		But in time the innumerable influences of the frontier and the reaction against the formalism of the
Anglican Church	ORGANIZATION	resulted in the rise of dissent , not of the Puritan kind , for Puritanism no more than persecution could exist in such a sparsely settled region , but of the more liberal and emotional kind .

		Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	says of the cause and growth of dissent : Loyal as the great mass of the people were to the Church of
England	LOCATION	, as represented in their ministers and parish churches , there was nothing in the manner in which it imparted its religious consolations to vivify , from time to time , the religious instincts of its congre - gations in the spirit of the modern religious revival .

		Now this was precisely what the early Quakers did .

		They found in those thinly settled and remote commu - nities a population strongly disposed by their situation to religious thought , and ready to fall almost headlong into indulgence of religious emotions as soon as that chord in their hearts was touched .

		The missionaries of the sect made a direct appeal at the very heart .

		Religion dropped the formalities of the liturgy and spoke to the spirit in the language of every day .

		It became personal , urgent , irresistible .

		It is not at all improbable that nothing but the unpractical features of Quakerism prevented a far more general conversion to that faith than seems to have really occurred . ''

		The chapters on education as fostered by the government bring out new and interesting information .

		Strong public sentiment in favor of free education existed ; but this , the author shows , could not become effective because of the thinly scattered population .

		Those who were able had tutors at their homes for their children , and later sent them to
England	LOCATION	.

		Like the classic pedagogue , these tutors were frequently purchased servants .

		One colonist leaves by will a sum for the purchase of a teacher of English and Latin for his children ; another purchases one
Thomas Hellier	PERSON	, promising him that he is to be a tutor and not be required to work as a field-hand except when there is an extraordinary demand for labor and then only '' for a short spurt . ''

		A college was early pro- jected , but not until late in the century was the
College of William and Mary	ORGANIZATION	established .

		When
James Blair	PERSON	was in
England	LOCATION	in behalf of 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, a college , he represented to
Lord Seymour	PERSON	that it would help the church .

		Seymour thought a college unnecessary . ''

		But , my Lord , '' remon - strated
Blair	PERSON	, '' the colonists have souls to save . '' ''

		Souls !

		Damn their souls ! ''

		was the reply ; '' make tobacco . ''

		The greater number of the children , however , were taught the rudiments in the Old Field School . '' ''

		Such a school was established at some spot in con - venient reach of every boy and girl in a whole neigh - borhood .

		In order to insure this , it was customary to build the schoolhouse in some old field , long abandoned to pine and broom-straw , which occupied a central situa - tion ; and here , during the hours when the school session was not in progress , the building remained locked , vacant , and silent ; but during the hours of instruction it was filled with the murmurs of recitation , and the con - fused sound of whispering tongues and shuffling feet .

		From the adjacent forest came fee voices of birds sing - ing in the branches , and in
winter	DATE	the roar of the wind in the bare treetops .

		The whole scene was marked by the spirit of extreme remoteness and seclusion ; and only the presence of the shouting and dancing children in the hours of play , or the smoke curling up from the chimney in the hours of work , gave it any apparent connection with the world of human beings . ''

		By studies of the records , of wills , and of voting-lists , the author decides that the propor - tion of illiterates in the entire white population was in the
last quarter	DATE	of the century a little less than half ; but only a fourth of the women could read .

		Books , which were always valued in terms of tobacco , were somewhat plentiful , and there was a fair degree of culture .

		For defense , the colony had only the old English militia based upon the principle of the Assize of Arms ; arms and ammunition were strangely scarce , and the authorities as well as the people were sometimes very apprehensive of foreign Indian attacks , and were correspond - ingly relieved when the danger was passed .

		Governor
Berkeley	LOCATION	, in
1666	DATE	, after a threatened attack by the Dutch , wrote to
Charles II	PERSON	.

		: '' As we are further out of danger , so we approach nearer to Heaven with our prayers that your Sacred Majesty 's enemies may either drink the sea or bite the dust . ''

		The law of
Virginia	LOCATION	was the law of
England	LOCATION	in spirit and in letter ; but the court system was much simpler than the English , the proced - ure less complicated , and the justice dispensed was not only law but equity .

		Lawyers and law books were few .

		A very remarkable contrast with English conditions was the administration of criminal law .

		Where in
England	LOCATION	three hun - dred offenses were punishable by death , less than half a dozen led to the gallows in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		In the administration of criminal law the colony was a century and a half in advance of the mother country .

		But if the punishments were not brutal they were at least numerous in kind ; hanging , fine , imprisonment , the lash , the white sheet , tying neck and heels , the wooden horse , the stocks , the pillory , ducking , and public apology , are among the examples given .

		Since the jails were only ten feet by fifteen , we may assume that prisoners were few .

		Tracing the early political institutions , Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	shows that the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, which `` broke out '' in
1619	DATE	, was a natural development and not an unexpected happening .

		However , the event was of extraordinary im - portance .

		`` It was not until
1618	DATE	that the first legislative as - sembly of English-speaking people to convene in the
Western Hemisphere	LOCATION	met at
Jamestown	LOCATION	; and from that year , which was made forever memorable by this great event , to the present date , there has been no discontinu - ance in practice of the principle of popular representa - tion within the area of country covered by the modern
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		In summing up , Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	finds that in several rather important particulars
Virginia	LOCATION	was unlike
England	LOCATION	: the agricultural system was extensive , not intensive ; slave labor was a main reliance ; there was no law of primogeni - ture ; land titles were recorded , not kept in pri - vate control ; legal administration was simple ; clergy were hired by the year ; manhood suf - frage gave a democratic assembly ; public ser - vice was paid for .

		These influences tended to make a different people of the Virginians , but there were stronger ones which tended to make
Virginia	LOCATION	a new
England	LOCATION	, the common English descent of the people ; the presence of the sev - eral classes of society ; the purely English social peculiarities ; the education of leaders in Eng - land ; the Anglican establishment ; the system of large estates ; the identity of moral and relig - ious standards ; and , finally , the similarity of legal and political institutions .

		Early
Virginia	LOCATION	history is therefore the history of the successful transplanting of English institutions under con - ditions different from those of
England	LOCATION	, and of the successful development and modification of those institutions .

		Of the supreme importance of the expansion of
England	LOCATION	into
America	LOCATION	, Dr.
Bruce	PERSON	says in closing : '' If to-morrow a vast wave from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, set in motion by some appalling convulsion of nature , should sink
England	LOCATION	forever below the level of the ocean , and thus destroy the last remnant of her population and the last vestige of her cities and her fields , yet in her spirit , which represents all that is highest in nations as in individual men , she would still survive in that great power over sea , whose seed she planted , whose growth she nourished , and whose chief claim to the respect of mankind will always be in upholding those general
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 ideas of law , government , and morality , which its peo - ple inherited from the little island lying like an emerald in the stormy seas of the North .

		From this point of view , the foundation of
Jamestown	LOCATION	becomes the greatest of all events in the modern history of the Anglo-Saxon race , and one of the very greatest in the history of the world .

		From this point of view also the conditions prevailing in colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	the foremost and most powerful of all of the English dependencies of that day , and the one which adopted the English principles and ideas most thoroughly , and was most successful in disseminating them becomes of supreme interest ; for from these conditions was to
spring	DATE	the characteristic spirit of one of the greatest of modern nationalities ; and from these conditions was to arrive a permanent guarantee that , whatever might be the fate of
England	LOCATION	herself , the Anglo-Saxon conception of social order , poli - tical freedom , individual liberty , and private morality , should not perish from the face of the earth . ''


WALTER L. FLEMING	PERSON	.

		A FAMOTJS PUBLISHER OF THE 18TH Most students of the drama and of eighteenth - century poetry are familiar with
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Col	PERSON	- lection of Plays '' and '' Collection of Poems , '' usually called `` Dodsley 's Miscellany '' ; but many people will be surprised to learn how important
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	was in his own generation , not only as a publisher but as a poet and playwright .

		It is strange that a man so prominent in the literary circles of
London	LOCATION	between
1735	DATE	and
1764	DATE	the friend of Pope , of
Shenstone	LOCATION	, of
Johnson	PERSON	, of the Wartons , of Bishop
Percy	PERSON	, and publisher for all of them should have been so neglected by literary his - torians .

		But it is so ; for
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	has received only casual mention even from the men who know that period best .

		It is a pleasure , therefore , to find that Mr.
Ralph Straus	PERSON	, the author of ''
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	, Poet , Publisher , and Playwright , '' has not only made a welcome contribution to the history of English literature in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, but has done an exceptionally careful and satisfactory piece of work .

		Dodsley began his literary career in
1729	DATE	, with '' Servitude , a Poem ... Written by a Foot - man , '' and if one came upon only that work , or its successor of
1732	DATE	, '' A Muse in Livery : or the
Footman	PERSON	's Miscellany , '' one might be ex - cused for thinking him merely another mildly interesting phenomenon , like
Taylor	PERSON	the Water Poet , or Stephen Duck the Thresher Poet .

		But Dodsley published , in
February , 1735	DATE	, his *

		By
Ralph Straus	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Toy-shop , a Dramatick Satire , '' which went into a fourth edition in
April	DATE	, and a sixth before the year was out ; moreover , the '' Toy-Shop '' was popular on the stage of both the theatres . ''

		The King and the
Miller	PERSON	of
Mansfield	LOCATION	, '' which followed in
1737	DATE	, was a favorite on the stage for many years .

		In
1740	DATE	came his '' Chronicle of the Kings of
England	LOCATION	, '' in style a parody of the
Bible	LOCATION	; and in
1750	DATE	, '' The CEconomy of Human Life , '' a series of maxims .

		All of these went through numerous editions and translations , and must have been among the '' best sellers '' of their time .

		Dodsley 's tragedy of ''
Cleone	PERSON	, '' in
1758	DATE	, was a less pronounced success , but far from a failure .

		In addition , among clever epigrams and mediocre verses Dodsley achieved one song which his biographer rightly calls '' near to immortality , '' '' One kind kiss before we part . ''

		It is evident , therefore , that
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	is by no means a negligible figure in the literature of the age of
Johnson	PERSON	.

		It is as a publisher , of course , that
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	is of most interest and importance .

		Mr.
Straus	PERSON	gives a good deal of space to an illuminating discussion of his business shrewdness notably his acceptance of
Joseph Warton	PERSON	's '' Odes '' and his refusal to publish
Collins	PERSON	's and devotes over seventy pages to a very careful bibliog - raphy of the books he issued .

		Dodsley may well have been proud of his books .

		Consider this brief list of the most notable :
Glover	PERSON	's '' Leonidas '' ; Pope 's '' Letters . ''

		as well as some of his poems ;
Johnson	PERSON	's ``
London	LOCATION	, '' `` Vanity of Human Wishes , '' ''
Irene	PERSON	, '' ''
Rasselas	PERSON	, '' and his `` Dictionary '' ;
Shenstone	PERSON	's `` Schoolmis - tress '' ; Young 's '' Night Thoughts '' ;
Aken	PERSON	- side 's '' Pleasures of Imagination '' ;
Joseph Warton	PERSON	's '' Odes '' and his '' Essay on Pope '' ;
Spence	PERSON	's '' Polymetis '' ; Gray 's '' Ode on a Distant Prospect of
Eton	LOCATION	, '' and his '' Elegy '' ;
Paltock	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Peter Wilkins	PERSON	, '' and Fielding 's '' Amelia '' ;
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's '' Siecle de Louis XIV. , '' and
Lowth	PERSON	's '' De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum '' ;
Gilbert West	PERSON	's '' Odes of Pindar , '' and
Tom Warton	PERSON	's '' Observations on the Faery Queen '' ;
Dyer	PERSON	's `` Fleece '' ;
Burke	PERSON	's `` Account of the European Settlements in
America	LOCATION	, '' and his '' Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful '' ; the second edition of
Walpole	LOCATION	's '' Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors '' ; the
London	LOCATION	edi - tions of '' Tristram Shandy '' and the '' Sermons of Mr.
Yorick	PERSON	'' ;
Percy	PERSON	's '' Five Pieces of Runic Poetry '' and '' Reliques '' -LRB- this last after
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	's death -RRB- ;
Evans	PERSON	's '' Specimens of the Welsh Bards , '' and
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' Enquiry into the
Present State of Polite Learning	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, One of the noteworthy things about this list is that it represents not merely Classicism or Romanticism , but practically all the literary currents of the age .

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Straus	PERSON	did not give us more information about those details of printing in the eighteenth century which are so useful and so very hard for even the special student to come by .

		He never tells us , for instance , how large an `` edition '' was ; and yet it is to be presumed some information on the subject was accessible to him in
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's papers .

		It is a pity , too , that he did not sup - plement his bibliography by an analysis of its contents , since it is too long for many generali - zations to be obvious , and yet examination brings to light much that is interesting .

		For example , we find that in the thirty years of
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's career as a publisher he issued over seven hundred books , of which nearly half are poems or plays though the plays form only a small fraction and under ten per cent are religious .

		Essays , letters , scientific and his - torical works , do not quite equal the poetry .

		It is significant , too , both of the taste of
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's generation and of his own judgment as a publisher , that nearly a third of the poems and plays went into two or more editions .

		His list of fiction includes only twenty-six titles , but fourteen of them were reprinted at least once .

		Of the dozen books which went into six or more editions , three were of
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's own making his `` Toy-shop , '' his `` Miscellany , '' and his '' -LRB- Economy of Human Life '' ; among the others were the '' Night Thoughts , '' the '' Elegy , '' the '' Pleasures of Imagination , '' Cotton 's now forgotten '' Visions in Verse , '' an alteration of '' Comus , '' and an Anatomy .

		Examination of the bibliography shows fur - ther that over three-fifths of
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's books sold for one shilling six pence or less , and only about one-tenth for over six shillings .

		Dodsley 's highest priced book was
Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary , the two volumes of which sold for four pounds ten shillings ; but Dodsley shared the risks with five other publishers .

		The most expensive books which Dodsley issued by himself were an '' England Illustrated '' in two volumes at fifty - six shillings ,
Spence	PERSON	's `` Polymetis '' at forty - two shillings six pence , '' L'Ecole des Armes '' at forty-two shillings , and the '' Memoirs of Clanrickarde '' at
thirty-one shillings six pence	MONEY	.

		Dodsley and Tonson together issued at fifty shil - lings a two-volume ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Jarvis	PERSON	's translation -RRB- , which went into a third edition .

		Mr.
Straus	PERSON	speaks of the frequency with which Dodsley shared the risks and profits of books with other publishers , but does not point out that these partnerships were about as often in shilling and sixpenny books as in more ex - pensive ones .

		In comparison with
Dodsley	PERSON	, the Newberys between
1740	DATE	and
1800	DATE	published about five hundred and fifty books less than four-fifths as many as
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	in twice the length of time .

		Less than a sixth of the Newberys ' publications were poems or plays ; and out of some eighty books of fiction , a majority were sixpenny or shilling abridgments of ``
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' ''
Clarissa	PERSON	, '' ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' and the like .

		The Newberys made a specialty of juvenile books , which formed more than a third of their output .

		This last fact explains why the Newberys sold more than a third of their books for sixpence or less , as against a sixth of
Dodsley 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Newberys far outstripped Dodsley in frequent editions , but have only
Goldsmith	PERSON	to put against
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's long list of notable authors .

		Hasty examination of a modern publisher 's catalogue , which contains some 1500 titles in general literature , shows that nearly ten per cent of his books sell for six dollars or over , and only about five per cent for less than
forty cents	MONEY	clear evidence of the increased market for expensive books , as well as of the decline of the old practice of issuing single essays and poems as pamphlets .

		In what Mr.
Straus	PERSON	has done , however , he has been exceptionally accurate and thorough , as will be evident from this very brief list of additions and corrections all the reviewer could find after a good deal of checking up : P. 47 .

		A GROUP OF L.OXG POEMS .

		* The central situation of '' Measure for Measure '' becomes the theme of '' Pietro of
Siena	LOCATION	, '' a new dramatic poem by Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	.

		This tragedy manquS is worked out in three brief acts of blank verse , all the scenes falling between sun - set of one day and sunrise of the day following .


Pietro Tornielli	PERSON	has captured
Siena	LOCATION	, and the tyrant
Luigi Gonzago	PERSON	is condemned to death .

		But his sister
Gemma	PERSON	pleads for his life , and Pietro , fasci - nated by her beauty , bargains for her body as the price of release .

		When they meet that night , she so arouses the stirrings of his nobler nature that he foregoes his lustful purpose , and vows to make her his lawful wife .

		The following lines will show with what eloquence
Gemma	PERSON	appeals to the tempter : '' You ghost , with but the vantage of the grave , O lover with cold murder on your lips , Bridegroom whose gift is blood , whose dower is death !

		Ah , what a tryst !

		What moonlight ever saw Such a forbidden rapture as is this ' . '

		Then take me in your arms , but never me !

		Or kiss these lips where lips have ceased to move .

		Fool , can you understand in your wild blood That never shall yon reach me on these terms ?

		How can yon drink my beauty , if no soul Makes the draught live ?

		You bargain for a bliss , But no bliss from a bargain ever came .

		That bliss may be too sudden , may be slow , Howe'er it come ; but it is thoughten wise , Not planned , not calculated ; be it sin Or fire of angels , not this way it comes , Nor ever hath : now to thy lips I yield My own , but with a cold laugh in my soul , Or else in dreadful thought thy kiss I take .

		Now thou art master ; thy brief hour demand !

		But had I loved thee ,
Pietro	LOCATION	, not this way Would I have clasped thee , but in sacred fire , And then shonldst thou have tasted of deep life ; Then not of flesh but of the endless soul . ''

		54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, It is a little puzzling , after these heroics , to note with what alacrity she accepts the new legal '' bar - gain '' proposed hy Pietro , and how cheerfully the brother acquiesces when the news releases him from imminent death at the sunrise hour .

		Such changes of heart are not exactly reasonable when brought about within the narrow limits which the author 's setting have allowed him . ''

		Dreaming in starless night , it seemed that I , Lifted in spirit arms , was outward borne , Beyond the steadfast boundaries of the earth And the invisible orb of the vast sun . ''

		Then was I ` ware that one beside me was , Whom I felt speaking rather than heard speak .

		4 One whom thou lovest and who still loves thee Despatched me to thy side , ' the spirit said . ''

		Thus opens '' The New Inferno , '' a second contribu - tion by Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	to the season 's literature , tak - ing the form of a blank verse poem in nine cantos , each divided into quatrains as above shown .

		It is a sophisticated modern Inferno into which the spirit guide takes us , although it emphasizes the old idea of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, the idea that the after life brings punish - ment which is the logical consequence of earthly sin .

		Thus we find
Napoleon	PERSON	imprisoned in a dreary world of ice , and
Torquemada	ORGANIZATION	writhing in the flames .

		These are the only historical figures of the vision , which is otherwise concerned with types of lust and violence .

		The lesson of the poem is found in the following quatrains : '' For now I see that Hell no city is , Nor place appointed , that no judge presides , Nor our Creator in his anger sits To sentence , and to punish the free soul . ''

		Far worse !

		the stain contracted leaves us not .

		No deepest grave obliterates a fault , But to the Earth the immortal spirit clings , And being spirit in greater madness burns . ''

		There are five passages in this poem , but we do not think that , on the whole , it will add materially to the author 's reputation .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	uses the great name of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	as a peg upon which to hang his own philosophical mus - ings , but it is the historical Florentine of whom we read in Miss Rose 's fine dramatic poem .

		This ''
Dante	PERSON	, '' a work in four acts , takes up the principal happenings of the poet 's life , from the factional strife and the broil of politics in his native city , through the years of exile at
Verona	LOCATION	and elsewhere , to the peaceful end at
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		The first three acts are concerned with the events which lead up to his ban - ishment , the plot whereby he is persuaded to make
Gemma Donati	PERSON	his wife , and the death of Beatrice .

		The fourth act sets forth the story of his closing years .

		Our illustrative extract shall be the ending of the work , the last words placed upon the lips of the dying poet . ''

		Come closer , shades .

		What , do ye fly my touch ?

		Hath woe not purified my flesh enow ?

		Must my poor soul , still sighing , sit within The adamantine prison of the flesh ?

		Hath it not even reached an outer door Where through some blessed chink it spies beyond Its kin at rest , care-free , in sweet Elysium ?

		Fed on the tree of life in
Paradise	LOCATION	, When perfect grown , must these new spirits swing The incense of their love and praise alone In Heaven 's domes ?

		Shall not some holy breath Be wafted down from them to earth again , Sweetening our lives and cleansing us from sin , And so let those above by mystic tie Be linked to what they were in living men ?

		O
Beatrice	PERSON	, such pure soul as thine Needs lower stoop than most , to reach us here .

		Madonna , at thy feet I lay my love ; 0 , lift it to thy bosom , let it lie , Like scented blossom , lightly , near thy heart .

		Still silent , blessed one ?

		Thine eyes speak only ; Thou standest near the Church enthroned in glory , Beside the
Rose of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, the Virgin Mother , Who shineth , clothed in light eternally .

		Even thou even thou art Beatrice !

		Stretch out thy holy hands ; help me to thee !

		let my faltering tongue find power So that a spark of all thy glory trail Resplendent through all centuries to come , Lit by the love that moves the sun and stars , That gives me God and
Florence Beatrice	LOCATION	'' This passage shows how deftly the author has made use of the Dantean phrase , weaving it into the fabric of her verse .

		There are other passages in which she reproduces the poet 's recorded words more exactly , introducing them as literal quotations , thus avoiding the insuperable difficulty of inventing fit words of her own for the significant moments of the action .

		The whole work is done in a spirit of the deepest sympathy and reverence , and is marked by the scholarly acquaintance with the subject without which a work of dramatic effectiveness , such as this work distinctly is , could not have been produced .

		The politics of
Florence	LOCATION	, with their shibboleths of faction and their insolent individual ambitions , bear little apparent resemblance to our modern poli - tics , swayed by social and economic forces , and con - tending upon a scale unimaginable in the
Italy	LOCATION	of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Yet poetry , seeing in all such struggles but varying manifestations of the unchang - ing soul of men , and viewing them all sub specie CBternitatis , may discern a kind of underlying unity in the most diverse expressions of the human spirit .

		Thus we do not seem to pass into a wholly different sphere when we turn from the old-world strife of
Guelph	LOCATION	with
Ghibelline	PERSON	to the new-world strife of capital with labor if only we approach both themes under the idealistic guidance of the poet .

		It is a poem in dramatic form , '' The Breaking of Bonds , '' by Mr.
Arthur Davison Ficke	PERSON	, that brings before our gaze the social unrest of modern life with a degree of imaginative power that raises the subject from the temporal to the eternal plane , and corre - lates it with subjects that might upon first thought seem better fitted for poetic treatment .

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	, taking
Shelley	PERSON	for his exemplar , seeks to forecast the shaping of a new earth out of the miserable place of our present abode .

		He says : '' I have expressed in the following pages neither a political plan , nor a carefully rounded and utterly impossible scheme urged on the world for adoption .

		I have merely
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 taken as a beginning the social hostility of to-day ; I have transported it into the world of imagination ; and there let the dramatic forces inherent in the situation work out what I conceive to be their nat - ural equilibrium . ''

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's method is highly symbolical .

		His characters are abstractions and spirits , like those employed by
Moody	ORGANIZATION	in '' The Masque of Judgment '' or by Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	in '' The Dynasts . ''

		There are choruses of the Men who Labor , the
Masters of Wealth	ORGANIZATION	, and the Wise Men , there is the Watcher on the Tower , and there are the Spirits of Beauty and of Power , of the Cities and of the
Hills	LOCATION	, and the Spirit of the
Eighth Day of Creation	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is this last-named Spirit upon whose shoulders the burden of prophecy is laid , and who , after the cataclysm which has laid waste what we now call civilization , gives heart to stricken man - kind in such noble words as these : '' One thing alone is worth your straining toil , To seek that way which in good time shall lead Up toward the fairer future of mankind .

		Deep in the soul of each must rise the dream Of man with higher powers , man more divine ; Flooded with light whose spark was on his brow When he emerged from out creation 's deeps , The wonder and the mystery of the world .

		As from the brute he grew in ages past , A greater passion of exalted life Shall thrill and glorify him , till he rise Godlike and wingeVl with his destiny .

		Such is the fate I give and ye must take .

		This is your pole-star .

		Crown nor crucifix Suffice for this ; but in each secret heart The light must
spring	DATE	, a more than mortal sense Of ages leading ever toward new heights ; That the far generations , sweeping on , Shall each see clearer , and descry at last What wondrous destiny lies free to man .

		But far in distant ages , all the years Of weary toil shall turn to their fulfilment .

		The lesser fails ; the higher shall endure ; And in the end , the Promised Land shall spread Its vast aerial valleys at men 's feet .

		.

		Greater mankind shall walk the walls of heaven Yet never dreamed .

		And from the cloudy night Of man 's long martyrdom shall come the dawn . ''

		It is the Watcher who has the last word , and he gives it this fine Swinburnian turn : '' New Masters may rise , But they shall not endure .

		We shall push our emprise Past each barrier and lure Through ways that are dim , to an end that is clear , with a hope that is sure . ''

		Crowns of gold or of thorn Are as phantoms that pale In the infinite dusk ; Yet one crown shall not fail ,
Yea	LOCATION	, the crown of man 's ultimate freedom that over the world shall prevail . ''

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	has given us a poem that is well worth while , a poem that is intensely modern in feeling and at the same time true to the English tradition of what is permissible and what is not , of what is desirable and what is to be shunned .

		It is somewhat venturesome , after the superb treatment of the subject by
William Morris	PERSON	, for anyone to attempt anew a '' Sigurd '' epic .

		But we think that Mr.
Arthur Peterson	PERSON	's poem has justified the venture , and we have read with much pleasure his new version of the greatest of all Teutonic leg - ends .

		His style is simple and his narrative straight - forward , as befits a theme which needs neither rhetorical adornment nor constructive artifice for its setting forth .

		As he retells the story , it seems to combine the essentials of the Nibelungenenlied ver - sion with some of the variations made familiar by the Wagnerian cycle .

		It deals mainly with the scenes at
Gunter	PERSON	's Bnrgundian court , and ends with the death of
Sigurd	PERSON	and the self-immolation of
Brynhild	LOCATION	.

		Sigurd 's earlier career is recounted by the hero himself , much as Odysseus tells the story of his wanderings at the Court of the Phaeacians .

		But the story is simplified by assuming that when
Sigurd	PERSON	awakens
Brynhild	PERSON	on her rock , acting on
Gunter	PERSON	's behalf , he has had no previous knowledge of her , thus avoiding the necessity for making use of the potion of oblivion in working out the tragic consummation .


Hagen	PERSON	has no evidence beyond his own evil suspicions that the
King	PERSON	has been betrayed by his representative and blood-brother .

		We notice that the scene of
Brynhild	LOCATION	's fire-encircled sleep is given as the island of
Halgoland	LOCATION	near the mouth of the
Elbe	LOCATION	.

		Can it be that the author has confused this island with the
Halogaland	PERSON	of the sagas ?

		Mr.
Peterson	PERSON	is a believer in the preponderance of the Scandinavian element in the population of the Brit - ish Isles , and even goes so far as to suggest that the Jutes and Angles were kinds of Norsemen , given which assumption his demonstration is easy .

		This view is expressed in the
Vala	ORGANIZATION	's prophecy , made when
Sigurd	PERSON	questions her concerning his fate . ''

		But see !

		E ` en now , on
Britain	LOCATION	's stormy shores , Hengist and
Horsa	PERSON	, with their sea-tost hosts , Land , and great
England	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	's predestined heir , Begins her conquering march .

		As , in a gale , A mighty tidal wave , holp by the winds , Breaks on some isle , and overwhelms the land , All things submerging ; so , on
Britain	LOCATION	's isle , The viking tide , in waves successive , breaks , And overflows the land ; o'erflows save where , In west and north , the mountain fastnesses Of
Wales	LOCATION	and
Caledonia	LOCATION	lift their towers .

		Angles ,
Jutes	LOCATION	, Saxons , Norsemen.Swedes , Goths ,
Danes	LOCATION	, One people called by many names , one race Of ocean-warriors , golden-haired , they come . ''

		We must make a further quotation from this pro- phecy , because in it the author achieves his highest flight . ''

		Methinks as in a dream I see them now .

		With tossing prows far out at sea beheld , With spears and helmets through the ocean mists Flashing , they come ; unheralded ; with dread Watched by those spirits pusillanimous Whose purblind eyes see not in these fierce foes
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's chosen seed , the saviours of the land , Wild giants they , wet with the salt sea-foam , But in their lives the primal virtues shine Strength , courage , justice , boundless energy , Truth-telling , love of home , contempt of death , THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, High wisdom , and all else that makes the man And through them is old
Europe	LOCATION	born again .

		As comes the spring-time back to earth , so comes Once more the age heroic back to men .

		The figure of a
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	, spear in hand , Crown 'd with his winged helmet , eagle-like Koaming , in dragon-ship , the ocean , looms Above the world 's horizon : I behold Comrades in fame , thy vikings range themselves Beside the stalwart shapes that founded
Rome	LOCATION	, And hero-hosts Hellenic ; and in thee ,
Sigurd	PERSON	, though briefer was thy life than theirs ,
Ulysses	PERSON	and ^ Eneas live again . '

		1 A noteworthy contribution to elegiac verse is offered by Dr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	, who in `` A Mid -
summer	DATE	Memory '' sings of his lost friend
Arthur Upson	PERSON	.

		It will be remembered that
Upson	PERSON	was drowned a little more than two years ago , in the thirty-second year of his age , but not before he had won for himself the recognition of them that know .

		His death was a grievous loss to American poetry , but we may find some consolation in the fact that it has given us this tender and heart-felt threnody .

		We quote the last two of the fifty-four stanzas : '' Even as
Arthur	PERSON	of the Table Round Followed the Gleam and fought the good fight through , Then floated down the mere unto the sound Of flutes that like soft wind forever blew , So thou didst straight embark and with a smile Float on the bosom of the After-while . ''

		The pure of heart are blessed ; they shall be God 's chosen , he is close to them alone .

		Lover of earth , now heaven hath claim on thee , Boldly thine eyes face that refulgency Of more than mortal keenness ; for thine own Were pure indeed ; forever safe thou art , Because thine often-heavy human heart Rests , circled by that promise , They shall see . ' ''

		Wit and wisdom , packed for the most part in Hudibrastic measures , are the characteristics of Professor
Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	's Phi Beta Kappa poem , '' The Happy Teacher . ''

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	has been a teacher for upwards of thirty years , and his confession that the word spells happiness will be echoed in the heart of every teacher w ^ ho is worthy of that noble profession .

		He has now commenced emeritus , which is a kind of happiness also for the veteran with long years of useful work behind him , although it must be mingled with something of regret .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's pedagogy is of the soundest , as may be instanced by his com - ment on the '' systems '' so dear to the commercial type of school administration .

		`` Their schools and systems , all and some , Seem founded on the axiom That gear of clock-work can direct The engine of the intellect .

		They dream , like alchemists of old , To find in their retorts the gold , Blind to the true transmuting stone , Only to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's bantlings known .

		The spirit bloweth and is still : Come , harness it to turn our mill !

		No teacher , but mechanic tool , Who , when the angel moves aright On waters of
Bethesda	LOCATION	's pool , Would thermograph them by some rule Of I ; < MII mar or Fahrenheit . ''

		Our happy guide , of
Socrates	PERSON	' Athletic school , distrusts degrees .

		Why dub the graduated ass Whose ne plus ultra is to pass , Honorificabilitudinitas ?

		O runner , fling aside the crutch !

		Is his monition ; overmuch Our Capuan schools abound in aids , Diplomas , titles , badges , grades : Why titillate with bait so slight The hungry edge of appetite ?

		Why tempt the torpid ?

		Fat of rib Is fat of wit : shut up the crib . ''

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's satire is not all aimed at the pur - blind pedagogue , but finds many other objects for its shafts .

		Here is one forcible example , which we commend to workers in the cause of conservation : '' Has Earth no vengeance , have the Heavens no curse For him who by destruction fills his purse ?

		Let actuaries calculate the worth Of him who , dying , poorer leaves the earth : Carve the hard face , that coming man may see The cruel features of his enemy !

		Hark !

		by the noble soul distinctly heard , Out of those marble lips escapes the Word That sacrifice of self for those unborn Is worship which the gods will never scorn .

		Who makes the world his oyster , leaves it dead And done with , soon as ever he has fed , Who sucks the juice and chucks away the shell Should find no fellowship except in
Hell Where Dante	ORGANIZATION	found the traitors wintering , Congenial spirits for the Lumber King . ''

		The true consecration of the teacher -LRB- to return to the main theme of the poem -RRB- is found in his ac - ceptance of the ideal thus nobly stated : '' No follower and no flatterer of the crowd , Not foremost in the synagogue is bow 'd Our Teacher , giving alms unseen of men , Shouts not upon the housetop his Amen !

		Yet when
Hosannah	PERSON	to the Lord on High , With voice of many waters people cry , Than he , none feels the common impulse more ; But , praying , goes within , and shuts the door .

		Deep in the heart he keeps a Holy Shrine ; There looks he , not in vain , for the Divine . ''

		In its guise of a playfulness which does not really conceal the serious underlying thought , this poem is suggestive of some of
Lowell	LOCATION	's best things , and its didacticism is precisely of the sort which he would have applauded .

		We think that the author will not bear us ill-will for pointing out this resem - blance , - r ,

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The eventful A hearty welcome is assured to life of a famous the authorized English version , trom peace-promoter .

		tne p rac ticed pen of Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, of the '' Memoirs of
Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	'' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		These '' Records of an Eventful Life , '' as they are called in a sub-title , cover a period of about sixty years , from the writer 's birth at
Prague	LOCATION	in
1843	DATE	to her husband 's death in
December of 1902	DATE	; but a supplementary chapter descriptive of her three weeks in
America	LOCATION	in
1904 1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 has been provided for this edition , as also a Preface to her English and American readers .

		Apart from the interest attaching to the
Barness von Suttner	PERSON	's early conversion to the cause of international peace , to her subsequent activities in behalf of that cause , and especially to the circumstances that impelled her to write her world-famous novel , '' Lay Down Your Arms , '' there is so much of romance and so wide a variety of rich and memorable experience in the life of this greatly-gifted woman as to render her autobiography irresistibly attractive to a wide circle of readers .

		Indeed , these pages from life , especially those describing the writer 's early literary and artistic enthusiasms , and recounting her passions of the heart and her elopement with the man in whose company she was to enjoy a `` perfect union of unclouded happiness , '' may well prove more fasci - nating than any passages from her works of fiction .

		The beginning of her acquaintance with
Alfred Nobel	PERSON	was curiously brought about , and her inter - course with him through the years that followed until his untimely death furnishes matter of the most readable kind .

		Other noteworthy friendships and other correspondence abound .

		The
Baroness	PERSON	's prom - inence in the peace movement naturally made her more or less intimately acquainted with nearly all the leading advocates of that cause , while her literary and musical tastes procured her a host of friends among authors and musicians .

		Mention must be made of her outspoken admiration of many Amer - ican institutions , including especially the magnifi - cent
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	and the hardly less admirable
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Through all the '' Memoirs '' there runs a certain German thorough - ness , an attention to homely detail , that characterizes her famous novel , and that may occasionally weary some , but will more often ingratiate and entertain .

		The work is a powerful utterance in behalf of a most deserving cause , as well as a charming piece of literature .

		Survey * of literature , old and neiv .

		Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's '' Shelburne Essays '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- have now reached a `` Seventh Series , '' and probably some readers will by this time have forgotten the origin of the title , the rural retreat where the first series was conceived and at least partly written .

		The aloofness and dispassionateness of thought and style that that retreat seems to have fostered still mark the successive additions to the series .

		To use the words applied by him to
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	in the present volume , Mr.
More	PERSON	impresses one as standing calmly '' aloof from the currents of the hour , judging men and things from the larger circles of time , '' and as at least partly '' emancipated from the illusions of the present . ''

		The essays now col - lected have with a single exception already appeared in print , although often in an abridged form , and are in almost every case prompted by books that have presented themselves for review .

		The chapter now for the first time published deals with '' Criticism , '' and begins by drawing a parallel , somewhat forced perhaps , between
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and the third
Earl of Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally , Mr.
More	PERSON	exalts the critic 's office , and he even persuades himself , if not his reader , that the critical
Cicero	PERSON	has been `` as dynamic an influence in civilization as
St. Paul	LOCATION	. ''

		A chapter on `` The Pragmatism of
William James	PERSON	'' agreeably disappoints one by proving to be more in sympathy with the current revolt against cut-and - dried philosophical systems than might have been expected from the writer 's somewhat conservative habit of thought and from a rather unsympathetic reference he has elsewhere made to the '' prattle of pragmatism . ''

		Yet while exposing the manifest weaknesses of the pragmatic position , he has not emphasized so strongly as he might have the service rendered to freedom of thought by Messrs.
James	PERSON	and
Dewey	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	and their associates .

		The essays not already mentioned have to do with
Shelley	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Hood	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, Mr.
G. Lowes Dick	PERSON	- inson ,
Louisa Shore	PERSON	, and , more briefly , a few other authors .

		Increased ripeness of judgment , widened and deepened knowledge , and enlargement of vision are to be noted in comparing this latest volume of the set with some of its early predecessors .

		A guide to the Those who wish to read wisely and appreciation well , and not merely to hasten the of literature .

Edwin L. Shuman	PERSON	's inviting little treatise , '' How to Judge a Book '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Twenty years of writing about books , notably as literary editor of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Record-Herald , '' have de - veloped the author 's literary taste , trained his judgment , and given him facility in expressing his opinions .

		His book , which is sub-titled '' A Handy Method of Criticism for the General Reader , '' and which is of similar size and general nature to Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's '' Books , Culture and Character , '' although necessarily more technical , devotes nearly three-quarters of its contents to the consideration of prose fiction , leaving but forty-seven pages for all other literature , and despatching poetry and drama in eighteen of these pages .

		But as the novel is un - questionably the most elaborate as well as the most popular form of literature , there is some reason in this apportionment .

		Not surprising , either , is the democratic test applied by the author to works of art .

		`` The greatest art , '' he holds , `` is that which gives the most lasting pleasure to the largest num - ber of people . ''

		But this rule , literally interpreted , would lead to some curious conclusions .

		For ex - ample , multiplying the duration of pleasure by the number of persons pleased , we should obtain a product indicating the art of
E. P. Roe	PERSON	's novels to be far greater than that of
George Meredith	PERSON	's , or , to take less recent authors , the art of '' The Deerslayer '' greater than that of `` The Scarlet Letter . ''

		Mr.
Shuman	PERSON	's reading , especially in fiction , has evi - dently been wide , and he recalls readily and aptly such scenes and characters as he needs for illustra - 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, tion .

		He seems to assign the right place to morality in art , neither exalting it as a leading motive on the one hand , nor going so far , on the other , as to preach unreservedly the gospel of `` art for art 's sake . ''

		Sanity and good taste speak in every page of the book , which moreover ingratiates by its amenities of style .

		LU commodore of Commodore
John Kodgers	PERSON	-LRB-
Arthur	PERSON	the old now .

		JJ .


Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is at once a biography of an able commander and a history of the old
navy	ORGANIZATION	from
1802	DATE	to
1838	DATE	.

		Dr.
Paullin	PERSON	, by his long studies in American naval history , is well qualified to do the work ; he has also had a wealth of material from which to draw out his facts the printed mat - ter , both public and private , relating to the subject , files of old newspapers , the manuscript records in the
Navy Department	ORGANIZATION	, and family documentary collections never before used .

		Each period of
Rod	PERSON	- gers 's life is exhaustively treated , his family and boyhood life ; his experiences as a young officer in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	; his career in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and in the War of
1812	DATE	; and his constructive work as member of the various boards and commissions which organized and reorganized naval institutions after the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The most interesting part of the biography is that which deals with the Am - erican naval force in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	during the troubles with the
Barbary States	LOCATION	.

		The responsi - bilities upon naval commanders were then much greater than in the present day of steam vessels and cables .

		In dealing with the North African powers
Rodgers	PERSON	proved to be a successful diplomat as well as a fighting captain , and was most success - ful in his difficult task .

		But his best and most per - manent work was as senior member of the boards which inaugurated a progressive and constructive policy planned a new navy , built navy yards , planned the naval academy , the naval observatory , and the
Hydrographic Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is a good history of the last generation of the wooden navy and of the best representative of the commanders of that period one who for twenty years was at the head of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is well illus - trated with contemporary portraits , facsimiles , and copies of old prints .

		An artist 's ^ * r
Hubert von Herkomer	PERSON	has writ - memorie * of his ten , not exactly a sequel , but rather early training .

		an antecedent to `` My School and My Gospel '' in his equally entertaining record of the rather harsh experiences leading up to the open - ing of his school and the firm establishment of his fortunes .

		In `` The Herkomers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- he traces his family history and his individual biog - raphy from the simple Bavarian days through the rough American experiment and the up-hill English struggle to the serener and more prosperous years of later life .

		The art instinct seems of old to have been strong in the
Herkomers	LOCATION	, in the plasterers and cabinet-makers and wood-carvers and other artisans of the family , while the love of music and skill in making music were prevalent on the mother 's side of the house .

		Their art being more to the
Herkom	PERSON	- ers than wealth or station , poverty and obscurity were their cheerfully-accepted portion until the present chief representative of the family came into full possession of his powers .

		The story of these years of hardship , told by Sir
Hubert	PERSON	in the com - placency of his own acknowledged success in life , has in its way much of the fascination of
Cellini	ORGANIZATION	's glowing and picturesque autobiography .

		A single incident will here indicate the stuff the Herkomers were made of .

		In their English exile the family was sorely pressed for the wherewithal to procure food and clothing , so that the father sacrified his cloak to provide jacket and trousers for his son , himself walking a little faster to keep warm , and a little later cut out the meat and alcoholic drink from his dietary , and also abjured tobacco ; and the son insisted on sharing the glory of this renunciation by embracing vegetarianism .

		The book is inviting in its literary style , and is attractively illustrated ; but the author might well bear in mind
Lowell	LOCATION	's observation on the use of the dash , that it stands as a confession of ignorance of the rules of punctuation .

		A remarkable command of oddly Essays , satirical c t ureg q ue epithet , surprising dex - and otherwise .

		r , , .

		terity in the moulding 01 whimsically striking phrases , great fertility of invention where the available resources of existing speech fall short of his needs , such are the salient characteristics of Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	's style in his collection of short and crisp essays published under the title , `` Constrained Attitudes '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Merrily sar - castic also and good-naturally satirical is he in his rapid shots at folly as it flies .

		The follies of literary persons receive some of his shrewdest hits , as when , in mild derision of the professional nature-writer , he opines that many a non-professional too might '' know when a thing is bosky and when a thing is lush , know the wonderful hour that is neither night nor day , and the tang of salt air , and the skirl of the haw-bird , and the booming note of the dugong , and where the bumbleberries cluster thickest and the wild pomatum blooms . ''

		Some remarks on
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, not heartily eulogistic , are bright and amusing , however charged with one-sidedness of view . ''

		He writes only for those who go to the theatre to be disturbed .

		Instead of beginning with love in difficulties and ending with a happy marriage , he begins with happy marriages and ends with the very devil . ''

		.

		In ridicule of ostentatious and learned quotation the author says , among other good things , '' It is a humane rule never to jingle your literary pockets merely to tantalise the poor . ''

		The book shows gain in both substance and form as compared with its predecessor , `` Imaginary Obligations . ''

		While still a self-constituted critic of everything criticizable , the author is a shade less dogmatic than he used to be .

		It may be hoped that in time he will acquire a very creditable store of human fallibility .

		THE 59 That unwearied maker of antholo - gi 68 ' Mr
> Wallace Rice	PERSON	< has P ut ^ wide acquaintance with literature in the form of verse to a most effective use in the compilation of `` The Little Book Series , '' published by the
Reilly & Britton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each volume of this series offers a selection of poems upon a special subject poems from a great variety of authors -LRB- among them foreign poets in translation -RRB- and includes many out-of-the-way pieces that only om - nivorous readers would be likely to find .

		Since few readers are of this type , the number of those whose gratitude Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has deserved should be propor - tionally large .

		The twelve volumes thus far pub - lished have for their respective subjects
Bohemia	LOCATION	, Cheer , Love , Laughter , Friendship , Out-of-Doors , School-Days , Sports , Lullabies , Limericks , Brides , and Kisses .

		Here is surely poetry for all tastes , and there is no assignable limit to the further ex - pansion of the series .

		A similar series each volume of which shall be devoted to a single poet is also planned by the editor .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has a peculiar fitness for the task which he has here undertaken , and the task itself that of bringing the treasures of poetry to the attention of people who balk at definitive editions and collected works is one of the most praiseworthy imaginable .

		We should think that many thousands of new readers might be gained for poetry by thus serving it out in moderate and palatable rations .

		Poetry is , after all , not too bright and good for human nature 's daily food , if only the world knew it , and we extend a grateful welcome to an enterprise which , like the present one , attempts to give practical effect to that ele - mentary proposition .

		Miss
Harriet Eliza Paine	PERSON	, who died last year at the age of sixty-four , left a series of unpublished essays on the general subject of the joys and sorrows of growing old .

		These posthumous chapters now appear under the collective title , '' Old People '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with a prefatory biographical sketch of the author by Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	.

		Ardent stu - dent and inspiring teacher ,
Miss Paine	LOCATION	was com - paratively early overtaken by two infirmities that sadly interfered with her chosen pursuits and must have sorely tried her brave spirit .

		These ailments of the body were deafness and blindness neither of them total , but both , especially the former , very pronounced .

		With the voice of authority , therefore , she speaks , in her book , on the subjects of `` Silence '' and '' Darkness . ''

		Other chapters are headed `` Greeting Old Age , '' `` Change and Breadth , '' '' Work , '' '' Earning a Living , '' '' On Keeping Young , '' `` The Inner Life of the Old , '' `` The Rela - tions of the Old and
Young	PERSON	, '' and '' The Renewal of Emotion . ''

		Some of us have a stout conviction , '' she writes , `` which has weathered many a gale , that the ideal is the only reality ; but veterans understand that to pull a steady oar always , whether the tide and wind and current are with us , or whether the tide and wind and current are against us , is the only way to make the reality ideal . ''

		Idealist , but not a dreamer ,
Miss Paine	LOCATION	has left a book that will speak to older readers in accents at once strong and comforting .

		BRIEFER MEXTIOX .

		A volume of '' Mohonk Addresses '' by
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	and
David J. Brewer	PERSON	, given from
1895	DATE	to
1907	DATE	at the
Mohonk Arbitration Conferences	ORGANIZATION	, is edited by Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for
the International School of Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		The addresses are brief and very much to the point .

		There are sixteen of them in all , eleven by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	and five by
Justice Brewer	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sociology is working its way down in the schools , and is probably headed for the Kindergarten .

		Meanwhile , a stage in its pedagogical progress is marked by the publication of Dr.
Charles A. Ellwood	PERSON	's '' Sociology and Modern Social Problems '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a text-book rather more elementary than any we have heretofore seen , and in striking contrast to the ponder - ous treatises of Spencer ,
Ward	PERSON	, and
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	.

		Amateur dramatic societies might do worse than turn their attention from the trifling farce-comedies they usually select to such sterling material as is offered by Mr.
Horace B. Browne	PERSON	's volume of '' Short Plays from Dickens '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		These '' plays , '' which are nothing more than brief dramatic scenes , are very entertaining in their dialogue form , and may be easily managed also , requiring few characters and even fewer accessories .

		`` The Poems of Cynewulf , '' translated into English prose by Dr.
Charles W. Kennedy	PERSON	, and `` The Plays and Poems of
George Chapman	PERSON	-LRB- The Tragedies -RRB- , '' edited by Dr.
Thomas Marc Parrott	PERSON	, are two welcome volumes that emanate from
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, are included in a '' Library of Scholarship and Letters , '' and are published by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both volumes have all the apparatus that a conscien - tious student could desire . ''

		Forty Songs by
Richard Strauss	PERSON	'' -LRB- for high voice -RRB- , edited by Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	, is a highly acceptable addition to the Messrs.
Ditson	PERSON	's '' Musicians ' Library . ''

		However we may dispute about
Strauss	PERSON	as a composer for the stage and the orchestra , we generally admit him to be a master among song-writers , one who has the key to the treasury of pure lyric beauty .

		This volume has the usual accompaniments of portrait and intro - ductory essay , and gives the texts in both German and English .

		Other publications of the same house are '' The Cocoa Palm and Other Songs for Children , '' by Miss
Mary Dillingham Frear	PERSON	-LRB- a revised edition -RRB- ; a second volume of '' Classics for Violin '' -LRB- an interesting selection of pieces ancient and modern -RRB- ; a set of '' Octave Studies after
J. S. Bach	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Isidor Phillipp	PERSON	; a collection of `` Choice Part-Songs for Men 's Voices , '' edited by Mr.
George L. Osgood	PERSON	; and a collec - tion of '' Twenty Popular Anthems , '' compiled by Mr.
Robert E. Austin	PERSON	.

		60 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, NOTES .

		Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	's study of
William Blake	PERSON	is to be issued immediately by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in their '' Popular Library of Art . ''

		Two of the special features of the new edition of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's complete poetical works , to be issued in ten volumes by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will be a sketch of the poet 's life by Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	and a prefatory essay on the
Wordsworth	PERSON	country by Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	.

		In '' The Purchasing Power of Money , '' which is to be published early this
Spring	DATE	by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Professor Irving Fisher of Yale University	ORGANIZATION	has attacked an old problem , but one which is ever timely and which is especially so now .

		The immediate purpose which the author has set himself is to determine the causes upon which the general level of prices depends .

		Dr.
William Edgar Geil	PERSON	, whose study of the Great Wall of
China	LOCATION	was embodied in book form a year ago , has extended his research to the '' Capitals of
China	LOCATION	, '' and a descriptive volume bearing this title and fully illustrated is to be brought out by the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		early in the
Spring	DATE	.

		The same house has in prepara - tion '' A Short History of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Capt.
George R. Clarke	PERSON	and others .

		Mr.
Herbert W. Paul	PERSON	, the well-known English histori - cal student , has brought together in a volume called '' Famous Speeches '' a large number of the most notable orations delivered in
Parliament	LOCATION	or elsewhere from the time of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	to that of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	will supply a general introduction , biographical introductions , notes , etc. .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	are publishing the volume in this country .

		A collection of '' Early Plays from the Italian , '' edited , with introductions and notes , by Mr.
R. Warwick Bond	PERSON	, is announced by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		These plays are '' Supposes , '' '' The Buggbears , '' and '' Misogonus , '' and the book as a whole is an attempt to illustrate the connection between the Latin , Italian , and Early Elizabethan comic stage , whether in subject - matter and spirit or in technical forms , Mr.
Bond	PERSON	also add - ing some brief notice of the allied Educational-Drama .

		The sixteenth annual meeting of the central division of the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	, held at
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, on
December 28	DATE	, 29 , and 30 , was marked by a fair attendance and an interesting programme .

		Chicago was tentatively fixed as the place of the next meeting , and Professor
Frank Hubbard	PERSON	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	was chosen to take Professor
Fossler	PERSON	's place as chairman of the
Western Division	ORGANIZATION	for
1911	DATE	.

		Several interesting books to be issued during the next few weeks by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : ''
Turner Essays	ORGANIZATION	in American History , '' by former pupils of Dr.
Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	; `` The Stability of Truth : A
Discussion of Reality	ORGANIZATION	as Related to Thought and Action , '' by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	; '' Some Fore - runners of Italian Opera , '' by Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	; and a volume by Dr.
Frederick A. Braun	PERSON	undertaking to trace the influence of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	upon
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	.

		There undoubtedly exists a demand for very ele - mentary , popularly written treatises on scientific sub - jects , which presuppose no technical knowledge what - ever of the field covered on the part of the reader .

		Since the days of Huxley there has been no really great master of science , both able and willing to meet this demand .

		Consequently such books are nowadays mainly the productions of uninspired , if diligent , compilers .

		In this class belongs Dr.
A. S. Herbert	PERSON	's '' The First Principles of Heredity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is the out - growth of a series of workingmen 's lectures , and covers in an orthodox and rather uncritical manner the main facts and theories of inheritance .

		As a general intro - duction to the abundant modern literature on the subject it may be found useful .

		While in the main accurate it can not be relied on implicitly in matters of detail .

		It is reported that some time before Count Tolstoy 's death , he made arrangements by which , after he died , none of his books were to be reprinted until his widow had sold the new complete edition of his works , in the preparation of which she has been engaged during the
last two years	DATE	.

		This edition is now almost finished ; only three volumes remain to be printed .

		The edition will be limited to 10,000 copies .

		Countess Tolstoy is also col - lecting for publication her husband 's correspondence , which will fill several volumes .

		There is peculiar timeliness in the immediate publi - cation , by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of a book which will in small compass deal with the whole question of militarism . ''

		War or Peace : A Present Day Duty and a Future Hope , '' is written by General
H. M. Chittenden	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, a graduate of West Point ,
1884	DATE	, who served as chief engineer of the
Fourth Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	during the Spanish-American War , and who is already known to the public for his writings on the history of the
West	LOCATION	.

		General
Chittenden	PERSON	presents the somewhat unusual spectacle of a soldier who does not let professional bias color his treatment of facts ; and after carefully marshalling the arguments for and against war , and summing up the world situation of the present day , he declares in favor of the dis - continuance of war as a means of national adjustment .

		Seventy-five of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's sonnets are embodied in the latest of the series of limited editions produced at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a square octavo , printed on Fabriano hand-made paper from an old - style type of exceptional clearness and beauty , each sonnet having an entire leaf to itself .

		Except for a graceful woodcut on the title-page , the typographical arrangement could scarcely be more severely simple as befits the poetry which it enshrines .

		The contents are arranged under three headings , '' Nature , '' `` Man , '' and `` The Poet '' ; and while many of the son - nets might logically be placed in either group , the arrangement is not without interest and value .

		Every
Wordsworth	PERSON	lover will rejoice in this dignified setting of some of the poet 's choicest jewels . ''

		The Mastersinger , '' edited by Dr.
Frank R. Rix	PERSON	, and '' Art Songs for High Schools , '' edited by Mr.
Will Earhart	PERSON	, are two new school singing-books published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections chosen by Dr.
Rix	PERSON	are `` of large content from the masterworks of the great composers '' a description in the main true , although it hardly justifies the inclusion of '' The Lost Chord '' and a selection from '' Erininie . ''

		Most of the thirty odd numbers are , however , really worth while .

		Mr.
Earhart	PERSON	's book does not claim so much , but offers what is simply a fair average selection of pieces good and indifferent .

		Since there are about one hundred and fifty of them altogether , the teacher has wide room for choice .

		But we have never yet been able to under - stand why any music that is not of the very best should ever be given to children in their singing-books .

		IMPORT AND OUTLOOK OF SOCIALISM By
NEWTON MANN	PERSON	Author of '' The Evolution of a Great Literature , '' etc. .

		` THE doubling of the Socialist vote in the
United States	LOCATION	* at the recent elections , lifting the Party into an actual prominence in the country and securing representation in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, goes far to confirm the declaration of President
Taft	PERSON	at
Jackson	LOCATION	, as quoted above .

		In the present volume Mr.
Mann	PERSON	with his customary large ability has sketched within moderate compass the rise of this movement , dis - cusses the means by which , as is believed , the great change is to be brought about , and critically examines the grounds on which the Socialist hope is built , treating in successive chapters the economic and the moral urgencies .

		-LRB- Thirteen chapters and index . -RRB-

		`` An Illuminating and Persuasive Volume '' From a column editorial in Unity ,
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Mr.
Mann	PERSON	does no careless work , and this book testifies to his usual painstaking and fearless labor .

		... It is a book that will lift the word out of the list of the bugaboo words .

		Socialism is no longer to be disposed of by taboo .

		One read - ing this book no longer dreads it on account of the ' material - ism , ' the ' infidelity , ' or the ' irreligion ' connected therewith .

		It is a book for the thoughtful , and particularly for the per - plexed ... who realize that there is something the matter .

		The book is handsomely printed .

		We welcome it as one more timely volume for the teacher , the parent , the preacher , and , above all , the business man who is afraid to think out these economic and social problems . ''

		From an editorial in
The Boston Common	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- public service -RSB- `` Raises Socialism to the power of a religion .

		If we had to learn of historic , contemporary , and prophetic Socialism through one book only , we know of none other which so clearly or attractively presents it . ''

		100 LIBRARY MACHINERY VS. HUMAN NATURE .

		There was once an old-fashioned librarian at the head of a modern library -LRB- this was not long ago , and there may be others like him even now -RRB- whose conception of a head librarian 's functions was beautiful in its simplicity and admirable in its theoretical provision for every foreseen or unforeseen contingency .

		He sat in his snug little book-lined office , read the liter - ary reviews and marked certain books for pur - chase , and formulated rules for the administra - tion of the great library whose destinies he con - trolled .

		These rules were handed to a sub - ordinate and duly published as the law of the institution until such time as they should be repealed or revised .

		Reports from depart - mental heads concerning the practical effect or non-effect of these rules were from time to time graciously received , as were also the properly registered complaints and suggestions of the visiting public ; and after these reports , com - plaints , and suggestions , which often revealed an amazing discrepancy between the theoretical perfection of the rules and their practical de - fects , had been read and pondered by the lib - rarian , there was a fresh formulation of rules , or of amendments to rules , and the new code went into effect .

		If a public library were nothing but a ma - chine , however big and complex , and if human beings were walking mechanisms , all built on the same model , the old-fashioned librarian 's method of administration would have worked to a charm .

		But they reckon ill who leave out human nature in their schemes for running the universe or any minutest part of it .

		Our learned bibliothecary above-mentioned never came in touch with his public , and hardly with his offi - cial staff .

		His surviving friends still smile at the remembrance of the almost panic-stricken haste with which he was wont to beat a retreat to his sanctum when waylaid by a reader or other person in quest of such assistance as , by the rules of the library , was to be rendered by a certain specified departmental superintendent or by some minor official .

		Between the mechanically perfect-running but otherwise worthless system by which a nickel-in-the-slot apparatus would furnish any 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, desired book , pamphlet , periodical , or piece of information , automatically registering the loan and return of books , and the unorganized , chaotic , hap-hazard way of conducting a library , there is surely a happy medium ; and this happy medium , with its maximum of quiet orderliness and frictionless efficiency , and its minimum of red tape and vexatious restrictions , every ear - nest library worker is more or less consciously striving to attain .

		Just now the pendulum has been set in full swing toward an unbureaucratic management of '' the people 's university , '' and this is well .

		What unnumbered disgusts and '' disgruntlements '' have been excited by the un - wise or untactful enforcement of rules not dic - tated by the ripest judgment !

		The weaknesses and prejudices of human nature insistently de - mand recognition in the formulation of library rules , so far as such rules must be formulated .

		What library worker can not recall instances of astonishing and often amusing sensitiveness or resentfulness in book-borrowers and readers ?

		There comes to mind a certain middle-aged man who had in an advanced stage of development what we call '' the library habit . ''

		That is , he was a frequent and long-staying visitor at the public library , without any manifest consistency or earnestness of purpose in his visits .

		But by some chance he had applied several times for a particular book that happened on each occasion to be out or misplaced , and the perhaps un - necessarily curt announcement of the book 's unprocurability , two or three times repeated in response to rapidly successive requests , begot in his mind a suspicion that it was being pur - posely and even malevolently withheld from him .

		As soon as the existence of this unjust suspicion was discovered , the man was reasoned with and the most convincing arguments were brought to bear upon his understanding , if he had any , to bring him to a saner frame of mind ; but all to no purpose , and he summarily with - drew his patronage from that library .

		Another instance of whimsical resentfulness recurs to memory .

		At a certain library where , as is universally the case , the demand for recent popular books is far in excess of the supply , applicants are notified by mail , upon request , when any desired work may be had .

		Moreover , in its praiseworthy attempt to do the greatest good to the greatest number , the library some - times sends these notices to those who have not asked for them , but who are known to have applied unsuccessfully for certain books .

		It was one such gratuitously-notified card-holder who one morning came snorting into the library and up to the delivery desk with a vigorous complaint against the authorities for bothering him with postal cards whenever he happened to ask for a book that was out .

		The tactful librarian is he who knows by something like intuition how to avoid all such ruffling episodes as the foregoing .

		Nothing mars the pleasure and impairs the usefulness of library work like these petty discords between the serving and the served .

		The importance of an ingratiating manner and an unfailing ability to avoid giving offense was felt by that public speaker who , in addressing a certain recent con - vention of librarians , began with the assertion that no one could hope to succeed in the profes - sion if he ate onions .

		The increasing attention now given to the '' human appeal '' side of library work is evidenced by the various affili - ated activities that are carried on under the modern library 's roof .

		It is rightly held that to make a good library-user of a person , he must be caught young .

		Hence the picture - exhibitions and the story-hours and , of late , the indoor games that serve as beneficent lures to turn many juvenile footsteps library - ward .

		Not only educative games , like Authors and Logo - machy , but even jackstraws and tiddledewinks receive the sanction of children 's librarians .

		From
Madison	PERSON	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, there comes word that the moving-picture apparatus has now been pressed into the service of the juvenile depart - ment at the public library , '' as an aid in making the library more fully an educational institu - tion . ''

		The story of
Sir Galahad	LOCATION	, of Oliver Twist , of
King Lear	PERSON	, or perhaps of
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, is first told in a brief and simple manner by the children 's librarian , and then the moving pictures present the same series of events to the eye , '' the scenery and costuming of the char - acters being in perfect accord with the theme . ''

		One can easily imagine the breathless interest with which the assembled little ones watch
Oliver	PERSON	as he extends his bowl for more gruel and encounters the scandalized astonishment of the poor-house officials .

		How many a
Dickens	PERSON	- lover , or potential Dickens-lover , must be then and there called into being !

		The question how far it is wise or indeed legitimate for the public library , established in accordance with certain State laws , to go into the business of furnishing mere amusement , however harmless and health - ful , to the children of its community , will never be settled by any hard and fast rule ; and it is undoubtedly well that the error , if any , should be on the side of indulgence and a large-minded and large-hearted interpretation of library law
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 rather than on that of bureaucratic stiffness and over - cautious conservatism .

		Something at any rate may be learned from errors of com - mission ; little or nothing by refusing to make experiments and strike out new paths .

		Our above-mentioned old-fashioned librarian chose to play toward his library somewhat the part of an absentee deity who winds up his universe and leaves it to run until it runs down .

		The modern librarian , on the other hand , feels himself to be something like an immanent pres - ence in his little world , and if he absents him - self even for a day the system tends to languish and suffer torpor .

		He resists the temptation , so natural to one having to do constantly with rules of classification , systems of labelling , and methods of shelving , to classify and label and shelve his helpers and his visitors and thereafter wash his hands of them .

		Ever on the alert for new and unexpected developments in human nature around him , and for fresh and unforeseen demands on his tact and resourcefulness , as well as on his stores of technical and general knowledge , he recognizes that there is no such thing as finality or completeness in library economy , and that the library with a flawless set of rules flawlessly enforced would be a hopelessly dead library .

		ECHOES FROM THE LIBRARY PRESS OF
1910	DATE	. ''

		The library world is still seeking an equilibrium between things essential and things non-essential , '' says Mr.
Charles E. Rush	PERSON	in the
January	DATE	number of the '' Library Journal , '' in an article called t ; Practical Problems in Reorganization Work . ''

		Among the non-essentials he classifies the greater part of library statistics , '' page after page of bare figures . '' ''

		Who cares for them and reads them '' ?

		he asks .

		The accession book is another fossil which he would like to see removed ; and he is not alone in his objections to it .

		Mr.
Rush	PERSON	refers to '' the per - sistent and increasing demands that are daily made by library patrons -LRB- and we know not by how many hundreds more of would-be patrons -RRB- to leave out the red tape in our rules , open the shelves , liberalize the allowance of books and the time limits , simplify our catalogues , show more books and less library ma - chinery . ''

		The library should carefully consider the needs of its constituency , the attitude of its patrons toward it , and not hesitate to reorganize if that seems to be the best way to meet the demands of the public .

		After all , the library exists to serve the public .

		The necessity of occasional reorganiza - tion is also pointed out by Mr.
W. Dawson Johnston	PERSON	, in his paper on '' The Librarian as an Educator , '' printed in the
October	DATE	number of the same periodi - cal . ''

		The work of organization , '' he says , '' is con - ceived to end with the establishment of the library .

		Now , from any point of view but a personal one , the establishment of a library is only the first step in its organization .

		Even a machine requires re - modelling ; much more an institution .

		The changes in the community , the changes in other institutions , and the changes in the institution itself make reorganization necessary . ''

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's paper discusses the position of the library towards the educational revolution of our day , and he urges that the services of the school to the library be con - sidered , it has in the past been neglected even by librarians for the discussion of how the library could serve the school .

		There are , he thinks , some things that the school does now that the library could do better , and he thinks that such topics in the curriculum as the reading of literature might well be taken from the school and turned over to the library .

		To quote from another part of the same paper : ' The demand for school extension has resulted in the establishment of evening schools ,
summer	DATE	schools , continuation schools , and other in - stitutions for adult education .

		In many cases , per - haps in most cases , these institutions have justified their establishment , but many times and in many places it would have been more economical and sometimes better to have provided added library facilities instead of added school facilities , or , per - haps , gardens and playgrounds . ''

		But would it ?

		That would depend on the personality , the interests , the sympathies of the librarians in charge .

		In the last part of the paper , Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	speaks of '' Research and Libraries , '' and here points out par - ticularly two defects of the present organization of libraries : that special collections coming to libraries either by bequest or by purchase are not kept up and added to through new purchases , and the lack of specialization in the reading-room service .

		The latter question was also taken up by Mr.
Frank P. Hill	PERSON	in his contribution to the symposium of '' Retrospect and Forecast '' which was presented at the annual meeting of the
New York Library Club	ORGANIZATION	in
May	DATE	, when the club celebrated its
first quarter century	DATE	, and printed in the
June	DATE	'' Library Journal . ''

		The retrospects were concerned with the changes that have taken place during the last twenty-five years , in statistics , methods , scope , and ideals .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	speaks of the possibilities of special - ization , pointing at a movement which became crys - tallized at the
A. L. A.	PERSON	conference of
1909	DATE	when the
Special Libraries Association	ORGANIZATION	was organized . ''

		The work thus initiated , '' he says , '' and for which there is a legitimate and , heretofore , practically unexplored field will no doubt go forward , though perhaps not through the medium of a separate organi - zation .

		More and more the need of specialization in libraries presents itself , and as resources become known students will turn from the free and reference libraries to special libraries , where they will find all material connected with their own line of work . ''

		And further : '' In order to ensure the efficient 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, handling of the many and varied collections result - ing from increased specialization , a staff of consult - ing librarians will probably be necessary to render the collections available , and it will only be in the spirit of cooperation that the best results will follow . ''

		Miss
Mary W. Plummer	PERSON	, in her contribution to the Forecast , dealing with the future of the library schools , urges what it may be permitted to say that the present writer has advocated for years , and which it is pleasant to see that a director of a library school has at last taken up , namely , the establishment of graduate schools of library administration and bibli - ography in connection with one or two universities .

		She characterizes the present situation aptly enough as chaotic , and says that she '' can see nothing to bring order out of this growing chaos but organiza - tion and systematization on a larger scale than any - thing we have tried .

		Let the general courses con - tinue for the younger people , for the general work , always having in view the discovery of talents and aptitudes for specialization ; and let there be two or three schools in the country , connected with univer - sities and an integral part of them , in which the study of technique and administration may be con - nected with an outline course in medicine , law , theol - ogy , science , pure and applied , civics , child study , or whatever specialty calls for training .

		A university frequently carries on a course followed by one or two students only , so that a paucity of applicants in any one division of the work would not mean dis - couragement or bankruptcy .

		What do I mean by an outline course ?

		To begin with , the history and biography of a science or an art ; a reading know - ledge of the languages in which its best treatises have been written ; a knowledge of the rarities and the curiosities of its literature ; an understanding of its terminology , past and present ; an acquaintance with its present development , tendency , literature , and practice , '' in other words , the history and bib - liography of scientific literature .

		Something of the same note is found in Mr.
Adam J. Strohm	PERSON	's paper read at the
Library School Section	ORGANIZATION	at the
1909	DATE	con - ference of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, entitled : '' Do We Need a
Postgraduate Library School	ORGANIZATION	, '' and printed in con - densed form in < k Public Libraries '' for
February	DATE	.

		`` In examining the study courses of the library schools one can not escape a sense of confusion from their mixture of trifles and ponderousness .

		Picture bulletins and story hours on one hand ; architecture and Latin paleography on the other .

		The student who may find interest in the one is not of the intel - lectual caliber that will master the other , while the college graduate and the more desirable library school students will frown at some of the food set before them .

		The library schools , in taking cogni - zance of certain manifestations of modernism in library methods and bidding scholarship to enter as well , are falling between two stools .

		It is feast for one and starvation for the other . ''

		Mr.
Louis N. Wilson	PERSON	, the librarian of
Clark Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , has again used the method of the question - naire , to bring out some mooted problems of library work ; this time his attention is drawn to the rela - tions between '' The Library and the Teaching Pro- fession , '' under which title the results of his inquiry are published in the
March	DATE	'' Public Libraries . ''

		He finds that '' the situation is hopeful , and one can not help the feeling that the problem is nearer solution than is generally supposed .

		Both sides are anxious to bring about changes , upon which they seem to be fairly well agreed , and all that remains to be done is to get to work and do it . ''

		But there is the rub , it seems ; for , after having given some examples of what a few librarians and teachers have to say about what should be done , and having cited a few instances of cooperation , he continues : '' But these are only a few bright spots amid a sea of gloom .

		In the great majority of cases libraries are still far behind what they might be and the teachers do not afford them the help they have a right to expect .

		Teachers are , as a rule , overworked , and librarians have to struggle for sufficient funds to keep the machine going . ''

		Turning to the con - siderations of ideal conditions , the author outlines briefly what may reasonably be asked of librarians and teachers in order to bring the conditions about . ''

		In the first place , libraries must make their books available to scholars .

		The day when people desir - ing to use books will be satisfied to be turned over to the tender mercies of a complicated card catalogue , has passed .

		Librarians should realize by this time that books placed in a closed stack room are fast dying , if not already dead books . '' ''

		There should be a large , well lighted , and well ventilated room set aside for students and teachers in the library .

		In this room the most expert attendant should be on duty and should seek the cooperation of the teachers in selecting and displaying books and artic - les of interest to the profession .

		Here library rules and regulations , necessary in dealing with the gen - eral public , perhaps , should be abolished , and no effort spared to aid the seeker after knowledge .

		Teachers in special lines should be induced to take a special interest in keeping the library advised of any new book that they consider of value or wish to see . ''

		To fill out the space at the bottom of the column where Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's article closes , the editor has printed the following quotation from Whately : '' It is folly to expect men to do all that they may reasonably be expected to do . ''

		What is probably the most important utterance made during the past year to any group of librarians may be read in the '' Presidential Address of Fred - erick
George Kenyon	PERSON	, Principal Librarian of the British Museum , '' in the
September	DATE	number of the British ''
Library Association Record	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	begins by saying that he is not a librarian in the ordinary sense of the term , the books with which he has had to deal having been manuscripts ; nor has the practical experience of the administration of a great library of printed books been his .

		He proposed , therefore , to deal , not with the practical application of any principles of librarianship , but
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJ 79 with some of these very principles themselves .

		He asks the pardon of the audience , if he , in so doing , ; should be found to utter a number of platitudes . ''

		It does us no harm , I think , sometimes to turn our thoughts from the details of our daily work to the principles which inform them and the ideals which inspire them .

		The principles and ideals may appear to be platitudes , but like many other platitudes , they are sometimes in danger of being overlooked in practice . '' ''

		Books , '' he says , '' may be roughly divided into three classes , the literature | of the imagination , the literature of knowledge , and the literature of pastime , '' and he gives a highly instructive and entertaining description of these three classes and the way in which they are inter - woven with each other to form the organic whole known as the world 's literature .

		The chief attrac - tion of a librarian 's position Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	sees in the opportunity to guide the reader 's taste . ''

		Many of his readers are , no doubt , persons in search of definite information with regard to their trade or profession ; many others are merely in search of an agreeable method of passing their leisure time , but others are young men and women in search of edu - cation and self-improvement , and to them the advice of the librarian may mean much . ''

		And he proceeds to disprove , with statistics -LRB- which , he says , though '' they often are dangerous things , and as unreliable as experts , '' often have '' a steadying effect on con - troversy '' -RRB- the current idea , popular , at least , with certain British newspapers and politicians , that libraries are chiefly concerned with the circulation of colorless and worthless fiction . ''

		Libraries should be the salt of the nation . ''

		And he feels that they have an important function before them in guiding the workingman -LRB- and probably not the workingman alone -RRB- from racing tips and foot-ball reports to '' the literature which gives refreshment and knowledge , the literature which gives ideas and expands the mind .

		This can not be done all at once .

		The desire for self-culture is not a plant of natural growth in this country , and in the past many influences have been hostile to it .

		The people of this country have for two generations listened to the doctrine that the pursuit of material self-interest is the law of human progress , and they can not now readily assimilate the doctrine of self-culture and self-training for the good of the community ... The man who considers his own material welfare the sole subject of importance may , if he is ignorant enough , think that material welfare will come to him from the study of betting news ; at least it is not for those whose daily occupation is the fluctuation of rubber shares to contradict him .

		A higher stage is reached when a man studies the literature of his own trade or profession in order that he may get on in it .

		The motive is still material self-interest , but it is self-interest of a more enlightened kind , and exercised on nobler subjects .

		It involves a training of the intellect which may lead to higher things .

		Yet a further stage is reached when the reader seeks knowledge for its own sake , from the sense of the mysterious attractions of knowledge , the wonders of nature , of mechanical science , of human life and thought .

		And the highest stage of all apart from that mystery of the intercourse of man with his Creator , of which I will not speak here the highest stage of all is reached when a man realizes that his supreme duty is not self-interest , but self-training in the interest of the community . ''

		In the latter part of his address , Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	touches upon the preparation of the librarian for his duties , the chief of which he summarizes as being concerned with the selection of the books for the library , the making them accessible to the public , and the guid - ance of the readers in their use . ''

		The first is a matter of knowledge , subject an important pro- viso to financial limitations .

		The second is a matter of technical training in classification and cataloguing .

		The third is a matter again of knowl - edge , but still more of tact and sympathy . ''

		And he closes with the following appreciation of his former colleague , the late
Richard Garnett	PERSON	: '' His knowledge , which ranged from astrology to horse racing , approached omniscience ; if he had not the actual information you required at his fingers ' ends , he could almost certainly tell you where to look for it , and knew something of what had been done and written with regard to it ; he had a reverence for every kind of work and research , and could enter into the feelings and aspirations of any one who would consult him ; and his good-nature was in - exhaustible . ''


AKSEL G. S. JOSEPHSOX	PERSON	.

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		TOLSTOY 'S DESIRE OF SECLUSION was long cherished by him before his secret departure from
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	in the
early morning of Nov. 10	DATE	.

		A letter written to his wife thirteen years ago but not to be delivered to her until after his death has now appeared in print , in the
St. Petersburg Novoe Vremya	ORGANIZATION	, and reveals a state of domestic friction that had long ago become hardly bearable to the earnest apostle of the simple life . ''

		Long have I been tormented , '' he writes , '' by the discord between my life and my beliefs .

		To compel you all to change your life , the habits to which I myself had accustomed you , I could not ; and to leave you ere this I also could not , believing that I should thus deprive the children , while they were little , of whatever small influence I could have over them , and that I should grieve you .

		On the other hand , to continue to live as I have lived these sixteen years , struggling and irritating you or falling myself under those influences and temptations to which I had become accustomed and by which I am sur - rounded , I also can not ... The chief thing is that just as the Hindus nearing sixty retire into the woods , and as old religious men seek to devote their last years to God and not to jokes , puns , gossip , or tennis , so for me , enteriag my seventieth year , the soul-absorbing desire is for tranquillity , for solitude , 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, and , if not for entire harmony , at least not for crying discord between my life and my beliefs and conscience . ''

		A still more recent communication to the press from Mr.
P. A. Boulanger	PERSON	, an intimate friend of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's , and one who was with him at the end , pictures in harrowing detail the increasingly inharmonious state of affairs at
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	during the last few years .

		Hopelessly unadjustable differences of ideals and aspirations , of tempera - ment and of the sense of what is demanded by con - science , made the Tolstoy home life a growing agony for the ardent reformer and moralist , and scarcely less so for his wife and those others of his house - hold who failed to share his views .

		AMATEUR CENSORSHIP OF CURRENT LITERATURE , pithily expressed in terms of uncompromising direct - ness , may be found in almost any much-used public library list of recent accessions , especially in fiction .

		Written in pencil against various titles in these lists , and sometimes even on the cards in the card catalogue , one encounters such brief and emphatic commendatory or condemnatory expressions as `` Fine , '' `` A 1 , '' '' Tip-top , ''
O. K.	PERSON	, '' `` N. G. , '' `` Rotten , '' `` Mush , '' `` Horrid . ''

		These and other like nut-shell criticisms serve to warn and advise succeed - ing readers much as the symbols adopted by profes - sional wanderers , and found on gate-posts and tree - trunks and dead walls along the highway , constitute a code understood and heeded by every member of the guild who is in search of a desirable place of re - freshment and rest .

		Another significant though mute and involuntary seal of approval or disap - proval is the appearance of the book itself .

		It is astonishing how invariably the more interesting books quickly shed their cloth covers and get them - selves enrolled in the library-bound regiment , and how a failure to win this promotion within six months ordinarily means permanent exclusion from the favored company .

		Critical comment , written in the book itself , especially at the very end , is not uncommon , however strongly discouraged by the rnling powers .

		All this unlawful scribbling is of course very wrong , but the actuating motive is altruistic .

		Being invariably anonymous , it can bring no fame or acknowledgment of any kind to the discerning and public-spirited critic .

		RECENT LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN
MARYLAND	LOCATION	reveals progress toward better things in that far too sparsely be-libraried State .

		The revised library law of
1910	DATE	created a
Maryland	LOCATION	Public Library Com - mission , in place of the
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	which had existed since
1902	DATE	; and it gives to the new body certain `` additional functions of advising and stimulating the establishment of County and
Election District Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, and of purchasing and sending one hundred dollars worth of books to lib - raries established under the Act . ''

		The county lib - rary system , as illustrated so creditably by the
Washington	LOCATION
County Free Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Hagerstown	LOCATION	, appears to meet local needs and fit in with local conditions in a way hardly possible throughout the country at large ; yet the hastening of the day when every
Maryland	LOCATION	village shall have its own perma - nent library administered by its own chosen officers is to be prayed for .

		We note in the '' First Annual Report '' of the newly constituted
Commission	ORGANIZATION	that whereas the new library law , as originally drafted , provided for a yearly appropriation of
five thousand dollars	MONEY	to carry on the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's activities , this amount was cut by the legislative shears to fifteen hundred , thus cruelly crippling that zealous band of workers .

		But , as in a damage suit , it was probably understood on both sides that the sum asked for would undergo a process of subtraction , the only question being the exact size of the subtrahend .

		LITERARY AND OTHER DUAL PERSONALITIES , such as the late
William Sharp	PERSON	, who was both
Saxon	PERSON	and Celt the latter under the pseudonym of ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	'' - are likely to have new light thrown on their complexities of mental and moral structure by the new method just introduced at the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Hospital of studying and treating nervous diseases .

		The nervous person , according to Dr.
Sigmund Freud	PERSON	of
Vienna	LOCATION	, the inventor of this new method , is nervous simply because his un - conscious half is craving some satisfaction or some activity that is withheld .

		This possession on our part of a dual nature is of course a matter of com - mon knowledge ever since '' The Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	'' reminded us of it .

		To learn what this latent self is thus dumbly and feebly groping for , it is proposed to subject the patient 's dreams to expert interpretation , and thereby to supply the want and cure the nervousness .

		All very good , we say , if the thing the unconscious self is trying to do or to attain is harmless , like writing poetry or translating Homer or acquiring a copy of the original edition of '' Rasselas '' ; perhaps some mute inglorious
Milton	PERSON	may by this means be rend - ered vocal and illustrious .

		But if one 's subliminal consciousness is fretting for the summary extinction of a hated enemy or an odious rival , or if the un - conscious part of a person is longing to seize and devour some particularly luscious specimen of for - bidden fruit , what then ?

		THE CRIMINAL 'S TASTE IN LITERATURE , so far as that taste has been noted by public library workers in reference to the incarcerated criminal , is surpris - ingly and encouragingly high .

		Possibly , and indeed probably , in his native habitat he might not give the impression of possessing delicate discrimination in the matter of reading ; but in the quiet seclusion of prison life he most often chooses from the books offered him those that have stood the test of time and have earned the right to be called classics .

		The current report of the
Vermont Board of Library Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	emphasizes the fact that from the traveling libraries sent for the last three years to the
State Prison	ORGANIZATION	the books borrowed by the convicts have been handled very carefully , have been much read , and evince a demand `` for a better class of reading than the average patron of a public library
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 calls for . ''

		Among other
Vermont	LOCATION	library notes of interest it is cheering to read that all but sixty-seven of the two hundred and forty : six towns and cities in the
State	ORGANIZATION	are now provided with established libraries ; and of the unprovided sixty-seven , seven - teen have traveling library stations .

		When it is remembered that
Vermont	LOCATION	's total population is little more than half that of
Boston	LOCATION	, these figures become significant of much .

		EDUCATION AND EFFICIENCY are related to each other , necessarily and increasingly , in this strenu - ous age of ours ; and if a school or college is ineffi - cient in its methods or wasteful in its expenditures , it is likely to be made unpleasantly aware of the fact at an early stage in its struggle for existence .

		This truism by way of introduction to some brief men - tion of an elaborate investigation into `` Academic and Industrial Efficiency '' that has been conducted under the auspices of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the Advancement of Teaching , and whose results are presented in '' Bulletin Number Five '' of that
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Morris Llewellyn Cooke	PERSON	, a mech - anical engineer and not a teacher , and therefore without the prejudices of a teacher , has made this investigation and written a full account of his find - ings .

		Eight institutions of learning were visited , and their department of physics was subjected to a searching scrutiny . ''

		It may well be , '' remarks President
Pritchett	PERSON	in a Preface to the printed re - port , '' that a thorough-going administrative study of the income and expenditure of one of our large and newly grown universities may be more helpful to it at this moment than more money .

		We have gone through a period of great expansion .

		Just now a critical examination and appreciation of what we are getting out of the expansion is probably more to be desired than further expansion . ''

		These words , ut - tered just at the moment when the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, over which Dr.
Pritchett	PERSON	presided before assuming his present office , is urging acute need of funds to meet the increasing demands made upon it , or even to continue its activities at all , have a peculiar significance and timeliness .

		THE GROWTH OF THE LlBBABY OF CONGRESS has been so increasingly rapid under its present able head as almost to make the observer gasp for breath .

		The current `` Report of the Librarian , '' a bound volume of three hundred and five octavo pages , shows noteworthy recent development in all departments .

		A few random notes from its rich pages will convey even to the unbibliothecal mind a sense of the vastness and vigor of this our national library .

		Whereas there were but one hundred and twenty-five persons employed when Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	took office not so very long ago , there are now three hundred and thirteen engaged in the library 's various departments .

		Its book collection numbers one million seven hundred and ninety-three thousand volumes .

		Its expenditures for the last fiscal year were more than eight hundred thousand dollars .

		Its bindery handled thirty-one thousand volumes .

		Its copyright department registered more than one hundred thousand books , pamphlets , and other items .

		Finally , the libraries subscribing to its printed catalogue cards form a list filling thirty-five pages of the Report .

		But to gain a clear concep - tion of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	's manifold and ever-inreasing activities , one needs to examine the Report itself , which is obtainable at a nominal price .

		THE STOEY OF A BYBON MANUSCRIPT of con - siderable interest to autograph-collectors and
Byron	PERSON	- lovers was recently told in the '' Pall Mall Gazette . ''

		It was the discerning eye of a
London	LOCATION	bookseller , Mr.
Charles J. Sawyer	PERSON	, of New Oxford Street , that recognized the peculiar worth of a bit of writing lately offered for sale by a Nottingham auctioneer .

		The treasure was secured by Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	, and proves to be the original draft of the poet 's epitaph to his dog
Boatswain	PERSON	, who died in
1808	DATE	and was buried in the garden at
Newstead Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, not far from the spot where his master was to be interred
sixteen years later	DATE	.

		The manuscript , given by the poet to the family of Job
Turton	PERSON	, the man who erected -LRB- at a cost of one hundred pounds -RRB- the monument that attested the grief of the dog 's master , passed from hand to hand until finally it was carried to the auc - tion room by a granddaughter of
Turton	PERSON	, and so came to public view and into Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	's possession .

		THE EFFECT OF BOOK EXHIBITIONS AT COUNTY FAIRS is encouraging .

		Note has already been made here of last autumn 's experiment , particularly in
Indiana	LOCATION	and
Vermont	LOCATION	, with carefully selected col - lections of agricultural and other works as a new feature at the annual `` cattle-show . ''

		And now from
Indiana	LOCATION	, on the authority of Dr.
Stanley Coulter	PERSON	of
Purdue University	ORGANIZATION	, as quoted in the current issue of the '' Library Occurrent , '' we learn that '' ap - proximately five hundred dollars ' worth of purely agricultural books were sold to them \ i. e. the farm - ers -RSB- from a collection of about 75 volumes exhibited at the county fairs this present
summer	DATE	and
fall	DATE	. ''

		What further stimulus to reading and to miscellan - eous book-buying should be credited to these literary exhibits will never be known , but from the general interest shown on the part of the rural public it may be confidently reckoned as considerable .

		THE PBOPEB INGBEDIENTS OF A TEA YELLING LIBBABY must depend largely on the nature of the communities it is designed to serve .

		Among rural readers , especially feminine readers , one is not surprised to find the borrowers following the example of the small child that eats the frosting of its cake first and then , surfeited with sweet , perhaps takes little or nothing of the more substantial and nutritious under-layer .

		From the `` Fifth Biennial Report of the
Nebraska	LOCATION	Public Library Commis - sion '' we learn that the book collections now visit - ing the prairie settlements of that promising com - monwealth have perforce been reduced to little else than fiction .

		Starting originally with ten works of fiction , ten of a more serious nature , and twenty 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, children 's books , these travelling libraries have shown so extremely little wear and tear in the non-fiction section that gradually they have undergone the transformation indicated above , while the eliminated idle books have been set apart as a reserve collec - tion from which to supply study clubs , individual students , or other persons desiring reading matter of a serious sort .

		Eighty-three counties of
Nebraska	LOCATION	have in the
last two years	DATE	profited by the
Commis	PERSON	- sion 's services in this sending out of good literature , four hundred and forty-two requests for travelling libraries having been responded to .

		THE ORGANIZATION OF HARVABD LIBRARIES under one administrative head has at last been effected .

		In its various schools and departments the university numbers more than thirty separate librar - ies beside the main one in
Gore Hall	PERSON	, and hitherto each of these has had its own librarian who has dis - charged his duties with no strict regard to the policy and proceedings of the other libraries .

		Now , how - ever , to provide an administrative head of the entire system , the university authorities have created the post of
Director of University Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, and have appointed as its first incumbent Professor
Archibald Gary Coolidge	PERSON	, of the class of
' 87	DATE	, who has long been a liberal giver of his time and his means to the library of his alma mater .

		This coordination of university libraries , like that which has recently been intro - duced at
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, should be of great service to the interests of economy and efficiency .

		YASNAYA POLYANA AS AN INTERNATIONAL PEACE MEMORIAL , which is the disposition of the estate said to be favored by the
Tolstoy	PERSON	family , would serve a larger purpose than if simply set apart by
Russia	LOCATION	as a
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	museum .

		There is no reason why the great peace-advocate 's old home should not be preserved both as a memorial to him and as an impressive reminder of his earnest protest against war .

		A nephew of the late Count has recently ar - rived in this country on a mission , it is rumored , to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	for the purpose of interesting that wealthy promoter of peace in the proposed plan .

		Unless Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	chooses to give his personal attention to the matter , here would seem to be a piece of work cut out for the trustees of the lately - established
Carnegie Peace Fund	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE TARDY ACCEPTANCE OF A CARNEGIE LI - BRARY that was generously offered to the
District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	seven years ago is now gratefully noted in the current report of the
Washington	LOCATION	Pub -
lic Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		As mentioned by us in a previous issue , the difficulty of getting our national legisla - tors to focus their gaze on so small a matter as a branch library for
Takoma Park	LOCATION	has seemed for years all but insuperable .

		But the impossible has at last been accomplished ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has actually consented to concern itself with so trivial a detail as a forty-thousand dollar library building , and the offered present to the people of the District has been formally accepted , with the somewhat niggardly stipulation , however , that no provision for mainten - ance shall be made over and above ten per cent of the total cost of the building an unwise economy , to be sure ; but we must save our pennies for the fortifying of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE QUESTION OF LIBRARY RENEWALS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The paragraph in a recent issue of THE DIAL with reference to the renewal of books in this Library , as discussed in our last annual report , came to my atten - tion about the time I was leaving the city , and the matter was pushed aside and overlooked until the present time .

		Permit me to go into the question of renewals a little more fully than it was discussed in our annual report , bearing in mind that what I have to say does not apply to new fiction seven-day books .

		We look upon this whole matter as chiefly one of administration , for most of the mistakes or misunderstandings with the public which arise in the circulating department are in connec - tion with renewals , persons thinking that books had been renewed when they were not , and therefore becoming subject to fine .

		Furthermore , renewals are given practically to everyone who asks for them , so that anyone who wishes to retain a book four weeks gets it for the asking .

		If the
Library	ORGANIZATION	is willing to let him have the book four weeks -LRB- provided he asks for it -RRB- it seems to us that it would eliminate a lot of red tape and trouble to cut out the renewals and allow the bor - rower to keep the book the straight four weeks if he wished to do so , without bothering him to have the book renewed in order to escape a fine .

		Most libraries in renewing books -LRB- many of them taking the request for renewal over the telephone -RRB- count the renewal as a second issue , and in that way the statistics of circulation are swollen ; but I believe that that is not the best way for a Library to increase its circulation .

		To have some one sit at a telephone desk all day taking requests for the renewal of books and then count those requests as circulation , is going through the motions , but without giving any real ser - vice .

		I believe that the sooner our libraries cut out all make-believe service of this kind the better it will be for them and for their communities .

		I might add that at least two well-known libraries -LRB-
Newark	LOCATION	and
Pitts	PERSON	- burgh -RRB- have abolished renewals , or restricted them to fiction , to the great satisfaction of all concerned .

		There are many books which it is impossible for a busy person to get through with in two weeks , and a fixed time limitation of that kind is in reality a limita - tion to the real usefulness of the library .

		I personally know of many such cases .

		In some instances it is true that to lengthen the retention period would curtail the general usefulness of the books ; but these instances are comparatively very few , and the time , trouble , and dis - satisfaction that this Library would save by abolishing renewals would , I believe , more than enable it to pay for the few additional duplicates that might be neces - sary .

		The best place for almost every library book in the circulation department is in the hands of some borrower , and not on the shelves waiting for the possible time when someone may want to use it .

		In every large library there are thousands of volumes that do not circu - late once in three years , and some not once in ten years .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 83 In short , as we see the problem in
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	, the abolishment of renewals would make for a better and more satisfactory service , thereby enabling the people to get more real use out of the library than they can get at present .

		It should be understood , however , that no definite action has yet been taken in the matter ; the abolishment of renewals was simply recommended in our last annual report .


SAMUEL H. KAXCK	PERSON	.

		HISTORY AND MACAULAY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		That my note on '' The Writing of History '' should have called forth the scholarly paper of ''
J. W. T.	PERSON	'' is greatly to its credit .

		It is the more so , however , that so able a pleader should have been compelled to resort to the dexterous parry the lawyers call a plea by way of confession and avoidance .

		For he admits all that is claimed for Macaulay , but denies that the latter lacks appreciation in the house of the doctrinaires .

		Whose , then , are all the sneers I have been hearing for wellnigh fifty years ?

		To all seeming they came straight from the schools of the pedants of research .

		It is true , they were couched in English so clumsy as forever to debar them from reaching posterity .

		Pos - sibly his good taste has spared ''
J. W. T.	PERSON	'' the pain of reading them .

		This correspondent also makes the point that there have been good writers of history since
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and instances a number of them .

		I gratefully agree with him , and wish that there were more of them .

		But surely this in no way contravenes my contention that the school of
Stubbs	PERSON	and
Freeman	PERSON	which had such vogue in the last generation and still influences the present deliberately slighted the graces of style and somehow infused into their admirers the notion that accuracy and bareness or slovenliness of diction were inseparable .

		The argument , based on the declaration that
Macaulay	PERSON	was a great artist and that we must not look to see his like in many an age , strikes me as having little bearing on the subject .

		It would be absurd for everybody to try to write like Macaulay : to use his methods and to adopt his spirit is a very different matter ; and it is all that I contended for .

		Mannerism is a poor equipment for an author of any kind .

		What Professors
Adams	PERSON	and Hodder say of the neces - sity for thorough investigation before the work of the true historian begins , is of course sound doctrine ; but there certainly is no intrinsic necessity for even the most careful and painstaking investigator to put crude material before the public and call it history .

		Yet that is what many have been doing , with but little adverse criticism to deter them .

		As for Dr.
Carl Becker	PERSON	, he tells us frankly that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	bores him .

		Impossible as it is to understand his point of view , one must surmise that this judgment is based wholly on the attempt to read the History , and not the historical essays .

		It is inconceivable that any one should fail to find the latter delightful .

		As this gentleman dislikes Latin quotations -LRB- yet rashly uses one -RRB- , I shall not quote the old adage as to tastes , but only remark that there are also those in this generation whom
Walter Scott	PERSON	bores , just as there were few at the Restoration period who could abide
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		But one can forgive anything to a man who has so sound an opinion in regard to doctors ' theses .

		TOI.STOY , ROMANCER AND REFORMER .

		* An unforeseen timeliness marks the appear - ance of Mr.
Aylmer Maude	PERSON	's '' Life of Tolstoy . ''

		Brought to a conclusion only a few months before the great Russian 's death , and published almost simultaneously with that closing of the book of his life , the biography , in its two thick volumes of fine print , presents a complete and authoritative account of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life-history .

		The writer 's twenty-three years ' residence in
Russia	LOCATION	, and his intimate acquaintance with the author-moralist whose works he and Mrs.
Maude	PERSON	have done so much to render accessible to En - glish readers , together with
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's expressed confidence in his biographer 's scholarly equip - ment and thorough trustworthiness , inspire a not unreasonable confidence in the elaborate work now offered to the British and American public after a careful revision at the hands of
Countess Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The treatment of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life and character naturally divides itself into two parts : the his - tory of the romancer and the history of the reformer ; and to each of these a volume is devoted , although with much inevitable over - lapping on both sides .

		These two personalities of the man become more and more at war with each other as he grows older , the moralist and reformer finally almost displacing the creative artist of the earlier years .

		But while the two natures are felt to be mutually antagonistic , each grievously hampering the free activity of the other , they yet in a certain sense aid and strengthen each other ; for without his deep moral convictions Tolstoy could not have made his fiction so impressive and of so powerful appeal to humanity at large , nor without his fine mastery of literary art could he have reached so many readers with his ethical , religious , and social-reform writings .

		How early the serious problems of life , and even some of the abstruse questions of meta - physics , began to interest him is revealed in the story of his life .

		It even appears that when about twelve years of age he arrived , unaided , at a pretty clear notion of the meaning of '' solipsism , '' without of course knowing that this was its name .

		A passage from his much later written '' Boyhood , '' quoted by Mr.
Maude	PERSON	, makes this apparent .

		As revealing thus early the combined speculative , self-indulgent , and * THE LIFE OF TOLSTOY .

New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		84 -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, self-chastising elements in his nature the fol - lowing extract is significant : '' It will hardly be believed what were the favorite and most common subjects of my reflection in my boy - hood go incompatible were they with my age and situation ... At one time the thought occurred to me that happiness does not depend on external causes , but on our relation to them ; and that a man accustomed to bear suffering can not be unhappy .

		To accustom myself therefore to endurance , I would hold
Tatishef	ORGANIZATION	's dictionaries in my outstretched hand for five minutes at a time , though it caused me terrible pain ; or I would go to the lumber room and flog myself on my bare back with a cord so severely that tears started to my eyes .

		At another time , suddenly remembering that death awaits me every hour and every minute , I decided -LRB- wondering why people had not understood this before -RRB- that man can only be happy by enjoying the present and not thinking of the future ; and for three days , under the influence of this thought , I abandoned my lessons , and did nothing but lie on my bed and enjoy myself , reading a novel and eating honey-gingerbreads , on which I spent my last coins ... But no philosophic current swayed me so much as scepticism , which at times brought me to the verge of insanity .

		I imagined that except myself no one and nothing existed in the world , that objects are not objects but apparitions , ap - pearing only when I pay attention to them , and disap - pearing as soon as I cease to think of them ... There were moments in which , under the influence of this fixed idea , I reached such a stage of absurdity that I glanced quickly round hoping to catch Nothingness by surprise where I was not . ''

		Very early there appear signs of his zeal for reform , and his restless desire to make over the world according to the ideal that , for the time being , presented itself to him as the pattern of perfection .

		In one of his many and usually discreditable love affairs we find him actually engaged to be married to an apparently respect - able girl ; but in a sudden fit of moral reform he allowed himself to assume toward her the role which , twenty-five years later , he was to play for the benefit of the world at large , and reproached her with the unworthy and frivolous nature of her interests and occupations , giving vent to some scathing sarcasms against the fashionable society she found so delightful , and making himself so odious to the lively young lady that one can not be surprised at the dis - continuance , not long afterward , of their inti - macy .

		Some of the hereditary influences that shaped
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's character are traced by the author .

		On his father 's side , and still more on his mother 's , he came of aristocratic stock more or less in passive opposition to the ruling powers and sharing the humanitarian sympathies prev - alent in the early years of the reign of Alexan - der I .

		A cousin of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's mother was one of the Decembrists , and on the accession of
Nicholas	PERSON	in
1825	DATE	participated in their unsuc - cessful attempt to establish a constitutional government ; for which he was exiled to eastern
Siberia	LOCATION	for thirty years and condemned to hard labor in irons for a part of that period .

		From
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's mother it was that Tolstoy the novelist inherited his genius for romance and his remark - able language sense .

		She was a woman of education , had five languages at her command , and possessed a remarkable gift for impromptu fictitious narrative of the most delightful de - scription .

		In the same way that afterward the son could hold a circle of army comrades spell - bound by the charm of his improvised tales , so the mother would in her maidenhood draw around her a group of companions who gladly forsook the fascinations of the ball to hear her tell a story in a dark room where her shyness would be shielded by the gloom . ''

		Her most valuable quality , '' Tolstoy has related , '' was that though hot-tempered she was yet self - restrained . ''

		Of the father , early cut off by an attack of apoplexy , some pleasing traits are sketched in '' Childhood , '' from which it ap - pears that he was most agreeably remembered by the son as '' sitting with grandmother on the sofa , helping her to play Patience .

		My father , '' he adds , '' was polite and tender with every one , but to my grandmother he was always parti - cularly tenderly submissive . ''

		Leo was the youngest of the five children -LRB- four sons and a daughter -RRB- born to
Nicholas	PERSON	and
Marie Tolstoy	PERSON	, and he lost his mother in
1830	DATE	, when he was not much over eighteen months old , and his father
seven years later	DATE	.

		His
Aunt Tatiana	PERSON	-LRB- in reality a very distant relative , but affec - tionately called '' aunty '' by the orphans -RRB- was in some sort a mother to
Leo	PERSON	after his own mother 's death , and seems to have had great influence over him .

		Tolstoy 's university days at
Kazan	PERSON	and
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, his army experiences in the
Caucasus	LOCATION	and in the Crimean War , the irregularities and impetuosities that preceded his happy marriage at the age of thirty-four , and his subsequent fruitful years at
Moscow	LOCATION	and at
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	-LRB- his birthplace and the part of the family property that fell to his share when he came of age -RRB- , are all treated with fulness of detail by his biographer , who has made wise use of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's own writings , both his letters and his published works , to illustrate his development and indicate his dominant aims and interests .

		It is not surprising to find that from the very start
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's writing activities were hampered in the most trying fashion by the official censor
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 of the press .

		In an early letter to his brother Sergius he complains that `` Childhood was spoilt and The Raid simply ruined by the Censor .

		All that was good in it has been struck out or mutilated . ''

		With no freedom in the literary expression of his germinating ideas and ideals , the wonder is that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	gained so early and so marked success as he did .

		The non-Russian reader of his life will see reason to be thankful not to owe submission to any such despicable satellite of despotism as strove to put out the new light that was breaking on the world of letters in the middle of the last century .

		Characteristic criticisms of his earlier works are quoted by Mr.
Maude	PERSON	from the author 's own lips .

		These comments , it will of course be remembered , are from Tolstoy the reformer .

		`` He told me that in War and Peace and
Anna Karenina	PERSON	his aim was simply to amuse his readers .

		I am bound to accept his statement ; but one has only to read either of those books to see that through them
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ardent nature found vent , with all its likes and dislikes , strivings , yearnings , hopes , and fears .

		I asked
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	why in What is Art f he relegates these great novels to the realm of ' bad art ' ; and his answer showed , as I expected it would , that he does not really consider them at all bad , but condemns them merely as being too long , and written in a way chiefly adapted to please the leisured well-to-do classes , who have time for reading novels in several volumes , because other people do their rough work for them .

		Of War and Peace he said , ' It is , one would think , harmless enough , but one never knows how things will affect people , ' and he went on to mention , with regret , that one of Profes - sor
Zaharin	ORGANIZATION	's daughters had told him that from his novels she had acquired a love of balls and parties ; things of which , at the time of our conversation , he heartily disapproved . ''

		Like all authors of repute ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	was sought out and more or less grievously pestered by aspiring and admiring young writers , poets , and would-be poets , and by the idle curious who swarm about a celebrity of any sort .

		To one of these uninvited visitors , who had brought a set of verses with him and desired the great man 's opinion of them , he delivered himself in the following frank and characteristic fashion : '' There is nothing original here ; and besides , every - body writes poems nowadays .

		There are hundreds and hundreds of people turning them out !

		And not one of them writes a single good line .

		In the days of Poushkin and LeVmontof there used to be poetry , but not now .

		Verses have gone out of fashion .

		And what 's the good of them ?

		You will agree that prose expresses our thoughts much better it is easier to read and has more sense in it .

		Take our conversation , for instance : We say what we want to .

		But if some one tried to put it into verse , it would come out all upside-down .

		Wher - ever a definite , clear expression is wanted , it either spoils the rhythm , or does n't suit the style : and one has to substitute some other word , often far from the real meaning . ''

		Little has here been said of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's later labors .

		With these , and with the abnormal place in his mind occupied by the sex question , the second volume of Mr.
Maude	PERSON	's work chiefly concerns itself .

		One can not but be disagreeably impressed with the strength and persistence of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's animal passions , and with his morbid fondness for puzzling over the eternally insol - uble sex problem .

		His biographer , in pictur - ing him as gaining in old age a glorious victory over his baser nature , gives him perhaps too much credit .

		The low desires that we gradually outgrow we are always too prone to regard as triumphantly overcome .

		The reason why Tolstoy himself , and why this life of him , are so fascinatingly interesting must be chiefly because the man so strikingly illustrates the duality in all human nature .

		He is ever at war with himself , and yet no com - plete conquest on either side is possible or , indeed , desirable .

		The study of his troubled life helps one better to understand what is meant by the '' eternal antinomies . ''

		PEXXSYL.VAXIA EV HISTORY .

		*
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has always been somewhat in the case of the man who lost his shadow .

		How - ever great or formidable it was , it did not seem to project any effluence beyond itself ; people did not see any
Brocken	PERSON	spirit cast upon the clouds .

		The good and sufficient reason for this has been the distrust and depreciation of litera - ture which has always prevailed in the
Keystone State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	blood , the Dutch tempera - ment , the tincture of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	spirit a spirit which has always seen everything in society as Malebranche saw everything in God , have combined to keep down any literary outburst or output .


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has been a bitter stepmother to her imaginative sons ; at best , it has regarded them as a hen does her brood of ducklings .

		While
New England	LOCATION	made idols of its writers ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has turned such unprofitable children out of doors for fear that they might impart some touch of color to the drab of its disposition or suspend for a single minute the maxims of Poor
Richard	PERSON	.

		It has been
Sparta	LOCATION	in act but
Bosotia	LOCATION	in thought .

		PENNSYLVANIA IN
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By Hon.
Samuel Whitaker Penny-packer	PERSON	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
William J. Campbell	PERSON	.

		86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, It has said to all within its borders , '' Do some - thing useful , and be honored .

		Invent a shovel , or be a magistrate . ''

		It has never realized that imagination and enthusiasm and charm pre - vail more mightily over mankind than utility .

		What is the result ?


New England	LOCATION	's influence has been , and is , dominant from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	; the sayings and doings of a group of not absolutely first-rate writers are treasured all over the world .

		There are people in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	who really think that
America	LOCATION	consists of
Concord	LOCATION	,
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	,
Walden Pond	ORGANIZATION	, and
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		But
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has depended on the Deed and despised the Word , and the Word and the world have left it severely alone .

		No charge of disregarding the Word can be brought against Ex-Governor
Pennypacker	PERSON	, whose book on ''
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in American History '' has just been published .

		For many years the author has held up the historian 's torch to illuminate the greatness and virtues of his
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has not only had to face criti - cism and misrepresentation from without , but some hatred and obloquy from his own folk .

		To be shot in the back by the soldiers you are trying to urge to victory is the hardest fate that can befall a captain .

		The deeds and men of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	have been mighty , in very truth .

		Take its generals of the Civil War ,
Meade	PERSON	,
McClellan	PERSON	, Han - cock ,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
McCall	PERSON	,
Humphreys	PERSON	,
Birney	PERSON	,
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Park	LOCATION	,
Naglee	LOCATION	,
Smith	PERSON	,
Cadwallader	PERSON	,
Crawford	PERSON	,
Heintzelman	PERSON	,
Franklin	PERSON	,
Gregg	PERSON	,
Geary	LOCATION	,
Pennypacker	PERSON	, and
Hartranft	PERSON	.

		It is hardly too much to say that this galaxy equalled in military talents and proved effi - ciency all that all the other
Northern States	LOCATION	contributed to the officering of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	armies .

		Or take its three great names of the Revolution ,
Franklin	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	, and
Wayne	PERSON	.

		The success of the American cause was probably due as much to them as to any other three who can be named .

		Ex-Governor
Pennypacker	PERSON	shows that
Morris	PERSON	financed the Revolution ,
Stephen Girard	PERSON	the War of
1812	DATE	, and
Jay Cooke	PERSON	the Civil War .

		Franklin was of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	birth , but his life-work was done in
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania .

		There are really two Franklins , one , the great patriot , statesman , and philoso - pher , who loomed so large in the eyes of his contemporaries both here and in
Europe	LOCATION	; and the other the business man and retailer of petty proverbs , who was nothing - in his own day , but who has since become the Franklin of fame and has stamped himself on the American mind .

		Ex-Governor
Pennypacker	PERSON	quotes from
Henry Adams	PERSON	's History of the
United States	LOCATION	this pas - sage : `` If the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	succeeded , the good sense , liberality , and democratic spirit of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	had a right to claim credit for the result . ''

		And again : '' Had
New England	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Virginia	LOCATION	been swept out of ex - istence in
1800	DATE	, democracy could have better spared them all than have lost
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	. ''

		Ex - Governor
Pennypacker	PERSON	discusses such matters as the history of
Congress Hall	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	,
George Washington	PERSON	in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, German Immigration , the Dutch Patroons of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, the High - Water Mark of British Invasion ,
Gettsyburg	LOCATION	, and a number of other allied subjects .

		One of the most engaging and valuable of his contri - butions to history is a somewhat extended biog - raphy of General
Anthony Wayne	PERSON	.

		Though one of the most popular of American heroes , as his sobriquet '' Mad Anthony '' and the efflor - escence of his name all over our map show , the facts of
Wayne	PERSON	's career are little known .

		He fought from
Canada	LOCATION	in the North to
Georgia	LOCATION	in the South , and in after life against the Indians in
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		His most daring exploit the capture of
Stony Point	ORGANIZATION	remains perhaps the most bril - liant feat of arms in our history .

		With four - teen hundred men he attacked and captured a fort on a steep hill a hundred and fifty feet high , defended by six hundred British troops with eight cannon .

		But he was practically in everything during the Revolution the battles of
Brandywine	ORGANIZATION	,
Germantown	LOCATION	,
Paoli	PERSON	,
Monmouth	LOCATION	,
Yorktown	LOCATION	, and
Savannah	LOCATION	, and he was always sent to the front .


Washington	LOCATION	leaned on him more than on any other one man .

		His defeat of the Indians on the
Miami	LOCATION	opened the West to civilization .

		In most of his engagements dur - ing the Revolution ,
Wayne	PERSON	was in command of the
Pennsylvania Line	LOCATION	, an almost separate organization of thirteen regiments , which in the worst times formed the bulk of
Washington	LOCATION	's army .

		In a similar way , during the War of the Rebellion ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	had a complete division in the field .

		The present writer feels a touch of personal interest in this last matter , because his father , who was a member of the
Pennsylvania Legislature	LOCATION
during the first three years of the Civil War	DATE	, was of some service to Governor
Curtin	PERSON	in passing the bill for the formation of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Reserves .

		Of this same Legislature , ex-Governor Pen - nypacker writes : '' At half-past four on the
morning	TIME	of
April 12 , 1861	DATE	, the rebels opened
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 87 fire upon
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	, in
Charleston Harbor	LOCATION	.

		Before the sun went down that day
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania had appropriated five hundred thousand dollars with which to arm
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This first step in the war upon the part of the North , quick as a flash , three days before the call by the President for troops , followed by
New York	LOCATION	on the 15th , and the other States later , is one of those momentous and over-powering events that determine the fate of nations , to be remem - bered with the crossing of the Rubicon and the Dinner of the Beggars of the Sea . ''

		Rather unaccountably , ex-Governor Penny - packer has omitted in his testimony any re - ference to the naval glories of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	was the nursery of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Barry	PERSON	,
Bainbridge	LOCATION	,
Dale	PERSON	,
Stewart	PERSON	,
Decatur	LOCATION	, and
Hull	PERSON	were natives or residents of that city .

		Another lack which we confess we feel is the one glanced at near the beginning of this re - view , a dearth of the humanizing light of let - ters .

		History is an elastic word , and in the mod - ern conception of the term includes much besides Statesmanship and War .

		Ex-Governor Penny - packer has not made the most of what
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania has to show in this field .

		If he had given us a study of
Charles Brockden Brown	PERSON	, the first American romance writer , who fascin - ated
Shelley	PERSON	, influenced
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	, and is good reading yet on his own account ; if he had given us some account of
Thomas Buchanan	PERSON	Read , some of whose graceful or fiery lyrics will live long in our literature ; if , best of all , he had made an analysis , as he could prob - ably do better than anyone else , of the genius of
Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	, whose ``
Hans Breitman	PERSON	'' is one of the greatest creations of American humor , he would , we think , have rounded out his book and given it a wider appeal .

		As it is , he has made a truthful , log - ical , and often eloquent plea for the preemin - ence of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		THE HERO OF
QUEBEC	LOCATION	.

		* Of the lives of great men of action
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Cromwell	PERSON	, ``
Washington	LOCATION	,
Nelson	PERSON	, and their kind the world never grows tired .

		Such a man of action was James V \ r olfe , the appear - ance of a volume of whose letters is , or should be , an event of importance in the literary world .

		Editor and publisher have combined to produce * THE LIFE AXD LETTERS OF
JAMES WOLFE	PERSON	.

		By
Beckles Willson	PERSON	.

		Xew York :
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		a substantial and attractive volume , containing a great deal of material bearing on both the public and private life of the hero of
Quebec	LOCATION	which has never before appeared in print .

		The book will appeal to the average uncritical reader because of the intimate light it throws on the character of one whose brief career was so packed with dramatic situations and splendid achievements .

		That it will appeal with equal force to the serious student , is questionable .

		Undoubtedly the book contains material of the highest importance , not elsewhere accessible in print ; and if the editor had carried out the promise of his preface , his work would rank with
Doughty	PERSON	's '' Siege of
Quebec	LOCATION	'' and Wood 's '' Logs of the Conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' filling in fact the one remaining gap hi the literature of the great siege .

		The student had every right to expect that Mr.
Willson	PERSON	would remember the one essential characteristic of such work that his transcripts should agree word for word with the originals .

		Unfortunately , they do not .

		Not only is the spelling and punctuation of
Wolfe	PERSON	's originals not followed , but whole sen - tences are omitted , or represented by only a word or two .

		It can not be positively stated that this criticism applies to all the letters , as a large number of the originals are not accessible ; but as it certainly does apply to some , there is reason to fear that the whole work is unreliable .

		Not only is the text inaccurate , but the editor 's comments are in many cases not what one would expect from one who has made such a close study of his subject .

		He refers to '' Sir
Charles Saunders	PERSON	'' in
1759	DATE	, although the admiral did not receive knighthood until
1761	DATE	; similarly ,
Pitt	PERSON	is spoken of as ''
Chatham	LOCATION	, '' though he was not elevated to the peerage until
1766	DATE	.

		These are but trifles , comparatively .

		A much more serious error is the statement on page 422 that ''
Saunders	PERSON	was merely to co - operate with
Wolfe	PERSON	, whenever that military commander should stand in need of such ser - vices as the navy only could give .

		Otherwise he was to * cover '
Wolfe	PERSON	's army , and keep con - trol of his communications . ''

		He adds that
Saunders	PERSON	exceeded his instructions , and gave
Wolfe	PERSON	'' a warm and loyal support . ''

		The King 's secret instructions to
Wolfe	PERSON	and
Saunders	PERSON	bear no such interpretation .

		On the contrary , they make it perfectly plain that
Saunders	PERSON	was expected to give Wolfe '' a warm and loyal support '' ; that , in fact , the attack on
Quebec	LOCATION	was to be a joint one , in which the army and navy were to work in perfect harmony .

		The King wrote : 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' Whereas , the success of this Expedition will very much depend upon an entire Good Understanding be - tween Our Land and
Sea Officers	ORGANIZATION	, We do hereby strictly enjoin and require You , on Your part to maintain and cul - tivate such a good Understanding and Agreement , and to Order , that the Soldiers under Your Command shall man the Ships , when there shall be occasion for them , and when they can be spared from the
Land Service	ORGANIZATION	, As the Commander in Chief of
Our Squadron	ORGANIZATION	is instructed , on His Part to entertain and cultivate the same good Understanding and Agreement and to order the Sailors and Marines under His Command , to assist Our Land Forces and to man the Batteries , when there shall be occasion for them , and when they can be spared from the
Sea Service	ORGANIZATION	; And in order to establish the strictest Union that may be , between You and the Commander in Chief of Our Ships , You are hereby required to com - municate these Instructions to Him as He is directed to communicate those He shall receive from Us to You . ''

		As to the Letters themselves , one would like to quote many passages for the sake of the new light they throw on
Wolfe	PERSON	's character and motives , and the clarity of his vision as a military commander .

		One or two must , how - ever , suffice .

		In one of the letters to his mother , we find this modest appreciation of his own merits : `` The officers of the army in general are persons of so little application to business and have been so ill educated , that it must not surprise you to hear that a man of common industryjis in reputation amongst them .

		I reckon it a very great misfortune to this country that I , your son , who have , I know , but a very modest capa - city , and some degree of diligence a little above the ordinary run , should be thought , as I generally am , one of the best officers of my rank in the service .

		I am not at all vain of the distinction .

		The comparison would do a man of genius very little honour , and does not illus - trate me , by any means ; and the consequence will be very fatal to me in the end , for as I rise in rank people will expect some considerable performances , and I shall be induced , in support of an ill-got reputation , to be lavish of my life , and shall probably meet that fate which is the ordinary effect of such conduct . ''

		This was written in
1755	DATE	, before the Roehefort expedition .

		That same disastrous campaign forms the text of one of
Wolfe	PERSON	's letters to his friend
Rickson	PERSON	, in
November 1757	DATE	, in which he lays down those sound principles of coopera - tion between army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	which he was after - ward to illustrate so brilliantly at
Quebec	LOCATION	, and the ignorance of which , on the part of his com - manding officers , made the Roehefort expedi - tion such a dismal failure .

		He says : '' I have found out that an Admiral should endeavor to run into an enemy 's port immediately after he ap - pears before it ; that he should anchor the transport ships and frigates as close as he can to the land ; that he should reconnoitre and observe it as quick as pos - sible , and lose no time in getting the troops on shore ; that previous directions should be given in respect to landing the troops , and a proper disposition made for the boats of all sorts , appointing leaders and fit persons for conducting the different divisions .

		On the other hand , experience shows me that , in an affair depending upon vigour and dispatch , the Generals should settle their plan of operations , so that no time may be lost in idle debate and consultations when the sword should be drawn ; that pushing on smartly is the road to success , and more particularly so in an affair of this nature ; that nothing is to be reckoned an obstacle to your under - taking which is not found really so upon trial ; that in war something must be allowed to chance and fortune , seeing it is in its nature hazardous , and an option of difficulties ; that the greatness of an object should come under consideration , opposed to the impediments that lie in the way ; that the honour of one 's country is to have some weight ; and that , in particular circumstances and times , the loss of a thousand men is rather an ad - vantage to a nation than otherwise , seeing that gallant attempts raise its reputation and make it respectable ; whereas the contrary appearances sink the credit of a country , ruin the troops , and create infinite uneasiness and discontent at home . ''

		An interesting point arises in connection with the fact that
Durell	PERSON	, instead of sailing to the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	at the earliest possible mo - ment , kept his ships in idleness at
Halifax	LOCATION	, and so permitted
Bougainville	LOCATION	, with news of
Pitt	PERSON	's plan of campaign , and with a couple of frigates and a score of storeships , to slip up the river to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Willson	PERSON	suggests that , had
Durell	PERSON	done his duty ,
Wolfe	PERSON	, '' instead of the long and dreary task before him , might have fallen on the enemy 's weak point and won vic - tory in
July	DATE	instead of
September	DATE	. ''

		The argu - ment is not convinciug , but it suggests a curious question : Had
Quebec	LOCATION	fallen in
July	DATE	, without the sacrifice of the life of the British general ,
Washington	LOCATION	might have had to cope with the genius of
Wolfe	PERSON	instead of with the mediocrity of the actual commanders .

		What , then , might have been the fate of
America	LOCATION	?

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 pursues them in holes in the ground , whence he has extracted in recent years many of the wonders to be seen by anybody who will trouble himself to visit the larger museums .

		The Age of Mammals , the subject of Profes - sor
Osborn	PERSON	's new book , may have lasted about six million years , more or less .

		Estimates vary from less than three to over six millions , but it is probable that the larger figure is more nearly correct .

		A million years is a long time , but it is only about five hundred times the distance between us and the birth of Christ .

		During the Age of Reptiles , when gigantic Dinosaurs walked the earth , our humble ancestors were slowly evolving .

		According to Professor Os - born , their real beginning , as mammals , was some fifteen million years prior to the `` Age of Mammals . ''

		All through this long period they were small and despised , with little to suggest their future glories .

		Even at the end of the cretaceous , the dinosaurs '' were in the climax of specialization and grandeur ; they moved amidst a stately flora of palms and sequoias interspersed with bananas and fig trees , and a very rich deciduous tree flora of modern south temperate type . ''

		We do not know what blight overtook them ; there was no world-catastrophe , for the plants show only gradual change .

		Per - haps the developing mammals , numerous and prolific if small , made away with the food sup - ply .

		If a pair of rabbits and a pair of elephants were enclosed in the same pasture , and left to multiply as best they could , it would only be a matter of time for the rabbits to starve out the elephants .

		However it may have been , the great reptiles disappeared , leaving only a fauna resembling in most respects that of to-day , while the mammals began to increase in size and number of kinds .

		From this time on they underwent a rapid evolution , while most other forms of life were relatively stationary ; hence they afford unrivalled chronological data , enabling us to determine the relative ages of different strata very exactly , although not knowing the actual time-period represented by each .

		Finally , as we near the present age , man appears , first of all in types so low that they are now considered to belong to extinct species of
Homo	LOCATION	.

		Is it fair to unscientific readers to recom - mend to them such a book as that of Professor
Osborn	PERSON	?

		The author himself says : '' Although I may not claim that any parts of this volume are light reading , I have endeavored both to hold the attention of those who are already within the charmed temples of palaeontology and to attract new votaries to its shrines .

		It should , however , be clearly understood that considerable sections of this work are purely documentary and may be passed over rapidly by the general reader . ''

		This admitted , he nevertheless declares that he shares '' Huxley 's confidence in addressing those who are willing to do a little serious thinking in order to enjoy the vast vistas of interesting truth which come as the reward of effort . ''

		In truth , the work is largely technical , yet not unintelligible .

		It sets forth , in a manner not before attempted , the history of that time in which the modern mammals , and finally man , evolved ; a tremen - dous drama of absorbing interest , only now beginning to be well understood .

		It is beauti - fully illustrated by maps and photographic figures , and especially by Mr.
Charles R. Knight	PERSON	's very clever and spirited restorations of the extinct animals .

		Are the cultured classes of to-day so stupid or so lazy that they can get nothing out of all this ?

		Such a suggestion would be unjust , yet are there not grounds for a suspicion that the mass of easy reading every - where available tends to crowd out serious forms of literature ?

		This is indeed a familiar com - plaint , and perhaps there is no remedy .

		Never - theless , I believe that something may be done to stem the evil tide .

		Suppose that some suit - able organization or journal were to take partic - ular pains to pick out and enumerate the new books which really added to human thought , and were not too technical to be fairly intelligible -LRB- no new body of ideas is likely to be wholly inteJligible to anyone ! -RRB-

		to the cultured lay reader .

		Suppose then that those interested in the movement , with or without definite organi - zation , made it their business to get acquainted with as many of these works as possible , to talk about them , and have them placed in public libraries .

		I can imagine such a movement doing much to initiate more robust intellectual habits , though it might occasionally deteriorate , the boundary between honesty and humbug having worn so thin .

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, THE GENIUS OF BALZAC .

		* The fame of
Balzac	LOCATION	has grown enormously in the last half-century .

		Of his own genera - tion , he alone fully recognized his supremacy as a novelist .

		His contemporaries preferred the lurid fiction of Sue and
Soulie	PERSON	to the Comedie humaine , and even Sainte-Beuve compared his genius to these masters of ultra-Eomantic barbarity .

		Sixty years have passed , however , since the publication of that famous causerie , and the enemies of Balzac have long since joined him in the grave .

		Death has brought forgetf ulness , and time a truer per - spective .

		The personal idiosyncrasies of the author his vulgarity and his egotism have dwindled into matters of literary history ; and what survives for us is the creator of the mod - ern novel .

		It would seem that the time were ripe for an adequate biography .

		Antiquarians have raked over all the old anecdotes .

		Students have spent days comparing and verifying the data of
Balzac	LOCATION	's life .

		Even his note-book is soon to be published , and we shall lack nothing of im - portance except the last letters to Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	.

		In spite of this , however , we have no adequate French biography .

		Brunetiere and Monsieur Le Breton have kept to literary criticism , and the
Vicomte de Lovenjoul	ORGANIZATION	to antiquarian re - search and bibliography .

		The result of this is a second
English Life of Balzac	ORGANIZATION	, reflecting this recent scholarship on its antiquarian side .

		It makes a very interesting volume , and Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	deserves the thanks of all Anglo-Saxon readers .

		He has brought together all the important facts and anecdotes , briefly analyzed the novels , and enriched his narrative by an admirable selection of illustra - tions .

		An excellent introductory chapter fixes the subject in its historical background , and upon this canvas the figure of Balzac is depicted with no glossing of realistic detail .

		The great novelist was not a literary
Galahad	PERSON	, and per - haps this fact has contributed somewhat to the coldness of the picture .

		The vivid portraits accent this lack of warmth . ''

		Exceedingly sane , '' however , the book certainly is ; for the first time we have a study of Balzac in which the adjective '' vertiginous '' is not employed !

		But such excellence is not without its defects .

		Admirable as a corrective to partizan enthusi - asm , interesting enough as a collection of anec - dotes , Mr.

Wessels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		spire the general reader .

		We could have wished for a portrait less purely external .

		The ideal biography will have its reservations , surely ; but after all its criticism , it will present the per - sonal force of the man .

		It will justify to us the conception of
Rodin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	's Balzac , one must confess , could hardly have written the Comedie humaine .

		He is less the genius of the letters than the vulgar little man of the anecdotes , and many of the anecdotes present a figure which seems to be almost wholly clay .

		Honore de Balzac was , undoubtedly , a tremen - dous egotist ; and if we can forgive that quality in a living person , we can not forgive the egot - ism of those whom we have never known .

		We know that
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's egotism was balanced by all those qualities which go to make up personal charm .

		His contemporaries loved him or hated him ; the warmth of his genius vitalized them all .

		But two generations later we can only recapture that vital heat in his novels or his letters , a task of greater difficulty than the interpretation of the anecdotes .

		And so the biographer is led to forget the genius in the bourgeois gentilhomme .

		We must remodel our conception of genius .

		All the genius of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	did not give him the moral repulsion of his age toward the actor 's life , or turn his exuberant manhood from the petty crime of deer-poaching .

		All the genius of Balzac did not prevent him from engaging to write an article , and then dickering with a nameless author to furnish him with the product for him to sign and sell .

		But this does not militate against the genius .

		It only com - plicates the task of the biographer .

		He must give us a synthetic picture , a picture with its light and shade , but with the force of unity throughout .

		He must interpret the man by the genius or the genius by the man ; the only escape from this dilemma means the reduction of biography to pure antiquarianism .

		But we need not go so far .

		It is his art which reveals most clearly the subconscious part of the artist 's mind , and the qualities by which the artist lives for us are , after all , the qualities by which he really lived .

		The true biographer will find the genius more important than the man .

		This is the task which confronts the would - be biographer of Balzac .

		It explains the lack of a French biography , and it may serve to excuse the defects of this one .

		The story of
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's life might be made more wonderful than any of his novels ; it seems more wonderful in the letters to Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	.

		For these letters are a veritable journal .

		Egotistic but vital with

		THE DIAJL 91 energy , crude , uncorrected , spontaneous , they give us Balzac 's very self ; his personality rises from their pages as the genie from the jar in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	tale .

		One feels at last the personal force of his genius .

		We can almost see him at his writing table its solid mahogany worn by the constant friction of his arm , as for eighteen hours a day he composed or corrected his novels , scribbling '' between two proofs '' the letters to his Russian Prlncesse lointaine .

		We feel the fire of his inspiration , '' work , always work , nights of flame succeeding nights of flame , days of meditation to days of meditation , execution to conception , conception to execution . ''

		We hear his exultant cry as he recounts his accom - plishment , see the reaction and note the cost : '' To-day I have finished ' La Recherche de 1 ` Absolu . '

		Heaven grant that the work be good and beautiful .

		I can not jndge of it ; I am too weary with toil . '' ''

		This morning I rebelled against my solitude .

		I wanted to roam the world , to see what the Landstrasse was , to put my fingers into the Danube ... in short , to do anything but write pages ; to be living instead of turning pale over phrases ! ''

		This is the real Balzac , the vividness of whose personality Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	has missed .

		Nor are such passages unique in these letters : '' Between this dolour and the distant light of love , what are men , the world , society !

		There is nothing possible but the incessant work into which I throw my - self work , my saviour , which will give me liberty and return to me my wings .

		I quivered on reading your reasoning : No letters , he is coming . '

		... I am seized by periodic furies to leave all behind me , to escape , to

		Then the chains chink down ; I see the thickness of my dungeon .

		If I come to you it will be a surprise , for I can no longer make decisions on that subject . ''

		These are details , perhaps , that Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	would better have left in the words of
Honore de Balzac	ORGANIZATION	, instead of questioning the depth of the novelist 's love .

		And against the vulgarities of
Balzac	LOCATION	's egotism he might have set another paragraph , equally egotistic , but overlooked in his biography : '' My life is varied only by ideas ; physically , it is monotonous .

		I speak confidentially with no one but
Mme. de Berny	ORGANIZATION	or with you .

		I find that one should communicate but little with petty minds .

		... I am vowed to great feelings and it is an odd contrast with my apparent levity ... What sentiments , feelings , I have made visible in my work is but the faint shadow of the light that is in me ... In twelve years I have had neither anger nor impatience ; the heaven of my heart has always been blue .

		Any other attitude is , to my thinking , impotence .

		Strength should be a unit , and after having for seven years measured myself with misfortune and vanquished it , and risen , to gain literary royalty , every night with a will more determined than that of the night before , I have , I think , the right to call myself strong . ''

		This is the
Balzac of Rodin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Everything about him is colossal , even his faults .

		The very vir - tues assume in him a monstrous quality ; his industry , like his extravagance , has all the excess of a debauch . ''

		At this moment I am a little drunk with work , '' he cries ; and , in another place , '' I have no time to live ... my life is a torrent . ''

		In the Romantic gener - ation , so full of curious types and exotic tem - peraments , he seems almost like a man of to-day .

		And it is the life of to-day that he interprets , the materialism of which one critic claims that
Balzac	LOCATION	was the creator .

		He was not the creator but the diviner of that nascent materialism , now grown like a cancer into our modern life , just as Musset was the interpreter of the Romantic malady of his own age .

		Absolute opposites , Musset and Balzac sum up the nineteenth cen - tury .

		Musset 's moral suicide typifies the shat - tering of Romantic theories .

		Balzac 's herculean energy foreshadows our modern strenuosity , affording us a spectacle probably unique in art , the incarnation of a

		92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, expressions of critical opinion which have seemed to verge upon the extravagant , and , altogether , we are glad that the work is to be placed in the hands of English readers .

		We say '' is to be '' advisedly , for the volume of six hundred pages now translated by Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	reproduces only about one-half of the French text already published , and we can not say what fraction it will prove to be of the work when completed .

		It comprises the four sections called '' Dawn , '' `` Morning , '' '' Youth , '' and '' Revolt , '' and leaves the hero a youth of twenty , at the outset of his real career .

		A few words about the author may be of interest .

		He was born in
1866	DATE	, a Frenchman of unmixed descent .

		He got his education in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, and it was in the latter city , in
1890	DATE	, that he met Malwida von Meysenbug -LRB- made the victim of an extraordinary error in the present translation by being called '' Weysenburg '' -RRB- , the friend of Kossuth ,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Herzen	ORGANIZATION	,
Blanc	PERSON	, and most of the other great mid-century idealists .

		This famous woman influenced him deeply , and found his spirit closely akin to theirs .

		It was at this time that the embryo of '' Jean-Christophe '' took shape in his mind , although the book was not to be actually under - taken for many years .

		Meanwhile ,
M. Rolland	PERSON	was winning his spurs as lecturer , critic , and dramatist , and as the author of lives of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Michel Angelo	PERSON	, and
Hugo Wolf	PERSON	.

		He describes in the fol - lowing terms the motives which impelled him to write the work now under consideration : '' I was isolated : like so many others in
France	LOCATION	, I was stifling in a world morally inimical to me .

		I wanted air : I wanted to react against an unhealthy civilization , against ideas corrupted by a sham elite : I wanted to say to them : 1 You lie !

		You do not represent
France	LOCATION	! '

		To do so I needed a hero with a pure heart and unclouded vision , whose soul should be stainless enough for him to have the right to speak ; one whose voice should be loud enough for him to gain a hearing .

		I have patiently begotten this hero .

		The work was in conception for many years before I set myself to write a word of it .

		Christophe only set out on his journey when I had been able to see the end of it for him . ''

		It takes a good deal of a book to justify so large and ideal a conception as this , but we are inclined to believe that the author has '' made good . ''

		It is the sort of book into which a man puts the whole of himself , the sort of book which , once written , makes it almost inconceivable that its author should ever produce another .

		Its enormous length may cause affright , and few will resist the temptation to skim over the surface in a good many places .

		It has not the compelling power and the closeness of texture which hold us to the pages of such books as ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' and The Old Wives ' Tale , '' for example , but it is a work of such deep sincerity and power of psychological analysis that even a hurried perusal can not fail to leave a lasting impression .


M. Rolland	PERSON	's hero is a genius by temperament , and a musician by accident .

		He is a native of a little village on the
Rhine	LOCATION	, and necessarily a German , since his character is that of a musician in the most idealistic sense .

		He becomes an adopted Frenchman by an act of revolt against the brutal militarism of his native country , and remains a Frenchman from the time when he finds refuge across the frontier .

		There is something symbolical in this , for , as the translator says : '' The book itself breaks down the frontier between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If one frontier is broken , all are broken .

		The truth about anything is universal truth . ''

		We might add that it is the peculiar province of the musician to express universal truth , and to know no barriers of soil , or of race , or of speech .

		The author says that he has `` always conceived and thought of the life of his hero and of the book as a river . ''

		It is the flow of the Rhine that mingles with
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	's earliest infant imaginings , and the thought of his own life as a river is one that is always present in his mind .

		Moreover , `` the river is explored as though it were absolutely uncharted .

		Nothing that has ever been said or thought of life is accepted with - out being brought to the test of
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	's own life . ''

		We do not believe that this is the method of the greatest art whatever Tolstoyans may think but it is
M. Rolland	PERSON	's method , and we must take his book upon its own terms if we are to get from it what it has to offer .

		Anything like a summary of the book , or even of the portion now translated , is out of the question in this review .

		Two hundred pages are needed for the first fifteen years of the boy 's life , and four hundred for the next five .

		We are simply given the chronicle of the countless incidents and imaginings , the countless defeats and triumphs , of those tender years .

		The boy is morbidly sensitive , with a tenfold endow - ment of passion , of capacity for happiness or grief .

		When he awakens to self-consciousness , it is in a stolid world which does not understand him in the least .

		He longs for love and sympathy , and finds only indifference and self-interest .

		He makes unselfish advances , and is rebuffed .

		He glows , and is chilled .

		Moreover , his environment is for the most part sordid and miserable .

		He is a human boy , also , and makes missteps , but his inherent purity and idealism save him from disaster .

		And he gradually works his way out of bewilderment into something like fulness of vision .

		But no words of ours can ac - count in any adequate way for this book , which is clearly one of the most vital and significant works of fiction that our age has produced .

		One always wonders what Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	is going to do next , and is sure only that it will be something surprising .

		And '' Mrs.
Fitz	PERSON	'' is assuredly a sur - prising successor to '' Fortune , '' '' Araminta , '' and ``
William Jordan	PERSON	, Junior . ''

		It is a blend of Mer - edithian comedy and `` Zenda '' romance , being concerned with a Princess of
Illyria	LOCATION	who marries an English gentleman , and scandalizes the country - side by her ways .

		The good people of the county do not know her origin , and take her to be a circus woman whom
Fitzwaren	PERSON	has picked up somewhere .

		The Illyrians wish to get her back , and to annul her marriage , because she is next in succession to the sovereign , and her match has been of the runaway sort .

		So they first seek to kidnap her , and failing in this , they get the
King	ORGANIZATION	himself to visit England
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 under a transparent incognito , to plead with her in i the interests of the dynasty .

		The old King is an j engaging rascal , and has his way with the recalci - trant princess to the extent of persuading her to re - i turn with him .

		But he is assassinated soon there - after , and thus it becomes the task of the deserted husband and a band of loyal friends to rescue the Princess from her Illyrian durance , and bring her triumphantly back to the English domestic hearth .

		It all makes the liveliest of stories , and combines real characterization and delicate social satire with the more robust melodrama of its main action .

		Colonial
New England	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century is the scene of '' Lady Good-for-Xothing , '' which is the latest blend of history with romance contrived for us by Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	.

		It offers a bitter arraignment of the puritan spirit , and a strong love - story , the two figures chiefly concerned being those of a
New England	LOCATION	girl and a King 's official .

		The girl 's brutal treatment at the hands of the puritan magistrates she is publicly flogged for Sabbath - breaking so arouses the official 's indignation that he champions her cause , and even demands to be set beside her in the stocks .

		Thus begins a very tender and beautiful romance , which is continued as the girl grows into the woman under the new sur - roundings provided by her rescuer , and leads to the efflorescence of a passionate love between them .

		This love is not sanctioned by the church , because the woman has become so embittered toward religion that she will have none of that consecration , but only narrow souls would deny that she remains a pure woman .

		Afterwards , the scene shifts to
Lisbon	LOCATION	, where Sir
Oliver	PERSON	grows recreant to his obligations , and wickedly yields to the fascinations of a
Portu	LOCATION	- guese charmer .

		Whereupon the Earthquake sharply recalls him to his duty , and almost reduces him to a death-bed repentance .

		But he is spared , after all , and
Ruth	PERSON	consents to be made his wife in the sight of the law .

		This latter part of the story is given us largely by indirection , in extracts from imaginary letters , a sort of narrative in which the author is particularly skilful .

		This is one of the best of Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's many good books , and its interest is unfailing .

		That interest has for its elements a piquant humor , a deft use of historical fact , a power of incisive characterization , and a spiritual insight , such as few writers of fiction have at their command .

		A man of good English family , who has been an adventurer in various parts of the globe for some ten years , and who has signally failed to u make good , '' yields to the call of home , and returns to
London	LOCATION	.

		The well-to-do members of his family look upon him as a black sheep , and their welcome is not exactly cordial ; but they have a sense of duty of a certain sort , and are much concerned lest the vagrant brother do something to discredit him .

		They are '' People of Position , '' in the
City	LOCATION	and the world of villadom .

		and their only standards are those of respectability and worldly success .

		Now
Jimmy Grierson	PERSON	, who would willingly have met them half way , is so chilled by their attitude , and so repelled by their prim conventionality , that he seeks metal more attractive , and soon finds it in the charming person of
Lalage Penrose	PERSON	, a victim of the
London	LOCATION	streets .

		With her he contracts a liaison which is delightful while it lasts , but for which the exiguous income of a Fleet Street journalist , with a precarious footing at best , coupled with a tendency to drown his sorrows in the cup that inebriates , does not provide an adequate basis .

		Then they are torn apart , Lalage going into rural retirement for a season of repentance , and
Jimmy	PERSON	into seclusion to become a great novelist .

		He is thus fairly on the way toward social rehabilitation , and soon gets so far as to contract an engagement with the canon 's daughter , when his past is disclosed to her horrified ears , and the fat is all in the fire .

		He now turns his back for good upon the world of smug conventionality , hunts up Lalage in her country re - treat , begs her forgiveness for his desertion , and persuades her to marry him .

		The author of this rather sordid and far from original story is Mr.
Stanley Portal Hyatt	PERSON	, whose novels have hitherto concerned themselves with colonial life , and who does not seem quite at home in his new environ - ment His bitterness toward '' people of position '' is such that he can not invest them with any redeem - ing qualities , while on the other hand he endows his heroine -LRB- in spite of her lapses -RRB- with most of the imaginable virtues , and makes her the chief object of our sympathetic interest .

		This , of course , is an easy thing to do if one resolutely sets about it , but the morality of the proceeding is dubious , to say the least .

		A young woman of the Russian nobility , having had an unfortunate matrimonial experience , and , being in imminent danger of another , resorts to the somewhat unusual expedient of cutting off her beautiful hair , donning man 's clothes , and fleeing to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Her name is
Maxine	LOCATION	, which she con - veniently abbreviates to the first syllable , and thus the last touch is given to the transformation .

		She is an artist in soul , and establishes herself in a studio at
Montmartre	LOCATION	, where she sets feverishly about developing her new career .

		A warm-hearted Irish - man whose acquaintance she has made on the journey , is touched by her charm -LRB- but of course all the time thinks her a boy -RRB- and constitutes himself her friend-in-chief .

		A delightful camaraderie grows up between them , the man quite naturally unable to account to himself for the appeal which she makes to him .

		Love has its inevitable way , after the girl has struggled in vain against it , and after the man has learned her secret .

		This is the story of Mrs.
Thurston	PERSON	's ''
Max	PERSON	, '' and it is one of the tenderest and loveliest stories that are often met with .

		Flushed with the spirit of youth , and sweet with the fragrance of sentiment , it is a pure and gracious idyl , yet not untouched by the deeper suggestion of passion .

		Other figures play their parts in the drama , and supply effective foils for hero and heroine .

		And perhaps the most exquisite touch of all is provided 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, by the use of phrases from
Charpentier	PERSON	's `` Louise '' as leading motives for the action .

		Nothing could be more fitting or more beautifully conceived than this heightening of the novelist 's art by borrowings from the sister art of music .

		Miss
M. P. Willcocks	PERSON	, in The Way Up , '' has given us a strong and absorbingly interesting novel which judiciously mingles an economic with a domestic interest .

		The former is provided by
Michael Strode	PERSON	's experiment in industrial coopera - tion , the latter by his marrying the wrong woman .

		He first comes before us as a young man fresh from the university , who is facing the world with a determination to reform it , or at least some small spot of it .

		This means that he turns aside from the smooth path prepared for him by the wealthy uncle who has provided his education , enlists in the ranks of the workers , and aims to achieve success by his own unaided efforts .

		This is rather scandalizing to his people , who are of good social standing ; but he proves his mettle , and establishes the cooperative enterprise of his dreams .

		It is really his wife 's money which makes this outcome possible , and when he discovers that her ideals are at the opposite pole from his , and that she has married him with the notion that she would bend him to her wishes , he is found unexpectedly stubborn , and refuses to yield an inch .

		Upon this , she goes her way , takes to the stage , and becomes a popular actress .

		Her with - drawal cripples the business , but he carries it on with grim determination , and his iron will eventu - ally accomplishes its purpose .

		Meanwhile , the right woman is near him all the time , an associate in his daily affairs , and when the wife dies , is more than willing to become her successor .

		This is the dry outline of a novel which makes anything but dry reading .

		Miss
Willcocks	PERSON	has an extraordinary power of characterization , and has given us a group of eight or ten very real and strongly individualized people .

		Her work has , moreover , an intellectual quality far out of the common , exhibited both in her dialogue and her descriptive passages .

		The book is one in which ideas are everywhere astir , yet it is not made arid by any lack of human sym - pathy .

		It almost seems to us to deserve the state - ment that it carries on the sane tradition of
George Eliot	PERSON	's novels , and has many of that great writer 's qualities of substantial workmanship .

		Written in a vein suggestive of '' The New Arabian Nights , '' whimsical , ingenious , and divert - ing , `` The Siege of the Seven Suitors '' will be found a source of mild enjoyment by all who find their way to its pages .

		Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	has written more exciting novels than this , and novels more seriously related to life , but nothing of surer appeal and charm .

		It concerns the senti - mental history of a young woman whose eccentric and romantic maiden aunt has devised an original plan for fitting her niece with a husband .

		The seventh man who proposes is to win her , but of course none of the aspirants knows that a too early declaration will seal his fate .

		The fun waxes fast and furious when the possible winners are reduced to two in number , and it becomes necessary so to engineer their movements as to dispose of the wrong one first .

		The chief agent in bringing about the desired result is a '' consultant in chimneys , '' who is a guest in the country house which witnesses all these stirring complications , and who gets the heroine 's sister
Hezekiah	PERSON	as a consolation prize for his disinterested activities .

		Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	is a pleasant romancer , devoid of virility and dramatic force , but skilful in neat structural devices , vivacious , and entertaining .

		`` The Im poster , '' his latest production , is a tale of
Annapolis	LOCATION	in colonial days -LRB- the Stamp Act period -RRB- , and has to do with the fortunes of a fair English visitor , besieged by many suitors , and the belle of the province .

		Among these suitors is an engaging rascal who sojourns in
Annapolis	LOCATION	under a borrowed name , and cuts a wide swath in the local society .

		He must be described as a villain manque , for he has good qualities , after all , which are permitted to emerge in time to make of him an acceptable husband for
Miss Stirling	PERSON	, in the reader 's estima - tion no less than in her own .

		The chief excitement of the tale is provided by a raid of pirates real pirates , with a gentlemanly cut-throat for their leader upon the shores of
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	.

		The unmasking of Long Sword , and the scene in which he makes a gallant end , are quite well done in the manner of artificial romance . ''

		Out of
Drowning Valley	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
L. Carleton Jones	PERSON	, may be described as a '' rattling '' good story of a plucky adventurer who has been in Sing Sing , a spirited girl , a resourceful villain , and a gold mine guarded by a secretive tribe of Indians .

		The hero befriends an Indian who lets him into the secret , the girl saves his life and makes him a devoted lover , and the villain seeks to compass the destruction of both , being ingeniously disposed of when his vil - lainies have reached their sum .

		We are kept in suspense by being made to believe that the hero has a wife in the East , and the heroine 's discovery of this woman 's existence creates the temporary estrange - ment without which no well-planned novel of the present species would be complete .

		But the wife turns out to be only a stepmother , and the man 's convict record only the result of his mistaken chiv - alry in bearing the consequences of her misdeeds .

		Even at that , she dies conveniently , and the truth all comes out , whereupon the hero wins the girl , and gets away with a reasonable amount of the gold before the mine is sealed for good by flood and cataclysm .

		The commonwealth of
Georgia	LOCATION	has no cause to complain of literary neglect .

		It has been brought to the attention of the reading public by two men as famous as
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	and
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	, and its local chronicle is acceptably continued by Mr.
Will N. Harben	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's homely novels might fairly be criticized for looseness of construction and lack of depth ; but within their unpretending limits , they offer highly satisfactory
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 95 work .

		The humors of the Georgian country folk , their village complications , their eccentric types , and the daily round of their rural life , are portrayed with sympathy and fidelity to fact in the long series of books to which u Dixie Hart '' is now added .

		The plot is simple .

		A village store-keeper is mar - ried to a vinegary woman whose former husband has deserted her and is thought to have been killed by an
Oklahoma	LOCATION	cyclone .

		Living near by is
Dixie Hart	PERSON	, a beautiful girl who is trying to release her farm from a mortgage , and who toils in the fields for this purpose and to support her widowed mother .

		The store-keeper befriends the girl , and they are in love with one another before they realize the fact .

		It turns out , of course , that the
Oklahoma	LOCATION	cyclone had failed to do its duty , and the return of the first husband leaves the second one free to follow the dictates of his heart .

		This is the substance of a story whose chief interest is in incident rather than plot .

		What we really enjoy are such things as the horse-trade with its sharp practice , the outwitting of the skinflint who holds the mortgage , the exploits of the tombstone agent , and the practical joking of old Wrinkle , the father-in-law .

		These are quite joyous matters , and the zest with which Mr.
Harben	PERSON	gives his account of them arouses a corresponding
WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		In a small volume of duodecimo Proportions , Mr.
Ernest A. Savage	PERSON	, librarian of the Wallasey Public Li - braries , has told '' The Story of Libraries and Book - Collecting '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- for the '' English Library Series . ''

		After prefatory apologies for daring to fel - low in the footsteps of
Edward Edwards	PERSON	, whose ' * Memories of Libraries '' is now out of print , ex - pensive , and also not up-to-date , the author sketches rapidly and in bare outline the history of ancient libraries , of mediaeval libraries and the preservation of the Greek and Latin classics , of early monastic libraries and the main stream of learning in the West , of the Renaissance and book-collecting , and of the principal libraries of modern times , arranged by countries .

		In so condensed a work there are necessarily many things omitted that one or another critical reader might wish to see included ; and there are also , in so crowded a list of dates and events , occasional minor errors .

		For example , in his opening chapter Mr.
Savage	PERSON	awards to Professor
Hilprecht	PERSON	all the credit of discovering the
Temple Library	ORGANIZATION	at Nippur , whereas Dr.
John Henry Haynes	PERSON	, the director of the expedition , and a veteran in the field of Babylonian excavation , unearthed this Nip - pur collection after pushing his explorations to a depth of eighteen feet , when the half-dozen rooms containing the precious tablets were unexpectedly disclosed .

		To Professor
Hilprecht	PERSON	, who was asso - ciated with him .

		and whose scholarly labors are not to be undervalued , due honor must be paid , but not to the exclusion of Dr.
Haynes	PERSON	's name .

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	's ranking of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	building as second in magnificence , in this country , to that which shelters the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	will soon require correction when the
New York	LOCATION	palace of literature in Forty-second Street is completed .

		His reference to the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Library 's ' branch at
Ridgeway	LOCATION	'' is based on a misconception ,
Ridge	ORGANIZATION	- way being a personal , not a geographical designa - tion , and the said branch being situated almost in the heart of the city .

		It looks a little strange to see our famous giver of library buildings referred to as `` Dr. ''
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	.

		As supplementary matter to this useful compendium there are added a few pages of '' brief notices of book-collectors and librarians , '' a list of '' principal works consulted for this book , '' and an index .

		As a sort of vade mecum for busy librarians the little book is sure of a welcome .

		ft
Walford	PERSON	, '' which being amplified stands for
Lucy Bethia	PERSON	-LRB-
Colquhoun	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Walford	PERSON	has seen so much of the world , both literary and non-literary , in the course of the forty or more years during which she has been producing her score and a half of popular works of fiction , as to enable her to add to her goodly list of books a volume of entertaining reminiscences of places and persons , of more or less noteworthy happenings and conversa - tions , to which she has given the title , '' Recollections of a Scottish Novelist '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Born in
1845	DATE	, she early acquired a liking for printer 's ink , and has never lost the appetite .

		Indeed , the flatter - ing reception of her first book , `` Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, '' which brought her , besides considerable English money and English fame , a check for twenty pounds and a gratifying letter from an honest American pirate , was enough to confirm her in her addiction to authorship .

		Even royalty itself , in the person of
Queen Victoria	LOCATION	, paid homage to the new lit - erary light , and we are told that as long as she lived she never failed to read each successive novel by the author of `` Mr.
Smith	PERSON	. ''

		More noteworthy still , a contribution to the '' St.
James Gazette	PERSON	'' from
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	coupled the names of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and
L. B. Walford	PERSON	as two living writers < ; whose work of this kind -LSB- i. e. the picturing of the times in which they lived -RSB- can scarcely be surpassed , '' and as worthy to be named in the same breath with
Scott	PERSON	and Fielding and
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		What prouder triumph could a young writer wish for ?

		Mrs. Waif ord 's early life in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	brought her into familiar contact with such personages as Professor
Blackie	PERSON	,
Dean Ramsay	PERSON	, Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, Sir
William Fraser	PERSON	, and Sir
Noel Paton	PERSON	.

		Neither the subject-matter nor the literary skill are lacking to her to write acceptably , even though somewhat desultorily and superficially , of her more memor - able experiences .

		Portraits and other pictorial matter contribute to the book 's inviting aspect 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, An inspection of Mr.
John Headley	PERSON	's excellent work entitled '' Tramps in Dark
Mongolia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- shows that most of the actual wanderings of its author were really within the confines of
China	LOCATION	proper ; and thus the title of the book is slightly misleading .

		Nevertheless , we have an interesting account of a country which is destined to attract more and more attention from the world .

		This is the age of the railway , and both
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are eager to develop the resources of this great country .

		When the day comes , on
Mongolia	LOCATION	's plains and in her valleys , that one locomotive will do the work of five thousand camels , the resources of this vast region of over a million square miles will be brought into the world 's market .

		The general note of the book is that of an earnest missionary , who wants the people enlightened , lifted up , and inspired with enthusiasms as great as those of earlier days , when some mysterious propulsion sent the Mongol in his ships as far as
Japan	LOCATION	and on horseback as far as western
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Headley	PERSON	's hope is that the same vigor and enthusiasm will be set to working out moral and peaceful problems that will make
Mongolia	LOCATION	a garden , rather than the semi-desert it is to-day .

		His book has many pages and chapters of interest ; he is no merely curious traveller , but is well informed as to the history of the country and people , so that he tells us what has happened at various places , and correlates the landscape with the events that once influenced half the world .

		A student of art and architecture , he interprets the symbols of Buddhism as they are sculptured in this land , which is peculiarly the garden of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether among the grass-lands , with the people at the fairs , in the shadow of the pagodas , in the brigand countries , or at the Lama temples , he is at home , and tells his story well .

		He makes friends with the abbots and monks , and incidentally shows us how very much alike are the many varieties of human nature , East and
West	LOCATION	.

		He stirs our optim - istic impulses to hope that when the Mongols find equal opportunities with the rest of the world , in the fields of transportation , science , and mingling of the ideas and inventions of many races and ages , they will rise to their opportunity .

		Nine posthumous pieces , mostly pub - Addresses of a > jj , i

		c addresses , trom the pen of
Henry Demarest Lloyd	PERSON	, are gathered into a handy , clearly-printed volume under the general title , ''
Mazzini	PERSON	and Other Essays '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		In addition to `` Mazzini : Prophet of Action '' the book contains chapters on
William Morris	PERSON	, with whom the author was privileged to spend a memor - able day , on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's wit and humor , on Sir
Harry Vane	PERSON	, on certain ancient Dutch notions , on free speech and the right of assemblage , the scholar in practical affairs , the question whether personal development is the best social policy , and an im - aginative sketch , after the order of '' Looking Back - ward , '' in which a new and a far better
Chicago	LOCATION	-LRB- of a century hence -RRB- is delightfully described .

		The old city , deliberately burned down in
1971	DATE	, on the centennial anniversary of the historic '' great fire , '' and ploughed up , disinfected , and '' sown with aromatic plants for many years before it was sweet again , '' gave place to '' a great park , and in it arose universities , theatres , libraries , meeting-halls , colos - seums for sports and public festivals , and temples of every religion professed by the millions living around .

		Room was made for all with equal willing - ness in the spirit of the ancient
Emerson	LOCATION	, that all the religions were one wine in different colored glasses . ''

		Of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	himself , whose name recurs with frequency in Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's pages , he says in the chapter devoted especially to him that he was a wit and a humorist , even though too little recognized as such .

		Quotations from his pen are given in proof of the assertion , and form interesting illustrations of his Yankee shrewdness and talent for terse and telling phrases , but can hardly make us think of him as conspicuously a humorist or preeminently a wit .

		In all these papers of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's the earnest - ness and moral purpose of an ardent and idealistic nature eloquently speak .

		Asia Minor is a quarry for startling ^ Shly people , archaeological discoveries .

		All the great nations of antiquity marched through its mountain passes and fought on its plains .

		One of the mightiest of these , and at the same time the least known , was that still mysterious people called the
Hittites	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
John Garstang	PERSON	's '' Land of the Hittites '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a vade mecum on the sub - ject .

		The author made a trip of exploration through the territory once occupied by that warlike and ag - gressive nation , and in this volume has presented a survey of the whole subject .

		His discussion of tke geographical boundaries of the
Hittite	ORGANIZATION	sway is intensely interesting , covering as it did nearly the whole of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor , and extending eastward into
Armenia	LOCATION	and southward into
Syria	LOCATION	.

		He gives a moving picture of the peoples who down to the Seljuk Turks occupied successively
Asia	LOCATION	Minor .

		The monuments of the Hittites now in full view of the explorer are very fully shown in superb half - tones .

		They were photographed in all parts of the ancient Hittite realm , and reveal how thoroughly that territory was covered by them .

		An elaborate discussion is given to the northern capital of the nation , at the site of the modern Boghaz-Keui , de - fended at one time by a tremendous acropolis , ramparts , and other fortifications .

		The author sets forth very vividly the splendor of their palaces and walled cities , their sculptures and their massive re - liefs .

		His ninety splendid illustrations give us a hint of the advancement made in civilization and culture by those hardy peoples of the northern mountains and plains , at a period ranging from about
3000	DATE	B. c. down to the eighth century B. c .

		But their real history will not be known until scholars can translate , not guess at the meaning of , the many inscriptions which we now possess .

		THE DIAL 97 Mr.
Joseph H. Longford	PERSON	's '' Story of A n outline of Qld J apan -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is intended Japanese history .

		, J i _ i _ for lay readers who have not the time or the inclination to study Japanese history through native sources or through more scholarly and original treatises by foreign students .

		The writer 's long residence in
Japan	LOCATION	, his travels and sojourns in all parts of the Empire , and his acquaint - ance with the native language and literature render his presentation of Japanese history much more than a mere abridgment of earlier productions ; but he frankly acknowledges the secondary and popular nature of his work as compared with that of
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Satow	PERSON	, and
Aston	ORGANIZATION	, and readers of
Griffis	PERSON	will find little that is new in the present volume .

		The chapters on mythology and the semi - mythical periods of history appear to lack the sym - pathy and insight of corresponding chapters in
Griffis	LOCATION	.

		From the beginnings of true history to the persecution of the Christians the writer gives so little attention to the life of the masses , to social customs , to literature and art , that the Japanese people are lost to view amid the constant wars of feudal lords .

		The reader can but vaguely guess at the progress of civilization .

		Fortunately , however , many incidents and episodes of history are related in detail which have been for centuries the classic themes of literature and art .

		The latter chapters of the book surpass theearlierin insight and enthusiasm .

		Great personalities of the later centuries are clearly portrayed .

		The horrible persecutions of the Christians are related in detail , and plentiful quotations from contemporary accounts render this chapter vivid .

		The author 's attitude toward the Portuguese mis - sionaries is generous , and his condemnation of the Dutch merchants unsparing ; it is to be questioned whether in either case he shows discrimination .

		Six appendices add greatly to the value of the volume .

		Affording , as it does , in a clear and readable style , an outline of Japanese history , and showing the roofs of present dominant race traits deeply planted in the soil of the ancient past , the book is to be welcomed as an addition to popular literature on the Orient .

		Biographical Entertainment of his readers appears studies in to have been Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	's imposture , ^ f o jjj ect m writing his '' Famous Impostors '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for he announces in his Preface that the author , ' ; whose largest ex - perience has lain in the field of fiction , has aimed at dealing with his material as with the material for a novel , except that all the facts given are real and authentic '' in his opinion , at least .

		The book is unquestionably of a character to interest the majority of readers , treating as it does of a con - siderable number of noted impostors of various kinds , such as pretenders to royalty , practitioners of magic , clairvoyants , so-called witches and wizards , women playing the role of men , the authors of various hoaxes , the famous
Tichborne Claimant	PERSON	, and others .

		Of course that popular favorite ,
Cagliostro	LOCATION	, is made to perform a few of his celebrated tricks for the reader 's entertainment , nor is any hint conveyed that he was not as genuine a trickster as the best of them .

		No echo from Mr.
W. R. H. Trowbridge	PERSON	's recent attempt to prove him an honest man is heard in Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	's account of him .

		Perhaps it is too soon to expect it .

		The concluding chapter of the book is the longest and shows the most study and original research .

		It is a serious , an unexpectedly serious , examination of the legend of the so-called
Bisley Boy	ORGANIZATION	, the person substituted , if the tradition be true , for the infant Elizabeth when that princess had suddenly died of a fever at
Bisley	LOCATION	, and her nurse , in an agony of fear , was momentarily expect - ing
King Henry	ORGANIZATION	to pay his little daughter a visit .

		That Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	, almost against his will , was led to take a great interest in this astonishing legend , speaks at least in favor of its plausibility .

		Though it was obviously necessary to omit from his book a great many famous impostors , the author might , with timeliness , have added a chapter on notorious frauds in the field of geographical exploration .

		The book is handsomely printed , and has some well - chosen portraits .

		_ A new ^ S ^ has a 5611 in th e

		The long-disputed and hotly -
Babvionia	LOCATION	.

		contested question as to the real originators of the civilization of
Babylonia	LOCATION	is prac - tically settled .

		Mr.
Leonard W. King	PERSON	's recent vol - ume entitled '' A History of Sumer and Akkad '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- forms the latest and most complete discus - sion of the problem .

		Being an expert Assyriologist , Mr.
King	PERSON	has utilized with rare skill the curious and complicated cuneiform inscriptions that have been excavated in
Babylonia	LOCATION	during the last twenty years .

		He has marshalled the evidence in a master - ful fashion to show when the so-called Sumerians came into
Babylonia	LOCATION	, what they captured , what city-states they organized and ruled , what religion they possessed , and what culture they developed and contributed to their successors , the Babylonians and Assyrians .

		On the evidence of the original documents themselves , the Sumerians came into
Babylonia	LOCATION	not earlier than 3400 B.C. , and assumed sway over the Semites then occupying it For thirteen hundred years , or until
2100	DATE	B.C. , they developed , expanded , and attained a degree of culture that , for bold originality and vigorous growth , has no peer in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		Their successors in
Babylonia	LOCATION	, at the founding and unification of the great monarchy , were little more than imitators of the unique Sumerians .

		The language and the art of these non-Semites is beautifully illustrated in this very convincing and timely volume .

		Impression , of The title of *** ' C -
Reginald Enock	PERSON	's American travel new volume , '' Farthest West : Life bv a Briton .

		and Travel in the
United States	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a trifle misleading , for the author 's starting point is on British shores , and his entertain - ing book deals with travel not in the States of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	alone but rather throughout our entire country .

		It has , however , a strong western flavor , 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, for the writer is evidently at home in the mining regions of
California	LOCATION	.

		He is an observant traveller , but his book is not lumbered up with guide-book minutiae .

		It is rather an assessment of values , scenic , geographic , economic , industrial , social , and political of things American as they penetrate the comprehension of our typically conservative brother from across the seas .

		Mr.
Enock	PERSON	even at - tempts an analysis of American humor !

		He seems , however , to have lived long enough in
America	LOCATION	to have become tainted by our national vice of exag - geration in his portrayal of some of our failures and shortcomings , though on the whole his criticisms will appeal to the candid reader as just and often gener - ous , and however scathing they are always interest - ing and worth reading .

		Like most books of such a general nature , this offers some minor examples of misinformation .

		One hardly expects to observe the '' white tower-buildings of
New York	LOCATION	, '' as one approaches the Statue of Liberty from
Sandy Hook	PERSON	, '' in the haze of the
New England	LOCATION	shore . ''

		The state - ment that the Great Lake region has never been invaded by yellow fever in
Winter	DATE	-LRB- sic -RRB- , and that malaria is found only in its denser swamps , hardly conveys a correct idea of the sanitary condition of that region .

Rebecca Paulding	PERSON	olden time .

		Meade 's '' Life of
Hiram Paulding	PERSON	, Rear - Admiral , U.S.N. '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- makes a graceful appearance , and also sets forth clearly and interestingly the gallant services ren - dered to his country by this officer of our old-time wooden-built and wind-propelled navy .

		Those whose memories go back to the Civil War will remember Paulding as Commandant of the
New York Navy Yard	LOCATION	, where his untiring exertions effected , among much else , the timely equipment of the `` Monitor , '' then called the ''
Ericsson	ORGANIZATION	, '' so as to make possible its memorable engagement with the '' Merrimac . ''

		Mrs.
Meade	PERSON	's book is well illustrated and contains frequent extracts from contemporary letters and journals .

		In short , it handsomely meets the ex - pectations aroused by the prefatory statement that it is `` an attempt , on the part of his children , to tell to those who care to hear it the story of one of our public men , a chivalrous hero of the old days , ' sans peur et sans reproche , ' whose official life is interwoven with his country 's history , whose home life was a rarely beautiful one , and whose example is worthy of imitation . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The series of brief lives of great Americans known as '' The Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has recently been enlarged by two new volumes , one on
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	by Mr.
Lindsay Swift	PERSON	and one on
George Washington	LOCATION	by Mr.
Worthington Chauncey Ford	PERSON	.

		The plan of the series , - - to give a general sum - mary of the life , character , and influence of the subject , is well carried out in both volumes .

		Dr.
Charles W. Super	PERSON	has edited , and Mr.
C. W. Bardeen	PERSON	has published , a translation of three treatises by
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	on education '' The Education of Boys , '' '' How a Young Man Should Hear Lectures on Poetry , '' and '' The Right Way to Hear . ''

		All of which matter , with the accompanying introduction and notes , makes up a volume called '' Plutarch on Education , '' which is highly instructive , and much sounder in doctrine than nine-tenths of the current pedagogical output .

		We do not know how many students of Portuguese are to be found in American colleges , but such as there are will be glad to have as good an elementary text - book as is now provided by Dr.
John C. Branner	PERSON	in his '' Brief Grammar of the Portuguese Language . ''

		This book is formed upon the best twentieth century models , and has a few extracts for reading , besides the neces - sary vocabularies .

		It is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, as are also the following texts : `` Spanish Composition , '' by Dr.
J. P. Wickersham-Crawf	PERSON	ord ; Ibafiez 's '' La Barraca , '' edited by Mr.
Hayward Keniston	PERSON	; '' Handbook of German Idioms , '' by Mr.
M. B. Lambert	PERSON	; and '' Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme , '' edited by M. M. Le * vi .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	add to their '' Standard English Classics '' three new volumes : '' A Midsummer-Night 's Dream , '' edited by
Henry N. Hudson	PERSON	; Lodge 's ''
Rosa	PERSON	- lynde , '' edited by Dr.
Edward C. Baldwin	PERSON	; and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's '' Essays on
Clive	PERSON	and
Hastings	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
Charles R. Gaston	PERSON	.

		The same publishers send us an '' Introduction to the Study of the Divine Comedy , '' by
Signor Francesco Flamini	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
Freeman M. Josselyn	PERSON	.

		The author seeks to guide wanderers lost in '' the wild wood of arbitrary interpretations '' and to provide him with '' an organic and simple system of general interpretation . ''

		Aristotle and
Aquinas	PERSON	, he as - sures us , are the philosophers who supply the proper clue to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		Two interesting art monographs are found in the special
Autumn	DATE	and
Winter	DATE	numbers of '' The Interna - tional Studio , '' published by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume , edited by Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	and entitled '' Peasant Art in
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Lapland	LOCATION	, and
Iceland	LOCATION	, '' offers illuminating proofs of the fact that
Sweden	LOCATION	'' is some - thing more than the dwelling-place of bears ... a place where culture was slow to strike root , and where its development was retarded by an unpromising soil and intellectual night-frosts . ''


Iceland	LOCATION	and
Lapland	LOCATION	are treated more briefly , but the six hundred full-page illustrations , in color and half-tone , of the peasant cot - tages , furniture , wood-carving , metal work , jewelry , tapestries , etc. , give an adequate idea of the art de - velopment of all three countries .

		The second volume , profusely illustrated , and provided with an introductory essay by Mr.
Malcolm C. Salaman	PERSON	, is devoted to a study of old English mezzotints .

		The lives and works of such artists as
Prince Rupert	LOCATION	,
Abraham Blooteling	PERSON	,
John Simon	PERSON	,
Van Bleeck	ORGANIZATION	,
Richard Houston	PERSON	,
Valentine Green	ORGANIZATION	,
John Dean	PERSON	,
John Raphael Smith	PERSON	whose cop - per plates gave such ideal expression to the charm of
Romney	ORGANIZATION	's art and many others , are treated in detail ; while in conclusion Mr.
Salaman	PERSON	prophesies that '' now after a long interval of inanition , the beautiful art of mezzotint , in the hands of that legitimate heir of the great engravers , Mr.
Frank Short	PERSON	and his school , promises to develop a capacity for original pictorial expression unimagined by the old reproductive mezzo - tinters . ''

Life of Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	, which
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue in this country .

		A biography of
Victorien Sardou	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.

Sardou	ORGANIZATION	was continually engaged .

		A translation of ''
Don Quijote	PERSON	, '' omitting the short stories and '' some of the poor poetry , '' has been made by Mr.
Robinson Smith	PERSON	, and is published in an un - adorned but dignified volume of seven hundred pages by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of a noteworthy series of articles by Mr.

S. G. Tallentyre	PERSON	'' is soon to be published in this country by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the title , ''

		The author of the volume , Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	, has written to a
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper to avow his American origin .

		A new volume of '' Letters of
Edward Lear	PERSON	'' is promised for early publication .

		The coming volume covers the latter portion of
Lear	PERSON	's life , and the corre - spondence is said to be marked by an under-current of seriousness , though there is no lack of the humor and paradox in which the author of the '' Book of Nonsense '' always delighted .

		Among the immediately forthcoming publications of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sous are '' The Ashes of a God , '' by Mr.
F. W. Bain	PERSON	; `` Love and Marriage , '' by the Swedish writer ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	; `` Behind the Screens : An English Woman 's Impressions of

		The English Poet Laureate , Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, who will be Seventy - six next
May	DATE	, has written his reminis - cences , and the work will be published in two volumes by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	during the present season .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	practised as a barrister for a few years , but it is probable that his recollections will be mainly occupied with his career as journalist and man of letters .

		The well-known handbook called '' Familiar Trees and their Leaves , '' by Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	, will appear presently in a new and much enlarged edition .

		The text has been revised throughout , and a supple - ment has been added containing information about many trees which were not discussed in the earlier editions , and also new data about our familiar trees which has come to light since the book was written .

		Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	, who , in spite of the many books to his credit , is still under forty , will soon issue a volume of reminiscences .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	is a grandson of
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	, and during his youth he saw a great deal of the chief figures in the pre-Raphaelite movement .

		His recollections give us glimpses of the Rossettis ,
William Morris	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and others who played a leading part in the development of nineteenth - century art and literature .

		Although `` The Broad Highway , '' which Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish this month in an Amer - ican edition , is , so far as the public is concerned , Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	's first book , he has been writing fiction for some eight or nine years past .

		His brilliant romance of eighteenth-century
England	LOCATION	was written over three years ago , and occupied two years in the writing , dur - ing part of which time Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	was employed in scene-painting for the Astor Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	.

		He was born thirty years ago in
Birmingham	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, but has lived nearly all his life in Kent .

		Another story of Mr.
Faruol	PERSON	's that is to be published shortly is called `` The Money-Moon '' ; it was written before `` The Broad Highway , '' and , as its title sufficiently suggests , is of a much lighter character .

		He is at present work - ing on a new romance dealing again with the days of the Prince Regent , and hopes to have it ready for pub - lication in the autumn .

		`` RUNNING STORY o/SOCIALISM '' `` AX able review and forecast of what President
Taft	PERSON	hag called ' the - * - next great issue before the American people ' is N'ewton
Mann	PERSON	's ` IMPORT AND OUTLOOK OF SOCIALISM , 1 from the press of the
James H. West Company	PERSON	, Publishers , of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In this work the author sketches rapidly the rise and interna - tional course of Socialism , beginning with the Utopian Communism of the early nineteenth century , and reaching now to a stage and view - point from which social transformation of the world appears dimly on the horizon of possibilities . ''

		There is little of the earlier method of Socialistic propaganda !

		* in Mr.
Mann	PERSON	's book , which is probably the beat and fairest presenta - tion of the claims of the proletariat that has been made in print by an American writer .

		World events render obsolete the old form of invec - tive , denunciation , and passionate appeal .

		Mr.
Mann	PERSON	employs liber - ally inductive processes of reasoning ; and his basic data , drawn from administrative and economic practice in many lands , are curiously suggestive sometimes almost startling . ''

		-LSB- The North American here quotes from the book a con - siderable series of examples , then continuing :] '' As a friendly survey of a momentous social and economic move - ment , written without prejudice and with clear understanding of present-day exigencies and conditions , Mr.
Mann	PERSON	's work is interesting and instructive .

		It names names , and gives dates and places , instead of ranting furiously or darkening understanding . ''

Stratford	LOCATION	, which was especially established , under the direction of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, to do honor to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town .

		It is the only complete edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works ever printed and published in his native town , and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart from any other existing or future edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lines are numbered at the side .

		An English hand-made paper , with

		The edition has been carefully produced under the supervision of Mr.

		A unique feature is the elimination of the great mass of notes which usually clog the pages of our great classic and impede the reader .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS .133 The * amiable gentleman who organized the Congresses of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, and who presided over their sessions , included among his duties that of opening the proceedings of each new
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with an introductory address .

		Being a gentleman of much learning and versa - tility , his opening remarks were usually appro - priate and felicitous .

		But on one occasion he went distinctly wrong .

		When the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	convened for the first time , he felt that the gathering called for an unusual effort , and his friends were a little aghast when they de - tected a semblance of rhythm in what he was saying , and soon found their suspicions con - firmed by the discovery that they were listening to an address in blank verse .

		No mere prose would serve for such an occasion and audience as this , and the presiding officer was not the man to shirk an obvious obligation .

		So the assembled authors were addressed -LRB- fortunately at no great length -RRB- in what was supposed to be their own tongue , and endured the ordeal with a degree of well-bred composure that effectively concealed their real feelings . ''

		Gute Leute aber schlechte Musikanten '' was
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's de - scription of the class of people to which the speaker belonged ; misguided poets we have thought to call them , although there is an element of question-begging in the phrase .

		The number of people who think that they can write poetry if they wish , and with easy assurance '' toss off '' a pedestrian effusion -LRB- often ornamented with bad rhymes -RRB- when some occa - sion seems to call for it , is a large one ; and the number is unduly swollen by the easy-going character of the average American company , ready to bestow equal applause upon thought and inanity , and to weigh the intention rather than the performance , provided only the inten - tion be to flatter or to please .

		The sort of com - position in spurious verse to which we refer is alarmingly prevalent at banquets , and in women 's clubs , and upon ceremonial occasions generally , when the whole proceedings are of a nature to induce a condition of hebetude in those present , and when the critical faculty is by tacit consent held in abeyance .

		The victims of the misguided poet are apt to have dulled senses at such times , the result of too much eating and drinking , possibly , or of the toxins 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, developed in the system by too many statistics or too much oratory .

		There are things for which even a bad poem will offer a kind of relief , and the relief is too frequently forthcoming .

		It sometimes happens that the ready versifier occupies a position , or possesses an influence , that makes the raising of objections , or the indulgence in anything but warm expressions of simulated delight , a delicate if not a danger - ous matter .

		We think of
Nero	ORGANIZATION	and
Richelieu	PERSON	and the German Emperor as historical examples .

		An instance at once modern and American is supplied by the circular letter of remonstrance that was recently sent from
Panama	LOCATION	to the
Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It seems that the Governor of the
Canal Zone	ORGANIZATION	is one of those persons who indulge in poetical propensities at the expense of their entourage , and his per - formances have become more than sensitive souls can bear , especially in a tropical climate . ''

		It is not , '' says the letter , '' that we who are helping to dig the canal have any objection to real poetry .

		But Governor
Thatcher	PERSON	's poetry has corns on every foot , despite which he feels it his duty to board incoming steamships and read a rhymed address to the most distinguished visitor on board .

		He did this in the case of the late President Montt of
Chile	LOCATION	.

		Something should be done at once by those in authority at
Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		The accompanying exhibit enables us to share in the disturbed sensibilities of the remonstrants . ''

		Who are loyal , strong , and brave ?

		The Chileans , sir !

		Who are masters of the wave ?

		The Chileans , sir !

		Who laugh at danger and the grave ?

		Who gladly die their land to save ?

		Who rule where mighty waters lave ?

		The Chileans , sir ! ''

		It must be admitted that here is a grievance .

		The immediate victim of this assault may have escaped unscathed because of his blissful ignor - ance of the English language , but our heart goes out to the unfortunate Americans who were compelled to stand by and listen .

		This Macedonian cry closes with an appeal that k ' all in authority read these effusions , understand our position , appreciate our difficulties , and give us relief .

		We do not ask for the Governor 's removal .

		He is a well-meaning man , although misguided .

		But we do demand that he stick to prose , keep out of the moonlight , and not inflict verses on his helpless subordinates . ''

		History has a way of repeating itself , and the disclosure of the conditions above described recalls a similar instance which we have long cherished .

		There was once a schoolmaster in Dundee whose poetic offerings upon public affairs were of such a nature as to evoke a vigorous protest .

		His verses have not , to our knowledge , been preserved , but they were bad enough to occasion the following entry , dated
1745	DATE	, in the town archives : '' The Council authorize the Theasaurer to give to Mr.
Lawder	PERSON	, one of the Masters of the Latine School of this
Burrow	LOCATION	, Two Guineas for his pains and Charges in making some poyms upon the
Town of Dundie	ORGANIZATION	, which are now hung up in the
Town House	ORGANIZATION	; but at same time intimate to him not to make any more of those poyms without the Magistrates ' approbation . ''

		This seems to cover the case very completely , and to afford a precedent for our own official action .

		May it not be suggested that this judgment , in the absence of any statutory provision fitting the case , should be considered a part of the common law , and applied for the relief of the oppressed Panamanians ?

		Our self-appointed Poets Laureate , wherever they may raise their voices under the a3gis of political station , should be gently but firmly taken in hand by some kind of authority .

		In the class of misguided poets we must include many for whose activities the public shares the responsibility , not merely by reason of its excess of good nature , but by reason of its uncritical approval of productions that belong upon the rubbish-heap .

		We have been speaking only of effusions that are taken seriously by none save their authors , of '' freak '' poetry that reveals to the least discriminating readers its own halting gait and manifest absurdity .

		But there is a great deal of bad verse that owes its existence to the applause of people who are ignorant of the very meaning of the word '' poetry , '' but whose ears are tickled by any kind of a jingle , and whose feelings are stimu - lated by any kind of mushy sentimentality .

		There is no more important task for the mis - sionary work of criticism than that of laboring with those strata of the uneducated in which brummagem is thought to be precious metal , and the counterfeit coin passes undetected .

		For bad poetry of the sort that finds warm ad - mirers has always existed , and always will ; the task of Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	with her broom was not more discouraging than is that of the preacher of the gospel of pure literature in this unregen - erate world .

		But the task must not be shirked , despite its hopelessness , and here and there the rescue of a soul from the mire of vulgar im - agery and false sentiment will be accomplished , giving the worker an ample sense of reward .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DUTIES OF THE NEW THEATRE were the subject of caustic comment by Sir
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, in a lecture recently delivered at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English playwright , inspired by the presence in the audience of ten of the founders of the enterprise , spoke somewhat at length on the unescapable responsibility resting upon the great playhouse of '' fostering a school of American drama , '' of '' bringing about an alliance between lit - erature and the drama in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Performances of classic plays , revivals of interesting works of the last generation , the encouragement , by occasional presentation , of plays of literary and artistic merit , but without the power to capture immediate popular attention , these are all objects subsidiary to the first great one , which alone can justify an institution with the national scope of the New Theatre .

		And it is a grave question where the worthy plays are to come from , and why the New Theatre , more than any purely commercial enterprise , may expect to bring them forth .

		This criticism is especially in - teresting in view of the theatre 's recent production of `` The Piper , '' surely an example of the sort of play that the lecturer had in mind .

		The American pro- duction is to the honor of the New Theatre ; although , as Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	, who still writes as
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	, laughingly said in an interview , they were n't `` dreadfully keen '' to have it until after its English success . ''

		There had been plenty of time after it was published in book form and before the English prize-winner was announced , for any enthusiasm , if it was really felt , to be manifested on this side , and none was apparent . ''

		Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	, in the course of rehearsals , found the American actor 's inability to catch the rhythm of poetry very '' har - rowing '' ; and she shares the opinion of many
New York	LOCATION	critics that the
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's part has not been wisely cast , though she speaks most appreciatively of the wonderful artistry displayed by
Miss Matthison	PERSON	in the role .

		INSECT BOOK-LOVERS , including paste-eaters , binding-devourers , and paper-gluttons -LRB- divided into those that prefer wood-pulp , those that feast on other vegetable fibres , and those that hunger after mineral fillers -RRB- , are far more numerous than is com - monly believed .

		The insects destructive of bindings alone may be subdivided into those whose taste is for morocco , those that delight in vellum , those whose preference leans toward calfskin , those with a plebeian fondness for the plain wood that covers some volumes , and so on .

		Mr.
William R. Reinick	PERSON	, custodian of public documents at the Free Library of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, has been for several years hot on the track of these illiterate devotees of literature , and has not only published a highly informing and useful treatise on '' Insects Destructive to Books '' -LRB- in '' The American Journal of Pharmacy '' for
December , 1910	DATE	, and reprinted in separate form -RRB- , but hopes to give out before long some later and fuller information on the same subject .

		As to methods of destroying these pests , he says in con - cluding his treatise : * ' Cleanliness in the handling of papers , books , and documents will be of more value than all the poisons combined .

		Let common - sense prevail , make sanitary rules in the home and in the Dublic library an enforced rule , and it will lessen and arrest the rapid growth of the little in - > sects which feed upon our silent friends of so much value to us , besides eliminating the possibilities of contagious diseases . ''

		Rather startling , if true , is the statement that '' more books and papers are de - stroyed by small forms of life in one year than by fire and water combined . ''

		On the whole , it seems safe to say of the oft-mentioned but seldom-seen book-worm , that its name is legion , and its variety innumerable .

		But , fortunately , we of northern lati - tudes are comparatively immune from its ravages .

		A FORCED INTERPRETATION OF
LINCOLN	LOCATION	, the writer and speaker of dignified and sonorous Eng - lish , is contributed to '' The North American Re - view '' for
February	DATE	by Mr
James Raymond Perry	PERSON	, who has convinced himself , and wishes to convince his readers , that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's prose is in reality poetry in disguise .

		To this end , he cuts up into lines , arbitrarily enough many times , a number of pas - sages from
Lincoln	LOCATION	's writings , presenting them thus in a certain Walt Whitman dress which does bear some visible resemblance to poetry .

		The
Gettys	PERSON	- burg address indeed rises to the dignity and im - pressiveness of an elegiac poem , but not even this eloquent utterance admits of being divided into lines metrically faultless , or even approximately faultless .

		And when the attempt is made , as Mr.
Perry	PERSON	cour - ageously makes it , to versify the '' First Inaugural , '' the result is , to say the least , not convincing .

		Who , without a pet theory to prove , would ever discern much of real poetry in the opening of that address ?

		`` I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservation , and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules .

		And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as proper to be enforced , I do suggest that it will be much safer for all , both in official and private stations , to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed , than to violate any of them , trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional . ''

		Let the reader try to cut this into verse-lengths , and then see how nearly , or how distantly , his division agrees with Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's .

		If Lincoln was a poet , then every writer of good rhythmical prose and all good prose is rhythmical is likewise a poet THE DEATH OF
ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS WARD	PERSON	, on the 29th of
January	DATE	, came unexpectedly , her illness having been but a short one .

		Ever since the age of thirteen she had been writing for publica - tion , and her earliest book , `` The Gates Ajar , '' which appeared in
1868	DATE	, when she was but twenty-four years old , immediately won for her a host of read - 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ers , their numbers rather increasing than diminish - ing as she followed up this remarkable success with novels not always so strikingly original , but always inspired with intensity of conviction and loftiness of moral purpose .

		`` The list of her books is a long one , and need not here be given even in part .

		Hardly a year passed , during her productive period , that did not see a new book , sometimes more than one , from her pen ; and they always maintained the same high ethical and religious level , impressing their lessons indeed with some straining of incident , some undue shrillness in the note struck , and some - thing that was occasionally out of drawing in the characters delineated .

		But this daughter of the gifted
Andover	LOCATION	professor of '' sacred rhetoric '' was always true to her
New England	LOCATION	traditions , and her work is not unworthy of comparison with the best of the good old
New England	ORGANIZATION	school to which she properly belonged .

		Her biography of her father ,
Austin Phelps	PERSON	, teacher at the
Andover Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, and for ten years the executive head of that institution , should not be overlooked in any review of her writings ; nor should her fame as novelist wholly obscure her talent as a writer of verse .

		Her death at the comparatively early age of sixty-six will cause deep and lasting regret to the many who found solace and cheer in her books .

William II	PERSON	.

		for mingled versatility , impetuosity , impatience of opposition , and sublime self-assurance , now makes a bid for the world 's attention in books that have been translated from their original French into English , German , Span - ish , Italian , Danish , Russian , Hungarian , and even Esperanto .

		Dr.
Gustave Le Bon	PERSON	, whose latest book is entitled `` La Psychologie Politique et la
Defense Sociale	ORGANIZATION	, '' has written also on so many other subjects that it would be easier to name the branches of learning left untouched by him than to enumerate those with which he has concerned himself .

		If one is to believe his friends and admirers , he possesses a sort of intuitive knowledge of all science .

		His u Evolution of Matter '' is hailed by one reviewer as the most startling pronouncement in science since
Newton	PERSON	's '' Principia , '' and his '' Psychology of Education '' is declared by another to have already influenced a large part of the educational world .

		We used to take justifiable pride in the scope of Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's studies and writings ; he could apparently with equal ease compose an epic poem and write a textbook on geology ; but if all the things we hear of Dr. Le Bon are true ,
Shaler	PERSON	's readiness as an encyclopaedic writer was not worthy of comparison with this extraordinary Frenchman 's .

		THE PROSPECTIVE SALE OF THE HUTH LIBRARY , one of the last of the famous collections of books got together by English bibliophiles , will disperse some literary treasures of unequaled value .


Alfred Henry Huth	PERSON	, of
Fosbury Manor	ORGANIZATION	near
Hungerford	LOCATION	, succeeded in
1878	DATE	to the ownership of the splendid library that his father ,
Henry Huth	PERSON	, had spent a quarter of a century or more and one hundred and twenty thousand pounds in forming .

		The death of the son last year seems to have left the library practically without an owner , or at least without one interested in preserving intact this rare collection , and the executors of the estate are about to place the library in the hands of Messrs.
Sotheby	PERSON	for auction sale .

		Among the treasures of the collection are several fifteenth-century Bibles , notably the
Mazarin	PERSON	for which
Henry Huth	ORGANIZATION	paid nearly three thousand pounds , and the
Faust	LOCATION	and Schoffer which cost him considerably less , but is hardly less interesting to the book-lover .

		A good number of Caxtons , in - cluding '' The Game and Playe of Chesse '' and the ''
Speculum Vitae Christi	PERSON	, '' and the four Shakespeare folios , with some of the rarest quartos , are named , as well as many other first or early editions of Eng - lish classics .

		The joy in the bosom of collectors at the release of all these treasures , many of which will be scrambled for at fabulous prices , and the inevitable bitterness in the heart of unsuccessful bidders , are matters passing the power of pen to deal with adequately .

		THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN 'S QUALIFICATIONS , or , in other words , the equipment necessary for the management of a special library , must always in - clude a good general knowledge of library science built upon a broad basis of general education .

		The 24th annual report of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	closes with some remarks on '' Training for Special Library Work , '' and maintains that `` the ideal combination is a technical training in some branch or related branches , a broad general educa - tion , and library training or experience . ''

		The special library is coming into more and more promi - nence in the business and industrial world , and in the arts and sciences , thus affording new openings for our library school graduates .

		In regard to these newly created positions , which are sure to become more numerous as time passes , the writer already quoted says : '' Though opportunities in special libraries -LRB- other than in cataloguing or clerical posi - tions -RRB- seem better at present for men than for women , there is a growing demand for both men and women of suitable personality , education , and training .

		From its practical character and its direct contact with men and industries , the special library should be a particularly attractive field for the young man of scientific or professional training to whom the bookish side of his profession appeals more strongly than its field work or its office routine . ''

		... THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A PROFITABLE INVEST - MENT was the subject of a recent notable address from Mr.
Hiller C. Wellman	PERSON	, librarian of the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB-
City Library	LOCATION	, before the local
Publicity Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		A surprising array of facts was placed before the audience to prove the money value of the library to the community ; not that this is its chief value , but , as the speaker took occasion
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 to explain , '' it is just because the primary purpose of a library is not commercial that I suspect we are apt to overlook the actual cash dividends which a library yields .

		The library of to-day studies the industrial life of the community and endeavors to supply the books that will aid every trade and every calling that exist in the city .

		It is eager to meet every demand , but it goes further : it en - deavors to create the demand .

		It advertises ; it uses every legitimate means of making its resources known .

		As advertising men , you may be interested to know that at least three per cent of the library 's expenditure is used directly or indirectly to further this sort of advertising .

		The result has been an increase in the extent and variety and scope of the services rendered that few people have any idea of . ''

		To refer to a single one of these profitable activities , by furnishing the numerous foreigners of its com - munity with elementary text-books from which to acquire a knowledge of their adopted language , the
Springfield	LOCATION	library has helped many of them to secure and retain paying positions , besides helping to make them good English-speaking citizens .

		THE HAUNTING ASSOCIATIONS OF A WORD will never be explained by any analysis of its sound - elements or any tracing of its etymology .

		Mr.
F. M. Wells	PERSON	writes in the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' on u Why Some English Sounds are a Delight to the Ear , '' adducing a number of words that have especial charm or significance to him and quoting aptly an unnamed critic 's commendation of Pater ,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Laf	ORGANIZATION	adio
Hearn	PERSON	as producing literature '' in which form and matter are essentially one ... besides ful - ness , beauty and melody of sound .

		Words are so used as to summon to the mind a deeper , a more psychic or , if you will , spiritual feeling than the primary thought which the language superficially conveys . ''

		Every man can instance words that from his early child - hood have possessed for him unaccountable power and beauty .

		To the present writer the word '' fairy '' was one of the earliest of these magic words .

		Another word , which turned out to be no word at all , had acquired a peculiar and satisfying significance until , on first hearing it pronounced after having only a literary acquaintance with it , the delightful illusion was shattered .

		The word was `` misled , '' which had been conceived of as the past tense of a present '' misle '' -LRB- pronounced mi-zel -RRB- .

		To '' misle '' a person had seemed the most perfect form of humbuggery conceivable ; and how much poorer the language seemed when it was learned that no such word existed !

		SIB
FRANCIS GALTON	PERSON	, whose recreations , accord - ing to '' Who 's Who , '' were '' sunshine , quiet , and good , wholesome food , '' lived by their aid to the ripe old age of eighty-nine years less one month .

		His '' Memories of My Life , '' which came out two years ago , reminded a too forgetful world that before achieving fame as an anthropologist -LRB- as a writer on heredity , as inventor of finger-print identification , and as a pioneer in the science of eugenics -RRB- he had already , sixty years ago , done notable things in African exploration -LRB- as chronicled in his ''
Narra	PERSON	- tive of an Explorer in
Tropical South Africa	LOCATION	'' and '' The Art of Travel '' -RRB- and in the science of meteor - ology -LRB- see his `` Meteographica , or Methods of Map - ping the Weather '' -RRB- .

		But it will be for his '' Hered - itary Genius , '' his '' Inquiries into Human Faculty , '' and his '' Natural Inheritance , '' that he will be best remembered .

		As a skilful manipulator of statistics and as a deducer from them of daring and original conclusions , he won the admiring attention of readers far beyond the limits of his own country .

		He de - monstrated in his own person the wisdom of choos - ing one 's ancestors with care .

		THE CENTENARY OF THE ACADEMIA BELLA CRUSCA was celebrated at
Florence	LOCATION
last month	DATE	, and the occasion was made memorable by the announce - ment that work will at once be resumed on the great Italian dictionary long ago undertaken by the Academy but apparently languishing for want of that government aid which is now promised .

		The famous society is to be reorganized , says the report from
Florence	LOCATION	, and one hundred thousand francs is to be appropriated for its use .

		Now let the sister academy in
Paris	LOCATION	bestir itself and give the world a complete , authoritative , and up-to-date dictionary of the French language .

		This is the age of great enterprises in the department of reference works ; witness the ponderous
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	and the wonderful
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' as well as the `` English Literature '' and the `` Mod - ern History '' bearing the latter university 's name .

		RICHARD
WAGNER	PERSON	'S FORTHCOMING AUTOBIOG - RAPHY , which is promised for
May	DATE	publication , was written in the years 186873 and runs to nearly twelve hundred pages of manuscript .

		Clearer light on an interesting and variously interpreted as well as variously misrepresented character is to be ex - pected from this notable contribution to autobiog - raphical literature .

		The reason why this light is so tardily shed may be gathered from the following extract from the musician 's own preface : `` The contents of these volumes were taken down from my dictation , in the course of several years , by my friend and wife , who desired that the story of my life should be written by myself .

		The value of this autobiography is based on its plain truth ... My statements are , therefore , accompanied by exact names and figures , and consequently publication is not possible until some time after my death , if my descendants still care to undertake it . ''

		JOHN
LOCKWOOD KIPLING	PERSON	, notable as architec - tural sculptor , artist , art-teacher , author , and illustra - tor of his more famous son 's works , died in
London	LOCATION
January 29	DATE	.

		The relations between the father and son were almost those of comradeship in their interests and occupations .

		Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	has warmly acknowledged his indebtedness to his father .

Feb. 16	DATE	, '' Everything I am and everything I hope to be , '' are his reported words , '' I owe to my father .

		He taught me the way to see things and how to know things , and I have never departed from his teach - ings .

		I am only satisfied when my work meets with his approval . ''

		The father 's memory is per - petuated , in a veiled form , in several of the char - acters of the son 's books ; but with all these claims to remembrance he will probably be best remem - bered -LRB- as doubtless be himself would wish to be -RRB- simply as

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		MR.
SHAW	PERSON	'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SHAKESPEARE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Are you not rather inconsistent in printing , in the same issue -LRB- that of
Jan. 16	DATE	-RRB- , an account of the Irish playwright
John Synge	PERSON	, with a reference to his getting his dialogue through '' a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying , that let me hear what was being said by the servant-girls in the kitchen , '' and a paragraph about Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's '' Dark Lady , '' which assumes Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's purpose in showing Shakespeare as likewise a '' snapper-up of other men 's good sayings '' to have been , plainly , '' a desire to make Shakespeare ridiculous '' ?

		I have taken time to get a copy of '' The Red Book '' for the purposes of careful perusal of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's latest ebulition ; and I am inclined to think that at least a part of his object is to show a very warm appreciation of the particular sort of genius that he is willing to grant the god of the English stage ; namely , not the furnishing of a great philosophy or of a working theory of life , but the getting real life down on paper in an intensely interesting and wonderfully lyrical fashion .

		In one of the criticisms entitled '' Poor Shakespeare ! ''

		in the first volume of the '' Dramatic Opinions , '' Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	insists upon the over-mastering music of the early plays : '' it is the score and not the libretto that keeps the work alive and fresh , and this is why only musical critics should be allowed to meddle with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	especially early Shakespeare . ''

		A re-reading of that and other essays in the same series will serve to remind one that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has never once shown '' a desire to make Shakespeare ridiculous ; '' his attitude in the matter has been quite obscured , for most of us , by an amusing and daring epigram about
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Therefore , if there is humor in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's having written `` The Dark Lady '' to assist the projected Memorial Theatre , we should call it a humor of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's own particular brand , which is as far removed as possible from the '' horse-play '' that your rash paragrapher finds in his latest published work .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has spoken so often and so clearly about Shake - speare that he is probably tired of the subject ; but we wish he might be induced to clear up the present dis - cussion with one of his inimitably cogent '' rejoinders . ''

		THE PLEASURES OF SERIOUS READING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I want to commend the views expressed by Mr.
Cockerell	PERSON	in the last paragraph of his review entitled Six Million Years , '' in THE DIAL of
Feb. 1	DATE	.

		There is not a tenth part enough good reading done , and , furthermore , not one person in twenty-five who calls himself or herself a '' great reader '' has any idea of how vastly his or her life would be improved in every way if the level of reading were raised .

		The con - tinual newspaper and magazine reader of to-day bears the same relation to life that a
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's tourist does to travel .

		If you can not do better , why , do the best you can , of course ; but if you can choose between a smat - tering and a study , or between an express trip or a single long heaven-and-health-giving tramp , do try the little-tried once and you will never hesitate again .

		There are planes of readers , as there are ranking classes ; but we can not always choose our class , and we can always choose our reading .

		As one who has just finished
John Morley	PERSON	's
Life of Cobden	ORGANIZATION	and
Fuller 's Life of Cecil Rhodes	ORGANIZATION	, as one who is wandering in the footsteps of
Scott	LOCATION	and
Dickens	PERSON	through the pages of Christian Tearle 's '' An American in
England	LOCATION	'' and is learning both sides of the greatest modern problem by contrasting chapters from
Mallock	PERSON	and
Sidney Webb	PERSON	, I do feel qualified to speak for the fascination of good reading .

		The infallible test of a book is the same as of that treasure referred to in the
Bible	LOCATION	, to modernize the rust and the moth , let me say that a really '' good book '' leaves the reader consciously ahead in life .

		There are few '' good books '' which do not give those who absorb them a newer and higher view out over a bigger and better world .

		THE '' THIRTEEN ORIGINAL SITUATIONS '' AND '' ELEVEN ANCESTRAL WITTICISMS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Being interested in Professor
Felix E. Schilling	PERSON	's reference to '' the thirteen original stage situations '' and '' the eleven ancestral witticisms , '' as quoted by you in your issue of
January 16	DATE	, 1 wrote to Professor
Schelling	PERSON	asking if he would tell me just what these situations and witticisms were .

		He replies that the expressions were figures of speech , and were not intended to be taken literally .

		Regarding the `` eleven ancestral witticisms , '' he says that the expression '' has reference to a clever saying of Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	some years ago .

		She was speaking on the subject of wit , and said that a learned friend of hers had informed her that all current jokes might be reduced to ` eleven ancestral witticisms . '

		She also told us that she remarked , upon hearing this , that she was surprised there were so many . ''

		It seems to me that her `` learned friend '' might better have traced the sources of current humor to '' the seven original jokes , '' that being the usual expression as I have heard it , and one of long standing .

		In this connection 1 should say that I once wrote to
Mark Twain	PERSON	for information about the '' seven original jokes . ''

		Perhaps he saw m the question a contemplated thievery of his secret ; for I only received a formal note from his secretary saying in effect that he did not know of them but had often heard of them .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's reference to the `` thirteen orig - inal situations '' is explained by him as having arisen in his mind '' from some of the statements of books on dramatic technique which referred dramatic situations to a small number of possibilities . ''

		Possibly some reader of THE DIAL may be able to shed more definite light on the source and meaning of these expressions .

		THE DIAL 119 CI * Ax EARLY VICTORIAN ROMAXCER .

		* In his sketch of
William Harrison Ainsworth	PERSON	in '' The Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Axon	PERSON	observes : '' No biography of Ains - worth has appeared or is likely to be published . ''

		The improbable , however , frequently comes to pass ; and as for biographers , no man , good or bad , who attains to any prominence is free from the possibility of undergoing their curious microscopic researches .

		A popular author like
Ainsworth	PERSON	, whose pen was busy for sixty years , and who was a familiar figure in
London	LOCATION	lit - erary and journalistic circles for a quarter of a century , was , it seems to us , not so unlikely to find his biographer though there could now be no chance that a
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	would appear .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's biography is one of which any man might be proud to be the subject if not the author .

		It fills two handsome volumes , aggregating over nine hundred pages , and in - cluding fifty-six illustrations , four of which are photogravures .

		There is a genealogical chapter , a bibliography , and an index which alone fills seventy-four pages and should satisfy the de - mands of the most exacting critic .

		The story of A ins worth 's life is well planned and well told .

		Some deviations from a strictly chrono - logical order seem to be justified .

		The author shows commendable restraint and taste in not dwelling on the strictly private life of Ains - worth , with which the public need not concern itself ; indeed , he almost forgets , it would seem , to mention
Ainsworth	PERSON	's second marriage , merely referring to it several years after it took place .

		His admiration for
Ainsworth	ORGANIZATION	is great indeed , some will call it excessive .

		He is not wholly blind , however , to
Ainsworth	PERSON	's defects of char - acter .

		Of literary criticism the book contains perhaps too little .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	makes no attempt to compare
Ainsworth	PERSON	with other writers of romance or to estimate his achievement .

		He does to some extent compare
Ainsworth	PERSON	's books one with another .

		Although '' The Tower of
London	LOCATION	'' has been the most popular of Ains - worth 's stories , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	believes '' The Lan - cashire Witches '' to be his best .

		In dealing with the principal stories , the biographer de - votes considerable attention to the local scenery , the underlying basis of historical fact , and the artist 's illustrations .

		Interesting light is thus *

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		thrown on
Cruikshank	PERSON	, who drew the illustra - tions for ten of
Ainsworth	ORGANIZATION	's romances , and on the methods of working together adopted by author and illustrator .

		In claiming to be the '' originator '' of '' The Tower of
London	LOCATION	, ''
Cruikshank	PERSON	is seen in an unfavorable light ; probably he was the victim of a hallucination .

		In the treatment of ''
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	'' the ethics of the desperado romance receive due con - sideration , and the inconsistency of Thackeray in condemning
Ainsworth	PERSON	for writing a story '' infinitely more immoral than any thing Fielding ever wrote '' and praising
Cruikshank	PERSON	for ' ' really creating the tale '' is pointed out with telling effect .

		As a matter of fact ,
Ainsworth	LOCATION	, in being censured by a part of the British public for writing ''
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	, '' became a kind of scapegoat ; other '' offenders '' should have been included .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	puts it thus : '' If it is inherently immoral to take a criminal for literary purposes and make him picturesque and inter - esting , then the greatest writers will have to stand in the same pillory as the author of
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	.

		The principal characters of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tragedies of
Hamlet	LOCATION	, of
Macbeth	LOCATION	, of Othello are but murderers ; Falstaff is a robber and worse .

		Scott must answer for
Rob Roy	PERSON	; Fielding for Jonathan Wild ; Gay for The Beggar 's Opera ;
Schiller	PERSON	for The Robbers ; Hood for his magnificent
Eugene Aram ; Dumas	PERSON	for his Celebrated Crimes and so on through Literature of all times and countries . ''

		It may be added that if immorality was actually promoted by ''
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	'' and the plays to which it gave rise , it is a nice question as to what share of the guilt certainly a not incon - siderable one belongs to the latter .

		In the course of an extremely busy life
Ainsworth	PERSON	found time for several
Continental	ORGANIZATION	journeys .

		Of the journey to
Italy	LOCATION	in
1830	DATE	he kept a full record , from which about thirty pages of extracts are reproduced by Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	.

		This diary is full of youthful enthusiasm and shows
Ainsworth	PERSON	's power of description to advantage .

		His narrative of the ascent of Vesuvius , for example , though too long to quote here , is extremely vivid .

		Here is an impression of
Venice	LOCATION	: '' After visiting other churches and palaces , we saw the
Palazzo Foscari	PERSON	not that it is a show house , but merely because I felt some interest in the house itself .

		* It was shocking to see the deplorable state in which it is .

		It is an immense mansion , and must have been fitted up with great magnificence .

		The lower room is turned into a workshop for masons ; and the
Grand Hall	LOCATION	on the first floor is hung with faded tapestry , in depressing contrast beneath the proud portraits of the Doges , Senators , and Cardinals of this once lofty and * In 1821-2
Ainsworth	PERSON	had published parts of a tragedy entitled ''
Venice	LOCATION	, or The Fall of the Foscaris . ''

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, illustrious , but ever unfortunate line .

		It is in itself an emblem of
Venice	LOCATION	, of which the shell alone remains .

		All the spirit is fled , and the inhabitants who dwell here are no more the Venetians of old . ''

		After dinner we rowed out to the
Islands	ORGANIZATION	, and on our way enjoyed one of the most superb sunsets it has ever been my good fortune to witness .

		It was more than beautiful ; the sky and sea were stained with crimson , orange , gold , and blue all uniting and blend - ing with an infinity of shades more exquisite than the hues of a rainbow .

		The effect of this extraordinary relief to the spires of
Venice	LOCATION	and its picturesque outline of houses was quite wonderful .

		Some smoke , which was issuing from one of the islands , was tinged au couleur de rose .

		As the light faded away , the whole mass of the city was thrown into dark relief against the horizon and presented a picture something like a great trans - parency . ''

		In the article already referred to , Mr.
Axon	PERSON	also remarks that
Ainsworth	PERSON	's correspondence , when examined after his death , was found '' to have but little biographical or literary import - ance . ''

		The large selection printed by Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	does not wholly negative this view ; yet several letters are of much interest from a lit - erary point of view , and all are written in a fresh , true , natural style .

		We quote his de - scription of
Browning	PERSON	, written to
John Macrone	PERSON	in
July , 1836	DATE	: `` I had yesterday , as I anticipated , the pleasure of making your new Poet 's acquaintance , and from what I saw of him and from what I heard and saw I am induced to form a very high opinion of him .

		He is full of genius .

		In appearance he might pass for a son of
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	, and
Maclise	ORGANIZATION	and I must hide our diminished heads before his super-abundant black locks while even your whiskers , improved as they are by the salt water , are insignificant compared with his lion - like ruff .

		But this is absurd and as absurdity is the farthest thing removed from Mr.
Browning	PERSON	, I ought not to connect anything of the kind with him .

		Sordello complete , he is to write a Tragedy for
Macready	PERSON	and I feel quite sure that he has great dramatic genius . ''

		We do not know whether Ains worth under - stood '' Sordello '' or not ; but it is pleasant to note that he recognized
Browning	PERSON	's genius and urged Macrone to publish '' Sordello '' ; the latter apparently would have done so in
1837	DATE	had not death prevented .

		Many other great Victorians figure promin - ently in Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's pages ; the list of Ains - worth 's literary friends was a long one .

		Thus we find
Charles Lamb	PERSON	writing in
1823	DATE	about
William Warner	PERSON	's '' Syrinx '' : '' I have read
Warner	ORGANIZATION	with great pleasure .

		What an elaborate piece of alliteration and antithesis !

		W hy , it must have been a labour far above the most difficult versification .

		There is a fine simile or picture of Semi - ramis arming to repel a siege . ''


Ainsworth	PERSON	and
Charles Dickens	PERSON	were close friends for many years ; '' Boz '' was a frequent guest of
Ainsworth	ORGANIZATION	at
Kensal Manor House	ORGANIZATION	, and the two planned in
1838	DATE	to collaborate in a work which should '' illustrate ancient and modern
London	LOCATION	in a Pickwick form , '' but the plan came to nothing .

		Thackeray likewise was intimate with
Ainsworth	PERSON	; he was very fond of Ains - worth 's three little daughters , and often used to walk out to
Kensal	LOCATION	on
Sunday	DATE	and accompany the Ainsworths to evening service at
Willesden Church	ORGANIZATION	.


Wordsworth	PERSON	was also a visitor at
Kensal Manor	LOCATION	.

		There is no record of Ains - worth 's opinion of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; but an amus - ing letter from Mrs.
Hughes	PERSON	to Mrs.
Sou	PERSON	they is quoted in which she intimates very distinctly that for her , as well as for
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	, the Laureate idol had more than feet of clay .


Canon Barham	ORGANIZATION	, of u Ingoldsby Legends '' fame , took great interest in
Ainsworth	PERSON	's work , and
Ainsworth	PERSON	often visited
Barham	PERSON	at his house in
Amen Corner	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here also figure
Sergeant Talfourd	ORGANIZATION	,
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	,
G. P. R. James	PERSON	,
Lockhart	LOCATION	, Sir
Theodore Martin	PERSON	,
Captain Marryat	ORGANIZATION	,
Horace Smith	PERSON	,
Daniel Maclise	PERSON	, and many other important Englishmen of the forties and fifties .

		But the friend whose name recurs oftenest was
James Crossley	PERSON	, of
Manchester	LOCATION	, who became president of the
Chetham Society	ORGANIZATION	and who was one of the most bookish of men , amassing a library of over a hundred thousand volumes .

		His was a peculiarly devoted friend - ship , extending to almost seventy years , and
Ainsworth	PERSON	fully recognized its value .

		But we must take leave of this interesting book .

		There is about
Ainsworth	PERSON	's life a pathos which strikes the reader somewhat forcibly as he finishes this biography .

		Here was a man who , though he once spoke of himself as '' the idlest of the race of authors , '' lived to produce forty romances and was at one time the editor of three prominent magazines .

		Yet so fleeting is literary fame that in his advanced years , in order to maintain his family , he was compelled to keep on writing long after he had spent him - self , and that he died in reduced circumstances and comparative obscurity .

		It is customary , of course , to say that
Ainsworth	PERSON	was careless in his writing , and that if he had taken more pains he would have achieved a more lasting reputa - tion .

		But it will not do to say that
Ainsworth	PERSON	was careless -LRB- cf.
Ellis	PERSON	i. 413 -RRB- ; and although somebody has found a few dangling participles in his works , that does not account for his pass - ing from the field of popularity .

		It is owing in large measure to the coming in of new fash - ions in literature and of new writers with no
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 121 more genius than
Ainsworth	PERSON	possessed and with perhaps not so many admirable qualities as are exhibited in his character and his best works .

		For this much can be said for
Ainsworth	PERSON	: that he was far from being the least of those numerous '' imitators '' `` who followed in the wake of

		* The minute and laborious scholarship of the past century is at last bearing fruit that is within the reach of the ordinary public .

		The ancient Roman world is coming really to be understood .

		LIFE IN THE ROMAN WORLD OF NERO AND ST. PAUL .

		By
T. G. Tucker	PERSON	,
Professor of Classical Philology	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Melbourne	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Private Munificence , '' '' Marriage , Divorce , Childlessness , '' `` Why the Roman Empire Fell , '' such are some of the topics on which Professor
Davis	PERSON	writes , with a range so wide that his book is almost deservingof the title of '' Roman Life . ''

		In his attractive chapter on '' The Business Panic of 33 A.D. '' he begins by delivering the '' stunning blow between the eyes '' recognized in these days as the sine qua non in the publish - ing industry , and the reader is filled with lively anticipation of travelling the hedonistic , if not the royal , road to learning .

		Professor
Davis	PERSON	's succeeding chapters do not quite fulfil the promise of the first .

		They are so closely packed with masses of data , and court so little the graces of presentation , as to savor somewhat of lecture-notes and the card - catalogue ; the proof is carelessly read ; there are occasional gaucheries which mar the other - wise nervous and rapidly-moving style ; and there are inaccuracies in statement of fact .

		One might find fault , too , with the use in the same paragraph of evidence from
Horace	PERSON	and
Jerome	PERSON	, or from Ammianus and Pliny .

		To treat as a unity the diversities of a period embracing three or four centuries , or of the lands of an empire extending from
Spain	LOCATION	to
Syria	LOCATION	and from
England	LOCATION	to
Egypt	LOCATION	, may indeed find its excuse in the homogeneity of Roman civilization ; but , after all , when we think of a historian doing the like for
Great Britain	LOCATION	or the
United States	LOCATION	, we begin to realize the possi - bilities of such license .

		And again , the book contains too much detail for the lay reader , and too little apparatus for the scholar .

		On the whole , Professor
Davis	PERSON	would have better ful - filled his declared purpose of conveying to the average reader a realizing sense of '' the realm of the great god Lucre '' if he had presented his points of view in a series of essays , making sparing use of representative facts from the great mass at hand ; or if he had utilized again the historical novel , a vehicle which he has shown himself so competent to employ .

		The lighter form of conveyance would at the same time have conciliated a larger audience and made stronger impression on the individual .

		We hasten to add that Professor
Davis	PERSON	's work has pronounced virtues , and will be found highly serviceable .

		It has a wide range , is pre - sented in orderly and effective manner , and really illuminates ; and it is the only book in the language that covers the ground in this manner .

		Those who wish to rehabilitate in imagination a great period in the history of the great people whose civilization lies so broadly 122 -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, and deeply at the foundations of our modern life will place this work upon their shelves .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's '' Life in the Roman World of Nero and
St. Paul	LOCATION	'' is composed upon a different plan .

		Its purpose is to pre - sent a picture of the universal life of the period .

		It is not only avowedly popular , but really so .

		Its author makes most judicious selection of material , omitting all that is superfluous , and yet sets before his readers an abundance of in - formation .

		He refrains , in a manner quite heroic for a professor of the classics , from the use of Latin quotations and expressions ; he is chary even of proper names , and displays no slight degree of ingenuity in avoiding them . ''

		Broadway '' for
Via Lata	LOCATION	, '' backbone '' for spina , '' many-cornered '' for polygonal , '' an old grandfather , the forerunner of the modern pantaloon , '' '' a cunning sharper , '' '' a garrul - ous glutton with a fat face -LRB- known as Chops -RRB- '' and '' an amorous Simple Simon '' for Pappus ,
Maccus	ORGANIZATION	,
Bucco	LOCATION	, and Dossennus of the
Atellana	LOCATION	, these are a few examples of the humane Pro- fessor 's dread of frightening the reader with technicalities and foreign phraseology , a dread which is to be regretted only so far as it seems responsible for the almost total absence of illus - trative passages from Latin literature even in translation .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's language is natural , straightforward , and easy , and is occasionally beautified by quiet literary ornament .

		His lucidity of style is equalled by the lucidity of his arrangement ; the first eight chapters , on the Empire and its administration , the character of the Capital and its Emperor , etc. , introduce the main body of the book .

		Nine chapters which describe the house and the private life of its inhabitants , and the concluding six chapters , on the army , religion , study , philosophy , art , and burial , sum up certain of the larger phases of existence in an age which for fulness has rarely been paralleled .

		Sometimes , as in '' The Social Day of a Roman Aristocrat , '' the chap - ters are semi-narrative .

		Everywhere the author displays the natural teacher 's bent by so paral - leling ancient with present-day conditions as to make antiquity rise before his audience in flesh and blood .

		A hundred and twenty-five illus - trations , including maps and plans , contribute to the usefulness of the work , though their elegance is not always worthy of the text .

		In spite of the popular nature of Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's book , it never lacks thorough dignity , and is throughout a work of sound scholarship .

		The student of Roman literature and history will find its sane and sensible presentations at the same time entertaining and helpful .

		One of the impressions carried away from the reading of these two books is that of the ex - ceeding modernness of antiquity .

		We seem to stand on familiar ground especially in Professor
Davis	PERSON	's account of the crimes and follies of the ambitious rich .

		We are told of the anti-treat law of A.D. 67 , of a block system of controlling votes , of the centralization of wealth , of union labor and strikes , of pall-bearers who stood for the '' closed shop '' in their business , and of '' graft '' in a thousand forms .

		A big estate supports 4117 slaves , 3600 yoke of oxen , and 257,000 other animals , and has funds amount - ing to
$ 3,000,000	MONEY	.

		Hadrian says of the
Alex	PERSON	- andrians that '' their only god is money '' ; and we are assured that
Caesar	PERSON	would have sub - scribed to
Walpole	LOCATION	's alleged assertion that '' all men have their price . ''

		Altogether , Professor
Davis	PERSON	's book might almost be entitled '' Muck - raking in Roman Antiquity . ''

		Despite his care to paint in the lights as well as the shadows , the nature of his subject leads him inevitably to present facts of such character as to strengthen belief in the adage that the love of money is the root of all evil .

		It leaves us no happier .

		Let the newspapers and the muckraking magazines and book publishers look to it : in spite of the purification they are working , too much setting forth of one kind of truth is making us a nation of pessimists .

		We are put in mind by it all of the ancient historian who says that the time has come `` when we can endure neither our vices nor their remedies . ''

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's book , by reason of the universal sweep of his subject , leaves vis with a truer and more encouraging picture of Roman society .

		It should be read for the sake of a background and corrective for special works like Professor
Davis	PERSON	's , whose fault of producing distorted impressions is inherent rather than due to the author .

IRELAND	LOCATION	.


Erin	PERSON	's Story in
Music and Verse	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Redfern Mason	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Wessels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 Indeed , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	calls his book alternately a History of Irish Songs or a History of the Irish People .

		We shall , however , deal here in the main with the music ^ and only second - arily with the people .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	, although not a native son of
Erin	PERSON	, is an ardent partisan , and his narrative glows with a sympathy to which the reader readily responds , and burns with an indignation that kindles the corre - sponding emotion as it is intended to do .

		The unfortunate country of which he treats has sent forth a series of songs which represent her every mood and display her every characteristic her light-hearted gaiety , her love of family and kindred , her religious enthusiasms , her hatred of wrong , her devotion to the abused and long-suffering fatherland .


Ireland	LOCATION	has always been the lyrist among nations .

		Her principal instrument has been the harp , and from time immemorial she has poured forth her full heart in song .

		The record goes back to a period long before the Christian era , and the claims which are made for her priority in many forms of musical invention and construction are curious and edifying .

		Unhappily , however , the power of musical de - velopment and the vigor of continuous and sys - tematic production do not seem to have been hers .

		Richey , in his '' Short History of the Irish People , '' makes the following statement : '' As to Celtic music , the separate airs handed down from remote antiquity are unequalled in variety , tenderness , and expression ; but Irish music has never risen beyond an air ; operas , oratorios and concerted pieces have been pro- duced by people of inferior sympathies but greater industry . ''

		That is to say , Irish music is of the naive and primitive type ; it has never entered upon the phase of elaborate exploitation of its resources , nor upon the yet higher stage of full expression of man 's conscious and deeper experiences .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	says , perhaps with pardonable enthusiasm : '' Irish song is the expression of Celtic genius in music and verse , in every-day life and history ...
Gerald Barry	PERSON	, the Welsh monk and historian , hater of the Irish though he was , declares that
Erin	PERSON	's harpers surpass all others .

		That was in the twelfth century .


Ireland	LOCATION	's musical skill had won her fame long ages before that , however ; when the wife of Pepin of
France	LOCATION	wanted choristers for her new abbey of
Nivelle	LOCATION	, it was not to
Italy	LOCATION	, to
Germany	LOCATION	, or to
England	LOCATION	, that she sent , but to
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		That was in the seventh century .

		In
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan days the songs of
Ireland	LOCATION	won praise even from her enemy and traducer ,
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	.

		Shake - spearian enigmas , long insoluble , become plain in the light of the poet 's acquaintance with Celtic lore .

		Bacon of Vernlam declared that of all instruments the Irish harp had the sweetest note and the most prolonged .

		Irish airs found their way into the virginal books of
Tudor	LOCATION	and Jacobean days .

		Byrde and
Purcell	PERSON	wrote variations on Irish tunes .

		As in peace , so it was in war .

		England 's battles have been fought and won to Irish music .

		The
United States	LOCATION	won its freedom to the strains of < All the Way to
Galway	LOCATION	, ' known all over the world aS ` Yankee Doodle , ' and while the English marched out of
Yorktown	LOCATION	, the pipes squealed the tune of ' The World Turned Upside Down . '

		Beethoven ,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Berlioz	PERSON	all confess the beauty of Irish melody . ''

		The structure of these songs is , of necessity , simple , as is the case with the folk-song every - where .

		They are a combination of words and music which came together into the world at one birth .

		They are written in primitive keys , which signify their far-off origin .

		They have been handed down from father to son , from mother to daughter ; and they have that variety of versions which such a descent brings with it perforce .

		These songs have no known authors ; they belong to the whole people , and the tribe , or district , or kingdom , or even nation , is their creator .

		This is true of the old and original Gaelic songs ; when the Anglicization of
Ireland	LOCATION	began and progressed to its inevitable conclu - sion , the individual composer appeared and made songs for the men and women about him ; but then the individual composer was possessed of the national feeling and predisposition , and he followed the model of the ancient and per - vasive popular song .

		A primitive classification of these songs , as found in an old Gaelic battle-story , divides them into the Soontree , or sleepy music , lullabies , which Mr.
Mason	PERSON	declares to be the most beauti - ful in the world ; the Goltree , or the music of sad - ness , including the keens and laments ; the Gauntee , or mirthful music , jigs and reels which were danced under the trees or in the halls of the chiefs and castellans .

		This does not exhaust the characterization of Irish music .

		There are hymns belonging to both religions , Pagan and .

		Christian ; battle - odes , songs accompanying the daily work , agricultural and other ; mystical songs full of the fairy lore which fills the island from sea to sea .

		The musician of
Ireland	LOCATION	was not necessarily the poet ; the bard and the minstrel fulfilled '' distinct functions .

		The former occupied an important place in the household of the chief or king in the tribal and communistic organization which persisted to so late a period in
Ireland	LOCATION	; he was part of the reigning pageantry , he was the chronicler of the dynasty 's great achieve - ments , he was a counsellor , he received an 124 -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, elaborate education .

		The music usually came from another hand , although the bard often was musician as well .

		The bards and minstrels continued in
Ireland	LOCATION	down into the eighteenth century , and the songs of one of the last of them ,
Carolan	PERSON	, received the commendation of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Irish bard , however , in the main took only short flights of song ; he was capable of the lyric ecstasy , but he had not the construc - tive ability nor the power of consecutive labor which bring forth the epic .

		The three great cycles of Irish adventure and achievement the triumph of the mythological
Tuatha de Danann	ORGANIZATION	over the Fomorians , the heroic tales of
Deirdre	PERSON	and of
Queen Meve of Connaught	ORGANIZATION	, the Red Branch Series , and the more simple and human narratives of
Finn MacCool	ORGANIZATION	and his son Ossian , come down to us in prose versions like the sagas of
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		Some Irish poet is yet to appear and do for these separate legends what
Tennyson	PERSON	did for the Arthurian cycle ; he will weave them into the national epic of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The number of the songs now to be found in collections , which have been made with great care , is very large .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	gives in his book about forty ; and this is only a small fraction of extant and authenticated pieces .

		Among them are specimens of the various compositions which have always solicited the Irish muse . ''

		The Last Rose of Summer '' appears in its original form , somewhat sophisticated by
Moore	PERSON	, and not to its advantage .

		The famous '' Coulin '' occurs first in its prime simplicity , then as sung in another part of the country , and then as embroidered by the harpers ambitious for instrumental effects .

		We find a Plough Song , a
Smith Song	ORGANIZATION	, a Spinning Song , several jigs , reels , laments , the Cry of the Banshee , '' The White Cockade , '' '' All the Way to
Galway	LOCATION	, '' and a stirring march .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	carries his history through the Gaelic period , the Danish and
Norman	PERSON	invasions , the Tudor tyranny , the
Cromwell	PERSON	persecution , the Jacobite illusion , and into the morning redness of to-day .

		In spite of everything , the Irishman has main - tained himself , has always expressed himself in lyric outbursts of joy or indignation , and has never abandoned the hope which has been always on the eve of success and fulfilment .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	inspires his critic with a measure of his unquenchable ardor .

		Mr.
Grattan Flood	PERSON	, in his exhaustive '' His - tory of Irish Music , '' quotes the following state - ment from Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	: `` Irish Folk Music is probably the most human , most varied , most poetical in the world , and is particularly rich in tunes which imply considerable sym - pathetic sensitiveness . ''

		Mr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	, in his '' Early Gaelic Literature , '' makes a strong plea for the study of the bardic writings and the accompanying music , on account of its antiquity and its representation of primitive social conditions ; and we have all heard what
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	had to say on the same subject .

		Through the labors of O'Curry and
Petrie	PERSON	, and a later band of scholars , the light of scientific research has been cast upon the dark places and the story has been successfully unfolded .

		Throughout Gaelic times ,
Ireland	LOCATION	, in spite of fearfully untoward conditions , continued pro- ductive in literature and music ; when English superseded the ancient tongue , she illustrated her vicissitudes with history and poetry and oratory and song , and at the present hour she has a band of patriots who are also writers , and who have given her what she has hitherto lacked a real dramatic literature .

		The melo - dies of
Moore	PERSON	were a notable achievement ; the old songs were again presented to the world , and furnished with new words which in most cases married the fitting verse to the expectant song ; and the later poets and musicians have added to the credit and honor of the country .

		The book of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	deserves only praise ; he has done very well a work by no means easy .

		He has the gift of clear and picturesque nar - rative ; he is a musician of learning and under - standing ; he knows his subject , and has pre - sented it in attractive guise ; he has not been the antiquarian only , but everywhere has brought the human interest into the foreground : if he is evidently a partisan , he can perhaps be for - given when one follows the events as he discloses them .

		The book is a credit to the publishers , and it should certainly be attractive to the gen - eral reader as well as to the lover of music .

		THE DIAL 125 THE LATEST STUDY or MOLIERE ix ENGLISH .

		* In a prefatory note , the author of the latest of the encouraging number of recent Moliere studies in English , f sets forth his plan and his point of view .

		He purposes to present , first , '' the facts of MoliSre 's life , stripped of all the legends which compass it about ; second , to trace his development as a dramatist , making it plain how cautiously he advanced in his art and how slowly he reached the full expansion of his power ; and third , to show his intimate relation to the time in which he lived , the glit - tering beginning of the reign of Louis XIV . ''

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	calls his book a biography , and has '' endeavored always to centre attention on Moliere himself . ''

		Of the three avenues by which Professor
Matthews	PERSON	has approached his subject , he has evidently been attracted most by the middle one , i.e. ,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's development as a dramatist .

		In discussing this development he has wisely kept the plays in their chronological order , thereby avoiding confusion and impressing the reader with the continuity and the homogeneity of the great Frenchman 's growth as a dramatic power .

		Indeed , this part of the plan has been so well conceived and so cleverly executed , especially as regards the lighter plays and the bearing of the unusually intelligent theatre - going Parisian public upon the length and breadth of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's career as a playwright , that one may reasonably be inclined to regret that the author has not confined himself to the discussion of this development .

		But the book is intended as a biography .

		It is not a history of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic career , but a biography of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	himself which the author has '' sought to establish solidly on the admitted facts , '' using no '' legends '' and refraining from borrowing hints or drawing inferences from such pam - phlets as '' Elomire Hypocondre '' and '' La Fameuse Comedienne . ''

		The intention clearly has been dictated by scholarly integrity .

		It is not , however , a critic 's province to dis - cuss an author 's intentions ; rather is it his * MOLIERE .

		function to discover how thoroughly they have been carried out , and to state his findings as impartially as may be .

		It seems to me , in the first place , that Professor
Matthews	PERSON	has scarcely distinguished between biography and history .


Montesquieu	LOCATION	's distinction is still valid .

		He said that biography studies the peculiarities of individual character , and history the general aspects of the society in which these peculiar - ities appeared .

		The general aspects of French society contemporaneous with the great humor - ist are placed before us with fine integrity ; the author 's characterization of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		as mon - arch and as man is done in masterly manner , although the courtly background of the lighter plays is scarcely more than sketched in ; but what of Moliere the man ?

		Do we not miss that coloring , that vivifying power which is so essen - tial in the process of presenting the subject of a biography as a living human being ?

		The modern view of history is hostile to the anecdote , but biography can not well get along without it .

		What if it be not true that the king invited the actor to sit at meat with him ?

		what if it be not proved that
Bellocq	PERSON	the poet offered to help him make the king 's bed ?

		These '' legends '' are truer than many a fact may be , because they are generic and stand for a long series of facts which it would be futile to es - tablish , and of which the significance is that
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, being an actor , was a social outcast with whom courtiers would not associate .

		This fact being either established or corroborated by these legends , it follows that Moliere must often have been deeply offended , and , being human , must sometimes have reacted , especially when opportunity offered during the building of a comedy .

		But it is exactly this biographical point of view that Professor
Matthews	PERSON	eschews .

		He separates the man from the playwright , on the ground that the construction of plays is the most objective of the arts .

		He neglects the man , he does not make him live before us in his characteristics ; the man merely estab - lishes the Illustre Theatre , fails , goes to the country , comes back to
Paris	LOCATION	, and dies on schedule time .

		But the playwright we see at i work very clearly ; and if the scope of the book had been limited to that of a history of
Molidre	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic career , it would have found an empty niche waiting for it .

		Molidre created the era of modern comedy .

		Was a new era ever created objectively , in cold blood ?

		Is not
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's deep melancholy alter - j nating with rollicking fun proof enough of his i abiding subjectivity ?

		Your objective man or 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, woman is wont to have a cheerful or grave , but an equable temper , and creates no new eras .

		I venture to doubt whether an equable temper was ever humoristic also : the millennium is not yet .

		If Professor
Matthews	PERSON	had stooped to the legend of the Due de la Feuillade who rubbed
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's nose against the buttons of his coat till it bled , or to the legend of his quarrels with
Armande Bejart	PERSON	, the reader would not have received an altogether incorrect im - pression of the dynamics of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's sensitive - ness .

		Brunetire points out how the ascendency of women in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, which is at the root of its contrast with the sixteenth , hampered
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's growth and accounts for his not being greater than he is .

		Considering his penetrating genius and the excellent educa - tion he had had , he must have known that this ascendency was a fact .

		Besides , he was a naturalist , i.e. , he insisted on seeing things as they are .

		But society in his day insisted on warping nature into artificiality and con - vention , with their corollaries of `` humbug and pretense . ''

		As Professor
Matthews	PERSON	points out , MolieYe hated these .

		Would mere academic dis - like , or the requirements of the ticket-office , or a laudable desire to write a good play , nerve a human being to such attacks upon women as we find `` Les Precieuses Kidicules '' and the '' Femmes Savantes '' to be ?

		or to such an attack upon woman-dominated society as is '' Le Misanthrope '' ?

		No ; indignation , hate , underlie these .

		Is hate not a very subjective passion , and is it not always caused by personal incidents and conditions which the hater finds unbearable ?

		The `` legends '' tell what these incidents were or might be .

		Molidre reacted , fought back ; it is not possible that a man of his high seriousness had that lukewarm pleasant thing , '' a message , '' which the author twice asserts he had .

		It had not yet been invented .

		Again ,
Molire	PERSON	lived at a time when the clergy were an all-pervading power , which as far as he and those he loved were concerned was exerted to keep him and them in a position of ignominious contempt , and who , unless he ab - jured his great life , would even make his death an occasion for insult .

		And yet is there only objective criticism in `` Tartuffe '' ?

		Moliere had a grumpy , grasping father , and he himself delighted in generous expenditure for his wife and his friends .

		And yet is it mere coincidence that his comedy fathers are all grumpy and grasping towards their children ?

		Moliere lost his mother in boyhood , there are practically no mothers in his comedies ; and what a carica - ture
Madame Pernelle	ORGANIZATION	is !

		yet was this owing to the fact that there was no '' old woman '' in his company ?

		Indeed , I make bold to surmise that in suppressing the '' legends '' and in basing his biography only on '' the admitted facts , '' Professor
Matthews	PERSON	has merely invented a new method of expressing Ms opinion .

		The sort of reader to whom this biography is addressed can not fail to discover that Professor
Matthews	PERSON	has not always succeeded in keeping his foothold firmly on the admitted facts .

		A quotation will illustrate the author 's procedure in this matter .

		He says , page 49 : '' These were the ... performers Moliere in his boyhood had seen in the open street , at the fair of Saint -
Germain	PERSON	, and perhaps also in the playhouse itself -LRB- if it was a fact that he was taken to the theatre by his grandfather -RRB- . ''

		On page 27 we are told that `` it is likely that she
Madeleine Bejart	PERSON	had hoped to become a countess , '' and on page 179 that `` it is possible that this with - drawal of '
Don Juan	PERSON	' was made a condition for the ultimate approval of ' Tartuffe . ' ''

		These and many other similar facts are not yet admitted , as the author duly indicates ; but that they have been used shows how difficult it is to carry out the programme he lays down in the preface .

		More serious is a slip like that on page 22 , where the author states that the Illustre Theatre was housed in a tennis court '' owned by a man named
Metayer	PERSON	. ''

		But this court was the Mestayers ' -LRB- joint or share - renters ' -RRB- court .

		There was , of course , no man named
Metayer	PERSON	.

		The business was transacted by
Noel Gallois	PERSON	, the tennis master , * who signed the lease , the rent being
1900	DATE	livres a year .

		On page 83 the author makes
Louis Bejart	PERSON	die just after the first performance of the Etourdi , which on page 33 he puts at
1653	DATE	, although
Grimarest	ORGANIZATION	's date has been discarded by

		THE DIAL 127 '' to show off . ''

		On page 97 , poor Moliere is made to '' work against time , '' and to be '' ready to the minute . ''

		It is a question whether or no
Madame de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	was herself only '' half an Italian , '' or whether '' the immediate appeal of the playwright is to the eyes of the spectators and to the ears of the auditors in the playhouse itself . ''

		It is agreed that
Moliere	PERSON	was a realist ; but why he should as such not brood over the darker aspects of humanity , which the conjunc - tion `` however much '' -LRB- page 91 -RRB- would seem to deny him the right to do , the author does not ex - plain .

		At the end of the book no one except acol - lege student would have a legitimate excuse for not knowing that
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	had been nourished on Rabelais and Montaigne , that he had a hearty detestation for humbug of all sorts , that he was a humorist , that he had had thorough instruc - tion in philosophy , or that in the Italian plays the acting occurred in the neutral ground be - tween the houses .

		These repetitions , and a little padding here and there , might easily have been avoided .

		`` When all is said and done , there remains the very praisworthy effort of which this book is a token .

		That professors of modern literatures should begin more and more to join urbanity with scholarship , and even to address the general reader now and then , is a hopeful sign , hope - ful also for American scholarship itself .

		Pro- fessor
Matthews	PERSON	is a modern pioneer in this respect , and on that ground alone deserves the most cordial recognition , the more so because he has had the courage to do this at a time when philological erudition of an almost physical type has been the surest road to a reputation for soundness .

		At first he is conscious of the guilt of idleness , and feels that he must be off and busy ; but he restrains * QUTKT DAYS IK

Cordova	LOCATION	he thus communes aloud : '' Shall I not dare to lie at ease upon the grass , to be warmed by the sun , to smell the odours of clean earth and pungent weed ; may I not read my history here , and for a time rest unconcerned ?

		What need I to care about news and the business of the world ?

		Here is enough , for I can dream , and ponder over the past . ''

		In order to gain a knowledge of conditions of life and the nature of certain rural industries , Mr.
Luffmann	PERSON	spends the winter upon a vine - yard of thirteen hundred acres situated in the highland between
Malaga	LOCATION	and
Granada	LOCATION	, while he passes the
summer	DATE	in what remains of an old Bernardine monastery on the Vega of
Malaga	LOCATION	.

		In these out-of-the-way spots he gathers much curious information about domestic - customs , which he gives us in a discursive and gossipy manner none the less agreeable when the dis - connected observations are apropos of nothing .

		Many of these sketches of Spanish life are vividly and accurately drawn .

		Together with all this , however , there is no lack of soulful passages .

		Mr.
Luffmann	PERSON	every - where seeks an impression .

		This he can not always secure , and in plain old
Santiago	LOCATION	he is obliged to confess : '' I can say no more than that I have seen
Santiago	LOCATION	, for I had no fine feel - ings there , and where one does not feel one does not live . ''

		He fares somewhat better elsewhere .

		At Covadonga , for example , he is impressed as follows : '' I leapt the torrents and drank from dripping stones and calm , arrested pools .

		I tired , I rested , gathered strength , and must needs go on .

		Hills were below and above me , and valleys near and far ... '' I fought with the bumble-bees for the honey within the throats of the large purple flowers of the wild nettle .

		I gathered nosegays and sniffed and chewed them as a child , and child-like threw them away .

		Where the ground was sure , I chased little blue and brown butter - flies , but without reason , for taking me for a Franciscan they settled on my hands .

		I drank more and more water , for the air lightened with every step , and there came that longing we have in mountain heights to be washed and pure .

		I rolled up my sleeves and let my arms sink to their elbows in an icy pool held by the ooze on the mountain-side .

		Then I lay on a mossy slab and felt it would be better if I lay beneath , in the con - viction that there I should be undisturbed forever .

		But freshening , a supple ash-plant waved in my face , and all the hard years slipped away .

		I made me a whistle with a high plaintive note like that of a wounded bird ; so I took a thicker piece with a lip which almost filled my mouth ; this had a full , challenging sort of sound and stimulated me to a quick march up the mountain .

		I climbed , I blew , and I laughed at my childishness and pride in small things .

		Then I came into the pres - ence of the great , for I arrived at the summit of what proved to be the highest peak for miles around .

		It was no great height , four thousand feet or so ; but all in sight of it was mine !

		Far below lay wonderful valleys , castles , trees , and fields , and the shrine of Covadonga ; around me swept buoyant and sustaining air , which said to my soul , Rejoice , thou art free ! '

		So I sat me down on this crown of the world ; and , looking round to see nothing I feared , there , with the rude pipe of my making , I blew out the song of my heart ! ''

		We appreciate Mr.
Luffmann	PERSON	's exaltation , and are glad to know that he was happy ; but we are sorry that he could not see the indelicacy of printing such intimate heart-throbbings in a book and selling them for money .

		Reduced one-half , the work would be increased in value .


GEORGE G. BROWNELL	PERSON	.

		VEGETARIAN BIOLOGY .

		* It is a pleasant duty devolving upon the writer to record in these columns from time to time the passing of a biological '' paradoxer , '' one who thinks on a different plane from the rest of mankind , and as a result of this intel - lectual isolation and independence is able to solve the deepest problems of nature and life with a deftness and circumstance that can but compel the admiration of ordinary mortals .

		Each of these '' paradoxing '' individuals has his own particular brand of metaphysical eye - water , which when properly applied enables us to see not only how stupid we have previously been , but also how really simple an affair the universe is if only one 's vision has the pre - scribed angle and acuteness .

		A worthy successor to the spiral philosopher and the vociferously immoral Italian who felt it his duty to point the way to the '' unenlightables '' is to be found in Mr.
Hermann Reinheimer	PERSON	, the author of a book entitled '' Survival and Reproduction . ''

		With the customary caution of its kind , the book starts off in a perfectly orthodox , if some - what obscure , fashion .

		For quite thirty pages the reader is led along through the mazes of a metaphysical discussion of evolution , with nothing in particular to excite his interest or arouse his suspicions , unless the very prosiness and orthodoxy of it has that effect .

		Then , no longer to be restrained , the cat pops suddenly out of the bag , in this wise : '' It also follows that animals , instead of wasting time and energy in fighting and depredation , or in the search for ' hosts ' for parasitic indulgences , might by furthering the interests of a bountiful vegeta - * SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION .

		tion almost indefinitely multiply their means of sustenance while at the same time justifying and ennobling their existence . ''

		This brilliant and profound thought strikes the keynote of the book .

		The author , like all good paradoxers , takes himself and his vegetarian philosophy most seriously , but this is a difficult thing for anyone else to accomplish .

		Try as one will to be properly respectful and serious about so weighty a matter , there creeps into his mind the notion of a large and hungry lion '' justify - ing and ennobling his existence '' by cultivat - ing , with the immortal Sairey , a taste for '' cowcumbers . ''

		In Part II .

		of the book the author relates his peculiar ideas respecting nutrition to the different modes of reproduction observed in the organic world .

		The general upshot of the discussion is that : '' Throughout we found it confirmed that the occurrence of antithetic developments is due to dysteleological function , i.e. , physiological transgression . ''

		This may not be a particularly illuminating conclusion as it stands , but interpreted it is to be understood to mean that one should be a vegetarian .

		A really enormous mass of facts and speculations culled from recent and classical biological lit - erature is by truly Procrustean methods worked into the book .

		The breadth of the author 's reading , and the zeal and diligence which have gone into the preparation of the volume are remarkable , and would , in a better cause , be worthy of all praise .

		But after all the marshal - ling of the heavy artillery of technical scientific data and hypotheses is over , the case reminds one of
Eugene Field	PERSON	's `` Militiaman '' : '' He revels in scenes of blood and gore , Where the terrible bomb is hurled ; He slaughters the foe and calls for more , And he wears his mustache curled . ''

		THE DIAL 129 BRIEFS ON XEW BOOKS .

		A near view of A two-volume work , extending to a great inventor nearly a thousand pages , has been at hi * work .

		prepared by Mr.
Frank Lewis Dyer	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas Commerford Martin	PERSON	on ''
Edison	PERSON	, his Life and Inventions '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	is connected as general counsel with the
Edison	ORGANIZATION	Lab - oratory , and Mr.
Martin	PERSON	was at one time president of the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Well qualified for the task which they undertook , they have been ably assisted in its execution by '' many loyal associates , '' as their preface explains , and have had the express sanction and the personal aid of the inventor himself and his wife .

		In fact , Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's Imprimatur is prefixed to the work , and it may safely be received as an authoritative , even though not , while its subject still lives , as the '' definitive '' or final biography which its authors say they have designed it to be .

		At any rate , it is much fuller and , especially to scientists , more satis - factory than Mr.
Francis Arthur Jones	PERSON	's similar work of three years ago .

		The history of the prin - cipal
Edison	ORGANIZATION	inventions is set forth with a thorough understanding of technicalities , but in language not beyond the ordinary reader 's comprehension .

		Naturally it is the inventor rather than the man that is the chief object of the writers ' study and portrayal , though the touch of human nature is by no means wanting to their pages .

		One notable chapter , the last one in the book , is devoted to '' The Social Side of
Edison	ORGANIZATION	, '' and characteristic actions and utterances of his thickly sprinkle all the preceding chapters .

		What he has to say on the educational need of the hour is worth quoting , in part , as rather amusingly characteristic . ''

		What we need , '' he declares , '' are men capable of doing work .

		I would n't give a penny for the ordinary college graduate , except those from the institutes of technology .

		Those coming up from the ranks are a darned sight better than the others .

		They are n't filled up with Latin philosophy , and the rest of that ninny stuff .

		... In three or four centuries , when the country is settled , and commercialism is dimin - ished , there will be time for the literary men .

		At present we want engineers , industrial men , good business-like managers , and railroad men . ''

		An appendix contains , among other interesting details , a good description , with drawings , of the new
Edison	ORGANIZATION	storage battery ; also a 28-page list of domestic patents taken out by the inventor , and a summary enumeration of his
1239	DATE	foreign patents .

		A full index concludes the work , and numerous illustrations , including portraits of Mr.
Edison	PERSON	iu a variety of attitudes -LRB- not poses -RRB- , are scattered through the volumes .

		Those who dislike '' Latin philosophy and the rest of that ninny stuff '' will heartily enjoy this faithful account of one who , though not a Latin philosopher , is something of an American philosopher , in his way , as well as a marvellously gifted inventor .

J. A. T. Lloyd	PERSON	's Two Russian Toittov compared Reformers :
Ivan Turgenev	PERSON	,
Leo	PERSON	and contracted .

		Tolstoy '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- might just as well and perhaps better have been called '' Two Russian Romancers , '' since it is rather more a study of their literary art than of their aims and methods in the way of reform .

		But any faithful interpretation of the two men , especially of Turgenev .

		must present them first and foremost as great writers , winning a hearing through the consummate mastery of their art far more than by the substance of their doctrines .

		How greatly the artist predominated over the re - former in the older man shows itself in his dying message to his '' good and dear friend , '' with whom he was by temperament in perpetual discord , the recluse of
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	. ''

		I write to you before everything else , '' he says , `` to tell you how happy I have been to be your contemporary , and to ex - press to you my last and immediate prayer .

		My friend , return to literature !

		Reflect that this gift has come to you from the Source of all things . ''

		Contrasting the genius of the two authors , Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	points out , in apt phrase , that '' if Tnrgenev may be described as a gourmet of life ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	may be described as a gourmand .

		Turgenev communi - cates the aroma of a half-forgotten scene ;
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	lives it over again , reproducing the actual physical delight or pain that he had experienced in it . ''

		The book , divided into two unequal parts , discusses Tnrgenev in the first two-thirds of its 330 pages , and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	in the remaining third , following each author through a chronological survey of his works .

		From the title one might reasonably expect a rather more definite and detailed statement of the partic - ular reforms for which these two men stand , in the author 's opinion ; and he might perhaps instructively have shown a stronger causal connection between early excesses , especially in
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's case , and later disgusts and weariness and inclinations toward asceticism .

		It is , however , a carefully studied and richly suggestive piece of work that the author has given us , and like Mr.
Maude	PERSON	's notable biography of Tolstoy it has an especial and unforeseen timeli - ness .

		Portraits and Russian scenes fittingly illus - trate the book , which has also chronological outlines of the two men 's lives and lists of their principal works . ''

		The Japanese Empire and its on
Java	LOCATION	'' Economic Condition '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is a translation from the French of
M. Joseph D'Autremer	PERSON	, lecturer at the
School of Oriental Languages	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The vol - ume appears to have been intended to serve as a handbook of exact information about
Japan	LOCATION	its geography , topography , geology , race origins , gov - ernment , commerce , and art .

		Unfortunately the information given under these various heads is uneven in value ; the material in the several chap - ters is ill-arranged ; there are statements likely to mislead ; the author dogmatizes without giving evi - dence of profound investigation ; and the English 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, translation reflects discredit upon the publishers .

		As typical specimens of the author 's unsupported generalities the two following statements may be cited : `` But from 660 B.C. ... these different races have been replaced Iby numerous Malay peoples . ''

		`` In spite of this shadow of Parliamentarianism -LSB- sic -RSB- , it is clear that the political condition of
Japan	LOCATION	resembles in no respect what we call constitutional government . ''

		The chapters on art are an almost hopeless confusion of details ill-arranged and state - ments not carefully weighed .

		Useful sketches of the various art industries read like undigested material taken from note-books .

		Seven pages are devoted to lacquer ; whereas cloisonne * is dismissed in the fol - lowing two sentences : '' This latter never attained in
Japan	LOCATION	the solid quality of Chinese cloisonne * , though it had greater elegance .

		At the present day
Tokyo	LOCATION	and
Yokohama	LOCATION	manufacture a great quantity of cloisonne * for exportation -LSB- sic -RSB- but little of it can be kept without deterioration . ''

		In regard to the beautiful
Kutani	PERSON	and Satsuma wares the reader not otherwise instructed would carry away the im - pression that nothing is being done in these wares save to manufacture a great quantity of tawdry im - itations .

		No doubt it is true that Japanese ceramic art reached its zenith between
1750	DATE	and
1830	DATE	-LRB- see Chamberlain : '' Things Japanese '' -RRB- ; yet many ex - quisite pieces of
Satsuma	LOCATION	,
Kutani	PERSON	, and cloisonne ware are still made to-day .

		As to the English of the book , one can excuse and even relish a slightly foreign flavor in translation , but there is no excuse for bad paragraphing and slipshod or unintelligible sentences .

		We are told that of the 19,000 foreign - ers in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' 13,000 are Chinese and the others Asiatic . ''

		Of Kioto we are informed that `` for more than a thousand years it has been -LSB- instead of was ~ \ the residence of the Emperors . ''

		The follow - ing is an example of careless sentence-structure : '' A piece of boehmeria cloth is taken , which is cut according to the size of the article to be covered -LSB- with lacquer -RSB- , care being taken to apply it in such a way that there is no fold , and covered with shesime urushi , so that it may be glued and secured in that condition . ''

		The treatment of
Japan	LOCATION	's industries and finances , in the last one hundred pages of the book , shows the writer at his best ; the discussion is full , and appears to be based upon the latest and most trustworthy statistics , studied by one familiar with this phase of the general subject of his volume .

Handel	ORGANIZATION	, and conspicuous for success in the elaborate music of the Italian opera in the resplendent days of
Donizetti	ORGANIZATION	and
Rossini	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter illustrious master of the florid school was the close friend and adviser of the singer , as - sisted her in her early studies , and stood by her side at every turn in her career , when aid or en - couragement appeared desirable .

		She was a devotee of the Italian method and style ; she witnessed the struggles and triumphs of
Wagner	PERSON	's extraordinary career ; but to the last she held out against the fascination and significance of the rising music drama .

		Thus she says in a section of her volume dated

		THE DIAL 131

		In his position as magistrate , corresponding to a '' father-and-mother '' official of the Chinese administration , he has had exceptional opportunities to know the people entrusted to his charge , and on his experiences and studies he has based a very interesting and at the same time scholarly book .

		The people , their customs and observances , their laws and institutions , their re - ligions and superstitions , are described with such sympathy for the native point of view that the im - pression is left with the reader that the Chinese residents of
Weihaiwei	LOCATION	have been very happily favored in their magistrate .

		The author thus con - cludes his discussion of present conditions : '' It is difficult to say whether
China	LOCATION	stands at present in greater danger from her own over-enthusiastic re - volutionary reformers or from her well-meaning but somewhat ignorant foreign friends who are pressing her to accept Western civilization with all its poli - tical and social machinery and its entire religious and ethical equipment .

		If ever a State required skil - ful guidance and wise statesmanship ,
China	LOCATION	needs them now : but wise statesmanship will not consist in tearing up all the old moral and religious sanc - tions that have been rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people through all the ages of their wonder - ful history . ''

George Wharton James	PERSON	's account of the '' Heroes of

		The author has selected for treatment some forty names famous in the annals of Californian exploration , settlement , and development , trap - pers , explorers , soldiers , pony-express riders , rail - road builders , inventors , scientists , judges , writers .

		Many of these names are of national or international repute :

		Heroism is justly interpreted by the author with latitude to include not only deeds of daring in times of danger , or amid the fastnesses of mountain and desert ; but likewise the achievements in other fields of endeavor , re - ligious , economic , industrial , scientific , and civic .

		He might well have included some mention of the seer who dreamed and wrought out during years of effort the foundations of higher education in
California	LOCATION	upon which its great
State University	ORGANIZATION	has been built ,
Samuel W. Wiley	PERSON	.

		And it is strange that a book on this subject should omit the name of
John C. Fremont	ORGANIZATION	.

		A considerable number of well-selected illustrations adorn this entertaining volume .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	and In the perpetual running fight about the Homeric Homer , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has been controversy - f or 8O me years a most prominent champion .

		In his latest return to the fray , `` The World of Homer '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , he lays about him in a very joyous and triumphant mood .

		His foemen are all those who hold , in some form or other , that `` the Iliad is a mosaic produced by a long series of Ionian additions to an Achaean ' kernel . ' ''

		Against them he maintains that the Iliad is , in the main , the work of a single poet , as is shown by the unity of thought , temper , character and ethos '' ; that it is '' a work of one brief period , because it bears all the notes of one age , and is absolutely free from the most marked traits of religion , rites , society , and superstition that characterise the preceding ^ Egean .

		and the later ' Dipylon , ' Ionian , Archaic , and his - toric periods in Greek life and art . ''

		Homer is an Achaean poet , composing for Achaean auditors at a time when `` the glow of ^ gean -LRB- late Minoan , Mycenean -RRB- culture still flushed the sky . ''

		In support of his contention he writes nearly three hundred pages under such captions as '' The Homeric World in War , '' '' Homer and Ionia '' '' Bronze and Iron , '' '' Burial and the Future Life , '' and '' The Great Discrepancies . ''

		It goes without saying that the lit - erary touch is light and the argumentation serious .

		The present reviewer has long been in accord with Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's principal views , while differing from him about many details ; but from friend and foe alike the book deserves attention .

		At the same time it is not to be recommended to any reader who takes little real interest in the protracted controver - sies about the Homeric poem .

		The volume is well illustrated , well printed , and substantially bound .

		Herndon '' -LRB- The Torch Press -RRB- with caution , and something of suspicion , as probably an unnecessary book in an over - worked field ; but before long it takes hold of the reader , and he is glad to read it to the end .

		It is based on a series of letters written by Mr.

Theodore Parker	PERSON	, whom
Herndon	ORGANIZATION	worshipped as his own inspirer in religion and his ideal of an orator and a teacher .

		These letters are very vivid , and describe political conditions in

		Mr.

		The work gives us the personality of Lincoln more clearly than most of the formal biographers are able to give it .

		Interesting also is the acquaintance that we get with
Herndon	PERSON	, as in seeing Lincoln through his eyes we come to know
Herndon	PERSON	himself ; and in spite of the slighting judgments of the biographers , we find him a man well worth knowing , and worthy to be the partner and intimate friend of

		The book is excellent in its mechanical form , as well as attractive in its contents .

		A freakish fancy is given a free Amusing foolery .

		- * o i _ i > in small rein in Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	s fragments .

		`` Literary Lapses '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a col - lection of half a hundred amusing trifles , evidently written with rapid pen and well adapted to even more rapid reading .

		A few of the titles of these mirthful sketches will indicate the nature of them all , '' How to Live to be 200 , '' '' How to Avoid Getting Married , '' '' Men Who have Shaved Me , '' '' Hints to Travellers , '' '' Society Chit-Chat , '' '' On Collecting Things , '' `` Borrowing a Match , '' `` A Lesson in Fiction . ''

		Here is the author 's sage advice to those tormented with fears of disease - germs and noxious bacilli : `` If you see a bacilli , walk right up to it , and look it in the eye .

		If one flies into your room , strike at it with your hat or with a towel .

		Hit it as hard as you can between the neck and the thorax .

		It will soon get sick of that . ''

		One of the writer 's most daring strokes is the creation of a
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	in the person of a Chinese laundry-man , who minutely describes the character and traces the history of a customer from an inspection of his weekly linen but proves in the end to be totally and ludicrously in error in his deductions .

		The book is full of smiles to those who approach it in a suitable frame of mind and not with too severe a determination to preserve their centre of gravity .

George Bruce Halsted	PERSON	, writing on the ' Foundation and
Technic of Arithmetic	ORGANIZATION	, ' pre - sents briefly the wonderful story of the cipher .

		Men struggled through centuries of intelligence with cumbersome number notation .

		At first five men in a row to count 10,000 : ten fingers raised by the first , one by the second ; ten raised again by the first , and two by the second ; ten raised by the second , then one by the third , and thus to one finger of the fifth man , equaling 10,000 .

		`` Then the abacus with pebbles to represent the fingers and a row of grooves for the row of men .

		Centuries of intellect using the decimal system , but struggling with it because unable to comprehend the possibility of the cipher to indicate position in the row of men or in the grooves of the abacus ; centuries of struggling with other symbols , adopting Hindoo numerals , but failing to find a character which would indicate ' nothing ' to indicate that a position was empty . '

		A Hindoo genius ' created zero .

		Hindoo numerals have been traced back to the early part of the third century B.C. '' ' But , ' writes Mr.
Halsted	PERSON	' a whole millennium was yet to pass before the creation of the most useful symbol in the world , the naught , the zero , a sign for nothing , a mark for the absence of quantity , the cipher whose first known use in a document is in 738
A.D.	LOCATION	.

		This little ellipse , picture for airy nothing , is an indispensable cornerstone of modern civiliza - tion .

		It is an Ariel lending magic powers of com - putation , promoting our kindergarten babies at once to an equality with
Caesar	PERSON	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, or
Paul	PERSON	in matters arithmetical .

		This giving to airy nothing not merely a local habitation and a name , but a picture , a symbol , is characteristic of the
Hindoo	PERSON	race whence it sprang .

		It is like coining Nirvana into dynamos . ' ''

		The Arabs , taking the symbol , called it cifr ' empty . ' ''

		171 STAGE CHILDREN .

		A great deal of mischief is done in the world by well-intentioned people who strike blindly at the abuses that excite them to indignation .

		They nearly always let the heart get the better of the head , and in their eagerness to do away with a particular evil , pay small heed to the collateral effects of the remedies which they seek to apply .

		Even roast pig may come too high when it costs the destruction of a house , and the wrong done by zealous reformers in other directions than that in which their own goal is set often outweighs the good they ac - complish .

		It is a pretty serious thing to invade the domain of personal liberty in the cause of any reform , and the reasons for so doing must be overwhelming to justify the reformer 's aim .

		It is easier to use '' blanket '' measures and '' dragnet '' precautions than it is to study an evil closely and devise the exact cure it needs , but it always means undeserved and wanton injury to some of the persons affected .

		A good illustration of what we are saying may be found in the laws made by certain states for the purpose of keeping children off the stage .

		Now we hold that child labor is one of the greatest of present-day social evils , and we do not believe that the rights of parents are unduly invaded when they are required to keep their children at school .

		It is a clear case of organized society intervening to protect the rights of the young against the denial of those rights by their unscrupulous elders .

		Laws regulating child labor , by which we mean prohibiting it in many cases , are in our opinion wise laws and in no need of defence .

		But when it comes to a law forbidding children to take part in theatrical performances , a law so drastic as to make it practically impossible for a child , no matter how carefully its interests may be safeguarded , to appear upon the stage at all , we think that there is something to be said upon the other side .

		Certainly a strong case for the opposition is made in '' The Stage Chil - dren of
America	LOCATION	, '' a pamphlet which comes from the
National Alliance	ORGANIZATION	for the
Protection of Stage Children	ORGANIZATION	.

		The members of this organi - zation are men and women of the highest char - acter , many of whom have no connection with the stage , and no one could fairly charge them 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, with other than disinterested motives , in making their protest against such prohibitive laws as have just been mentioned .

		If the sponsors for this document have any bias , it is on the side of the children rather than of the theatre .

		The substance of their argument is that stage children have a truly enviable lot in comparison with children employed in most other places , and the substance of their plea is that a rational law would regulate the conditions under which the child actor should work , but would not prohibit all such work by one sweeping enact - ment .

		The statute now in force in
New York	LOCATION	is recommended as a model , and is urged for adoption in all the other states .

		It prohibits absolutely the employment of any child under sixteen as an acrobat or gymnast , in any im - moral exhibition , and in any practice dangerous or injurious `` to the life , limb , health , or morals of the child . ''

		It also prohibits the appearance of children as singers , dancers , performers upon musical instruments , or actors in theatri - cal exhibitions , but qualifies this prohibition by permitting them to be thus employed if the consent of the local authorities be obtained , and no objection be made by the local organization devoted to the welfare of children .

		A law framed upon these lines would seem to provide every reasonable safeguard , and would clearly be more rational than a law which places trapeze tricks and Shakespearean fairies under the same ban .

		As the pamphlet now under consideration says , '' child labor legislation should not only be directed toward protecting but also toward better equipping the child , and no legislation can serve either truly to protect or benefit a child , where such legislation denies to it any opportunity to develop its talents , or where the child is forbidden education or training in any art for which it displays special aptitude , or , as is often the case , actual genius . ''

		The stage is , after all , a profession , and one of those that contribute most to civilization .

		Not many are fit to enter it , but those who are endowed by nature with the necessary qualifications must be discovered at an early age , and their special education begun .

		The testimony offered upon this point is convincing .

		Nearly all the men and women who have won distinction as actors have begun their training in their tender years , and are agreed in claiming that this has been an essential factor in their success .


John Drew	PERSON	says : '' My own mother was a child actress and commended me to the stage , and I in turn have commended my daughter to it .

		I am convinced now that it is of absolute importance to the child genius that it should have every oppor - tunity in its pre-self-conscious period to learn the art of the stage . ''

		And Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	-
Robertson	PERSON	, speaking of the effort to keep chil - dren off the stage , says that '' later the oppor - tunity may never come to the child , and it is robbing the drama of a possible genius , with the hope of making an excellent mechanic . ''

		On the other hand , Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	has recently made the following confession : '' Every day of my life I feel the lack of very early stage training .

		It would have been invaluable to me , for I was a peculiarly timid , self-conscious boy , and that training would have spared me then and advanced me now . ''

		Such testimony as this , which might easily be multiplied indefinitely , is worth more than any amount of doctrinaire abstract argument .

		When we think , moreover , of the normal conditions of child labor in almost all other occupations , even when the law exercises its humane control , and contrast them with the conditions under which the child of the stage does his work , we see that the theatre is about the last workshop in the world to provide ob - jects for our pity .

		In this light , the special efforts put forth to protect these children sug - gest the sort of benevolence that establishes homes for cats and dogs while suffering hu - manity is left to fend for itself .

		The stage child , as compared with the factory child , has comparatively little work to do , and even that is of a distinctly educational character .

		The stage child may have late hours -LRB- which is , we admit , a serious consideration -RRB- , but on the other hand , the closest attention is paid to its comfort in the matters of food , clothing , and bodily care .

		It is usually under the direct supervision of parents or relatives , and is given education of the ordinary school sort in addition to the special education that is provided by its professional task .

		We are by no means to be taken as advocating the stage life for children , but we believe that it should not be denied to the right kind of children under the right con - ditions , and that whatever laws are made upon the subject should not raise barriers beyond which no child may be permitted to pass .

		The drama , as a whole , simply can not dis - pense with child characters , and for these neither midgets nor grown-ups dressed as juven - iles can provide satisfactory substitutes .

		Cer - tain types of stage children we might readily spare , the child , for example , whose opportune introduction saves its parents from divorce , or
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 the child who rescues the drunken father from the bar-room and restores him to the weeping wife .

		But even mawkish sentiment has its rights upon the stage , which we would not deny , although ourselves carefully avoiding the exhib - ition .

		We are now , however , urging the claims of such dramatic art as is exemplified in the creations of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fancy `` The Tem - pest '' and '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' such as we find in ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' and '' The Piper '' and '' The Blue Bird . ''

		These plays must have child actors if they are to be prop - erly performed .

		To forbid children to take part in them -LRB- always under suitable restric - tions -RRB- is to wrong the children themselves , to wrong the dramatist , who is justified in pro- testing against so arbitrary a limitation upon his art , and to wrong the public , which has a right to insist upon seeing such masterpieces , ancient and modern , as those we have mentioned .

		On the whole , then , we approve of the contention made by the organization which has issued '' The Stage Children of
America	LOCATION	, '' and are glad to say so in our
State of Illinois	LOCATION	, which is one of the chief sufferers under misguided legislation affecting this , as well as many other educational interests .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LUBE OF AN UNCROWDED CALLING , a calling rich in intellectual satisfactions and not requiring special abilities of a rare nature , should find many easy victims in these times when most professions are already congested and are yearly receiving an influx of poorly - equipped would-be practitioners , as the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	investigators are making plain to the world .

		A brief pamphlet entitled '' Librarianship an Uncrowded Calling , '' issued by the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, and made up of papers prepared at various times and for various purposes by noted library workers , sets forth in glowing colors some of the altruistic delights of the profession , and describes in general outline the requisite qualifications and ordinary duties of the modern librarian .

		In especially appealing accents does Miss
Elva L. Bascom	PERSON	, known as Editor of the ''
A. L. A. Booklist	PERSON	, '' address the college woman and invite her to enter upon library work , the personal qualities necessary for which are briefly defined . ''

		The two most important , '' she says , '' are effici - ency and enthusiasm .

		To these should be added , for the ideal library worker , accuracy , order , ex - ecutive ability , initiative , and a good personality .

		An ' efficient ' librarian must have a good general education and a thorough library training , plus the ability to think clearly and quickly , to judge fairly , to work effectively : perhaps there are other qualities that should be included under this most comprehen - sive word , but these are the ones that come first to my mind .

		Enthusiasm needs no comment or would not if librarians in this country were not justifiably proud of what they call ` library spirit . '

		I despair of defining just what it implies perhaps enthusiasm coupled with optimism , tempered with experience , and strengthened by a fine sense of the privilege of service ... The work is distinctly that of social service , and the qualities that will bring the worker into closest contact with the peo - ple are those that are most desirable , next to those that make for a good foundation in education and special training . ''

		Perhaps , after this enumeration of qualities that must conjoin , in due proportion , to make the `` efficient '' librarian , our foregoing re - ference to librarianship as a calling '' not requiring special abilities of a rare nature '' will tend to elicit protest .

		... A DELIGHTFUL BIT OF AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AU - DACITY was offered to a not sufficiently appreciative public some years ago in Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's anonymous book entitled `` The Truth about an Author . ''

		Since he has come into his own with the deserved success of `` The Old Wives ' Tale , '' ``
Helen	PERSON	with the Higb Hand , '' '' Clayhanger , '' and other products of his lively imagination and literary skill , the little-known essay in self-revelation has been eagerly turned to for information concerning the brilliant and versatile author .

		Among other items of interest gathered from its ingenuous pages , it is noted that the boy Arnold was early attracted to literature ; wrote verses , in the form of a hymn , at eleven ; entered the field of prose romance with a story written for his teacher ; forsook literature for art , and indulged in paint for a protracted period , rarely opening a book , and remaining ignorant of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, and other classic authors , until manhood , not even ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' being known to him until he was thirty .

		But one author , not exactly a classic , he did devour in his adolescence , and that was ''
Ouida	PERSON	. ''

		It was she , he confesses , who gave him '' that taste for liaisons under pink lampshades which I shall always have , but which , owing to a Puritanical upbringing , I shall never be able to satisfy . ''

		The account of his steady and rather rapid rise in the
London	LOCATION	world of letters , where he seems to have turned his hand to almost every sort of honorable and decently-paid literary work , of his later migration to the quiet of the country , and -LRB- but this is not in the book -RRB- of his latest move to the French capital , where his indus - try appears to continue unabated , can not but interest the large number who desire his writings as the hart panteth after the water-brooks .

		QUANTITY AND QUALITY IN PLAY-WRITING , as in other departments of literature , are often in - versely proportional to each other , but not always .

		That very successful dramatist , Sir
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	, is credited with the recent assertion that one play 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, a year is enough for any man , and another popular playwright is warned by his friends that he is writ - ing too rapidly when he announces four plays as his season 's product .

		This invites a backward glance at the great dramatists of the past .

		Surely there were giants of productivity in those days .

		^ Eschylus is believed to have written between seventy-two and ninety tragedies , more than half of which were first-prize-winners , though only seven have survived .

		Sophocles , with the same number of extant plays , is said to have produced one hundred and twenty - three , or even one hundred and thirty .

		Euripides is credited with a total of one hundred and twenty , of which eighteen have come down to us .


Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes , known to us by his eleven extant comedies , is thought to have written nearly four times that num - ber .

		Plautus had as many as one hundred and thirty comedies ascribed to him -LRB- though on doubtful authority -RRB- , and twenty have survived , more or less complete .

		Shakespeare in twenty years wrote some thirty-five plays without beginning to apply himself strenuously or exclusively to authorship .

		His Span - ish contemporary ,
Lope de Vega	PERSON	, is held to have written the incredible number of fifteen hundred -LRB- some say eighteen hundred -RRB- regular dramas , besides several hundred autos or religious pieces and en - tremeses or interludes .

		Calderon has the credit of about one hundred and twenty plays .

		Goldoni left nearly one hundred and fifty comedies to attest the varying excellence of his workmanship .


Tom Taylor	PERSON	wrote or adapted more than one hundred pieces for the stage , and other recent prolific play - wrights are the younger
Dumas	PERSON	,
Boucicault	LOCATION	, BjOrn - son , and
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	.

		That some or all of these might have written better if they had written less is of course possible , but the fact remains that the greatest dramatists of the past have as a rule not stinted themselves in their output .

		A noteworthy contrasting instance in the present is the author of `` Chantecler . ''

		EMERSON 'S UNDEMONSTRATIVE GENEROSITY to those less fortunate than he in the matter of tangi - ble returns for literary work , was as fine as it was little known .

		In a privately-printed volume , '' Rec - ords of a Lifelong Friendship , '' just put forth by Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	and composed of the correspondence from
1837	DATE	to
1877	DATE	of
Emerson	PERSON	and his schoolmate , the editor 's father , the late Dr.
William Henry Furness	PERSON	, there appears a character - istic instance of this generosity .


Ellery Channing	PERSON	had been proposed by his friend
Emerson	PERSON	as a con - tributor to '' The Gift , '' an elegant annual of the period , published by
Carey & Hart	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and edited by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	.

		Emerson himself had been asked to contribute , and he searched his port - folios , '' but without a clear and satisfactory result , '' as he writes to
Furness	PERSON	.

		`` Here , however , '' he adds , '' are some verses from my friend C. new virgin poems .

		If you like his poetry half as well as I do , you will think me honorably represented by such a proxy .

		But I do not mean to decline a personal appearance in such good company , and if you will give me as long a day as last year , namely , to 15
March	DATE	, I will send you some prose or verse , the best that I can , by that day .

		The bargain shall be the same as last year , that whatever fee Mr.
Carey	PERSON	judges suitable to
Channing	PERSON	's and mine united , shall be forwarded to
Channing	PERSON	as the price of his alone . ''

		This recalls the same benefactor 's goodness to
Alcott	LOCATION	, of which one among many not too well-known instances may here be given .

		At a conversazione held for
Alcott	ORGANIZATION	's benefit at
Emerson	LOCATION	's house the sum of thirty dollars was collected and handed to the beneficiary . ''

		I dare say , '' was his daughter
Louisa	PERSON	's shrewd comment , '' Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	gave twenty dollars himself . ''

		LITERARY FAVORITES OF THE BLIND might by some be thought to be limited chiefly to works of a contemplative , introspective character , treating of that inner life with which the sightless are perforce so familiar .

		What , one might ask , have they to do with light and color , with visible shapes and out - lines , with stir and movement , as noted by the sense of seeing ?

		And yet the blind , even those born blind , habitually use the vocabulary of their more fortunate neighbors , and the verb '' to see '' is by no means excluded from their phraseology .

		Thus it results that their taste in books is rather for the ob - jective , the pages that glow with color and are alive with action , than for the intensely subjective .

		The works circulated among the blind of
New York State	ORGANIZATION	by the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	form an instructive list in this regard .

		From the current report of Director
Wyer	PERSON	we learn that
Mark Twain	PERSON	's ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' is the best-read book of the lot ; Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's '' Rebecca '' stories are almost equally popular ; Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's '' The Virginian '' is a prime favorite ; and so is Mrs. GaskelPs ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' as might not have been expected .

		The very last on the list of twenty-one is ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	, '' which is far outdistanced by certain works of the non-fiction class .

		In the list of periodicals printed for the blind , it is to be noted with regret that no fewer than four styles of typography are used ,
New York	LOCATION	point ,
American Braille	ORGANIZATION	, English Braille , and
Moon	PERSON	, while a fifth , line letter , is used in many of their books .

		Why could not the blind , sufficiently handicapped already , have been spared this Babel of tongues in their reading ?

		CARLYLE ON SOME OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES is interestingly reported in the
February	DATE	issue of `` The English Review '' by Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, who had a number of intimate interviews with the
Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	celebrity near the close of the latter 's life .

		All the world knows how slightingly
Carlyle	PERSON	was wont to speak of
Darwin	PERSON	's theory of evolution .

		Conse - quently it is a satisfaction for the Darwin-admirer to find his scornful critic according him some credit after all . ''

		I saw in him then qualities I had hardly done justice to before , '' he says in recounting a chance interview , `` a patient clear-mindedness ,
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 fairness , too , and above all , an allegiance to facts , just as facts , which was most pathetic to me ; it was so instinctive , determined , even desperate , a sort of belief in its way , an English belief , that the facts mast lead you right if you only followed them hon - estly , a poor groping blind faith all that seems possible to us in these days of flatulent unbelief and piggish unconcern for everything except swill and straw . ''

		But a little later he breaks out : '' The theory , man !

		the theory is as old as the everlasting hills . ''

		-LRB- Impatient contempt in his voice as he spoke . -RRB- ''

		There 's nothing in it nothing ; it leads no whither all sound and noise signifying naething , naething . ''

		Asked to name the greatest of all the great men he had met in his long lifetime , he replied at once : ''
Emerson !	ORGANIZATION

		Emerson by far , and the noblest '' ; and he nodded his head , adds Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, and re - peated the name with a sort of reminiscent emotion .

		CULTURE IN
MANKATO	LOCATION	is high and still rising , as any one may convince himself by consulting the latest annual report of the
Mankato Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Mankatonians have as good taste as the proverbial Bostonians , '' asserts , with justifiable pride , the
Mankato	LOCATION	librarian ; '' and we have proven by experience that our patrons will read good liter - ature when good literature is put within their reach ; when books of real merit rather than books of an ephemeral nature are placed to catch the eye of everyone approaching the desk fiction that is sound and wholesome , and non-fiction to appeal to the student , the professional man , the artisan , the tradesman ; to the mother , the society woman , the housemaid , the child ; books to refine the mind and elevate the taste ; nor does this bar out light read - ing reading for the tired mother requiring recrea - tion , for the sentimental miss in high school or fac - tory , reading for the man or woman getting his or her first introduction to literature . ''

		Another paragraph that catches the eye states that '' the library takes a part in all campaigns : tuberculosis , the commission plan of government , good roads , food-inspection , politics , etc. , thereby standing for the practical as well as the cultural . ''

		As evidence of the sober and substantial quality of
Mankato	LOCATION	culture , let it be noted that under the regime of the present librarian the circulation of non-fiction has been raised since
1905	DATE	from twenty-four to forty-five per cent of the total circulation , '' and the fiction called for is a much better grade now than formerly . ''

		This , we infer , has been effected in no small part by the judicious ex - posure of the best books of the day and of the ages .

		HUMOR ix GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS , those for - midable and rapidly-accumulating volumes that con - stitute one of the unsolved problems of librarianship , is not often looked for and is still more seldom found .

		A bill introduced
Feb. 14	DATE	, though not ostensibly as a comic valentine , in the
Massachusetts House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, has more of this rare legislative humor than is often embodied in such proposed enactments .

		The bill is one of those many proposals to tax bachelors which never get beyond the initial stage ; and of course it makes the customary disposal of the prospective revenue in favor of the unmar - ried women , whose spinsterhood is a standing re - proach to celibate men .

		But it further specifies that said spinsters must be '' deserving '' and must be `` those who have passed , or are believed to have passed , the marriageable age . ''

		What woman with the smallest remnant of woman-nature in her make - up would ever submit to being classed among the unmarriageables ?

		Another curious clause exempts from taxation the bachelor who can prove '' that he is not of good moral character , or that he is otherwise unfit for matrimony . ''

		The amount of the yearly mulct -LRB- five dollars -RRB- is not sufficient to inspire any vehement desire to prove one 's moral worthlessness , or one 's undesirability as a husband in other respects .

		But there is no likelihood that these gems of humor will be preserved in statute form .

		The more will - ingly , therefore , do we here rescue them from oblivion .

		... WHY THERE IS YET NO AMERICAN LITERATURE is explained by Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	in the
February	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		Writing in his customary frank and agreeable style on `` The American Spirit , '' he pleasantly though firmly refuses to grant that we have anything worthy of being called a literature of our own , and adds the usual and the obvious explanation that we are still too young and too busy with our material develop - ment .

		But , he adds , `` one of the most hopeful signs of promise is the rich , racy , vigorous knack of conversational expression Americans possess . ''

		And this , he opines , '' may be the seed of a great literature , because it is the sign that thought is taking its own shape and crystallizing itself , even though it be in bizarre forms . ''

		In this connection it is an interesting fact , not noted by Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, that some of our raciest so-called Americanisms are nothing but survivals of old idioms that have died out in the home of their origin .

		Thus the crystal - lization referred to by him took place , in part at least , ages ago in his own country .

		... A BELATED GENIUS , a man or woman who has arrived at maturity or even passed beyond it with no suspicion of extraordinary latent powers , now and then comes into public notice and serves to remind the inconspicuous plodder that there may yet be fame or fortune , or both , awaiting him in some fold of the mantle that muffles the mysterious future .

		The late
Owen Kildare	PERSON	, author of ''
Mamie Rose	PERSON	, '' '' The Good of the Wicked , '' '' The Wisdom of the Simple , '' and `` My Old Bailiwick , '' as also of the unsuccessful dramatization of the first-named book , which made its appearance at
Wallack	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre as `` The Regeneration , '' could neither read nor write at thirty years of age .

		The romantic story of his rescue from illiteracy and vagabondage by a school-teacher of
New York	LOCATION	's lower East Side , 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, where he was born of an Irish father and a French mother , and where he grew up in hap-hazard fashion , contains many curious details .

		The final accumu - lation of troubles and misfortunes , after he had so surprisingly made his literary mark , forms a sad sequel to this hopeful beginning of better things .

		A POET LAUREATE 'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY , a thing not so common in our literature as buttercugs in
June	DATE	, is promised soon .

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	has written his reminiscences , and the house of Mac - millan is to publish them , as we hear from
London	LOCATION	.

		The graceful prose of the present poet laureate has probably won him more readers than his verse or at least than that particular portion of his verse which has come from him by virtue of his high office .

		It is remarkable , by the way , how little he has impressed himself upon the world 's attention as Poet Laureate of
England	LOCATION	.

		Probably there are hundreds of cultured and well-informed persons in this country who would be at a loss if asked sud - denly to name
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's successor .

		Only a few weeks ago there appeared in a
Boston	LOCATION	paper of high standing an editorial reference to Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	as poet laureate .

		And why this delay in knighting Mr.
Austin	PERSON	?

		Even English newspapers occasionally refer to him as Sir
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, as if a laureate must by reason of his office have a right to a title .

		Let us hope that when honors are dis - tributed at the coming coronation he will be re - membered that is , if he cares for that sort of thing .

		THE HUTH BEQUEST TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM forms an important clause in that part of Mr.
Huth	PERSON	's will which relates to the famous library soon to be dispersed -LRB- unless a sufficient offer is made for it as a whole -RRB- and already referred to by us .

		The be - quest is made in these terms : '' If at any time it should be found necessary to sell the collection , before such sale the authorities of the British Museum are to have the first selection of a gift of fifty items therefrom , which shall be marked by them and always known as the
Huth Bequest	ORGANIZATION	.

		In making this selection the authorities shall not be allowed to take a second or more perfect copy of an item already in the
National Collection	ORGANIZATION	, unless they shall exchange such item for the one already in their possession , the exchange of any item being counted as one of the fifty for their selection . ''

		The half-hundred choicest items in a private library estimated as now worth a quarter of a million pounds will form a collection of no little value , in terms of dollars and cents , and of exceeding interest to book-lovers .

		THE '' SPECTATOR 'S '' BICENTENARY ought not to pass unnoted .

		Two hundred years ago to-day -LRB-
March 1	DATE	-RRB- appeared the first number of what was destined to be the most famous periodical of its kind ; and though it ran for less than two years from
March 1 , 1711	DATE	to
Dec. 6 , 1712	DATE	it nevertheless , as has been said of it , '' fixed new standards of man - ners , morals , and taste , whose influence lasted many years . ''

		Even now it is read , not only as prescribed reading in school and college , but for the pure pleasure of its graceful and correct style , its old - fashioned allusions and quotations , and the agreeable picture it affords of a bygone age .

		Of the essays which formed its contents ,
Addison	PERSON	wrote two hun - dred and seventy-four , and
Steele	PERSON	two hundred and forty .

		Its early extinction was due to the imposi - tion of a government tax on periodicals a half - penny , or some such trifling amount , which was enough to make the difference between profit and loss to the publishers of
Addison	PERSON	's venture .

		A FRENCH EPIC OF HEROIC PROPORTIONS follows close on the heels of
M. Romain Holland	PERSON	's indeter - minate serial , ``
Jean Christophe	PERSON	, '' which has now attained its tenth volume .

		The very name of the poem in question , `` L'Epope `` e de la
Grande Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' is a guaranty of good measure ; and though at present only the first part , covering the period from
May 5 r 1789	DATE	, to
May 5 , 1821	DATE	, has appeared in print , we are assured that the entire work will extend to more than twenty-five thousand lines two-thirds longer than the '' Iliad , '' and nearly thrice the length of '' Paradise Lost . ''

		The author , one
Abel des Trois	PERSON	- Arches , began this great national epic of his forty - two years ago , so that it may be considered his life - work .

		In the face of this robust performance will any man now dare to assert that poetry is on the decline ?

		THE MODERN NOVEL AND ITS PUBLIC .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-


London	LOCATION	,
Feb. 18 , 1911	DATE	.

		When there is nothing of great importance hap - pening , from the journalistic point of view , our enterprising press has the pleasant habit now and again of starting a discussion and inviting corre - spondence on the subject from interested readers .

		With a little judicious fostering , and a certain num - ber of letters written in the office to indicate the best methods of treating the topic , these arguments sometimes reach truly formidable proportions , es - pecially if they deal with a religious or moral sub - ject .

		With literature , the general public is justly supposed to be less concerned ; and it is rare to find a paper `` opening its columns '' -LRB- as the phrase runs -RRB- to any discussion about the making of books .

		But a few months ago the unexpected happened : the '' Westminster Gazette '' did actually invite the opinions of its readers on the momentous question of the Length of Modern Novels ; and , curiously enough , this departure from the old tradition met with considerable success .

		For some weeks the novelists of
England	LOCATION	entrusted their opinions on this fascinating topic to the correspondence columns of our premier evening paper , commonly at a length
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 inversely proportioned to the importance of the writer .

		The diversity of opinion registered was re - markable ; until at last one sensible man propounded the theory that a novel , like a pair of trousers , should be cut to the measure of the material it was meant to contain .

		The correspondence closed shortly afterwards .

		Generally speaking , the public prefers a good long novel to a good short one , as is only natural .

		The more the buyer gets for his money , assuming the quality to be equal , the better he is pleased .

		But it is also true that the modern reader does not want his attention taken off the main theme by any irrelevant matter .

		I do not think the ordinary consumer of novels to-day spends much time in read - ing the old masters .

		Most houses in
London	LOCATION	that have any library at all no doubt possess editions of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Dickens	LOCATION	; but they are rarely taken down from the shelves .

		If '' Quentin Dur - ward , '' or '' Vanity Fair , '' or ''
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	'' were offered to the
London	LOCATION	trade to-day as new books by unknown authors I am confident they would be refused , not because of their mere length but because their authors had not learned the art of excluding matter not germane to the story .

		Scott 's prefatory and introductory remarks alone would often fill as many pages as a modern novelist re - quires for his whole book .

		Thackeray , they would say , was always introducing long apostrophic reflec - tions on things in general .

		Dickens invented so many subsidiary characters and side-issues that he was forced , as it were , to strike a balance-sheet at the end of the book , telling his anxious readers in a few words what had become of all the secondary personages who had flitted across his pages .

		I dare not imagine what the modern publisher would say of his other habit of interpolating whole stories , such as '' The Stroller 's Tale '' in the third chapter of '' The Pickwick Papers . ''

		The fact is that , so far as construction goes , the technique of the novel has been improved out of all recognition during the last thirty years .

		A great number of very poor novels are published year by year ; but , bad as they are , they do not generally err in the direction of technique .

		The plot may be thin , the characters wooden , the writing undistinguished or even ungrammatical ; but the author has gener - ally the merit of keeping the story well in view from start to finish .

		He has discovered that the one thing he must not do is to allow the reader 's attention to wander .

		It is far more likely to wander than it was in the old days ; and this is not entirely due to inferiority in the artist of the twentieth century , it is due rather to the rise of a new and half-educated public , who have been fed on papers like '' Answers '' and '' Tit-bits '' the babies ' food of the young reader .

		It remains to be seen whether this public will ever be educated up to anything better ; but at present they are incapable of absorbing any para - graph of more than five or six lines in length .

		They require a series of shocks to keep them awake , and consequently the modern novelist has learned the imprudence of indulging in prolixity .

		The page of a new novel must not even present a physical appear - ance of solidity ; if a publisher sees the proofs come from the printer with more than ten inches of un - broken matter he is quite capable -LRB- as has happened more than once in my own case -RRB- of breaking up the paragraphs himself .

		Only a few of the old guard , such as Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, are permitted some lati - tude in this respect probably because they were found to be incorrigible .

		It is easy to theorize about the production of books , but it is still extraordinarily difficult to predict with any approach to accuracy how the public will receive any given specimen .

		Yet one can generally tell what sort of reception it will meet with from the reviewers .

		Some years ago this would have been sufficient ; there was a time when a few enthusiastic acclamations in the more important papers sent a new book gaily forward on the road to success .

		In these days the criticisms of the press seem to have lost their effect upon readers ; the reviewers may praise until they have exhausted every adjective in their vocabulary , yet the buyers will refuse to come in .

		Sometimes I am almost inclined to think that a chorus of commendation damps the ardor of the public ; they suspect all sorts of things an organized attempt to boom the work of a personal friend , or perhaps even bribery .

		They have lost their child-like faith in the infallibility of the critic that our forefathers possessed .

		It is a curious and instructive fact that the most popular writers of the present day in the world of fiction
Hall Caine	PERSON	,
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, and the author who is probably sell - ing more sixpenny editions than anyone else just now ,
Charles Garvice	PERSON	are the three novelists for whom the reviewers never have a good word to say .

		The people are not only uneducated , then , but obstinate ; they hear the voice of their master , but deliberately stuff their ears with cotton-wool ; they do not wish to learn .

		And the critic can only sigh and point out for their own satisfaction that in all branches of art the public has ever admired , with a curious consistency , the worst that is put before it .

		What does sell a novel ?

		The irresponsible chatter of women at afternoon tea , say some of my friends .

		I think it a fact that women have a great deal to say in the matter .

		They read far more novels than the men ; they take their reading more seriously ; and are more likely to discuss their favorites afterwards .

		Thus some of the literary agents now lay it down as a cardinal rule that , in a successful story , the feminine interest should be dominant .

		Women , they argue , like to read about themselves , and especially to learn how they should behave in moments of emotional stress .

		There is thus a formula for the construction of the '' big seller , '' if anyone could ever work to a formula , and if the literary agents are correct .

		Personally , I fear that the great secret eludes analysis .

		Like many so-called games of chance , the art of success - ful novel-writing is a matter of fortune , with a re - servation in favor of the better player .

		The good 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, man will commonly achieve a modest independence in time , if he goes on trying .

		For the rest , it is well for him not to be too much concerned with the commercial side of his work .

		The artist , we used to say , is seldom a good man of business .

		The reproach , or encomium -LRB- for it will bear either interpretation -RRB- , is probably as true now as then , but the artist of to-day has a host of helpers anxious to take the business side of his profession off his shoulders .

		Some half-dozen lit - erary agents of repute have followed the lead given them by Mr.
A. P. Watt	PERSON	, the doyen of the profes - sion ; and it is now the exception for an author of any popularity to conduct negotiations personally for the sale of his work .

		And in addition to the agents , there is also the Society of Authors that eminently useful institution founded by the late Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	for the protection of the writer against his natural foes , the editor and the publisher .

		With these two forces working on his side , I can not help thinking that the balance of power has now shifted .

		The writer who has anything worth selling is so well protected that no year passes without one or more publishers going through the bankruptcy court or retiring unostentatiously from business .

		The days are gone by when he could recoup himself for a series of losses by an occasional bargain .

		In order to keep himself afloat he is compelled to seek every possible means of adding to his slender profits ; and no sooner does he discover a new avenue to wealth than the
Society	ORGANIZATION	erects a toll-bar across the highway and demands additional royalities for its fortunate clients .

		The committee has its collective eye now upon the use that some publishers are making of cheap books as advertising media .

		The printing of publishers ' lists at the end of a book has been the custom for ages , though even here there may be a doubt as to the strict legality of the pro- cess .

		But when the publisher of a cheap shilling or sixpenny novel proceeds to pad out the book with advertisements of pills and soap and face-powders and safety razors , not only on the covers and end pages but sometimes interleaved with the body of the story , it is felt that he is seriously interfering with the
Dignity of Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		And no man , says the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, shall dare to interfere with that dignity without paying heavily for the privilege .

		The
February	DATE	number of '' The Author , '' the official organ of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, has dealt with this topic .

		I foresee a very pretty quarrel .

		The publishers will no doubt point to the magazines in justification of their action .

		If you can advertise in a collection of stories by various hands , why should you not do the same in a single story published at the same price ?

		For my own part , I am divided in my sympathies : I am anxious that the novelist should make a decent living , but this steady procession of publishers wending their way to the court of bankruptcy is not without its serious side .

		A cer - tain amount of healthy competition is good for all trades , and I do not want to see the publishers of
London	LOCATION	reduced to a few big houses .

		But certainly an author has a right to grumble when he sees his most impassioned love-scene faced with a page in praise of corsets , cosmetics , and specifics for the reduction of obesity .

		THE THIRTY-SIX ORIGINAL DRAMATIC SITUATIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The inquiry of your correspondent respecting the number of possible dramatic situations will probably call out numerous answers .

		It was Goethe who , in his Conversations with
Eckermann	PERSON	, under date of
February 14 , 1830	DATE	, attributed to
Gozzi	PERSON	the statement that there could be but thirty-six '' tragic situations , '' and added that
Schiller	PERSON	thought that there were more but could never find as many .

		There is a little book by
Georges Polti	PERSON	, entitled '' Les trente-six situations dramatiques , '' published in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1895	DATE	by '' Le Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, '' which undertakes to set forth in detail these situations as they occur in ancient and modern drama .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As Professor
Schelling	PERSON	has started Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	in quest of the original dramatic situations , it may be inter - esting to recall that
Polti	ORGANIZATION	says that
Goethe	PERSON	said that
Gozzi	PERSON	said there could be only thirty-six , and that this set
Schiller	PERSON	off , who took much pains to find more but could not even find so many .

		Apparently the results were not formulated .

		The omission was too much for
Georges Polti	PERSON	.

		In the fulness of time , in
1895	DATE	, he published in
Paris	LOCATION	his '' Thirty-six Dramatic Situations , '' wherein with a thoroughness all Teutonic he digested the con - tent not of drama simply but of literature and history .

		To set down the brief headings under which each group is analyzed by its numerous subdivisions does scant justice , of course , to his ingenuity and skill .

		They run as follows : 1 , Supplication ; 2 , The Savior ; 3 , Vengeance pur - suing crime ; 4 , To avenge kinsman upon kinsman ; 5 , The Fugitive hunted ; 6 , Disaster ; 7 , A Prey ; 8 , Re - volt ; 9 , Daring effort ; 10 , Carrying off ; 11 , The riddle ; 12 , To obtain ; 13 , Hatred of kinsmen ; 14 , Rivalry of kinsmen or friends ; 15 , Murderous adulterer ; 16 , Madness ; 17 , Fatal imprudence ; 18 , Involuntary crime of love ; 19 , To kill a kinsman before recognition ; 20 , To sacrifice to the ideal ; 21 , To sacrifice for kins - men ; 22 , To sacrifice all to passion ; 23 , To be obliged to sacrifice one 's kinsmen ; 24 , Rivalry of unequals ; 25 , Adultery ; 26 , Crimes of love ; 27 , To learn the dis - honor of one who is loved ; 28 , Loves obstructed ; 29 , To love an enemy ; 30 , Ambition ; 31 , Struggle against God ; 32 , Mistaken jealousy ; 33 , Judicial error ; 34 , Remorse ; 35 , Recovery ; 36 , To lose one 's kinsmen .

		The search for the indivisible elements out of which the interaction of impulse and circumstance produces its myriad compounds must be a pastime of scholars born without a taste for chess .

		Some new result emerges periodically to start an epidemic among the laity .

		One tendency seems worth noting : the number of elements , against analogy , is diminishing .

		It is no answer to say that the whole affair is one of classifica - tion ; as well say that chess is a mere matter of check - mate , or that '' Les trente-sept sous de M. Montaudoin ''

		THE DIAL , 153 is a mere matter of arithmetic .

		Has anyone proposed a reduction to thirteen fundamental types ?

		Or has the '' thirteen original '' been assimilated from our familiar `` thirteen original colonies '' ?

		Or is there some con - fusion here with Professor
Baker	PERSON	's dozen ?

		Heretofore I have been immune from the disease , but this new - fangled
Microbe Thirteen	ORGANIZATION	has found a foothold in my curiosity .

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	, it is a comfort to know , is in a worse state ; for he has been suffering , apparently during some years of time , from the '' seven original jokes '' as well .

		Should it not be the seven cardinal jokes ?

		And should n't the perennial attempt toward such enumerations as these be recognized as one of the seven ?

		THE COSMOGRAPHY OF PLATO AND OF DANTE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In Professor
John A. Stewart	PERSON	's '' Myths of Plato , '' page 102 , the author speaks of the `` strange coinci - dence '' that in
Dante	LOCATION	's Inferno , '' which is so largely modelled on the Sixth Book of the JSneid , '' there should re-appear the Phaedo '' description of Tartarus as bored right through the earth , '' a conception '' unique in Greek mythology and in no way counten - anced by
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It certainly is a parallelism well worthy of notice ; and the Professor drops many another remark in the work which the student of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	will find illuminating .

		The Dantean conception of hell , however , and the Dantean conception of its origin , have another parallel which seems to me still more striking .

		It is found in a sacred book of the Parsees , '' The Bundahish , '' and as I have never seen it referred to as a parallel , I take the liberty of calling attention to it here .

		Dante , as every reader will remember , pictures Lucifer as having '' by the force of his fall bored a passage down to the centre of the earth '' -LRB-
Stewart	PERSON	, p. 106 -RRB- .

		The Bundahish gives the same picture , say - ing : '' The centre of the earth was pierced and entered by him , '' i.e. , the
Evil Spirit	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	represents Lucifer as remaining in the lowest hell thus formed at the precise centre of the earth .

		Similar is the repre - sentation of the Bnndahish , which says : '' Hell is in the middle of the earth ; there where the Evil Spirit pierced the earth and rushed in upon it . ''

		Again , despite the fact that he was describing the fallen angel as pos - sessed of wings and legs ,
Dante	PERSON	calls him '' the abhorred worm which boreth through the world '' In like man - ner , in the Appendix to the
Bundahish	LOCATION	, Ahriman is described as coming on '' through the middle of the earth , as a snake , all-leaping comes out of a hole ; and he stayed within the whole earth .

		The passage whereon he came is his own , the way to hell , through which the demons make the wicked run . ''

		MISGUIDED POETS AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Apropos of your editorial on '' Misguided Poets , '' permit me to call attention to a nuisance in our public libraries , especially to be found on the shelves devoted to the poets .

		Every loiterer among the stacks must he familiar with those slender volumes with a binding of peculiar style -LRB- a connoisseur can always know them by their bindings -RRB- with the words written inside '' Don - ated by the Author . ''

		They are not entirely useless , as they furnish an endless supply of amusement .

		One gentleman of the tribe appended his biography to his volume , and in one sentence has so crystallized the folly of them * 11 that it ought to be considered their classic expression : `` I have donated copies of my '
Cudmore	PERSON	's Prophecy of the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	' to libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, Central and
South America	LOCATION	,
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and
Tasmania	LOCATION	. ''

		The particular kind of provincialism of which these authors and donators are guilty is , it seems to me , a gross ignorance of the organization of publishing and marketing of books , and of the habits of the reading public .

		And besides the wholesome fun which they naturally call forth , perhaps an acquaintance with them leads one to a more conscious gratitude that we have great publishing houses with reputations and policies , who give to books the prestige without which their careers would indeed be precarious .

		ANOTHER MOURNER OF `` MIZZELED . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your editorial note in the issue of
Feb. 16	DATE	, on the haunting associations of words , struck a most sym - pathetic chord in my heart .

		It is gratifying to find someone else who has been '' mizzeled '' as to the pro- nunciation of `` misled , '' and who shares my grief at having our vocabulary robbed of a word so pregnant with meaning as '' mizzeled , '' and given in its place a word so poor , cold , and undescriptive as '' misled . ''

		You are the third person I know of who feels that way about it .

		I remember when I was about thirteen years old , hearing my father , who for many years occupied a seat on the bench of the
Civil Court	ORGANIZATION	in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, tell of a brilliant young Creole lawyer using in his argument the word '' mizzeled , '' to the complete mys - tification of the court .

		He afterwards asked the young lawyer to spell the word for him , and thereupon en - lightened him as to its real pronunciatiation .

		But I feel sure the young man was not so much mortified at his mistake as pained at his irreparable loss .

		Perhaps , however , in a better world where language is what it should be , our dear departed `` mizzeled '' will come into its own .

		The writers , one day to be famous , whose genius he and his brother
Daniel	PERSON	recognized and encouraged , and whose books they published , form a long and notable list .

		And yet he was without early advantages in education , being the son of a poor Scotch farmer with a large family , and being left fatherless at the age of five and forced to shift for himself when he was not more than fifteen or sixteen .

		He was born at
Irvine	LOCATION	, in
Ayrshire	LOCATION	,
Oct. 3 , 1818	DATE	.

		The schools of the town gave him his education , and there he himself became `` head - master of Scott 's School '' at the surprisingly tender age of sixteen .

		The succeeding few years are mostly a blank in our knowledge of his interests and occupations , but with his going to
London	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	to join his older brother
Daniel	PERSON	in the bookselling business the memorable period of his active and fruitful life begins .

		But some mention should be made of his youthful adven - ture as a sailor before the mast in a voyage to
America	LOCATION	in
1836	DATE	, undertaken apparently in a fit of boyish unrest and seldom referred to by him in after life .

		In
1843	DATE	the brothers removed from
London	LOCATION	to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and soon after - ward became publishers as well as booksellers , their first venture being '' The Philosophy of Training , '' a short educational treatise by a
Glasgow	LOCATION	schoolmaster .

		Their acquaintance with
Cambridge	LOCATION	men and their keen interest in the literature of the day naturally led to their entering upon business as well as friendly relations with a number of the young writers about them .

		Books on education seemed at first to make the strongest appeal to them , but it was not long before they became interested in furthering the fortunes of such authors as
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Maurice	PERSON	, Trench ,
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	, and many others with what the shrewd Scotch brothers saw to be a promising future before them .

		The establishment of a
London	LOCATION	house or branch became a necessity with the rapid and unexpected success of their publishing business , * LIFE AND LETTERS OF

Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		but before this had been accomplished the elder partner ,
Daniel	PERSON	, died , and the entire burden of the enterprise was imposed on
Alexander	ORGANIZATION	's shoulders .

		In
1858	DATE	the
London	LOCATION	branch was opened , and in five years it grew to such im - portance as to necessitate its proprietor 's re - moval to
London	LOCATION	, which thereafter remained the headquarters of the business .

		The records of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's life at Cam - bridge , and especially his connection with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Working Men 's College , show him to have been a man of large heart and generous impulses , of deep moral purpose , and of remark - able influence upon young men .

		Indeed , he seems to have been sought out as adviser and confidant by men of all ages .

		His soundness of judgment , his sincerity , his breadth of view , and his freedom from all selfish interest , secured for him an enviable position in the university circle and in the larger world about him .

		The regard cherished for him by many of the noted men of his time may be gathered from the wide correspondence drawn upon by Mr.
Charles L. Graves	PERSON	in his '' Life and Letters of
Alexander Macmillan	PERSON	, '' which comes from the publishing house founded by the two brothers more than sixty years ago .

		One of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	friends of the younger brother has contributed his rem - iniscences of
Alexander Macmillan	PERSON	.

		A short extract will be here not out of place , before we follow him to
London	LOCATION	and to the more engross - ing cares of his increasing business . ''

		I only knew of his work in connection with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Working Men 's College from what he told me himself and hearsay from others , but it was he who really supplied the driving power which started and kept going its whole machinery .

		There were many distinguished men on the teaching staff of the institu - tion besides himself , among them
Harvey Goodwin	PERSON	,
J. B. Lightfoot	PERSON	,
F. J. A. Hort	PERSON	, and
J. B. Mayor	PERSON	, whose names overshadowed that of the secretary and lecturer
Alexander Macmillan	PERSON	, but none of them , in
Maurice	LOCATION	's phrase , ' got hold of the working men ' if that were the true description of those who attended the classes in anything like the same degree . ''

		With the establishment of the
London	LOCATION	house came the serious consideration of the project for starting a magazine .


Thomas Hughes	PERSON	had been the first to advise this step , at the time when his ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's School Days '' was about to be published .

		Its author much wished to have the story come out as a serial , and would have had its publishers found a magazine for the purpose .

		Finally , in
1859	DATE	, the start was made , with
David Masson	PERSON	as editor ; and
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's activity in securing the best of contributors for its pages very early assured its success .

		His son
George	PERSON	writes of this period :

		THE DIAL 155 `` For the next five years -LSB- from
1858	DATE	-RSB- it was my father 's regular habit to spend each
Thursday	DATE
night	TIME	in
London	LOCATION	, and to keep open house that evening in Henrietta Street for any one who liked to come and take part in a modest meal , followed by free and easy discussion of literary and other matters .

		These ' Tobacco Parliaments ' were a very important feature in the development of the publishing business , espe - cially after the foundation of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's Magazine in
November , 1859	DATE	. ''

		The autographs inscribed on the bevelled edge of the round table at which the `` parliament '' sat include those of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	,
Maurice	PERSON	,
Hughes	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Masson	PERSON	,

G. S. Venables	PERSON	,
F. T. Palgrave	PERSON	,

William Allingham	PERSON	,
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	, and
Alfred Ainger	ORGANIZATION	.


Macmillan	PERSON	was by nature an able captain of industry , and he always had the loyal support of his company of fellow-workers .

		He knew how to delegate authority , but he could also carry in his head an infinity of details and thought no part of the necessary routine of his business beneath him .

		The pains that he took with the reading and judging of submitted manuscripts was incredible , and his flair for the desirable thing to publish was of the keen - est. .

		It is , however , a matter of record that Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's ''
Auld Licht	PERSON	Idylls '' was rejected by this passionate lover of everything Scottish , though his biographer seeks to account for so inexplicable a blunder by conjecturing that the manuscript must have been sent in and passed upon when the head of the house was absent .

		This inference is rendered the more probable by reason of his practice of writing long and critical though sympathetic and friendly letters to accompany the return of any meritorious but unaccepted offering ; and no such letter to Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	seems to have been discovered .

		An interesting letter to Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, dated
1868	DATE	and filling more than three pages of close print , is reproduced by Mr.
Graves	PERSON	.

		It ex - plains , convincingly and kindly , the publisher 's reason for rejecting '' The Poor Man and the Lady , '' and the author appears never to have questioned the justice of the verdict , as the story remained unpublished , being withheld even after
George Meredith	PERSON	had passed upon it favorably .

		The course of self-education that had qualified
Alexander Macmillan	PERSON	to be his own professional '' reader '' is thus referred to by
Canon	ORGANIZATION	Ainger : '' He had mastered the leading English prose classics , and they formed for him a secret standard and criterion of excellence which saved him in a remarkable way from false admirations , or from being deceived by that specious mediocrity which is perpetually appearing in fresh shapes above the horizon .

		A life-long enthusiasm for the best novels was at the root of his highest suc - cess as a publisher . ''

		In illustration of his discriminating taste in novels , let us quote from a letter written by him to
James T. Fields	PERSON	in
1861	DATE	.

		It touches sympathetically also on our struggle , then in progress , to preserve the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and free the slave ; but that is apart from its main theme . ''

		I wish much that Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	would do a story which should be entirely one of natural manner and character , and have nothing of the wild or weird about it .

		The power of character-painting that is exhibited in the book is very high and very fine .

		The discrimina - tion and sharpness of his delineation are not to be sur - passed .

		The least interesting character is Elsie herself , and this only because it is conceived under circum - stances which are very partially true to fact and far from interesting if it were at least to modern and Christian times .

		The idea of the old Greek unavoid - able fate having its consummation through all sorts of pain and crime in spite of sorrow and repentance , has a kind of grandeur about it , but that a human being should take to poisoning because her mother saw a serpent has something at once painful and paltry about it .

		Buckle 's view of whale blubber and starch being the extremes of man 's moral and physical nature has a kind of interest as you can make your choice but how am I to prevent my wife from seeing a snake if she lives in a snake land ? ''

		Six years after this letter to Fields the writer was welcomed in the hospitable home of the
Boston	LOCATION	publisher , on the occasion of an Amer - ican visit that brought with it a variety of agreeable experiences .

		Even at that time the number and wealth of our colleges and univer - sities struck him with astonishment . ''

		Within the last six years , '' he observes , '' more endow - ments have been made than have been made in
England	LOCATION	for the last two hundred . ''

		And further : `` You go nowhere where princely munificence , bestowed by plain citizens , does not meet you . ''

		Gratifying also is the following in reference to the general prevalence of cour - tesy and refinement : '' One expected to find culture and refinement at a place like
Boston	LOCATION	, where
Longfellow	PERSON	who is the sweet - est and brightest of men
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	,
Emerson	PERSON	and the like live .

		But one finds almost as good everywhere .

		... I met farmers in the prairies who had read and understood
Carlyle	PERSON	, Mill , Buckle ,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Lecky	PERSON	, and authors of that class . ''

		It was in this visit that
Macmillan	PERSON	became im - pressed with the possibilities of extending his business to
America	LOCATION	, as was not long afterward done with signal success ; but he could not fail to note that '' the high tariff is a terrible drawback . ''

		Not unnaturally , in the course of his dealings with all sorts of authors , sound-minded and the reverse , he came in contact with the advocates of 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the Baconian theory of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Graves	PERSON	speaks , in this connection , of '' the redoubtable Mrs.
Pott	PERSON	's Baconian hypothesis , '' forgetful ap - parently of the honor , or dishonor , due to our own
Delia Bacon	PERSON	, whose lunacy antedates Mrs.
Pott	PERSON	's by nearly twenty years .

		As the publisher of the famous ''
Cambridge Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' , '
Macmillan	PERSON	was very naturally approached by Mrs.
Pott	PERSON	in the interest of her an ti - Shakespeare ideas , and he frankly and fully replied to her in a courteous letter beginning : '' I am afraid your enterprise is hopeless .

		Bacon assuredly is not the author of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and assuredly Shake - speare wrote them himself .

		I know the Essays well , and all Shakespeare well .

		They are the products of our greatest intellectual and moral age .

		It is impossible but that they should have much in common . ''

		A later patient letter to this persistent woman contains the following striking passage : '' The question about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's education is one requiring more space than I can give it .

		But I do n't think we quite realise how rapidly a man like Shake - speare might assimilate new words and forms of life .

		I have known I know at present a man who travel - ling through a street or town with a number of fairly intelligent men and women will learn twenty times as much as any of them with even less apparent observation .

		Do you know the story of Houdiu , the conjurer , how in passing a shop window with hundreds of objects in it he could with a glance give an inven - tory of it ? ''

		How different this from Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's conception -LRB- in `` The Dark Lady of the Sonnets '' -RRB- of a Shakespeare who , notebook in hand , painfully collects such scraps of useful material as fall in his way , chiefly from other men 's lips !


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's official connection with
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	as publisher to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and the honorary
M.A.	LOCATION	conferred upon him when that connection ceased , were matters in which he took pride .

		A letter from Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	congratulating his friend on becoming '' a brother M.A. of my ancient and honourable University '' concludes thus : '' No honour was ever better deserved , as I have often said .

		It is really a most pleasant bit of recognition for good service , and I know that you will be gratified by it .

		My only doubt is whether you ought not to have been made a Doctor of Divinity , but they do n't know you so well as I do . ''

		Mr.
Graves	PERSON	's life of the younger of the brother publishers forms a fit companion to
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	's memoir of the elder , and is in fact a much more elaborate and , in general interest , more valuable work .

		Alexander Mac - millan 's was a character worthy of a full-length portrait , and his biographer has done him justice .

		The many letters and other interesting reminders of the noted writers of the day which the book contains make it a notable contribution to liter - ary history .

		To supplement the graphic strokes of the biographer 's pen , the photographer and the artist have been called upon to show us clearly what manner of man , in his outward person , this enterprising and cultured Scotch publisher really was .

		p ERCy R BlCRNELL > ENGLISH LITERATURE IN SHAKESPEARE 'S LIFETIME .

		* There is probably no one in this country better fitted for writing a history of English literature in the time of Shakespeare than Pro- fessor
Schelling	PERSON	, whose work in the Elizabethan drama and the Elizabethan lyric , the two pre - eminent forms of expression in this age , is uni - versally authoritative .

		As in his ' ` Elizabethan Drama , '' the book before us '' departs in method from the customary arrangement of material by way of annals .

		It has neither listed authors in the order of their birth , nor books in the chronology of their publication ; but it has sought to view the subject in large by the ' recognition of a succession of literary move - ments , and varieties in poetry , drama , and prose , at times identified with a great name , at others grouped merely because of subject-matter or likeness in origin or purpose . ''

		Naturally , it is about the author whose name appears in the title that a considerable portion of the book is centered .

		Thus , the first chapter , which is fit - tingly headed '' The Literature of Fact , '' and as such introduces the Elizabethan period by an account of contemporary works on history and adventure , opens up the source-books of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's chronicle history plays .

		Follow - ing this come two chapters on `` The Literature of the Coterie '' and `` The New Cultivated Prose , '' which prepare the way for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets on the one hand and his early dramatic work on the other .

		The eight chapters on the drama , in which is compressed Professor
Schel	PERSON	- ling 's larger treatment , and with an eye single to the dramatic type rather than to the dra - matist , are grouped about the greatest poet of the age .

		The dominance of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius is , of course , felt in the lyric , and even in the prose work of the period we are aware of his presence .

		The range of treatment is , there - fore , not so arbitrarily limited as it might at first strike the casual reader .

		* ENGLISH LITERATURE DURING THE LIFETIME OF SHAKESPEARE .

Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	, Professor in the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 While it is true that a history of literature , no matter how limited the period considered , must be primarily concerned with details of historical fact , sources , influences , and the like , it is important that it should not neglect the more vital appeal of literature that which , after all , is worthy of historical treatment .

		Extensive appreciation in such a work as the one before us is necessarily impossible ; but it is easily apparent that the author has carried over into his pages his own fervid enthusiasm for the literature of this period .

		The book is not crowded with quotations , and those that do appear are admirably illustrative and are not stale from frequent use .

		Thus , the splendid stanzas on Belphosbe , in the second book of the ''
Faery Queen	PERSON	, '' furnish the text for the follow - ing eloquent appreciation : '' Of such art we feel that it is loving and leisurely ; its very progress is like that of the shuttle in the loom , now forward now back .

		Neither weaver nor poet can be conceived as hurried , or as otherwise than content to add , hour after hour and thread after thread , the beautiful colors that grow insensibly into a pattern , ever recurrent and conventional , but ever holding , as with a soft compulsion , our approval and affection . ''

		The vexed question of the sonnet Professor
Schelling	PERSON	treats with his usual sanity .

		Whether we agree with him or not in his belief that '' ` Astrophel and
Stella	PERSON	' had its inspiration in a passion sufficiently real to take on a genu - inely tragic tone to one of the ardent nature of
Sidney	PERSON	, '' we are glad that he does not lead us off into unprofitable discussions which generally end where they had begun .

		Granted poetic genius , however , it hardly seems necessary to demand an actual passion as a sine qua non of genuine love poetry ; and it again seems unlikely that
Sidney	PERSON	would dedicate to his wife sonnets cele - brating his passion for another woman , or that both his wife and his sister would regard with enthusiasm any such expression of his love .

		Especially sensible is Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's dis - cussion of the Shakespearean sonnets .

		He does not seek to identify positively the '' Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	'' except that he refuses to regard him as
William Herbert	PERSON	,
Earl of Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	.

		He clears the whole question of useless argument , and in a single paragraph presents the story of the sonnets , which , as he says , '' is neither difficult nor involved . ''

		As to the dark lady , he is content and so should we be with the wise comment that '' the court of
Elizabeth	PERSON	was fuller -LSB- of sirens -RSB- than was ever the ^ gean ; and for my part I should be sorry to have the mask of anonymity torn from the face of that immor - tal shadow . ''

		A -RSB- 1 of which is in remarkable contrast to the pronouncements of the author of '' The Man Shakespeare . ''

		The chapters on the Drama naturally begin and end in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		The court as well as the popular drama leads up to his consummate accomplishment , for these embody in whole or in part the three influences which formed the drama , those of the classical drama and of the popular vernacular farce , and that of
Italy	LOCATION	and the spirit of romance .

		The plays of Shake - speare are each considered briefly and with reference chiefly to their literary qualities .

		Questions of structure and characterization are only touched upon ; more would not be possible in a volume of this character .

		The summaries and general criticisms at the close of the chapters are appreciative and scholarly .

		The theory that
Shakespeare	PERSON	in his latest plays , the romances , was seriously affected by the new Fletcherian tragi-comedy , '' and that this influ - ence worked to the detriment of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art , destroying especially the long lines of his characterization and reducing his art to the measure of the man he imitated , '' is disposed of by the vigorous protest against the `` discovery '' that '' Shakespeare was prematurely old and decaying in his genius at forty-five , careless in his art , and content to leave his throne to sit on the footstools of his younger contemporaries . ''

		The protest is too strong .

		For it is impossible to maintain , in the face of the numerous resem - blances adduced by Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	in the authoritative monograph on the subject , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's and
Fletcher	PERSON	's dramatic romances were wholly independent of each other .

		Either
Fletcher	PERSON	set a model for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or vice versa .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	prefers to group these last plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's with others like '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' '' Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' and '' Pericles , '' which do not belong to any special category of history , tragedy , or comedy , and to scout the idea that he could have imitated or adopted the dramatic ideas of a younger con - temporary .

		But
Shakespeare	PERSON	about this time and later was collaborating with
Fletcher	PERSON	in ''
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		and '' The Two Noble Kinsmen , '' and in these plays the tone is Fletcherian rather than Shakespearean .

		Shakespeare never hesitated to adopt a dramatic fashion , and it was wholly consistent with his past conduct that he should try his hand at what he saw was popular with the
London	LOCATION	audiences .

		The fact remains that the late romances are not so great as the trag - edies , and it makes very little difference in our judgment of the intrinsic worth of these plays whether we say their lower rating is due to 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's imitation of a younger contem - porary or not .

		They are not less good when viewed as under the influence of
Fletcher	PERSON	than when regarded as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's original crea - tion .

		No one says that they are not superior to
Fletcher	PERSON	's romances , or that the elder dramatist failed to improve upon the work of the younger .

		We might almost as well blame Shakespeare for adopting the revenge idea in `` Hamlet '' from
Kyd	PERSON	's play on the same subject as criticize him for transforming the idea in the Fletcherian romances into the wonder of '' The Tempest . ''

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's work on the Lyric we already know , and his chapters in this volume are marked by the same discrimination and appreciation that have made his two lyrical anthologies familiar to scholars everywhere .

		Particularly good is his treatment of
Donne	PERSON	, both as a corrective of a prevalent error about his relation to the so-called `` metaphysical school , '' and as a just estimate of the salient qualities of his poetry .

		By his illumination of what had hitherto appeared commonplace , he deserves
Jonson	PERSON	's eulogy , that he was '' the first poet in the world in some things . '' ''

		The golden
summer	DATE	'' of the lyric of
Herrick	PERSON	and his compeers we are shut out from by the limits of this volume ; but this lyric , which is more artistic and less spontaneous than the Shakespearean , may be omitted without causing too sharp a break in our survey of the poetic development of this period .

		In this and in other provinces of literary expression , the book preserves a proper unity of treatment .

		THE
STEPHENS PRISON DIARY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* If the term `` human document '' were not taking a well-earned furlough , it might be applied with peculiar fitness to the diary before us , penned by
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	, Vice - President of the
Southern Confederacy	LOCATION	, during his imprisonment at
Fort Warren	LOCATION	, in
Boston Harbor	LOCATION	, from
May	DATE	until
October , 1865	DATE	.

		There is no side of
Stephens	PERSON	's nature which does not find expression , and the reader feels in every paragraph the impression of absolute sincerity .

		From the historical standpoint , the volume is of great value for the light which it throws upon * RECOLLECTIONS OF

		the attitude of a large class of men who were ardent lovers of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and strongly opposed to the policy of secession , but whose political training made it inevitable that when once the die was cast they should go with their States and throw their energies into the cause of the Confederacy .

		In ability and character ,
Stephens	PERSON	stood easily at the head of this class of Southern statesmen ; and the motives and principles underlying his course are fully outlined in this Diary , especially in his copy of a long communi - cation to President
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	, accom - panying a request for amnesty , under the special provisions of the Proclamation of Amnesty and Pardon issued on the
29th of May , 1865	DATE	.

		As a man of highly cultivated tastes ,
Stephens	PERSON	's prison days were largely devoted to reading ; and we confess to a somewhat deeper interest in the books recorded than in the much talked about `` pig-skin library '' of a later date .

		Prescott 's `` Ferdinand and Isabella '' and '' Con - quest of
Mexico	LOCATION	'' were purchased out of the little stock of gold coin brought with him , and carefully read , as various comments and appli - cations to current problems prove .

		The high state of culture and liberty to which
Aragon	ORGANIZATION	had risen under an effectually decentralized system of government especially attracted his attention .

		A volume of the philosophical writ - ings of
Cicero	PERSON	led to a comparison of the moral tone of the Roman with that of
Paley	LOCATION	, whose title to a place in the senior year of every college curriculum was never questioned in
Stephens	PERSON	's time .

		The comparison is strongly in favor of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		Bacon 's Essays on the whole disappointed him , though he thought highly of the one on '' Friendship , '' which in his opinion '' embodies in a nutshell more true philosophy than all else I have seen upon this subject . ''

		Later , after a re-reading of Cicero 's '' De
Ami	PERSON	- citia , '' he says : '' This book is an almost fault - less production .

		Still , I believe
Bacon	PERSON	's essay says more .

		But Bacon by no means supersedes
Cicero	PERSON	.

		Bacon tears up the foundations of the philosophy , blasts the works from the quarries ; Cicero polishes these rough materials for use and ornament .

		Every young man should study
Bacon	LOCATION	on this subject ; then he should study
Cicero	PERSON	. ''

		Aristotle on Economics pleased him , but the '' Politics '' he considered of little value .

		Particularly ,
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's failure to consider slaves as entitled to any standing as an element of society is criticised .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Essays in Criticism '' was presented to him , and he read the chapters on
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, but with little sympathy . ''

		I have not
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 been able to satisfy myself as to this critic 's general object .

		It seems to me that it is not good , that his spirit is evil , that he conceals himself as well as he can and attempts to incul - cate his own views through the teachings of others . ''

		A volume of
F. W. Robertson	PERSON	's ser - mons was presented to him and read with high appreciation , as were certain volumes of
Sweden	LOCATION	- borg , in spite of his dissent in many particulars , and his conviction that
Swedenborg	PERSON	was some - what unbalanced in mind .

		Many hours were given to study of various books of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and many of his comments thereon are surpris - ingly '' liberal '' for a strongly religious Southern man of that period .

		The inclusion of the Song of Solomon with the other books of the Bible he could not comprehend .

		He raises no question as to
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	's authorship of the book , but fails entirely to find in it any evidence of allegorical intent . ''

		It seems only such love-songs as
Solomon	LOCATION	may be supposed to have indulged himself in writing . ''

		To interpret it as refer - ring to Christ or the Christian Church seemed to him '' not much short of impious . ''

		Burns and
Coleridge	PERSON	were read occasionally .


Tenny	PERSON	- son had never appealed to him until the effec - tive oral interpretation of a lady visitor revealed the beauty of Ms verse .

		In poor health , and troubled in mind over the failure of the authorities at
Washington	LOCATION	to pay any attention to his request for amnesty or parole , unable to get into communication with his family and friends at home ,
Stephens	PERSON	's prison days were gloomy enough , and without the company of his books he would probably have broken under the strain .

		Until the last few weeks of his imprisonment , his confinement was close , his quarters uncomfortable , and his food palatable only because he gave up the allotted rations altogether and supplied his table from other sources at his own expense .

		On
July 26	DATE	he records : '' Had a sort of row with bedbugs .

		Examined my bed to-day and found several . ''

		On
August 2	DATE	, '' Had another row with bedbugs ; discovered a good many , though small .

		To none did I give quarter . ''


August 11	DATE	, '' Got through with the biggest row I have yet had with bedbugs . ''

		And a week later , when commenting on the failure of a mouse which he had been feeding to come into sight , he adds : '' It may see from its hiding - place what I do with the chinches , and draw conclusions which prompt it to keep out of my power .

		I have often felt sorry for what I have to do to these blood-suckers .

		Most willingly would I turn them loose and let them go away if they would go and stay , but this they will not do . ''

		There are many personal comments in these pages which one would gladly quote if there were room .

		The most severe judgment of all , though thoroughly kindly in spirit , is that passed upon
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	.

		His opinion of the abilities of Grant was very high , and the comparative failure of Grant in the Presidency must have come as a great surprise to him .

		As most of the really level-headed leaders of the South , he came to have a very high regard for
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		Greeley also shares in his admira - tion , though his dissent from
Greeley	ORGANIZATION	's political principles led him to oppose the union of the Democrats with the Liberal Republicans in
1872	DATE	.

		There is no word of ill-tempered criticism for anybody .

		No kindlier and juster heart ever beat than that of
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	.


W. H. JOHNSON	PERSON	.

		THE EARLIEST LORDS OF THE OCEAX .

		* Ever since
Newton	PERSON	and Wood delighted the western world with their discoveries of the ruined glories of the
Mausoleum	LOCATION	and the temple of
Ephesian Artemis	ORGANIZATION	, the progress of Greek archaeology has been almost uninterrupted ; and its claims to the rank of an orderly and definite science are now universally recognized .

		Its splendid chapters have been written by
Schliemann	PERSON	and Dorpfeld , at Hios ,
Mycenae	LOCATION	, and Tiryns ; by the Germans at
Olympia	LOCATION	, the French at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, and the British and
Ameri	PERSON	- cans wherever they could get a chance to put in their spades ; and the annual reports of these various schools of classical study contain most comf orting assurance that new and substantial additions are yearly being made to our knowl - edge of the past .

		That a rich , if somewhat barbaric , civilization could be identified and confidently assigned to pre-Homeric times , is now generally accepted .

		`` Mycenaean '' was the name not altogether a satisfactory one given it ; and its dates were approximately placed at 15001000 B.C. With this as our furthest reach backward into the prehistoric past of Hellenic or pre-Hellenic races , we were perforce content until the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	; but since the year

Arthur Evans	PERSON	at Cnossus in
Crete	LOCATION	, together with other excavations at various Cretan sites , * THE SEA KINGS OF

		160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, have combined to make it evident that this ancient '' hundred-citied '' island was for cen - turies the home of a brilliant civilization , which antedates the Mycenaean age as much as the latter does the time of historic
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In honor of the most famous traditional Cretan worthy , this civilization has been called '' Minoan , '' and Dr.
Evans	PERSON	has proposed a chronological table dividing its life into three periods , known as Early ,
Middle	LOCATION	, and Late Minoan ; each period being subdivided into three divisions designated by Roman numerals .

		The whole stretch of time thus occupied ranges through two millen - nia , from
3000	DATE	B.C. to
1000	DATE	B.C. .

		A number of publications have described and sought to appraise the results of these Cretan excavations .

		Dr.
Evans	PERSON	himself has published full reports on his discoveries ; and books by
Ronald M. Burrows	PERSON	-LRB- '' The Dis - coveries in
Crete	LOCATION	'' -RRB- ,
A. Mosso	PERSON	-LRB- '' Palaces of
Crete	LOCATION	and their Builders '' -RRB- , and
Harriet Boyd Hawes	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Gournia	LOCATION	,
Vasiliki	LOCATION	, and other Prehis - toric Sites '' -RRB- , have served to maintain the public interest and increase the public knowledge .

		The latest work dealing with this subject is the Rev.
James Baikie	PERSON	's '' The Sea Kings of
Crete	LOCATION	, '' a handsome volume , well-printed and illustrated .

		The author writes with keen but tempered enthusiasm of the `` finds '' at Cnossus ,
Phsestus	LOCATION	, and
Hagia Triada	PERSON	, and what they seem to show .

		That the Minoan dynasties were sea-lords of the 2Egean and eastern
Mediter	PERSON	- ranean , he regards as fully established ; and the significant fact that the great palace structures were not fortified , as were those at
Mycenae	LOCATION	and Tiryns , only strengthens the conclusion that here we have to do with a power that depended on the '' wooden walls '' of its fleet for both aggression and defence .

		Sooner or later , of course , this floating bul - wark would fail ; and to some such crisis as this a sudden dash by pirates , or a concerted invasion by rivals who managed to out-sail and out-fight the Cretan fleet we are to refer the great catastrophe which destroyed the palace at Cnossus at the end of the period called
Middle Minoan II	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- about
1850	DATE	B.C. -RRB- .

		On the ruins of this first palace a second seems to have arisen , which in turn met its destruction at the close of the Late Minoan II .

		period -LRB- circa
1400	DATE	B.C. -RRB- .

		The temptation to construct history out of legend with the assistance of archaeological dis - coveries is always great :
Schliemann	PERSON	, as is well known , yielded to it , and was sure that he had found the corpora ipsa of the Agamemnon and Clytemnestra mentioned by Homer and the Greek tragic writers .

		Something of this con - fidence confronts us in the pages of Mr.
Baikie	PERSON	's book , as where he contends for a historic background to the terrible story of the human tribute paid by
Athens	LOCATION	to Minos of
Crete	LOCATION	, and of the slaying of the Minotaur by the Attic hero Theseus .

		His support for this position is derived largely from the frequency of bull - combats and the suggestion of bull-headed divinities on the various works of art found during the progress of the excavations .

		More conservative and acceptable is one of the concluding paragraphs of the book : '' No one now dreams of hesitating to accept the statements of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and Thucydides as to the great sea-empire of
Crete	LOCATION	.

		Whoever the Minos to whom they allude may have been whether he was actually a single great historical monarch who brought the glory of the Kingdom to its culmination , or whether the name was the title of a race of kings , is a matter of small moment .

		In either case the sea-power of
Minoan Crete	ORGANIZATION	was a reality which endured , not for one reign , but for many reigns ; and it is practically certain that , during a long period of history , the whole sea-borne trade of
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	was in the hands of these , the earliest lords of the ocean . ''

		The relations of
Crete	LOCATION	with
Greece	LOCATION	, the
Cyclades	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	, are discussed and illus - trated by parallelisms in pottery , sculpture , and metal-working ; and about thirty excellent half - tone plates show the principal architectural and artistic results of the various excavations .

		The book is written in an intelligent and entertain - ing style , which , added to the fascination of the subject , makes it as readable as any romance .

		THE MEMOIRS or HEESTE .

		* ''
Heinrich Heine	PERSON	's Memoirs , '' in two beauti - ful thin , though comprehensive , volumes , doubt - less give the best opportunity of meeting the poet face to face that has yet been offered in English .

		The title is confusing , for the term Memoiren was preempted by
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's small autobiographicaJ fragment first printed in
1884	DATE	.

		It was the idea of Karpeles to publish -LRB- in
1888	DATE	-RRB- an extended cento of fragments of
Heine	LOCATION	's let - ters , verse , and prose , arranged in chronological order , under the more admissible title , '' Auto - biographic . ''

		In the main the difficult English translations are spirited and idiomatic , and the metrical form of the lyrics is preserved , even though rhymes like `` daughter : about her , '' *

		THE DIAL 161 '' undoing : ruin , '' go to the verge of what may be permitted .

		It is necessary to add that the badness of the work in many other respects goes far beyond this limit .

		Karpeles ' plan , for which the translator is not responsible , is a horror to the professional scholar , and to the philologist an abomination .

		Without guidance of notes , a '' harmony '' is forced by methods more violent than those em - ployed by the most perverse theological zeal .


Karpeles	PERSON	' lack of method has made a sorry mess of it , enhanced -LRB- let it be stated without rancor -RRB- by a more than British indifference to minute accuracy on the part of the translator .

		Chapters , divisions , and titles are purely arbit - rary .

		It seems impossible that any editor could omit the lyric '' Ein Jiingling liebt ein M'dd - chen '' the very epitome of the most telling ex - perience of
Heine	LOCATION	's life , or '' A us alien Mdrchen winkt es , '' that sublimated quintessence of the cruel conflict between romanticism and reality .

		The poet 's saucy irrelevancies , his daring wit , even his word-plays , vulgarities , and blasphemies , are so much a part of himself that a
Heine	LOCATION	, with these completely purged away , would be no Heine at all .

		Omissions are often posited where none occur , while again and again sep - arate letters and lyrics are macerated into one undifferentiated substance , poems are mutilated with no indication , sentences torn limb from limb and grafted one upon another in a way that belittles Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's most heroic tales of operative surgery .

		Often a new paragraph is placed so as to be related only to the im - mediately preceding text , whereas it applies , in fact , to a section that has vanished without a trace .

		Because of its allusion to the '' Trag - edies '' -LRB- published 1823 -RRB- ,
Karpeles	PERSON	may be excused for including under the documents of
1823	DATE	a letter written on
June 7 , 1826	DATE	, but the bare-faced change of the date to ``
June 7 , 1823	DATE	'' is intolerable .

		Equally unpardonable is the crass stupidity shown in translation , and by no means limited to proper names .

		Liibtheen ap - pears as `` Liibthern , ''
Bovden	PERSON	as `` Booden , ''
Harburg	PERSON	as ''
Hamburg	LOCATION	, ''
Adolf Milliner	PERSON	is leveled to '' Miiller , '' the great surgeon
Dief	PERSON	- fenbach comes off with '' Dreffenbach , '' while the famous lexicographer Adelung suffers a sea-change from a living person into '' the bur - den of the aristocracy . ''

		Other examples of Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's art of translation are : biderbe , '' solemnly '' ; Oratorium , '' exhortation '' ; be - wegliche
Figur	PERSON	, '' mobile face '' ; ebenfalls , '' ever '' ; geheimnisvolle Wonne , '' sweet glee . ''

		Klagende Flamme , in the well-known stanzas in
Deutschland	LOCATION	, certainly does not mean '' flame of mourning , '' and so the long series sounds every note from the irritating inaccuracy of Er war von alien Menschen derjenige , den ich am meisten auf dieser Erde geliebt , `` Of all men he was the most beloved on this earth , '' to the inestimable climax of the repeated rendering of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's title Die Bdder von
Lucca	LOCATION	as '' The Bathers of
Lucca	LOCATION	. ''

		Into this fair book are also set such gems of English as '' This could however anyhow not suffice to-day , '' and `` almost by one half to destroy these notes . ''

		But none of these ineptitudes , nor even the disconcerting sum of them all , can offset the perennial allurement of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's baffling and elusive personality .

		Perhaps more than any other , he is the vibrant sensorium of an acutely susceptible consciousness which makes the mod - ern man of culture the recipient of a myriad of aesthetic impressions undiscovered in simpler ages .

		He caught quick glimpses of new truths , of shifted relations .

		He may , indeed , be consid - ered the first man of the future , and his life was rendered wretched chiefly by its rupture with the past .

		For pleasure or pain , all impressions reacted upon him from contrary poles : he thrilled to the majestic symbolism of the Catholic church , yet Christianity had never a more keen oppo - nent .

		He was awed by the mysterious sainthood of woman , and detested her as a cold-blooded serpent ; he was the soul of chivalry , while destitute of an elementary sense of honor ; his insatiable appetency for supreme culture proved not incompatible with a cynical vulgarity .

		No artist has more masterfully exploited the sim - plest poetical materials , even though we admit that his confession of a unique debt to
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	is just .

		Goethe rested in serene and severe Hellenism , whereas
Heine	PERSON	went forward , and his soul is still marching on , to modernism .

		The fascinating life-panorama of this intensely sentient being is unrolled upon these handsome pages , and every line tingles with interest to the modern combatant .

		The poetry of the future will hardly derive its spirit from the bemusing opiates of oriental or Celtic romanticism ; the sweet deceptions of the past will yield place to the clear actualities of scientific doctrine , and to the task of recon - ciling man to his own existence .

		Modern poetry will rest upon realism , not the discarded type which dwells upon the abnormal and the revolt - ing , but that which fixes its calm vision upon the dignities of life , and renders them more acces - sible to men .

		It will choose as its chief subject - matter not merely '' things as they are '' but to 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, quote a valued human document not yet fully superseded '' whatsoever things are true , what - soever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report . ''

		RECENT POETRY .

		* The fact that Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	is of the kin of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	has been noted by all readers of the two men 's novels .

		It is evidenced anew by the volume of poems , entitled '' Wild Fruit , '' that the former writer has now published .

		The title is well - chosen , for the poems have a wilding flavor that sets them far apart from the garden products of most versifiers .

		In this , they are suggestive of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's verses , as well as in their unconventional phrasing and their ironic tang .

		There is a fine sardonic humor in this song of '' The Owl and the Epitaph '' : '' The moon shone in the
midnight	TIME	sky As an old brown owl went gliding by .

		He lighted upon a churchyard tree , And shouted aloud right eerily ' Hoity-hoo-hoo , Toity-too-too , Hullabaloo !

		The graves are many , the mice are few . ' ''

		Beneath his perch there stood a stone Where a young , dead woman lay alone .

		The owl conned over her epitaph , Then , blinking his eyes , he began to laugh 4 Hoity-hoo-hoo , Toity-too-too , Hullabaloo !

		This was a fine damsel that once I knew .

		Dear

		Hoity-hoo-hoo , Toity-too-too , Hullabaloo !

		There 's a mouse on her grave ! '

		And down he flew . ''

		As an example of a sincere and purely serious lyric we may quote '' The Kisses '' : 44 Your gentle kiss fell light upon my lips As when a hovering
Vanessa	PERSON	sips One instant and away .

		Oh , blessed touch !

		How little then I guessed What seeds of aching grief and wild unrest Were sowed that
summer	DATE	day . ''

		But now the secret garden of my heart Can scarcely hold them ; every throbbing part Blooms with a mad desire .

		Oh , precious woman of the misty eyen , Would to dear God that futile kiss of mine Had planted such a fire . ''

		Yours carried life and flying seed of flame Until the very letters of your name Chime out a glorious song .

		Mine found no fruitful resting-place to ` dwell , But humbly sank to that sad haunt of hell Where sterile kisses throng . ''

		We must find space also for one of the fine sonnets of this poet , and there is no fitter example than this heartfelt tribute to the memory of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, a brother-poet : '' Children and lovers and the cloud-robed sea Shall mourn him first ; and then the mother-land , Weeping in silence by his empty hand And fallen sword , that flashed for Liberty .

		Song-bringer of a glad new minstrelsy , He came and found joy sleeping and swift fanned Old pagan fires , then snatched an altar brand And wrote , ' The fearless only shall be free ! '

		Oh , by the flame that made thine heart a home , By the wild surges of thy silver song , Seer before the sunrise , may there come Spirits of dawn to light this aching wrong Called Earth !

		Thou saw ` st them in the f oreglow ` roam ; But we still wait and watch , still thirst and long . ''

		This is a tempting volume to quote from , and we do not find it an easy one to lay aside .

		It reveals a poetical faculty , the plenitude of which we had hardly suspected from the stray pieces by Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	that had hitherto come to our attention .

		Perhaps we shall gradually come to think of him ,
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163 in the end , as we are gradually coming to think of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	as an artificer of more durable things in verse than in prose .

		Mr.
Cyril Scott	PERSON	, in '' The Voice of the Ancient , '' sings such strains as these : '' I lie in lenitive shades of cedar boughs , Replenishing richly my soul in Elysian fragrancy , Watching my dreams lullabying in roseate vagrancy , To zephyrs , that kiss with neetareous moisture my brows . ''

		The poem is styled ''
Supra Celestia	PERSON	, '' and is much too supercelestial for comprehension by the common mind .

		Sometimes , however , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's thought is more nearly accessible , as in '' The Awakening , '' with its imaginings concerning the experiences of the soul that has just passed through the gateway of death : '' Awake the soul is lifted from her conch of roses , Of myriad buds to earth unknown , Of colours more alive than ever earth discloses , Far richer , purer , paler , more full-blown . ''

		No sweetness can expound terrestial joy is sadness , All sleeping only wakes to strife ; But here each thought and sense unites in perfect gladness , And man perceives that life was never Life . ''

		Now was the gentlest moment time had ever moulded , Now as the soul unveiled her eyes , To find herself in countless virgin arms enfolded , Back from her sojourn in the vale of sighs . ''

		Mr.
James Elroy	PERSON	.

		Flecker is the author of '' Thirty-six Poems , '' the first of them being these wistful lines '' To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence '' : '' I who am dead a thousand years , And wrote this sweet archaic song , Send you my words for messengers The way I shall not pass along . ''

		I care not if you bridge the seas , Or ride secure the cruel sky , Or build consummate palaces Of metal or of masonry . ''

		But have you wine and music still , And statues and a bright-eyed love , And foolish thoughts of good and ill , And prayers to them who sit above ? ''

		How shall we conquer ?

		Like a wind That falls at eve our fancies blow , And old Ma * > nides the blind Said it three thousand years ago . ''

		O friend unseen , unborn , unknown , Student of our sweet English tongue , Read out my words at night , alone ; I was a poet , I was young . ''

		Since I can never see your face , And never shake you by the hand , I send my soul through time and space To greet you .

		You will understand . ''

		This is so encouraging an opening that it has tempted us to read the volume from beginning to end , and we have found each one of the remaining thirty-five poems marked by simple sincerity and something like distinction of phrasing .

		Death is a favorite theme with Mr.
Flecker	PERSON	, but it does not leave him merely moody ; rather does it move him to concrete and often striking imaginative expres - sion .

		This is noteworthy in such poems as '' The Town without a Market , '' ''
Felo de Se	PERSON	, '' and `` No Coward 's Song . ''

		An example brief enough for re production is '' Tenebris Interlucentem '' : '' A linnet who had lost her way Sang on a blackened bough in Hell , Till all the ghosts remembered well The trees , the wind , the golden day .

		* At last they knew that they had died When they heard music in that land , And someone there stole forth a hand To draw a brother to his side . ''

		In quite a different vein is the spirited '' War Song of the Saracens , '' of which these are the closing verses : '' A mart of destruction we made at
Jalula	LOCATION	where men were afraid , For death was a difficult trade , and the sword was a broker of doom ; And the spear was a desert physician who cured not a few of ambition , And drave not a few to perdition , with medicine bitter and strong : And the shield was a grief to the fool , and as bright as a desolate pool , And as straight as the rock of Stamboul when their cavalry thundered along ; For the coward was drowned with the brave when oui battle sheered up like a wave , And the dead to the desert we gave , and the glory to God in our song . '' ''

		The Masque of the Magi '' and the two miracles , ''
Joseph	PERSON	and Mary '' and '' A Miracle of Bethle - hem , '' are very simple things , but they have just the touch of na'ivetS needed in such imitative exercises .

		With these poems must be grouped the story of ``
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	. ''

		Why , asks the poet of the penitent , '' didst thou renounce thy scented pride ? '' ''

		She trembled , and her eyes grew dim : ' For love of Him , for love of Him / '' The contents of this unpretending volume are indeed treasure-trove .

		The author of '' Verses by V '' knows how to put his thoughts in a striking way , as these lines upon ''
Albert Diirer	PERSON	'' may witness : '' Had earth no flowers , and were no women fair In many-gabled
Nuremberg	ORGANIZATION	, the day Whei .

		Durer 's touch made ugliness seem rare , And gnarled strength worthier than lithe limbs at play ?

		Were his eyes blinded , when in beauty lay All dreaming
Italy	LOCATION	, in whose blue air He saw the southern faces , Art 's despair , And saw the antique statues ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	's display ?

		Yet on those eyes how many a May had risen !

		How oft had they beheld the beech unsheathing Her tassel-tufts , and from their winter prison Seen break the wood-flower and the wild-rose wreathing !

		Or had his vision of the Heaven so dazed him , That earthly loveliness no more amazed him ? ''

		The author can also be vigorous as well as striking , as his '' Bismarck '' poem attests : '' The earth runs lighter in her daily round : Bismarck is dead !

		Call him high names , and fill the streets with sound !

		And o'er his head Carve bronze and marble in a likeness grim !

		We laugh secure , for
Earth	LOCATION	has done with him .

		164 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, `` 0

		Whom Men deemed of yore Land of high dreams , the loveliness of home , Proud , peaceful poor .

		Who learned by haunted rivers tender moods , And thoughts unworldly in enchanted woods ! ''

		shake off the accursed spell !

		Forget the craft From Hell inspired and now returned to Hell !

		Once more let waft The breath of Heaven on thy distempered brow !


Germany	LOCATION	!

		Sister !

		Europe calls thee now ! ''

		When the author writes without those staccato effects , he achieves such simple distinction as the stanzas in `` A Great Soul '' exemplify : '' Brother , methinks if I could see The soul within your breast , ` Twould bear the likeness of a tree Upon a lonely crest , Where all the winds of heaven are free , And never all at rest . ''

		It standeth , as the mountain stands ,
Unshaken	LOCATION	, steadfast , strong ; It looketh down on all the lands ; ltd shade lies deep and long ; And all the soft-winged heavenly bands Fill it with sweetest song . ''

		Yet never hath it peace ; for , lo , No time is quite so still But that some little wind doth blow Some leaflet to its will .

		And yet it groweth and shall grow An ensign on the hill . ''

		Vs utterance is inclined to he a little thick , just escaping the quality of the purely lyric note , but he is frequently happy in his graver measures .

		This may be illustrated by quoting one of the briefer sections of his long poem in the '' In Memoriam '' stanza , entitled To the Unknown God '' : '' Awake , awake , and break the dream , man !

		and think of God no more As what in man ye might adore , The saintly walk , the moral scheme ! ''

		If strife ye see in all around , Seek Him in war no less than peace ; If death and sorrow never cease , The grave too must be holy ground 1 . ''

		Aye , I would even dare avow , Where man sees only human sin , That God himself may be therein Fulfilled oh , past our thinking how ! ''

		The poem called '' A Son of
Cain	PERSON	, '' which sup - plies the name for Mr.
Mackereth	PERSON	's volume , is not discovered until we reach the closing pages , al - though its merits entitle it to a place in the fore - front of the collection .

		It turns out to be a grim and powerful ballad on the model of '' The Ancient Mariner . '' ''

		I cursed her for her trickery wrought In hell and devil-crowned ; I tracked her foulsome , plotting thought From bound to bitter bound And cursed .

		He entered , and we fought We fought with little sound ... '' O'er Windal moor the day w ^ B sped .

		A fell-sheep ` gan to bleat .

		I saw that all the west was red ; Grey-still the village street .

		There was a tumult in my head ; A silence at my feet . ''

		I saw a fly beat on the pane .

		I saw a wreath of smoke Curl blue ` gainst evening cliffs , and gain The sky : no passion broke The calm of nature , that in pain Stared , stared and never spoke . ''

		God , it was so very still .

		The very thought was heard Moving about the brain ; the will Bent numbed ; the cold blood stirred Like memory after death : so still .

		Loud in that vivid void of ill A playful kitten purred . ''

		This ballad is clearly the work of a poet , as is also , in another mood , the long reflective ode on '' The Gods That Pass and Die Not , '' of which we quote the closing section : '' The gods depart , but thou ,
Earth	LOCATION	, art young , And constant to the Source of Now and Then ; To That which was and is thy psalm is sung , Mother of men .

		And all thy days are patient , and thy power Abideth though the beauteous gods depart , Mother , who still dost cherish at thy heart Thy child the thinker and the thoughtless flower ,
Mankind	LOCATION	fails not ; winds laugh , and woodlands blow Still , hope immortal fans abiding mirth ; Only the beckoning gods , far-summoned , go , And pass with poignant splendour from the earth . ''

		Another fine poem of this type is the '' Ode on the Passing of
Autumn	DATE	. ''

		Altogether Mr.
Mackereth	PERSON	's volume will well reward him who ventures into its pages .

		Mr.
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	, the author of '' The Town down the River '' is a parsimonious poet , but when he gives us dole of his riches , we know that the coin is no counterfeit .

		He is a reticent poet , but a few of his words will outweigh the fluent utterance of the more voluble .

		Witness these lines about Lincoln : '' For he , to whom we had applied Our shopman 's test of age and worth , Was elemental when he died , As he was ancient at his birth ; The saddest among kings of earth , Bowed with a galling crown , this man Met rancor with a cryptic mirth , Laconic and Olympian . ''

		The love , the grandeur , and the fame Are bounded by the world alone ; The calm , the smouldering , and the flame Of awful patience were his own : With him they are forever flown Past all our fond self-shadowings , Wherewith we cumber the Unknown As with inept , Icarian wings . ''

		Witness also these words of
Napoleon	PERSON	, half-delirious upon his death-bed at
St. Helena	LOCATION	: '' What ruinous tavern-shine Is this that lights me far from worlds and wars And women that were mine ?

		1911 . -RSB-

		What lowering outland hostelry is this For me the stars have disinherited ?

		An island , I have said : A peak , where fiery dreams and far desires Are rained on , like old fires : A vermin region by the stars abhorred , Where falls the flaming word By which I consecrate with nnsuccess An acreage of God 's forgetfulness , Left here above the foam and long ago Made right for my duress ; Where soon the sea .

		My foaming and long-elamoriiig enemy , Will have within the cryptic , old embrace Of her triumphant arms a memory . ''

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's attitude toward life in its conven - tional manifestations is bitter or contemptuous , his expression almost acrid , and yet his vision is trans - figured with gleams of idealism .

		The City of God may be as yet unbuilded , but somewhere possibly in this land of ours its foundations are being laid .

		Even so godless a spot as Broadway may prove to be its site . ''

		When in from
Delos	PERSON	came the gold That held the dream of

Euripides	LOCATION	, When men met Aristophanes , Who fledged them with immortal quills Here , where the time knew none of these , There were some islands and some hills . ''

		When

Maro	PERSON	into music ran Here there was neither blame nor praise For
Rome	LOCATION	, or for the Mantnan . '

		When
Avon	ORGANIZATION	, like a faery floor Lay freighted , for the eyes of One , With galleons laden long before By moonlit wharves in
Avalon Here	LOCATION	, where the white lights have begun To seethe a way for something fair , No prophet knew , from what was done , That there was triumph in the air . ''

		We may not chide for his too infrequent stage en - trances the poet who has grave and measured dis - course like this .

		There is hardly another American singer now left us who has equal right to say '' Mon verre n'est pas grand , mais je bois dans mon verre , '' and whose thought has such quintessential purity of distillation .

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	has heard the call of the East once more , as he tells us in so many words : '' I chafed at the gyves that bound under the western star , When over the welter of waves a clear voice called from afar .

		And I said ' I will seek once more the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	and the nen - uphar . ' ''

		So I strode to the long , low quays , and boarded a deep - decked bark And we plowed through the phosphor seas by the beacons of day and dark Till we raised the Gate of the
East	LOCATION	with the sweep of its harbor arc . ''

		The result of this outing is a volume of thirty lyrics , '' Chords of the Zither , '' the product of happy mus - ings under distant skies .

		We think particularly well of ' ^ Stars over
Egypt	LOCATION	'' : '' We are the orbs eternal , Lighting the outer void .

		Blossoms forever vernal , Aster and asteroid ;
Isis	ORGANIZATION	and
Osiris And Ammoii	LOCATION	, what are they ' ?

		They are as marsh fire is ; We are for aye and a day ! ''

		The Scrape um solemn , The Sphinx with brooding lid .

		Capital and column Pylon and pyramid ,
Memnon	ORGANIZATION	's silenced singing Under the dawning ray They are as swallows winging ; We are for aye and a day ! ''

		When ne'er a Pharos flaming Brightens the whelmed earth , When man shall have done with naming The creatures of mortal birth .

		When all the creeds have crumbled As crumbles the potter 's clay , We shall abide nnhumbled ; We are for aye and a day ! ''

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's little books of song come to us with tolerable frequency , and they are always welcome ; even more welcome than most of them is this col - lection , based upon an old inspiration renewed .

		The collection of '' Songs and Sonnets '' by Mr.
Webster Ford	PERSON	may be illustrated by the pair of roundels entitled '' Separated '' : '' I walked afield with your sweet soul -LRB- If heaven past joy could yield -RRB- And sought again the wooded knoll ; I walked afield .

		No longing ever yet was healed By autumn 's sunny dole , Nor eyes by a remembrance sealed .

		You seemed within the aureole Half seen and half concealed , That o'er the aching distance stole ; I walked afield .

		Your woman 's soul , its tender grief , Like autumn winds which toll Sweet odors from this flowering fief , Your woman 's soul Comes back , like music , to console With red bloom and gold leaf , Love 's restless nncontrol .

		For hearts that burn , a rapture brief That finds nor bourn nor goal Save in dream days and gathered sheaf ; Your woman 's soul . ''

		The plaintive strain of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's decorous but deeply-felt verse is very moving , and his graceful measures have a charm that is genuine and com - pelling .

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Dr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	is ene of our best sonnetteers a fact which we have had previous occasion to point out and his work is both rich in thought and wide in imaginative sweep .

		From among the sonnets which make up the greater part of his '' Lavender and Other Verse , '' the following particularly fine example may be chosen , its subject being Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	's ship `` GjOa , '' now the property of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and preserved in
Golden Gate Park	LOCATION	: '' At last I rest in peace where nevermore The waves shall whip my stout-resisting side ; Ignobly rest , and swell with bitter pride As casual eyes all lightly scan me o'er Me , that have dared the Arctic 's awful shore , And with the bold Norwegian as my guide Sailed the dread Pass to other keels denied Where we shall dwell with Fame forevermore Ah , it is pleasant here with birds and trees , With laughter-loving children , and the sea 's Keen winds that romp upon my orphaned deck ; Yet , mid this fatal peace at times I yearn To face again the dangers of a wreck ; To see once more the great
Aurora	LOCATION	burn . ''

		Many of Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	's sonnets are occasional , and few men have as happy a gift for paying this sort of tribute to a person or a celebration ; others are of an abstract or philosophical cast .

		One group gives the poet 's impressions of certain paintings by Mr.
Keith	PERSON	; another is concerned with literary person - alities , from Landor to
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	.

		We are also given , in the closing section of the volume , further examples of Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	's quality as a translator from the French , these pieces including Chantecler 's '' Hymn to the Sun , '' Hugo 's '' Ce qu'on entend sur la Montagne , '' and some of the best things of Be * ranger , Musset , and
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have long known Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	as one of the most accomplished and intellectual of our actors , sympathetic in the interpretation of the poetry of others , but we had not known him as a poet on his own account until '' Beauty 's Lady and Other Verses '' came into our hands .

		How gen - uine is his gift may be evidenced by this Rossettian sonnet : '' When dusk has spread his tent where Day had been And Nature 's altar lamps are trimmed anew , When from the folded wings of Strife , the dew Of tears repentant wipes the dust of Sin , In such an hour , shall she come calmly in And lay her lips on mine and kiss me ?

		Through That kiss shall I not wholly know the true Beatitude of Love , life prays to win ?

		Then all the tangled cords of troubled Care Shall fall from off my soul set free through her , Together we shall breathe the open air Of Truth , I too like her its worshipper ; Ah , God !

		must this not be ?

		but with quick breath Sharp on my mouth instead the kiss of Death ? ''

		The greater number of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's poems are in the sonnet-form , of which he displays consider - able mastery .

		As an example of what he can do in lighter measures , we quote this simple '' Song '' : '' Across the rainbow bridge of dreams My Lady went a-maying , And left me on the hither side Among the graves of hopes that died , And wild desires still baying The moon of borrowed pleasures ' gleams . ''

		Across the crystal stream of tears , My Lady 's voice is ringing , And through the dark aisles of my mind An echo answers , like a blind Canary sadly singing Remembrance of the sunlit years . ''

		Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	's vivid and pregnant verses may be illustrated by these two stanzas in `` The Unburied '' : '' In the wood the dead trees stand , Dead and living , hand to hand ,
Being Winter	ORGANIZATION	, who can tell Which is sick , and which is well ?

		Standing upright , day by day Sullenly their hearts decay Till a wise wind lays them low ,
Prostrate	LOCATION	, empty , then we know . ''

		So thro ' forests of the street , Men stand dead upon their feet , Corpses without epitaph ; God withholds his wind of wrath , So we greet them , and they smile , Dead and doomed a weary while , Only sometimes thro ' their eyes We can see the worm that plies . ''

		In this new volume , called `` Herbs and Apples , '' the author again proves herself a true poet , of the sort that we could ill spare , although we could spare without a pang the figures which here serve as illustrations . ''

		^ Egean Echoes and Other Verses '' is a collec - tion of refined and thoughtful poems by Mrs.
Helen Coale	PERSON	Crew .

		As the title indicates , Mrs.
Crew	PERSON	's inspiration has been drawn chiefly from a study of the classics , and , rightly considered , the production of such a small volume as this constitutes a more convincing defence of classical studies than many stout volumes of prosy argument .

		For here is concrete evidence that the spirit of Hellas still exists as a shaping and vitalizing power in the modern world .

		`` By their fruits ye shall know them '' is , after all , the most trustworthy of peda - gogical tests .

		We quote a part of the poem called '' Sappho to Phaon '' : '' Beloved , wait not for the sun to set , But come thou while his level glances fill The green world with a flood of mystic light ; And only Hesperus of all the stars , Dares hang a lamp within the golden glow .

		Slow wanes the day , slow slips the ebbing tide Upon the shingly reaches of the shore ; And all my heart is drawing thine to me .

		Nay , come at noontide , when the shimmering heat Wilts all the tender blossoms on their stems ; And under willows , in the grateful shade , Pan and his happy brood dream happily .

		High in the air the hawk hangs motionless ; The dragonfly above the placid pool Spreads filmy wings upon the quiet air .

		The bee sleeps in the bosom of the rose , But I await thy coining eagerly . ''

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 167 The ideals of the sensuous and the austere are strikingly contrasted in `` The Penitent '' : ''
Leofric	PERSON	, monk , bends him above his books .

		In the Scriptorium ; flushed his eager face , Gleaming his eye , the while his pen doth trace In clearest script the lines whereon he looks .

		With beating heart , upon the vellum there He copies from an ancient , musty tome A burning page vivid with pagan
Rome Catullus	PERSON	, singing to his
Lesbia	PERSON	fair .

		Vivamus ,
Lesbia	PERSON	mea , atqne amemns !

		Da mi basia mille .

		deinde centum ,
Dein	PERSON	mille altera , dein secunda centum ! ' '

		* Leofric , monk , kneeleth in silent prayer Upon the cold stones of the chapel floor Before the altar ; mutely he doth adore The pallid Christ hanging before him there .

		Deep lie the shadows on his sunken cheek ; Heavy the sins upon his low-bowed head ; Worn are the beads whereon his prayers are said ; Trembling his lips with words his soul would speak . '

		Rex tremendae majestatis Qui salvandos salvas gratis , Sal va me , f ons pictatis ! ' ''

		One more selection this time an exquisite per - sonal tribute shall be given . ''

		Thou '' is the simple title of the three stanzas : '' Lord God would write an epic , and the world , New-moulded from the void , rolled into space , And with heaven 's glittering myriads took its place .

		Sapphired with oceans and with sands empearled . ''

		Lord God would write an elegy .

		Swift grew
Great Babylon	LOCATION	and
Memphis	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	; Only to perish under dust and loam Of centuries , ` neath heaven 's relentless blue .

		Then the Lord God , not wholly satisfied .

		Where the dawn glowed and trembled , dipped his pen And wrote a lyric .

		Ah !

		and then and then Thou grave and tender , smiling , starry-eyed ! ''

		Mrs.
Garrison	PERSON	's new volume , `` The Earth Cry .

		and Other Poems , '' exhibits much refinement of thought and subtlety of emotional coloring , but does not reveal a very distinctive individuality .

		Its best things are apt to remind us of better things by other poets , as '' The Annunciation '' does : '' God whispered and a silence fell ; the world Poised one expectant moment like a soul Who sees at
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's threshold the unfurled White wings of cherubim , the sea impearled , And pauses , dazed , to comprehend the whole ; Only across all space God 's whisper came And burned about her heart like some white flame . ''

		Then suddenly a bird 's note thrilled the peace .

		And earth again jarred noisily to life , With a great murmur as of many seas .

		But
Mary	PERSON	sat with hands clasped on her knees , And lifted eyes with all amazement rife , And in her heart the rapture of the
Spring Upon	ORGANIZATION	its first sweet day of blossoming . ''

		Neat little magazine pieces of the better class , deal - ing with familiar themes and symbols , these poems charm for the moment , but hardly impress them - selves upon the memory .

		Something similar must be said of the u Lips of Music , '' by
Miss Charlotte Porter	PERSON	, and '' Earth 's Artists '' shall be taken to illustrate the judgment '' A
Painter Autumn	ORGANIZATION	is , whose brush Shows earth 's hot heart in each cool rush , Each bush flames underfoot , each tree A tossing torch flares high and free ,
Eaph	LOCATION	plant would all a flower be . ''

		A
Sculptor Winter	ORGANIZATION	is his hand With icy chisel carves the land ; He bares earth 's pureness to the light , His keen strokes shape with rigor right The sudden goddess , hushed and white . '

		Earth listens : her Musician ,
Spring	ORGANIZATION	,
Afar	LOCATION	, and timid , thrills his string : The goddess melts , a girl descends ; Those stars her eyes , on his she bends , And deathless hope his luting lends .

		But when the girl a woman turns , Within her soul all music burns ; Her Poet ,
Summer	DATE	, sings the word Her spirit had but inly heard , And life to know Life 's joy is stirred . ''

		Miss
Porter	PERSON	has studied in the best schools of taste , as her textual work in editing the master-poets makes sufficiently evident , and she is entitled to have her own fling .

		Her pieces are mostly lyrical , and we do not mean it as dispraise when we say that she seems to have mastered the rhetoric of the lyric rather than to have caught the secret of its magic .

		Many of her songs have , indeed , been written for a musical setting . ''

		The Desert Queen , '' which means the giant cactus of the southwestern desert , suggests to Miss
Sharlot M. Hall	PERSON	the following stanzas : '' I was
Zenobia	PERSON	in the olden time And ruled the desert from
Palmyra	LOCATION	's walls ; I flung my challenge to imperial
Rome	LOCATION	So far that still across the years it calls In proud defiance but my halls are dust ; The jackal suns him at the temple door ; The wind-blown sands hide street and corridor And heap the palace floor . ''

		Forgotten is Aurelian and his might ; Above his grave the beggar children smile ; And I , who swayed the East in other days , Am mistress now of many a Western mile ; Crowned with a coronal of snowy flowers , And armed and guarded with a thousand spears , I dream while dim mirages recreate In shimmering light the splendor of past years .

		v This is as typical a short piece as we can find in Miss Hall 's '' Cactus and Pine , '' but it represents her inadequately , for her real quality is to be sought in the swinging rhythms of her long poems .

		In her work the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	finds a voice its legends , its romantic history , its natural beauty , and its free outdoor life .

		She has a large and vivid imagina - tion , which she nevertheless does not permit to lose itself in abstractions , and her blend of realism with song offers a refreshing contrast to the work of the magazine poets who spin their verse from their inner consciousness .

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		An impressive record of a people s Progress of i .

		i T > t - the French achievement is given by Professor Republic .

		j .

		Bracq in ''
France	LOCATION	under the Republic '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is the most per - tinent answer to the familiar question whether or not the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	is stable , or is to share the fate of its short-lived predecessors ; for what chance have pretenders with a population which every year is finding new expressions of its industrial , intellect - ual , and moral energy ?

		Such a record accounts for the increasing weakness of the monarchist groups .

		The financial strength of
France	LOCATION	is always a surprise to the uninitiated who have listened to so many tales of returning travellers about the degeneracy of the French .

		Professor
Bracq	PERSON	notes that the gold re - serve of the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	has risen in thirty years from 604,000,000 francs to 3,052,000,000 .

		A quiet but significant display of this financial power calmed the warlike inclinations of the Ger - mans at the time of the
Morocco	LOCATION	affair .

		Its source is industry , commerce , and thrift ; and so with the increase of the gold reserve goes the fact that the clearing-house transactions in
Paris	LOCATION	have mul - tiplied thirteen fold .

		If these were all the signs of progress , one might infer that the bourgeoisie of the Republic had been acting on the advice which
Louis Philippe	PERSON	is said to have given to the bourgeois of
1830	DATE	, `` Enrich yourselves . ''

		Professor
Bracq	PERSON	shows the other side in his chapters on '' Education in the New Life , '' '' Social Reform , '' and kindred topics .

		His enlightening chapter on '' Religious Doubt - Religion '' encourages the conclusion that although there is a large number of '' intellectuals '' who are entirely out of sympathy with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	and with Christianity , the prospects of both Catholicism and Protestantism were never brighter .

		The separation of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	has simplified the situation .

		The last third of the volume is devoted to the religious crisis , including the controversy over the
Church	ORGANIZATION	schools , the religious orders , and the Law of
Separa	LOCATION	- tion .

		Upon such matters exact and impartial state - ments are difficult to make .

		The author seems to be taking refuge in verbal distinctions when he says , apropos of the Revolution and Church property , '' The charges about confiscation of property , as a whole , are untrue . ''

		An equally questionable state - ment denies any reference in the Concordat to the payment of salaries as a compensation for the loss of property .

		There is also a tendency apparent in the discussion to ignore the difference between the Concordat and the Organic Articles .

		But these are historical matters , and Professor
Bracq	PERSON	's opinions upon them do not mar the otherwise fair tone of his treatment of his subject .

		The evolution Somewhat misleading as to title is of styles in the book called '' How to Know architecture .

		Architecture '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Frank E. Wallis	PERSON	,
A. A. I. A.	PERSON	; although a sub-title , '' The Human Elements in the Evolution of Styles , '' describes its contents more accurately .

		The pub - lishers ' advertisement asserts that '' after you have read this book you can , on looking at a building , say to what style and what period it belongs '' ; and the author himself says toward the close , '' A little further study will differentiate for you the English revival , and the Italian revival , the Philadelphian Georgian and the Georgian of
Boston	LOCATION	or of Annap - olis . ''

		But we can not grant that either of these assertions is justified .

		Beginners -LRB- to whom the book is evidently addressed -RRB- have not sufficient data for such differentiations , nor has the author pro- vided them .

		He is not exact enough ; his definitions are too few , and those he gives are not always ac - curate entasis , for instance , is defined as the tapering of a Greek column .

		By its failure to offer sufficient and accurate technical explanation , it falls far below such a book as
Stratham	LOCATION	's `` Archi - tecture for General Readers , '' in which the psychol - ogy of architecture is interwoven with a working knowledge of construction and general details .

		But as a study of the Evolution of Styles it is readable and suggestive .

		The underlying principle -LRB- or the `` axiom , '' as it is called by the author -RRB- is this : '' Architectural style development follows trade under the inspiration of political and religious conflict and progress , and to know architecture is to know the fundamental human or national ideal - ism . ''

		This development is traced through four principal periods : Pagan , Christian , Intellectual .

		Modern , the latter including the '' industrial feudalism '' of
America	LOCATION	to-day .

		Architecture is provided with a new and unique opening in the '' interesting partnership between the industrial overlord and his retainers .

		The overlord requires libraries , institutions of learning , banks , and palaces , and we have them .

		On the other hand , we have a domestic architecture of the highest degree of ex - cellence , a new expression which is not only com - fortable and fit but beautiful and supremely con - vincing . ''

		The author has brought together a large amount of material , and has treated it in a suggestive though not always entirely relevant way .

		There are one hundred and seventeen illustrations ; the page decorations for the subject-divisions and the initials for the chapter-beginnings , both designed by the author , are appropriate as well as beautiful .

		Mr.
R. L. Gales	PERSON	, a keen-eyed observer Rural essays J and other with a good memory and a lively sense disquisitions .

Arcady	LOCATION	, and Other Essays from a Country Parsonage '' -LRB-
Herbert & Daniel	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The writer 's cloth excites expectation of grace and learning in his wit and humor ; nor is expectation disappointed .

		The mellowness of ma - ture years , also , and the charity that comes with a considerable knowledge of the world , speak in his pages .

		An American reader can not but marvel at the stunted intelligence and narrow outlook of the average rural dweller in
England	LOCATION	, as depicted in
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE 169 Mr.
Gales	PERSON	's pages .

		In the matter of figures , five hundred would seem to be the highest number even dimly conceivable by his simple-minded parishioners , and their notions of geography are so ludicrously vague that we have one person referring to
Rome	LOCATION	as `` in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and another speaking of Manchester as in the south of
England	LOCATION	.

		Pathetic , too , as well as amusing is their eager but unintelligent interest in the lives of `` the quality . ''

		This hunger for a more abounding life they seek to feed with such sensational reports from the great world as are sup - plied by the
Sunday	DATE	newspapers , for which the au - thor has an unexpected good word to say . ''

		After all , '' he feels compelled to admit , `` they are the Greek tragedies , the
Strauss	PERSON	operas , of the poor .

		Here for them is the ' pity and terror , ' the sense of destiny and awfulness , which an intellectual elite finds in antique choruses .

		Some of the Greek plays are almost insupportably dreadful , the mythological stories are in themselves , as a matter of fact , often repulsive and grotesque , but there is always a re - deeming sense of largeness , and this the poor find amid the horrors of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper . ''

		It may well be that these plodding rustics are mentally too heavy and dull to be either much hurt or much helped by anything they might read .

		In addition to these
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	studies from real life , the book contains a number of chapters on '' Folk-Lore and Tradition , '' and on '' Speech and Language , '' while a final half-dozen are grouped together as '' Discussions and Digressions . ''

		Of books as well as human nature the author shows himself to be a diligent student .

Harz	LOCATION	in
Heine	LOCATION	's Footprints of Heine '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- footprint * .

		fa an ingratiating , if slight , perform - ance , deriving native charm from being written on the spot by one who has absorbed some of the real spirit of the Harzreise .

		With the convenient help of the railway , which was not available to his pre - decessor , and omitting -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- the ascent of the Ilsenstein , the author repeated most of the memorable foot-tour of
1824	DATE	.

		Although not notable in style , the book gives back the free and generous joy of the open road : '' I drank in the balmy pine - laden air : it was a kind of spiritual second wind '' and the breezy book itself may well serve a similar tonic purpose to overwrought and distracted readers .

		The author is susceptible in various directions , and falls in with more liberal spoils in the way of living folk-lore and delicately-attuned German ladies than most pedestrians in those parts are like to en - counter .

		So generous is he in sharing these prizes , that they have a suggestion of premeditated and not altogether pertinent embellishment .

		The pungent Harz-atmosphere scarcely needs this conscious spic - ing .

		The legend of the partridges -LRB- p. 78 -RRB- reads like a retelling of Die Kraniche des Ibykus , a myth-making popular redaction of
Schiller	PERSON	's poetry for which there are convincing parallels .

		The spell - ing wavers between English and German usage , with occasional forms that belong nowhere .

		`` A man bearing the pastoral name of
Blumenbach	LOCATION	'' is a tame designation for the immortal founder of the science of anthropology , and is no sort of a pre - paration at all for the crushing shock caused by the startling apparition of
Walther	PERSON	von der Vogelweide '' emerging from a gabled house humming a tune of the Meistersinger . ''

		The full-page illustrations by Mr.
Walter King	PERSON	Stone are most satisfactory impres - sions of the region , and reflect not a little of its per - ennial charm .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the third re-issue of this memorable work since its first ap - pearance in
1888	DATE	, and is so considerably revised and enlarged as to constitute almost a new work , though the ground-plan remains much the same and certain chapters have called for but little modifica - tion .

		In the two hundred additional pages of the present edition are contained four new chapters of importance , one on our transmarine possessions , another on the vast influx of immigrants from cen - tral and southern
Europe	LOCATION	, still another on the more recent aspects of the negro question in the South , and , finally , a consideration of the notable develop - ment in late years of American universities .

		In the subsidiary matter prefixed and appended there are some omissions and some additions .

		The con - stitution of
California	LOCATION	has been reduced to a one - page extract , and the constitution of
Oklahoma	LOCATION	has been added , to the extent of twenty-three pages of fine print .

		The handy table of '' Area , Population , and Dates of Admission of the States '' has been omitted , as has also '' The Federal System of En - glish Universities , '' doubtless to avoid swelling the volumes to unmanageable size .

		The author 's hopes for our future have by no means given place to despair since he first essayed , with optimistic pen , to portray our public institutions and our social life . ''

		It was with some anxiety , '' he confesses , '' that I entered on this revision , fearing lest the hopeful spirit with which my observations of American institutions from
1870	DATE	to
1894	DATE	had inspired me might be damped by a close examination of their more recent phases .

		But all I have seen and heard during the last few years makes me more hopeful for the future of popular government .

		The forces working for good seem stronger to-day than they have been for the last three generations . ''

		This work from the hand of a foreigner becomes , in its enlarged form , more emphatically than ever the most noteworthy treatise on our political and social system .

		_ A - ott the f '' An English - itieofErin man in

		Journey in a Canoe by
River	LOCATION	,
Lough	PERSON	, and Canal '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
R. A. Scott	PERSON	-
James	PERSON	, strikes the note of this opening season as follows : '' There comes a time early in the
spring	DATE	when the decrepitude of years or the precocity of youth is wont to fall from you .

		On that real first day of 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the year you suffer reincarnation , and feel that your opportunity in life , as the lay preachers express it , hegins again : that you have another chance to he the superman , your dislike for whom has always been tempered by a reserve of envy . ''

		Yielding to the vernal impulse , the author , with a congenial companion , secured a canoe , studied well the map of
Ireland	LOCATION	and the course of the river
Shannon	PERSON	, with its connecting water-ways , and then proceeded to tour the island , from
Belfast	LOCATION	on the northeast to
Limerick	LOCATION	on the southwest , in the manner indicated in the title .

		Descriptions and reflections and bits of dialogue diversify the chronicle of this leisurely journey .

		Of the typical Irishman the writer ob - serves : '' Perfectly he fulfils the maxim ' Take not thought for the morrow ' ; and because he does not take thought he is poor , but in his poverty he is provided with more that the heart needs , with more that makes for happiness , than we with all our prac - tical but inhuman industrialism can achieve . ''

		A map and illustrations from photographs help the reader to a more vivid participation in this pleasant Irish jaunt .

America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we in

		have a very instructive and readable account of certain aspects of municipal administra - tion in six of our largest urban communities .

		The author has already rendered valuable service in pre - vious discussions , and this study goes more deeply into the essence of the struggle between the repre - sentatives of individual interest and public welfare .

		The criticism of abuses is not cynical but distinctly patriotic , the message of those who believe the American people need only the light of truth to call forth earnest effort and sane action .

		No citizen can read this work without setting his teeth for a new attack on mercenary control of the colossal ma - chinery of city government .

		The facts are brought up to date , and the reader can connect the daily news with the story of the development of the institutions which thus far represent the sorriest defects of uni - versal suffrage .

GEORGE B. CUTTEN	PERSON	, President of

		As the curative effect of mind over matter is more systematically practised now than ever before since the rise of modern science , this is a timely book of extraordinary and curious interest .

		Dr.
Cutten	PERSON	gives the history of this movement a history far longer and of a more numerous ancestry , as appears from the author 's picturesque and fascinating record of relics , talismen , amulets , charms , and healers , than most people think as practised both independent of and associated with religion .

''

		It contains a love story so moving that its equal can not often be found anywhere .

		Besides its intense interest merely as a story filled with scenes and incidents of great reality and with fascinating characters skillfully portrayed , it has this further significance : With no direct comment , with absolute impartiality , it presents and analyzes the British Aristocracy at a moment when certain legislation seems likely to change radically that great , definite , historical class .

		`` Any ne_w book by
Hugo de Vries	ORGANIZATION	is bound to be read with interest , not only because of the part which the author has played in giving us the mutation theory , but also because it may help to settle some other more doubtful points in that theory .

		In
1868	DATE	Darwin himself wrote to
J. D. Hooker	PERSON	: ' I feel sure if
Pangenesis	PERSON	is now still-born , it will , thank God !

		at some future time reappear , begotten by some other father and christened by some other name . '

		Had
Charles Darwin	PERSON	lived , he would have seen how successfully Hugo de Vries revealed the great truth contained in his well-abused Hypothesis of Pangenesis .

		Although it can never be absolutely demonstrated as true , the formulation of the hypothesis of intra - cellular pangenesis marks the beginning of the greatest and most important forward step made in the study of the origin of species since
1849	DATE	.

		Indeed , it led up directly to the conception of mutation as one method of the origin of species , and resulted in permanently removing the entire question of organic evolution from the realm of ineffective speculation and establishing it upon the firm basis of experimentation .

		The importance of the hypothesis is admirably set forth by Prof.
Gager	PERSON	in his excellent preface in citing
Strasburger	PERSON	's paper on Typisclte und allotypisclie
Kerntheilunfi	PERSON	, a paper which shows how the hypothesis of intracellular pangenesis may assist in forming some comprehensible picture of the mechan - ism of matter in the living state '' Scientific A merican . ''

		Though it attracted little attention at the time of its appearance , an honorable place in the history of our science must be accorded to the '' paper published by De Vries -LRB-
1889	DATE	-RRB- under the title Intracellular Pangenesis .

		This essay is remark - able as a clear foreshadowing of that conception of unit-characters which was destined to play so large a part in the development of genetics . ''

		... .235
FRIEDRICH SPIELHA	PERSON	GEN. There ^ was a period which may be roughly designated as that of the seventies when the American public was engaged in a series of interesting discoveries in foreign literary parts .

		This spirit of enterprise had been sporadically manifested long before
1870	DATE	, and did not by any means subside with the close of the decade , but it was perhaps most evident during the time in question .

		It was a phenomenon coincident with the disappearance of many of the great English-speaking writers -LRB- especially novelists -RRB- who had shaped our ideals during the genera - tion just preceding , and with a decline in the powers of those still remaining to us .

		It seemed to be the instinctive expression of the feeling that we had sucked our own orange nearly dry , and that we needed new sources of refreshment .

		Considerably earlier than the seventies , of course , the curious
New England	LOCATION	mind had occasionally fared abroad , and returned with treasure-trove from
Germany	LOCATION	, or
France	LOCATION	, or
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It may have been '' Hesperus , '' or '' Consuelo , '' or `` I
Promessi Sposi	PERSON	'' there was nothing very systematic in the quest ; but whatever it was , transcendentalists and farmers and school-teachers pounced upon it , and ex - tracted from it some sort of nutriment .

		Ideas were much astir in those
New England	LOCATION	days , and a new supply was welcome from any quarter .

		It was well before the seventies that we had discovered George Sand and
Dumas	PERSON	and Hugo -LRB- `` Les Miserables '' is indissolubly associated , not by a wretched jest alone , with our memories of the Civil War -RRB- , but it was not until the middle eighties that Balzac became more than a name to English readers .

		The idyllic side of Bjbrnson and the impeccable artistry of Tour - guenieff became our cherished possessions in the seventies , but it was not until the following decade that we found our way to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and learned that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	had written such books as ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	'' and '' War and Peace . ''

		Meanwhile , many of our most interesting dis - coveries were being made in the field of German fiction .

		We had hardly known that there were such things as German novels , aside from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Jean Paul	PERSON	, and now we found out that there were a great many of them , and some exceed - ingly good .

		Particularly , we made the acquaint - ance of
Auerbach	LOCATION	and
Freytag	PERSON	and Spielhagen 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, and
Heyse	PERSON	, and were plunged deep into the dis - cussion of '' Auf die Hohe '' and '' Soil und Haben '' and '' Problematische Naturen '' and '' Kinder der Welt . ''

		They were books that stirred the stagnant waters and opened new avenues to the imagination .

		They were books , moreover , that embodied in their several ways definite idealisms , and thus supplied an element that seemed to be singularly lacking in our rather opportunist fiction in English .

		Were these books as good as we once thought them , when they made their appeal to the gen - erous impulses of youth , and seemed to bear just the message for which the spirit craved ?

		Prob - ably not , since few people think them worth reading nowadays , and the water that then flowed under the bridges has long since been merged with the sea .

		But with some men of middle age here and there they remain as ineffaceable memories , just now powerfully evoked from the slumbering past by the news of
Spielhagen	ORGANIZATION	's death on the twenty-fourth of
February	DATE	, at the exact age of eighty-two .

		We are inclined to hold him , despite certain obvious limitations , as good a novelist as
Germany	LOCATION	has ever nurtured .

		This does not mean that he is of the rank of
Scott	PERSON	and Hugo , or of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	, for it has not been given to the German genius to produce such men , but it does mean that he will have a high and lasting place among those who made prose fiction the distinctive literary form of the nineteenth century .

		He was possessed of creative power , intellectual grasp , and aesthetic intuition in remarkable degree , and the fine balance of his faculties , as displayed in the works written be - tween
1860	DATE	and
1880	DATE	, offers an object worthy of our sincere admiration .

		If our modern generation has lost the power to be moved by those works of
Spielhagen	ORGANIZATION	's middle period , it is by so much the poorer , and the loss is hardly to be offset by gains in other directions .


Friedrich Spielhagen	PERSON	's fourscore years span - ned the period between
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's age and our own .

		He was born
February 24 , 1829	DATE	, at
Magdeburg	LOCATION	, in the heart of
Saxony	LOCATION	, but his impressionable boyhood time was largely spent on the Pomeranian coast , and this Baltic land - scape is often pictured in his novels .

		After leaving the university , he became a teacher , but soon drifted into journalism .

		After some years in
Leipzig	LOCATION	and
Hannover	LOCATION	, he removed to
Berlin	LOCATION	in the early sixties , and thereafter made the capital city his home .

		He was not quite thirty when he published ''
Klara Vere	PERSON	'' and '' Auf der Dime '' the novelettes which began the long series of his works of fiction .

		His first great novel , ''
Problematische Naturen	PERSON	, '' ap - peared in
1861	DATE	, and ''
Durch Nacht	PERSON	zum Licht , '' its sequel , in the following year .

		Be - fore the sixties were over , he had placed to his account three other novels of the first magni - tude , '' Die von
Hohenstein	PERSON	, '' '' Hammer und Amboss , '' and `` In Reih und Glied . ''

		It is by this group of works that he became known to English readers in the seventies , although we do not recall that an English translation of the last-named novel ever saw the light .

		They gave us unforgettable pictures of the life of
Young Germany	LOCATION	its moods and its struggling aspira - tions during the years when it was still under the spell of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and was seeking to apply his wisdom to the rapidly changing conditions of modern life .

		This was the time of revolu - tion , focussed in the great year of Forty-eight , and it found in
Spielhagen	LOCATION	one of its chief spiritual interpreters .

		His sympathies were with the people , and the arrogance of the aristocracy was depicted with bitter severity in '' Die von
Hohenstein	PERSON	. ''

		The hero of '' Problematische Naturen '' and its sequel was a youth of the people who nevertheless dared to be a man , and his figure became endeared to all romantic hearts .

		The hero of `` In Reih und Glied '' is thought to have had the young Lassalle for a prototype .

		The message of `` Hammer und Amboss , '' on the other hand , was social rather than political ; here was a powerful preachment of the gospel of work alone efficacious in healing the diseased mind , alone helpful in the struggle for genuine freedom . ''

		Nur die Arbeit kann uns frei machen . ''

		How the words rang in the ears of the generation that heard them , how wholesome and authentic was the message they conveyed !

		It will be seen from what has just been said -LRB- if there be any who need to have it indicated -RRB- that
Spielhagen	PERSON	was no mere dabbler in words , no writer who stood aloof in aesthetic indiffer - ence from the spectacle of life , but a thinker and a man of convictions , so little afraid of didacticism that he sometimes carried it too far , so strong in his feelings that he could not be wholly objective in his portrayal of the world about him .

		Ideas were things to be championed , as well as expressed , and he re - mained semi-militant to the end of his long career , passing in review the successive develop - ments of political and social life , as the world of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, into which he had been born , passed by gradual transformations into the world of
Bismarck	LOCATION	.

		Upon this succession of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 dissolving views he was a sharp commentator , as the long series of his later novels testifies .

		They were not , for the most part , as good as the earlier ones , although the old fires of indig - nation once more flamed up with the old force in '' Sturmflut '' -LRB- 1877 -RRB- , a merciless study of the spiritual deterioration that followed upon the victory of Sedan and the payment of the French milliards .

		We recall with peculiar affection ''
Allzeit Voran	PERSON	, '' the novel that had the war with
France	LOCATION	for its theme ; '' Was die
Schwalbe	PERSON	Sang , '' one of the briefer and earlier tales , and ''
Quisisana	LOCATION	, '' ' that tender and beautiful story in which sentiment and description , style and characterization , are almost perfectly blended into an artistic whole .

		Besides his fiction ,
Spielhagen	PERSON	was responsible for much journal - istic writing of the higher sort , for a fair amount of verse , for noteworthy contributions to the literature of aesthetics , for a book of travels and two or three plays , and for numer - ous translations , including American examples from
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Curtis	PERSON	, and some of our poets .

		His death has broken one of the last links that have held us until recently to the German past ; the only link of comparable strength now re - maining is the life of the octogenarian Paul He ` yse , just one year the junior of the writer whose death we now mourn .

		WANTED : A HANDBOOK OF CRITICISM .

		There is needed a handbook of criticism , a primer which in small space will give some account of the various aesthetic activities of mankind , relate them to each other , and make an effort to arrive at a statement of their absolute and relative impor - tance .

		Probably no two critics in the world would agree on all the points included in such a work , but it ought to be possible to give a sketch of the battle - ground of opinion and indicate the position of the various forces .

		I therefore venture to suggest the following scheme for such a work .

		I should divide the book into three parts the first entitled '' The Clash of Criticism '' ; the second , '' The Whole Matter '' ; the third , `` The Great Exem - plars . ''

		I should begin with some remarks about the uncertainties of criticism : the blunders of great men about themselves and their contempo - raries ; the changes of taste from age to age .

		Then the eternal questions of art would come in .

		Is Pleasure the only purpose of art ?

		Is Beauty its only means ?

		What is the didactic claim the part of morals in art ?

		Is the idea , the conception , the important thing ?

		Is the execution , the expression , the sole matter to be considered ?

		Are artists poets , or reporters ?

		that is , do they weave their web out of their own brains , or do they merely work on materials furnished by nature ?

		These , with a brief resumt of the opinions of the great critics of all times , from Aristotle down , would fill out the first part of the book .

		The most wide-sweeping , all-embracing method by which man makes himself known is literature .

		Literature is really everything that is expressed in words ; the divisions , however , being : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The
Basic Group Religion	ORGANIZATION	, Philosophy , Science , His - tory , Politics , and Law ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- The
Central Group	ORGANIZATION	the Epic , the Drama , the Lyric , the Novel , the Ballad , and the Short Story ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- The Subsidiary Group the Didactic Poem , the Satire , the Fable , the Essay , Letter - Writing , and Conversation .

		There are prob - ably minor forms in each group , but these would do as headings .

		I am unable to draw the line that separates the first group from pure literature .

		In all of the components that go to form this
Basic Group	ORGANIZATION	, imagination , reason , the thoughts and passions of men , are exhibited .

		All of them use language as their medium , and all of them may be irradiated by wit , poetry , felicitous expression .

		They melt into each other and into creative literature .

		Religion and philosophy are works of art themselves , and the parents of other works .

		Science has its con - ceptions which thrill and enthrall .

		History is the poems and dramas of the actual .

		Law is the codi - fication of the customs , manners , and opinions of mankind .

		Politics is law in making , as law is past politics .

		The mental effort of men which goes into these kinds of work far surpasses in quantity that which goes into pure literature .

		There is probably more written and printed about politics in a single year than is included in all the books of the world .

		And religion and law have an output nearly as great - The claim that this group serves truth may , I think , be set aside .

		Its components change and alter and prevaricate too much .

		There is often more truth in a fairy-tale than in a piece of history .

		The one solid distinction between this and the next group is utility .

		All the efforts of religion , metaphysic , science , politics , law , and those of history mainly , are for a purpose .

		The end of the second group is play .

		It components are disinterested .

		Whatever their practical influence is and undoubtedly they sway and sweep men here and there almost as much as the others do it is all by the way , and not con - sidered or intended in their making .

		In the third group we get back to the idea of use though of use mixed with entertainment .

		The central group really exhibits only three forms ; for the novel , the ballad , and the short story are bantlings of the epic .

		The drama has numerous varieties , and the lyric as many .

		The epic is a tale told ; the drama , an action exhibited ; the lyric , an emotion or thought projected .

		In the subsidiary group it may seem strange to include conversation to say that we do not merely , like
M. Jonrdain	PERSON	, talk prose , but that we talk liter - 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, ature .

		But conversation is really the great sea from which all the clouds and fountains of literature arise .

		It can be a love-song , an epigram , a drama , or a tale .

		And of course there are great books made up of actual conversations
Boswell	PERSON	's
Johnson	PERSON	,
Ecker	PERSON	- mann 's Goethe ,
Coleridge 's Table Talk	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		Architecture is the earliest and perhaps most necessary of the arts .

		Man may have made him - self a bower of woven boughs , or sought shelter in a cave , before he could talk .

		It does not seem pos - sible that we shall ever get beyond the two final elements of architecture the beam and the arch .

		The day of the arch seems over at present , with the aspiring , indefinite , infinite emotions which it sym - bolized .

		In
America	LOCATION	, at least , we are going back to the architecture of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		But there is a Spanish or Moorish influence at work which counts .

		And the new material of reinforced cement , by its plasticity and the readiness with which it lends itself to decoration , seems destined to evolve a new school of architecture .

		Sculpture , in its great efforts , is based on the human form .

		It is therefore an exotic in cold climates , where people huddle themselves up in clothes , and where not only mock modesty is alarmed , but there is a real sense of discomfort , of goose-flesh , at the sight of a nude statue .

		Yet even the races that succeeded best in sculpture did not habitually go unclothed .

		The nude is a con - vention and must be accepted as such , like the conventions in the other arts : the line in pictures , there are no lines in nature ; verse in literature , people never talk in rhymed and measured words ; the heaped up and pressed down conventions of the stage .

		And anyhow there is no reason why the human head , `` and features , the great soul 's ap - parent seat , '' should not be reproduced in bronze or marble .

		If we would only set up pedestalled portrait busts , of natural or colossal size , instead of the awful effigies in frock-coats and trousers which we perpetrate in public places , there would be a great gain for our sense of beauty and solemnity .

		The most interesting warfare in the arts is on to-day in painting .

		The latest French landscape school has discovered or revived one new thing , and is trying to make that thing seem the sum and total of art .

		It is hardly probable that they will push the masters of the past from their thrones , but what is good in their discovery will be assimilated and have a place with other methods and purposes in painting .

		Apart from this , there is the eternal question of the subject in pictures .

		Of course , as in every art , expression is the first desideratum .

		Unless an artist has command of his medium , unless he can paint , write , sing , it is useless for him to try to body forth thought , emotion , or passion .

		But this gift granted , it would seem that the more he - expresses the greater he must be .

		The theories of the modern art-extremists lead directly to still-life painting .

		If nothing is of any value in pictures but the vibration of light , the juxtaposition of colors , textures , and things of that kind , what is the use of going beyond a basket of fruit or a bunch of flowers ?

		The Arabs did with less than this .

		Their religion forbade them to imitate nature or human - ity , and they had to content themselves with com - binations of lines and colors .

		And they developed schemes of decoration that outdo anything that European art can show .

		Few oil paintings could stand the competition of a Persian rug or an
India	LOCATION	shawl .

		But are we to forgo the intellectualized art of the Christian world for this kind of work ?

		If '' The Last
Supper	DATE	, '' the '' Sacred and Profane Love , '' the '' Night Watch , '' the '' Lances , '' and thou - sands of other pictures that tell stories or express emotions and thoughts , are merely illustrations , then Illustration is a great art , fully equal to Decoration .

		Post-Impressionism seems to be the painting of sug - gestion , rather than of reality of any kind .

		In music , too , chaos is stirring ; but whether with creation or not , it is too soon to say .

		The effort is to make music a definite language , to create a sort of musical Volapuk .

		It is possibly within the scope of human ingenuity to assign to each thought or act of man a certain sound which would be its symbol as words are ; but the prospect of having to learn this seems an appalling one .

		Of the lesser arts , clothing and furniture come nearest to man and influence him most profoundly .

		We bow to a suit of clothes more often than we do to a man .

		But modern female dress , being amenable to no law or reason , is beyond criticism , as modern male dress , in its uniformity of ugliness , is beneath it .

		It may be that the hideous habilaments forced upon men to-day are part of a subtle feminine plan for his subjugation .

		I remember once reading to a woman that description in
Scott	LOCATION	's ``
Kenilworth	LOCATION	'' of Leicester in his court dress . ''

		Why , '' she said , '' if a handsome man dressed like that were to come into this room , I would get right down under the table . ''

		Furniture has hardly less power over our thoughts and feelings .

		Human beings on an average spend three-fourths of their time within walls , and the furniture and decorations of their rooms must dye their brains and souls .

		Ugly or unpleasant objects out of doors have no such power to hurt .

		Nature takes them into her power , the sun redeems them , and as a rule we only notice them temporarily .

		But to sit day after day in a room with uncouth or squalid surroundings must decivilize .

		An ounce of example is worth a pound of preach - ing .

		After the dry theories of the preceding sec - tions of the projected book , I would gladden my readers ' minds and eyes with concrete models .

		In literature I would give as many citations , in prose and verse , as might be needed to exemplify the various kinds of style at their best .

		And I would give an analysis of the greater figures of fiction .

		In the other arts I would give a few reproductions of the very finest works though music , being so recondite and esoteric in its visible form , might have to be excluded .

		Such , I think , would be a pretty useful book .

		THE DIAL 203 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NATIONAL LIBRAKY FOB
CANADA	LOCATION	has long been felt to be needed , and the need has recently been cogently urged in a carefully prepared and apparently unanswerable argument for its early establishment , from the pen of Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	, of the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Ottawa	LOCATION	.

		`` A Plea for a
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' reprinted from the
February	DATE	number of `` The University Magazine , '' opens with a statement of the manifest deficiencies of the
Library of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, proceeds to show that every country comparable in population and im - portance with
Canada	LOCATION	has its adequately equipped national library , and closes with a recommendation that a worthy building for library purposes be erected on the site of the present
Printing Bureau	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	itself to be provided for elsewhere -RRB- and to this building there be transferred , as a nucleus for the desired
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, all books in the present Parliamentary Library that are not of a legislative character .

		The possibility , however , is considered of following the model of our own library at
Washington	LOCATION	and uniting the legislative reference with the more generally useful collection .

		But this , Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	observes , '' is a rare combina - tion ; one that only the genius of the present
Libra	PERSON	- rian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has made practicable ; and one the ultimate wisdom of which is open to question .

		In most countries the practice is to maintain a national library and a legislative library as separate and quite distinct institutions , each devoted to its own peculiar functions . ''

		With such unimportant coun - tries as
Costa Rica	LOCATION	and
Honduras	LOCATION	rejoicing in na - tional libraries of their own , it is no wonder that
Canada	LOCATION	, vast territorially and increasing rapidly in population , should be regarded as in a shameful position with no worthy institution of the sort .

		That its dependent political status is partly answer - able for this , seems more than probable .

		HOW OUR COPYRIGHT LAWS IMPRESS AN OUT - SIDER can be pretty accurately surmised by any one gifted with moderate intelligence and a little imagi - nation .

		Nevertheless an occasional reminder of the ridiculous figure we are cutting in the world of letters by reason of our absurd interpretation of the rights of literary property may serve to give a salutary sting to our sense of shame , and finally to arouse us to the pitch of amendment .

		`` The Author '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , noting its receipt from the Con - gressional Library of a communication to the effect that on the
8th day of December	DATE	there was issued by President
Taft	PERSON	a proclamation under which
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are entitled to reciprocal benefits under the American and German copyright laws , goes on to say : '' It is to be hoped that with the extension of these reciprocal rights the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will see their way finally to join the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	, and deliver themselves from the shackles which make them at present the laughing-stock of civilized nations as far as copyright is concerned . ''

		The same writer , referring to the late copyright agreement adopted by the
Pan-American Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Buenos Aires	PERSON	, continues : '' If the Pan -
American Union	ORGANIZATION	can be completed , with the participation of the
United States	LOCATION	, the next and indeed final step should be * the consolidation of the
International Copyright Union	ORGANIZATION	in one body of world-wide rela - tionship , like the
Universal Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		On the whole , the civilized world , and we with it , however sluggishly , are moving toward better things in this matter of copyright legislation ; but the distinction of covering the rear instead of leading the van in this march , is not enviable .

		THE ADVENT OF `` MARIE-CLAIRE , '' in English dress , is heralded as nothing short of a literary event , even as its original appearance in French was hailed with enthusiasm by the book-world of

Marie-Claire	ORGANIZATION	's by no means thrilling experiences ; but if the highest form of art is that which conceals art , even though the concealment be instinctive ,
Mile	LOCATION	.

		Audoux must be called an artist .

		Autobiography , touched with the kindling glow of imagination and penetrated with insight , seems to form the substance of ``

Arnold Bennett	PERSON	renders a like service upon the book 's publication in
England	LOCATION	and

		A RECORD OF RECRIMINATION fills a number of pages of Part II .

		of the Fifth Annual Report of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first part is devoted to the business of the year , the granting of pensions , the placing of additional universities and colleges on the '' accept - ed '' list , the publications of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , and the second and more interesting part to the inter - relations of colleges and secondary schools , and the general character of the training our students re - ceive , with comments -LRB- largely adverse -RRB- from busi - ness men and from the Oxford tutors who have 204 THE DIAJL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, been questioned by President
Pritchett	PERSON	on the edu - cational equipment and the intellectual ability of our Rhodes scholars .

		A decided lack of harmonious cooperation between fitting schools and the colleges appears to exist , and neither party shows any eager - ness to shoulder the blame .

		On the contrary , some frankly uncomplimentary things are said by high - school teachers concerning college professors and their aims and methods , and vice versa .

		Then the outsider is called upon for testimony , and he says , '' A plague o ' both your houses ! ''

		In other words , the business man , with a need for young helpers of energy , sagacity , initiative , and persistence , fails to find that either our secondary schools or our colleges impart to their students the qualities he most desires .

		The Oxford authorities praise the American stu - dent 's natural ability , but criticize his previous training , his superficiality , and his disinclination to concentrate his attention and grind away unre - mittingly at an appointed task .

		Some suggestions toward remedying the existing defects in our school and college system are made by the President in closing this part of his report .

		Part III .

		is devoted to brief biographies of recently deceased benefici - aries of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and the Treasurer 's annual statement follows ... A LIBRARIAN , POET , AND HUMORIST , a lover of his kind and a philosopher with much shrewd insight into the homely realities of every-day life ,
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	, who died at his home in
Somer	PERSON	- ville ,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
Feb. 26	DATE	, in the fifty-third year of his age , had won the hearts of his community and also had made a place for himself in the affection of the larger world that read his volumes of verse or listened to his own public readings of his poems .

		Born of poor parents on a
New Hampshire	LOCATION	farm , and forced to work his way through school and college , he had acquired a grit and energy that stood him in good stead when at the age of twenty - five he , with a friend , revived the

		The Yankee Blade , '' of
Boston	LOCATION	, was his next journalistic enterprise , and the fame of that sprightly publication became little short of national .

		Editorial work on the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Globe '' followed in
1894	DATE	, and thenceforward Mr.
Foss	PERSON	devoted much of his spare time to the preparation of the poems that were to be his best-remembered contributions to literature . ''

		Back Country Poems '' was published in
1894	DATE	, `` Whiffs from Wild Mea - dows '' in the following year , '' Dreams in Home - spun '' in
1897	DATE	, `` Songs of War and Peace '' in
1898	DATE	, and '' Songs of the Average Man '' in
1907	DATE	.

		Mr.
Foss	PERSON	became librarian of the
Somerville Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in
1898	DATE	, and was chosen president of the
Massachusetts Library Club	ORGANIZATION	in
1904	DATE	.

		There was something of Poor
Richard	PERSON	's homely wisdom and a touch of
Holmes	ORGANIZATION	's flashing wit in this philosopher - poet , who at the same time was always and un - mistakably
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	.

		THE MORBID SENSITIVENESS OF SOME NOVEL - READERS almost passes belief .

		The monomaniacal musician who a few weeks ago murdered
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, because the violinist chose to fancy himself portrayed in unbecoming guise in one of the novelist 's characters , furnishes a conspicuous in - stance of this touchiness .

		Recent reports from
London	LOCATION	tell of an actor 's suit for damages against a fiction-writer because a certain personage in a serial story chanced to bear the very name -LRB- in full -RRB- of the sensitive actor .

		The writer 's sworn assevera - tion of previous ignorance of the actor 's existence was not received by the court in mitigation of the offense , and damages were awarded .

		The editor of the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' recalls in this con - nection the similar surprising experience of Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	in the troublesome uprising of an actual and indignant Mrs.
Ebbsmith	PERSON	soon after '' The Notorious Mrs.
Ebbsmith	PERSON	'' had appeared on the stage .

		As a matter of fact '' Mrs.
Ebbsmith	PERSON	'' was explained as a sort of inverted imitation of the name of a certain Mr.
Flood Jones	PERSON	.

		All the world has heard of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's fictitious colonel of wonderful name who disconcertingly presented himself in the flesh to embarass the innocent author and prove that truth is at least as strange as fiction .

		Though the novelist take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of his imagination , in quest of impossible names , yet is there no assurance that he has transcended the limits of actual nomenclature .

		THE LIMITED EDITION has its place in the world of books .

		It appeals to the lover of things rich and rare and withheld from the ordinary mortal , and sometimes wholesomely ministers to the aesthetic sense even though it may occasionally also feed the self-complacency of the purse-proud .

		The relation of the limited edition to the public library is another matter .

		The library 's book-fund is a trust fund , commonly collected from the pockets of the people , and to be spent for the best good of the people .

		In the lately-published '' Proceedings of the
Second Annual Meeting of the Pacific Northwest Library Association	ORGANIZATION	'' occurs this passage from the address of one of the speakers : '' Limited editions have no place in a library 's economy and should be shunned altogether unless picked up cheaply as remainders or at second-hand .

		... If the buyers of these limited sets follow the book market , do they not become discouraged when , after a few years , they find these rare sets thrown on the market as re - mainders at from one-fifth to one-tenth the price they paid ?

		Yet the next time they again fall vic - tims . ''

		Only a work of real merit , unprocurable in a cheaper form and not likely to be soon reprinted , should be bought in a limited edition by the public library .

		Of course the host of de luxe humbugs in book form , which batten on the illiterate rich , should be shunned with contempt and loathing by private purchasers and libraries alike .

		THE DIAL 205 Two NEW ACADEMICIANS have been elected to the French Academy .

		They are
M. Henry Roujon	ORGANIZATION	and
M. Denys Cochin	PERSON	, concerning both of whom flattering reports are now in circulation .

		Born in the early fifties , they have both had time to make reputations for themselves .

		That of
M. Roujon	PERSON	rests chiefly on his volumes of '' chroniques '' or short essays -LRB- '' En
Marge du Temps	PERSON	, '' '' Au Milieu des Hommes , '' `` Dames d'Autrefois , '' etc. -RRB- , and on his connection with the Academie des Beaux - Arts , whose permanent secretary he became seven years ago .

		His style as a writer is blithe and brilliant , with a touch and go peculiarly French .

		M.
Cochin	LOCATION	appears to be rather more solid and serious in his make-up .

		First and foremost he is a Catholic , we are told , and after that he is a statesman , an orator , a scientist , an art > lover , and a collector of fine paint - ings .

		As long ago as
1893	DATE	, after twelve years of municipal service , he was elected to the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	, where his speeches have become famous for their combined simplicity , clearness , precision , and sober elegance of style , all touched with the fervor of intense conviction .

		Besides his mastery of religious questions , he is an authority on foreign relations , and he plays no unimportant r6le in French parliamentary proceedings .

		THE `` OKCHARD HOUSE '' AT
CONCORD	LOCATION	, where the
Alcott	PERSON	family once lived , and where `` Little Women '' was written , is standing to-day , in general appearance much as of old , but deserted and subject to the ravages of time .

		The
Woman 's Club of Concord	ORGANIZATION	is now interested in the preservation of the historic dwelling , which can be bought , with suffi - cient land adjoining , for
eight thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		Some further amount would doubtless be required for repairing and maintaining the building as an Alcott memorial .

		Its present aspect , with windows boarded up , doors closed , and the dilapidation of an unhonored old age beginning to make its melancholy appearance , is saddening to the
summer	DATE	tourist and pathetic to all who cherish in fond remembrance the name , the history , and the achievements of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	and -LRB- more especially -RRB- his gifted daughter .

		In the closing words of a public announcement signed by the officers of the above-mentioned asso - ciation , '' the
Concord Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	appeals to all lovers of
Miss Alcott	LOCATION	to help by contributions , large or small . ''

		COUNT APPOXTI AND KOSSUTH are naturally thought of together at this time , when the former is visiting our country and addressing enthusiastic listeners from the same Faneuil Hall platform where , nearly fifty-nine years ago the great Hungarian patriot well remembered by our fathers and grand - fathers , if not by us , spoke for the cause of freedom amid such plaudits and cheers as had scarcely ever before been heard in that cradle of liberty .

		An agreeable reminder of that triumphal progress of
Kossuth	ORGANIZATION	's through the
North Atlantic States	LOCATION	may still be seen in many large public libraries , and in not a few private ones , in the shape of a handsome volume published by
John P. Jewett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	for the benefit of the Hungarian cause , and entitled '' Kossuth in
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		Of course this is but one of the many publications attesting the popular interest in the Hungarian hero .

		The handy little biographie ^ of the man issued at that time to gratify a very general and not unpraiseworthy curiosity are now nothing but literary lumber , but they serve as evidence that hero-worship in
America	LOCATION	was then of a fervor seldom or never equalled since .

		* THE HUMANITIES IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	lost prestige to a considerable extent some years ago when the higher education of the country underwent a reform in favor of science studies .

		But now there are en - couraging signs of a turn of the tide once more toward the neglected classics of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	itself .

		Among recent advocates of this re - form appears the review '' Les Marges '' -LRB- edited by
M. Eugene Montfort	PERSON	-RRB- in a petition to the Min - ister of Public Instruction .

		The petition , to which signatures are being solicited , calls attention to the decrease of general culture noted by observers whose opinion carries weight , and goes on to say that '' convinced , like them , that there is an intimate con - nection between the study of the ancient languages and the persistence of the French genius , we have the honor of calling your benevolent attention to the necessity of a revision of the curricula of secon - dary education elaborated in
1902	DATE	, which have well-nigh abolished the study of Latin in the lyce `` es and have also diminished deplorably the study of French . ''

		... THE CARLYXE HOUSE AT
ECCLEFECHAN	LOCATION	, where
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	was born , has been bought , says a
London	LOCATION	literary correspondent , by a
London	LOCATION	syndi - cate , and is to be preserved as a
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	memorial .

		The humble cottage has had a succession of tenants since it first became an object of interest to the literary world , and it has been visited by hundreds of tourists , notably American tourists , in
Dumfries	LOCATION	- shire .

		Henceforth the sight-seer may have to pay a small admission fee , which will make him value more highly the privilege of inspecting the birth - place of the greatest of Victorian men of letters .

		But that a ' * syndicate '' -LRB- ominous name -RRB- should turn to commercial account the hero-worshipper 's eagerness to render this act of homage , seems not exactly in harmony with the fitness of things .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A WORD FOR ACROBATIC ART .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The editorial on '' Stage Children '' in your issue of
March 1	DATE	was sane and pointed , and so of course I agree with its conclusions and commend its spirits .

		One sentence , however , which was clearly interjected , as it bears little relation to the rest of the argument , serves as 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, an excuse for this communication .

		The editor disparages '' a law which places trapez tricks and Shakespearean fairies under the same ban . ''

		And so , indeed , would I , though not as he would seem to .

		I take it that , as quoted above , '' trapeze tricks '' stands for the practice of the art of acrobatics and '' Shakespearean fairies '' stands for the practice of the histrionic art , and I for one should dislike to see subjected to the operation of the same laws or rules of criticism an art in the expres - sion of which the mind of the practitioner is of neces - sity swayed and controlled by the very essence of rhyth - mic beauty to the exclusion of all else , and an art in the exercise of which , even in its highest flights , the thoughts of the practitioner may be far away in realms fair or foul , while in present word and gesture he reaches the consummation of his art .

		I say this to disparage no art ; but consider , please , if it has no moral bearing .

		There is in the art of the acrobat not one sensation inducing to impurity in thought or act , not one ideal that is not lofty .

		One has no need to censor this work to determine if it be detrimental to the morals of the child actor or to the adult player or to the susceptible audi - ence .

		As to the danger to life and limb , any active boy between six and sixteen years of age takes more chances and runs greater risks of getting hurt that does the child acrobat .

		Restraint should be placed upon foolhardy acts as upon immoral plays , but not for the same reason .

		A fracture of a youthful limb , though not to be courted , is more easily healed and sooner for - gotten than is the open sore which evil impressions leave upon the youthful mind .

		The life of the acrobat must necessarily be one of self-restraint ; the child of the acrobat is reared with his father and mother and as they were , and the gaities of life do not lure him .

		His work is glorified play to him , and it is not tainted with selfishness or vanity .

		I have some conception of the meaning of the art of the actor and of the art of the acrobat .

		I have dabbled a bit in each since my earliest youth , and have studied their bearings and their rela - tions to the other arts .

		They are corollaries of the great rhythmic art of architecture to which I have given the service of my life , and it is from my standpoint of student and practitioner that I speak .

		Please , Mr. Editor , do not disparage the purest and loftiest and most abstract of the arts of rhythmic motion or lightly place it under the ban .

		WORDS AND THEIR WAYS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is wonderful how one can go on reading for years '' with the spirit and with the understanding also '' and without knowing the exact meaning of every word .

		I am one of those for whom '' misled '' was for years a word of mystery .

		I had a vague feeling that it meant a conglomeration of evil things , for I had read of a misled person , in my early days , who seemed to answer to this description .

		When at last I looked it up in the dictionary , I was wiser , it is true ; but I lost a word which had been more '' blessed '' to me than ''
Mesopo	PERSON	- tamia . ''

		No other word has ever had quite the same thought or content for me as the one whose meaning I so long misunderstood .

		LIGHT ON
BROWNING	PERSON	'S PERSONALITY .

		* It does not always happen that those who have known a man in the '' dreary intercourse of daily life '' are the ones who truly know him best .

		The circumstances that shape a man 's conduct , direct his thinking , determine his utter - ances , are often obscure to his neighbors .

		A view in perspective is sometimes better than one at close range .

		When
Robert Browning	PERSON	died , twenty-one years ago , it seems to have been assumed that his personal friend , Mrs.
Sutherland Orr	PERSON	, would be his most competent biographer .

		Accord - ingly , much material was placed in her hands , and in a little over a year her book was pub - lished .

		It was a storehouse of valuable data , for which we were then and must always be duly grateful .

		But , as was noted by the present reviewer -LRB- THE DIAL , 1891 -RRB- , Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	failed signally to show
Browning	PERSON	amid the currents of thought of his time , to reveal how he influenced them and was influenced by them .

		This , to the poet 's lovers , seemed to omit a very vital char - acteristic of his writing .

		Another cause of dis - appointment in Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	's work was her failure to trace the connection between the poet 's life and the poet 's work .

		Hers was a cold piece of biographical writing , and it left the reader cold .

		Since then , many able and eloquent pens such asthoseof
Symons	PERSON	,
Herford	LOCATION	,
Dowden	PERSON	, etc. have given us illuminating and sympathetic studies of
Browning	PERSON	; but these have been interpreta - tions and criticisms , rather than biographies .

		Without much attempt to collate new sources of information , they have accepted the data at hand as sufficient .

		But the lapse of twenty years has brought to light many new and original sources to which Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	had no access notably the two vol - umes of '' Letters of
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
Eliza	PERSON	- beth
Barrett Browning	PERSON	'' ; Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's two volumes of Letters , collected by Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	; ''
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
Alfred Domett	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	; besides four volumes of the poet 's letters to various persons privately printed by Mr.
Wise	PERSON	, and the unpublished diary of
Browning	PERSON	's earliest and closest friend ,
Alfred	PERSON	* THB LIFE OF
ROBERT BROWNING	PERSON	.

		With Notices of his Writings , his Family , and his Friends .

Harry Christopher Minchin	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 207 Domett , better known as '' Waring '' or '' the friend over the sea . ''

		These new materials , together with the re - collections of many of
Browning	PERSON	's surviving friends , were in the hands of Professor
W. Hall Griffin	PERSON	, who had in view the writing of a more complete and definitive life of
Browning	PERSON	than had yet appeared .

		For many years the poet 's writings had been a principal subject of Pro- fessor
Griffin	PERSON	's thought and study .

		Moreover , he had been at great pains to identify the sites of
Browning	PERSON	's early homes in
South London	LOCATION	; thence he had followed him to Asolo and to
Florence	LOCATION	, and had gone on pilgrimage to num - erous cities and regions that had been the poet 's home in
summer	DATE	wanderings or in winter sojourns .

		At many of the lesser known places such as La Saisiaz ,
Arezzo	LOCATION	, Asolo he made charming photographs .

		But when the work was little more than half finished , Professor
Griffin	PERSON	died , and his manu - script and notes were transferred to other hands .

		The book , as we have it now , is com - pleted and edited by Mr.
Harry Christopher Minchin	PERSON	, who offers it '' not as a study of the life of
Robert Browning	PERSON	seen through a tempera - ment , but a record based upon a sympathetic review and interpretation of accepted facts . ''

		In the main , it may be said , this intention has been well carried out : we do get a clearer conception of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's character and bearing than before ; some of the old misapprehensions are removed ; there is not a little of fresh re - velation concerning the poems , in their origin , growth , and reception by the public .

		Partic - ularly delightful is it to make a closer acquaint - ance with the Caniberwell household that united , harmonious , and intellectual family of four persons , where
Robert Browning	PERSON	grew up , an only son .

		A knowledge of the early home-life is partic - ularly essential in
Browning	PERSON	's case , since there , to all intents and purposes , he acquired his whole literary education .

		His school-life counts for very little ; of college drill he had practically none ; but he read continually and voraciously in the library of six thousand volumes in his own home a library collected by
Robert Browning	PERSON	senior , nominally a business man , but with '' the scent of a hound and the snap of a bull-dog '' for any old or rare volume .

		No wonder that with such an encyclopaedic father , and with unlimited browsing among such books , the poet acquired a very pronounced liking for out-of-the-way learning and out-of-the-way peo - ple ,
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	,
Sordello	PERSON	, a Roman murder case of the year
1698	DATE	, to say nothing of u Parley - ings '' with a lot of dead-and-gone and always little-known worthy gentlemen .

		To account for the '' supremely passionate nature '' with which he credits himself , we must look further back than this serene household , to the first of the three
Robert Brownings	PERSON	, the irascible grandfather .

		For the boy 's artistic nature , the means of self - education also lay close at hand .

		Dulwich was only two miles away , and the
Dulwich Picture Gallery	ORGANIZATION	was then the best collection of pictures open to the public in
England	LOCATION	.

		Older by twenty-four years than the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, it contained three hundred and fifty paintings of a very representative character .

		The '' green half - hour 's walk '' across the meadows between
Camberwell	ORGANIZATION	and
Dulwich	LOCATION	led often to this gallery , and the boy , even before he was in his teens , sitting long before one or another of these paintings , learned to know and love pictures almost unconsciously .

		Also , without leaving his suburban home , he gained that knowledge of musical theory that helped him to set songs to music , to compose fugues , and emboldened him before he was twenty-one to contemplate writing an opera .

		A neighbor living in an adjoining street was his teacher ; but this neighbor was no less a personage than
John Relfe	PERSON	, musician in ordin - ary to His Majesty , and considered one of the best piano-teachers in
London	LOCATION	.

		Passionately fond of the theatre , the young
Browning	PERSON	found means to see
Edmund Kean	PERSON	in his principal roles , while that distinguished actor was playing at
Richmond	LOCATION	what proved to be his last engagement .

		Although Camberwell was ten miles away from
Richmond	LOCATION	, the distance was made on foot both ways , young
Browning	PERSON	and his favorite cousin
James Silverthorne	PERSON	re - turning after the performance of the play through the country lanes in the early hours of the morning .

		Epoch-making occasions truly , since it was seeing
Kean	PERSON	in the part of
Richard III	PERSON	.

		that inspired
Browning	PERSON	to the composition of his first poem , ''
Pauline	PERSON	. ''

		We know this on his own authority from a pencil note in his own hand written in a copy of '' Pauline '' now preserved in the Dyce and Foster collection of the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	.

		It is the veritable copy sent to
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	for review ; and in it he wrote , also in pencil , the notice which he sent first to '' The Examiner '' and then to ``
Tait	PERSON	's
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Magazine . ''

		It was rejected by the editors of both of these publications , and had remained 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, unprinted , we believe , until it appeared in THE DIAL of
1901	DATE	, when the present reviewer was kindly allowed by the Museum authorities to make a copy of it .

		It had then only recently come into the
Museum	ORGANIZATION	's possession .

		We are glad to see this highly interesting memorial of two such men as
Browning	PERSON	and Mill now given to the public in the pages of a book .

		Altogether , it is a vivid and charming impres - sion that this volume gives us of a richly - endowed nature that has been allowed to grow .

		No effort seems to have been put forth to make
Browning	PERSON	something other than he naturally inclined to be ; the tendencies of his boyhood are visible , sanely and fruitfully developed , in his maturity ; always the words he put into the mouth of
Fra Lippo Lippi	ORGANIZATION	seem to have been true of himself : '' The world 's no blot for us , Nor blank ; it means intensely and means good ; To find its meaning is my meat and drink . ''

		But ''
Pauline	PERSON	'' had to be privately printed , and gained little recognition , most of that little being distinctly unfavorable .

		Yet surely it must be too sweeping to say that '' not a single copy of his poem had been sold , '' though doubt - less it is true that `` a bale of unbound sheets was destined to be sent home by the publishers . ''

		With the next poem , ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	, '' it was different ; and the older poets Landor , Words - worth , Talfourd honored themselves and him by inviting him to a dinner in which the toast to the '' Poets of
England	LOCATION	'' was associated with the name of the author of ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But there is less that is new about this period , because we already knew much .

		With '' Sordello , '' the next poem , the situa - tion is different .

		The story of the evolution of this poem and the circumstances attending its production has never been recounted as fully or as well as we now have it .

		The poem was cast and re-cast many times , and its publication long delayed by such untoward happenings as the earlier appearance of another poem on the same subject , the modification of the Sordello legend suggested by
Browning	PERSON	's visit to
Venice	LOCATION	, the introduction of a new love element , the portrayal of a spiritual conflict of a different character from the one first contemplated .

		Dante 's influence over the poem is traced , and is shown to be more immediate and fundamental than has been usually recognized .

		Of great interest is the chapter on ''
Brown	PERSON	- ing and the Drama . ''

		We are shown the de - gradation of the English stage in the thirties , the lack of good dramatists , and the repeated but somewhat disappointing results of
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's efforts to redeem the stage and to elevate the literary repute of
England	LOCATION	.

		But the poet had too little practical knowledge of stagecraft to make a good playwright .

		`` Colombe 's Birth - day '' remained unacted for nine years .

		After this , he ceased to write for the actual stage , al - though his poems continued to be , as he himself said of them , `` always dramatic in principle . ''

		Midway in the volume we come upon that momentous hour in
Browning	PERSON	's life the meet - ing with
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	, on the
20th of May , 1845	DATE	.

		Her picture as a girl is given in a full-page plate , made from a sketch by her sister ,
Arabella Barrett	PERSON	.

		It shows a plump round face , long curly hair parted on one side , and features of very great regularity , beauty , and vivacity of expression .

		Pictures of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	in later life reveal so plainly the in - fluence of the sickness and suffering from which she was never wholly free after her thirtieth year , that it is a pleasure to see this healthy , alert , almost mischievous , but at the same time earnest and thoughtful , face .

		Apparently she was about twelve years old at the time this sketch was made .

		The story of the courtship under adverse conditions , the quiet wedding in
St. Marylebone Church	LOCATION	with only two witnesses , and the flight to
Italy	LOCATION	, is contained in a single chapter .

		During all this time , it is to be remembered that the society which surrounded them did not consider
Browning	PERSON	a great poet , nor the equal of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	.

		Six years after her death he wrote -LRB- 1867 -RRB- to Mrs.
Millais	PERSON	, '' I am the most unpopular poet that ever was . ''

		We all know his apostrophe to the British Public , '' Ye who love me not . ''

		But the very volume in which this apostrophe occurs '' The Ring and the Book '' -LRB- 1868 -RRB- changed the whole attitude of that public .

		If it was not exactly captured , it was at least forced to acknowledge that English poetry had been enriched by a new masterpiece , the roll of English poets lengthened by the addition of the name of
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		For the story of the remaining twenty years of
Browning	PERSON	's life the biographer has drawn upon a very large number of sources letters , memoirs , conversations , published and unpub - lished , with the result that we feel we are getting a fuller presentment of the whole man , '' in his habit as he lived , '' than has been given us before .

		We are told that '' He had a horror , carried almost to excess , of as - suming anything like a bardic pose ; indeed , he seemed , in general society , anxious not to be reminded , or to
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 remind others , that he was a poet .

		But in moments of noble enthusiasm of which a few were witnesses , when he would move a listening group to tears by his read - ing of '
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	, ' or would recite with fire Smart 's ' Song to
David	PERSON	, ' or his own ' Thamuris Marching , ' then indeed the disguise or armor of daily life fell from him , and the true poet was revealed . ''

		He was never unduly elevated by his own achieve - ment ... The corollary of this attitude was a generous appreciation of the work of other poets .

		He never wavered in his assertion of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's supremacy ... When
William Morris	PERSON	's
Defence of Guenevere	ORGANIZATION	' ap - peared in
1875	DATE	,
Browning	PERSON	wrote of it enthusiastically to Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	: I shall hardly be able to tell
Morris	PERSON	what I think and re-think of his admirable poems , the only new poems , to my mind , since there 's no telling when . '

		He was always eager to encourage new practitioners , where he could discern promise ... Among the last of his letters which have been preserved is one addressed to a lady who had submitted to him her verses in manuscript , in which he assures her , in words borrowed from one of her own poems , that ' There is room in the blue for a new song-bird . ' ''

		We all know the unconquerable spiritual optimism that dominates
Browning	PERSON	's poetry ; it is gratifying to find that it was also his most salient characteristic as a man .

		Throughout his life , he did indeed '' Hold on , hope hard in the subtle thing That 's spirit ; though cloistered fast , soar free . ''

		Instinct impelled him to invest every human interest in its appropriate poetic garb .

		That language did occasionally succeed in getting the upper hand of him , must be granted ; but in his highest efforts , language is his servant the servant of his great and creative nature .

		To the lovers of
Browning	PERSON	as a poet there is no shock in becoming more intimately acquainted with him as a man .

		Appendix A gives a list of five poems headed '' Shorter Poems by
Robert Browning	PERSON	not in - cluded in any edition of his Works . ''

		This statement is true only if the words '' by him '' are inserted after '' included . ''

		They have been for many years accessible through both the '' Camberwell '' and the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition of
Browning	PERSON	's works , published in
America	LOCATION	.

		But in this , as in other matters , the biographer ignores entirely the labors of American editors and publishers .

		To an American reader , it is somewhat amusing to find that in making a quotation from Dr.
H. H. Furness	PERSON	, the author considers it necessary to add , '' eminent as a Shakespearian scholar '' ; and to follow the men - tion of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	with the description , `` an American statesman . ''

		The second appendix contains a very val - uable document , translated from an Italian man - uscript found in
1900	DATE	in the
Royal Casanatense Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The manuscript deals with the same '' Roman murder-case '' that
Browning	PERSON	found in his '' square old yellow book '' in
Florence	LOCATION	; it has much in common with the information in that book , but supplements it in various ways and is the best prose account of the whole case that is known to exist .

		This , also , has been previously published in
America	LOCATION	, in a translation made by Mr.
Hodell	PERSON	.


Brown	PERSON	- ing never saw this document , hence it is almost startling to find in it so many similarities with thoughts and incidents that grew out of his poetic imagination .

		No less than eight portraits show how
Brown	PERSON	- ing looked at different ages , two or three of which we do not remember to have seen before .

		Fourteen photographs , mostly of landscape or scenery , made by Professor
Griffin	PERSON	himself , are both beautiful and interesting .

		Careless proof - reading has left some errors in spelling under - neath certain pictures , as '' Annunciata '' for
Annunziata	PERSON	, `` Feode '' for Fede , etc. , though the same words are correctly given in the index .

		ANNA BENNESON PROBLEMS OF RACE ADJUSTMENT .

		* The contact attrition and final relations of the various races of mankind constitute the one all-embracing problem of modern civilization .

		Two bold and comprehensive attempts to grap - ple with the world - wide problems of race adjust - ment are presented in two recent volumes , '' The Negro in the New World '' and '' The Conflict of Color . ''

		The two volumes are de - voted to the same general object , although the one is world wide , while the other is hemis - pheric , in scope .

		The one last named deals , in separate chapters , with the yellow and brown and black races in their relations to the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean ; while the former is concerned only with the African and the Caucasian in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		There are many points of agreement in the two works , as well as striking diver - gencies . ''

		The Negro in the New World '' is the production of a scholar , with broad histor - ical knowledge , long tropical residence and experience , wide observation , a scientific spirit , and a philosophic turn of mind .

		On the other hand , '' The Conflict of Color '' is the attempt of an impatient publicist to promote a pro- gramme , with reliance upon race antipathy as * THE NEGRO IN THE NEW WORLD .

		210 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, the chief dynamic .

		The authors are alike un - mitigated materialists , and place as full and final reliance upon the concrete and practical factors of power in the final settlement of things as if they were dealing with the parallelogram of forces .

		They casually waive aside all restraints of conscience and the higher sanctions of re - ligion .

		Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	ventures the judg - ment that the Negro may in time rise to a position '' of all-round equality with the white man '' ; while Mr.
Weale	PERSON	passionately espouses the age - worn dogma that he '' can not rise in the scale beyond a certain point . ''

		Both books lack the cohesiveness of consecutive and integral treatment , due to the fact that the collected articles first appeared as scattered magazine essays . ''

		The Negro in the New World '' narrowly misses being a monumental treatise in the field traversed .

		In the wide range of historical , scientific , and sociological knowledge , in firm - ness of grasp upon every essential feature of race relations during the last four centuries , it easily ranks among the first , if not itself the first , of books on the subject .

		Its faults are incident to the manner of its making . ''

		The rolling stone gathers no moss '' because its perpetual rolling does not give the spores the requisite time to take lodgment and reach structural maturity .

		And so the globe-trotting sociologist is not likely to formulate a seasoned philosophy .

		Successive impressions are not given time to ripen into positive opinion or settled knowledge before others are super - imposed , making a composite rather than a positive photograph .

		The sociological sojourner is always prone to hasty preachments , and is not willing to let his impressions convey their own lesson .

		The value of an impression is proportional to the nature and quality of the object impressed ; it may be made on mud or on marble .

		But the value and convin - cing power of a reasoned philosophy is inde - pendent of the medium by which it is conveyed .

		This book is a conglomerate of facts , historical and actual , and of impressions and preachments .

		The author also reaches general conclusions from an insufficient induction of particulars .

		Single impressive incidents are magnified out of proportion to their inherent importance .

		For example , the author was so profoundly impres - sed with the work of
Hampton	LOCATION	and
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, involving some 2500 pupils , that he confined his treatment of Negro education almost to these two foundations , with barely a word con - cerning the other Negro universities and col - leges with ten times as large a number , or the great system of public schools with an enroll - ment of over a million .

		The plan of the book is excellent .

		The gen - eral conclusions , as set forth in the preface , are underpinned by subsequent chapters devoted to a detailed recital and analysis of history and actuality .

		There are several good maps and numerous excellent photographic illustrations .

		The first chapter is devoted to a labored effort to show that the Negro belongs to a sub-species of the genus homo .

		The general reader will glance at the pictures as he flits through the pages , but will pay little attention to finely and profoundly drawn ethnological analogies .

		How - ever fascinating the discussion of the '' os calcaneum '' and the `` plica semilunaris '' may be to the scientific student , it makes the general reader somnolent .

		The bulk of the book is devoted to a histori - cal and present account of slavery under the several European powers , and of the present position of the descendants of the African cap - tives and their European captors in the West Indian archipelago and in the two continents of the Western world .

		These chapters give the book its permanent importance and value .

		Indeed , if these chapters were disengaged from what precedes and what follows , and bound in a separate volume , the weight of its authority would be greatly enhanced .

		The observations , impressions , and conclusions , concerning the present-day Negro in the
United States	LOCATION	can not be said to be in any marked way superior to those of several other writers , except that the author shows throughout an inveterate hatred of cruelty and oppression , a genuine sympathy for the weak and overborne , and a fine sense of fair play .

		In '' The Conflict of Color , '' Mr.
Weale	PERSON	ap - proaches his subject from the standpoint of a passionate advocate defending a dogma , rather than a philosopher in quest of the truth .

		His general proposition is that the white race has been vouchsafed eternal dominion over the `` lesser breeds '' of men , yellow , black , and brown , and that this dominion must be main - tained though the heavens fall .

		With pic - turesque and dramatic portrayal , he proclaims imminent world-wide revolution unless his pro- gramme is followed .

		He holds a brief for the white race in general , and for
England	LOCATION	in particular .

		In this threatened struggle between white men and non-white men , `` it is flesh and blood which forms the true barrier . ''

		The dominant forces of the world are physiologic
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 and not psychologic .

		Of course the inate ever - lasting superiority of the white man is assumed a superiority which , it is declared , exists even after death .

		We read : '' The vigorous white man even after death possesses a certain majesty of form a certain resolution which is totally lacking in the rice fed Asiatics . ''

		Shakespeare tells us that `` Imperious
Caesar	PERSON	, dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away . ''

		Mr.
Weale	PERSON	thinks that even the dust of the European is of a finer quality than that of other men .

		Separate chapters are devoted to the yellow , the brown , and the black factors of the problem .

		The final conclusion is reached that the peace of the world depends upon a nicely calculated balance of power among these elements , the white man holding the scales , and
England	LOCATION	taking heed that the balance is true .

		Of course the Negro is accorded the lowest position on the scale , from which he '' shall be lifted nevermore '' according to Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's dismal philosophy .

		On this point the author is devoid of originality .

		He adopts the same hoary dogmas that have been bandied about the world every since the oldest son of
Noah	PERSON	took advantage of the bibulous proclivities of that ancient patriarch .

		The black man is some - thing apart `` something untouchable . ''

		Along with received doctrines and animosities , the author falls into traditional inconsistencies on this subject . ''

		The anxiety to preserve race - purity is a natural and a commendable one ; it is one of nature 's most zealously guarded laws . ''

		This we read on page 230 ; five pages further on we note : '' How to keep races pure from his -LSB- the Negro 's -RSB- contact will then certainly be an acute problem ; for as he scatters far and wide , he will leave in spite of all precautions some traces of his blood . ''

		The writer must have forgotten his premises before reaching his conclusion , within the space of four pages .

		What need is there of precaution to enforce nature 's `` most zealously guarded laws '' ?

		How is it that nature allows her laws to be set aside , even in spite of the vicarious assistance of pre - cautionary human prudence ?

		A casual visit to
Rio de Janeiro	ORGANIZATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	, or to
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Virgi	PERSON	- nia , would surely convince Mr.
Weale	PERSON	that for some centuries nature has been a great laggard in enforcing her own zealously guarded laws .

		Mr.
Weale	PERSON	has also imbibed the traditional intolerance of spirit .

		Such expressions as '' pulpit orators , '' '' arm-chair philosophers , '' `` ardent evangelists , '' and `` the individual who refuses to see things as they appear to the mass of his countrymen , and who simply argues aca - demically on all so-called color questions , is not worthy of being read , '' sound quite familiar to the student of pro-slavery literature .

		The real value of the book from a sociological point of view consists in the display and the interpreta - tion of the statistics of the various races , the potentiality of physical population , and the keen observation that the momentum of racial flesh and blood will probably fix the future bounds of habitation .

		Taking together these books which portray this great drama of which the world is the stage and the various races but players , one must feel that their vital weakness is that they both , pur - posely and in set terms , rule out of account the religious motives which have exercised the highest influence on human conduct throughout all history .

		It is , indeed , rather fashionable in present-day philosophy to ignore religion as a practicable sociological factor .

		Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	avows that religious traditions are not of the slightest practical utility in the Negro world of to-day .

		Mr.
Weale	PERSON	declares that `` religion has little to do with the standard of living ; religion has still less to do with the balance of power ; and it is these things alone to-day which have a paramount racial importance . ''

		Again , Sir
Harry	PERSON	avers : '' Given the same temptation and the same opportunities , there is sufficient of the devil left in the white man for the three hundred years of cruelty of Negro -LRB- or other -RRB- slavery to be repeated , were it worth the white man 's while . ''

		This is the severest indictment drawn against the claim of the Christian religion to assuage the inherent deviltry of man .

		The Christian conscience of this continent can not allow this indictment to stand unchallenged .

		We need not be surprised , after this , at Sir
Harry	PERSON	's final statement : `` Money solves all human difficulties . '' ''

		The one undoubted solu - tion of the Negro 's difficulties throughout the world is for him to turn his strong arm , his sturdy legs , his fine sight , subtle brain , deft fingers , and rapidly developed brain , to making money . ''

		This doctrine is of the earth earthy .

		The gospel that is based upon the dollar as the highest common divisor of values can never solve problems which touch the deepest human feelings and passions .

		The dollar is mighty , but not almighty .

		The love of money is the root of all evil , says St.
Paul	PERSON	; and subsequent history confirms the verdict .

		It is certainly the cause of '' the conflict of color '' throughout the world to-day .

		It was this '' cursed love of gold '' which brought the African to the Western world to exploit his physical capacities , and 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, which has carried the European to the ends of the earth seeking what lands and peoples he might devour .

		Until there is developed a higher sanction , which transcends the physiological basis of flesh and blood , and the desideratum of the market - place , there never can be peace and good-will among the rival nations and races of men .

		To bring the world under the controlling sanction of a science and a religion which ignore the preju - dices and pretensions of the higher or haughtier sections of the human race is '' the one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves . ''


KELLY MILLER	PERSON	.

		A FRENCHMAN 'S STUDY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		* To all but scholars , the name of
Alfred Aulard	PERSON	is almost unknown in
America	LOCATION	.

		Read - ers who are familiar with their
Thiers	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, their Tocqueville and
Taine	PERSON	, have never heard the name of
Aulard	LOCATION	; and yet
Aulard	PERSON	has done more to promote the scientific study of the French Revolution than all of the above men - tioned gentlemen taken together .

		Among his - torians in
France	LOCATION	, and among special students of the Revolution everywhere , his name is as familiar as the name of Pasteur is to scientists .

		Students of the French Revolution the world over are preparing a memorial to present to him in commemoration of the twenty-fifth annivers - ary of his activity as Professor of the French Revolution at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	; and at the same time he is being introduced to the American public by a translation of his most important work , '' The French Revolution : A Political Study . ''

		Verily , fame travels at a laggard pace !

		A quarter of a century ago , the city of
Paris	LOCATION	voted funds to found a chair of the French Revolution at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		The first occupant of that chair and the present occupant was
Alfred Aulard	PERSON	, known at that time by his work on '' The Orators of the Revolution '' in three volumes .

		The first volume appeared in
1882	DATE	, while he was professor of French liter - ature in the
University of Poitiers	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was written from a literary point of view , and in a second edition , published in
1905	DATE	, Aulard states * THE FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		A Political Study ,
1789	DATE	-
1804	DATE	.

		By
Alfred Aulard	PERSON	, Professor of Letters at the Uni - versity of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Translated from the French of the third edition , with a Preface , Notes , and Historical Summary , by
Bernard Miall	PERSON	.

		In four volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		that were he to write the work to-day he would `` conceive it in a more historical manner . ''

		He would apply to it '' a more rigorous method , a better documentation , making less use of Memoires written after the events , and would refrain more from the judgment of men and their work , aiming at a more objective im - partiality . ''

		In spite of the literary flavor and method , it was a good work then and is a most useful work to-day .

		Aulard 's reputation as a scholar , however , rest upon something more solid than his '' Orators . ''

		His selection for the chair of the French Revolution at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	has been amply justified by his effective and untiring activities since his appointment in
1886	DATE	.

		These activities have been of four kinds : those of the professor at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, consist - ing of lectures and exercises upon the Revolu - tion ; those of the editor of documents relating to the Revolution , of the editor of '' La Revolu - tion frangaise , '' the monthly publication of the '' Societe de la Revolution frangaise , '' and of the historian of the Revolution .

		Naturally , the work of the professor has helped the work of the historian and the editor , much of what was presented in the lecture room afterwards appearing in the review or in book form .

		Not the least valuable part of
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's work at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	has been his success in arousing an interest in research work among his students , and in forming a large group of trained men who speak of him as '' le cher maitre . ''

		If to-day a larger body of scholarly monographic material is being put out upon the French Revolution than upon any other period of European history , much of the credit must be given to
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Review '' has aroused and kept alive an interest in the Revolution , has supplied a place for the publi - cation of rare documents and short papers and for the criticism of current literature on the Revolution .

		Posterity will probably decide that
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's most valuable contribution to the study of the Revolution is to be found in his work as editor of source publications , his six volumes of docu - ments on the Jacobins , his nineteen on the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, his four on the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	, and five on the reaction of
Thermi	LOCATION	- dor and
the Directorate	ORGANIZATION	.

		A formidable list to place to the credit of one man !

		Under the same head must be counted his activity during the past few years as a member of the com - mittee engaged in the most important labor of directing the publication of the great mass of documents relating : to the economic side of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 213 the Revolution .

		If
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's productiveness as a historian does not bulk as large as one might expect , the explanation is to be found here .

		The writer of historical narratives may acquire greater renown than the editor of historical sources , but it is a debatable question as to whether he does a more valuable service to historical truth .

		Besides the work recently translated into English ,
Aulard	PERSON	has written an excellent vol - ume on '' Le Culte de la Raison et le Culte de 1 ` Etre Supreme '' -LRB- second edition ,
1904	DATE	-RRB- ; six volumes entitled '' Etudes et Lemons sur la Revolution franQaise , '' consisting of lectures and articles reprinted from reviews ; a large part of the volume on the Revolution -LRB- VIII . -RRB-

		in the '' Histoire generale , '' and a volume on ''
Taine Historien	PERSON	de la Revolution francaise '' -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- , a destructive critical study on
Taine	PERSON	's ''
Les Origines de la France Contemporaine	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		To my mind , this last work is the most impor - tant volume of criticism dealing with a work on modern European history that has appeared in our day .

		I believe this is a just estimate of the volume , although I do not consider Aulard as critical a writer as some other historians of the Revolution in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		His success in demolishing
Taine	PERSON	was due to the fact that he knew the printed and manuscript sources of the Revolution as no other man has known them : and through the study of
Taine	PERSON	's journal and correspondence he was able to show that
Taine	PERSON	did not have the time to examine many manuscripts , and did not examine them ; that he neglected some of the most valuable of the printed sources , and often blindly followed unreliable sources .

		That Aulard has made tremendous strides in the knowledge of the criti - cal historical method since the days when he was professor of French literature at
Poitiers	LOCATION	, will be patent to anyone who compares the first volume of his '' Orators '' with the studies on
Dan	PERSON	ton in the '' Etudes et Lecons '' -LRB- quatrieme serie -RRB- ; but an examination of his chapters on '' Les Premieres Historiens de la Revolution , '' in the last volume of the '' Etudes '' -LRB- sixieme ^ will make clear that he has not fully outgrown the literary point of view nor fully assimilated the historical method .

		He does not seem to appreciate fully the importance of analyzing a contemporary account , like the '' Histoire par deux amis de la liberte , '' for the purpose of determining the sources of information , of com - paring newspaper accounts to ascertain whether or not the accounts are independent , or of prov - ing a fact by the citation of at least two inde - pendent witnesses .

		He knows his sources , and the best sources ; but he does not always use them in the most critical manner .

		Although his historical writing must be ranked high , it can not be placed without reserve in the same class with the work of such a master of histori - cal method as
Leopold von Ranke	PERSON	, for example .

		The work just translated and published in four volumes originally appeared in one large volume in French .

		It bears the title '' Histoire politique de la Revolution franchise , '' and is already in its fourth edition -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- .

		It is not a comprehensive history of the Revolution , not even a '' political '' history in the larger sense ; but it is what we Americans commonly desig - nate as a u constitutional '' history .

		Aulard him - self states that his aim was '' to show how the principles of the Declaration of Rights were , before
1789	DATE	and
1804	DATE	, put into operation by the institutions of the time , or interpreted by speeches , by the press , by the policies of the various political parties , and by the manifesta - tion of public opinion . ''

		In other words , '' he added , '' I wish to write the political history of the Revolution from the point of view of the origin and the development of Democracy and Republicanism . ''

		He notes that '' Democracy is the logical consequence of the principle of equality , Republicanism the natural conse - quence of the principle of national sovereignty .

		These two consequences did not ensue at once .

		In place of Democracy , the men of
1789	DATE	founded a middle-class government , a suffrage of property-owners .

		In place of the Republic , they organized a limited monarchy .

		Not until
August 10 , 1792	DATE	, did the French form themselves into a Democracy by establishing universal suffrage .

		Not until
September	DATE	22d did they abolish the
Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	and create the Republic .

		The Repub - lican form of government lasted , we may say , until
1804	DATE	that is , until the time when the government of the Republic was confided to an Emperor .

		Democracy , however , was suppressed in
1795	DATE	, by the constitution of the year III. , or , if not suppressed , at least it was pro- foundly modified by a combination of universal suffrage and suffrage with a property qualification . ''

		Here is a clear statement of the nature of the work , and of its extreme limit .

		The whole subject ,
1789	DATE	to
1804	DATE	, is divided into four parts 1789-1792 , 1792-1795 , 1795-1799 , and 1799-1804 .

		These parts do not corre - spond exactly to the division of the English translation into four volumes , although very nearly so for the first and last volumes .

		The second volume , although it promises to go of
1795	DATE	to correspond to
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's division goes only to
July 1794	DATE	, to the revolution of Thermidor .

		To do this work simple justice , it must be judged by what the writer intended to accom - 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, plish .

		If we are disappointed in not finding brilliant pictures of the great days of the Revolution , accounts of diplomacy and war , of economic and financial conditions , of the bloody deeds of the Revolutionary tribunal , and of the vicissitudes of civil war , we have no ground for complaint ; these things do not enter into the plan of the work , and Professor Aulard never forgets for a moment what he is writing about .

		His eye is fixed upon two things : -LRB- 1 -RRB- public opinion , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- public institutions , studied in their mutual relations and in relation to the Declaration of Rights .

		Much as
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	knew about the subject , for some parts of it the con - ditions are such that no one man can control the source material and formulate conclusions .

		Where such a situation exists , he calls the reader 's attention to it , making no claims to infallibility in knowledge .

		Although an enthusi - astic democrat , Professor Aulard aims to pre - sent the truth as he finds it in the sources ; and his efforts have been crowned with success .

		His work is that of a ripe scholar , who has lived with his sources , printed and manuscript , for a quarter of a century , and who sees his subject as a whole .

		He advances no statement without the support of valuable source material , and he always indicates what this source is , that the reader may control his work .

		What a mass of evidence often lies behind a single sentence , what an amount of labor has preceded a single cautious generalization , only the initiated can know .

		M.
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's volume dealing with political opinions and political institutions during the Revolution is a pioneer work , and will doubt - less suffer the fate of all pioneer work in being corrected in part by later and more detailed in - vestigations .

		I think , however , that its final fate will be that of great works like those of
Ranke	PERSON	.

		It will never be fully outgrown .

		It is grounded upon a study of the sources ; the large lines are undoubtedly true , and destined to stand .

		It is not superficial , dilletante work , like that of
Thiers	PERSON	and
Taine	PERSON	, but sound and scholarly as far as it goes , and certain to be the starting-point for all work of the future on the political history of the Revolution .

		The translator has done his work well , pro- ducing a vigorous and readable English text .

		It would not be difficult to pick flaws in it , some due to the translator , some doubtless due to the compositor ; but such criticism would be without point .

		No scholar will go to a trans - lation , if he is doing intensive work ; while for the public at large , minor inaccuracies are not important .

		The work of the editor is less sat - isfactory than that of the translator .

		In fact , the results would have been more acceptable if the editor had been less in evidence .

		It was a great mistake to undertake to supplement such a work as this by matter that would re - lieve the reader of the necessity of turning to other works for a knowledge of the Revolution as a whole .

		It would have been more dignified to have presented the translation unadorned , to have left the field entirely to
M. Aulard	ORGANIZATION	.

		For , in the first place , the task of supplement - ing his work by prefaces , biographies , and chronological tables , was an impossible one ; in the second place , it was poorly done .

		It would have been much more to the point to refer the reader to such a work as the volume on the French Revolution in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History , '' to
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Eve of the French Revolution , '' or even to
Gardiner	PERSON	's or
Mathews	PERSON	's short sketches .

		Aulard 's footnotes have been inconsistently treated , many being reproduced in full , some omitted , and others left incomplete .

		The translator 's own footnotes , many of them incorrect , might well have been omitted .

		The volumes are well printed and attractively bound , giving a fitting dress to the most important work on the French Revolution translated into English in our day .

		FRED MORROW FLING .

		DIVERTING DISSERTATIONS ox DICKENS .

		* In the Introduction to his '' Appreciations and Criticisms of the Works of
Charles Dick	PERSON	- ens '' Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	says , with characteristic sacrifice of accuracy to rhetoric , that while he has read `` Treasure Island '' twenty times and feels that he knows the book , he has , in the case of '' Pickwick , '' '' not so much read it twenty times as read in it a million times , '' and that he seems to find something new in its pages every time he turns them .

		A goodly number of these fresh discoveries , not only in the work mentioned , but in all its companions as well , are collected in the '' Appreciations , '' which are themselves so many prefaces contri - buted to a recent edition of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	.

		After the well-known volume on that writer issued by Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	four years and a half ago , it is interesting to note how much fresh inspira - tion he has derived from his novels ; and it is rumored that the end is not even yet , additional * APPRECIATIONS AND CRITICISMS OF THE WORKS OK

		THE DIAL 215 rich veins having been struck by the indefati - gable miner since the prefaces were written .

		We wonder what
Dickens	PERSON	himself would have said to all this wealth of interpretation and comment .

		Had he the faintest suspicion that he was writing books so astonishingly profound in meaning ?

		Did he ever once dream that he was a myth-maker , whose myths it would tax the robust powers of a distinguished twentieth - century critic to render intelligible to twentieth - century readers ?

		`` Zounds ! ''

		we can perhaps conceive him exclaiming in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's lan - guage as he now looks down from his immortal eminence on all this pother , '' I was never so bethumped with words since I first called my brother 's father dad . ''

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's prefatory essay , written for this reprint of his
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	prefaces , has the attraction of freshness , and merits more than passing notice from the reviewer .

		In the course of an argument to prove that what have com - monly been regarded as caricatures in
Dickens	LOCATION	's novels are on the contrary very real and natural characters , the author confidently asserts : '' Those comic monstrosities which the critics found incredible will be found to be the immense majority of the citizens of this country .

		We shall find that Sweedlepipe cuts our hair and Pumblechook sells our cereals ; that
Sam Weller	PERSON	blacks our boots and
Tony Weller	PERSON	drives our omnibus .

		For the exaggerated notion of the exaggerations of Dickens ... is very largely due to our mixing with only one social class , whose conventions are very strict , and to whose affectations we are accustomed ... For the English , of all nations , have the most uniform upper class and the most varied democracy .

		In
France	LOCATION	it is the peasants who are solid -LSB- stolid ? -RSB-

		to uniformity ; it is the marquises who are a little mad .

		But in
England	LOCATION	, while good form restrains and levels the universities and the army , the poor people are the most motley and amusing creatures in the world , full of humorous affectations and prejudices and twists of irony .

		Frenchmen tend to be alike be - cause they are all soldiers ; Prussians because they are all something else , probably policemen ; even Americans are all something , though it is not easy to say what ; it goes with hawk-like eyes and an irrational eagerness .

		Perhaps it is savages .

		But two English cabmen will be as grotesquely different as Mr.
Weller	PERSON	and Mr.
Wegg	PERSON	.

		Xor is it true to say that I see this variety be - cause it is in my own people .

		For I do not see the same degree of variety in my own class or in the class above it ; there is more superficial resemblance between two Kensington doctors or two
Highland	LOCATION	dukes .

		No ; the democracy is really composed of Dickens charac - ters , for the simple reason that
Dickens	PERSON	was himself one of the democracy . ''

		In further defense of these grotesque char - acters of the novelist , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	maintains that they are real because their creator '' took the poor individually , '' whereas `` all modern writing tends to take them collectively . ''

		He likens the modern picture of a poor man to a composite photograph , '' unlike anything or any - body . ''

		This and more in the same strain he allows himself to assert in the very face of that gallery of sharply differentiated characters in humble life painted by Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	to name no other modern artist in that department of fiction .

		From the same preliminary section of this entertaining book we take a short and sug - gestive summing-up of '' A Tale of Two Cities . ''

		Further on in the volume the same novel is made the subject of a nineteen-page essay , with some interesting comparison of
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` French Revolution '' with
Dickens	PERSON	's tragic tale , and the assertion that '' the French Revol - ution was a much simpler world than
Carlyle	PERSON	could understand ; for
Carlyle	PERSON	was subtle and not simple .

		Dickens could understand it , for he was simple and not subtle . ''

		The nature and purpose of the novel for which its author caught his inspiration from
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	are thus interpreted by Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	: '' It was well for him , at any rate , that the people rose in
France	LOCATION	.

		It was well for him , at any rate , that the guillotine was set up in the Place de la Concorde .

		Unconsciously , but not accidentally ,
Dickens	PERSON	was here working out the whole true comparison between swift revolutionism in
Paris	LOCATION	and slow evolutionism in
London	LOCATION	.


Sidney Carton	PERSON	is one of those sublime ascetics whose head offends them , and who cut it off .

		For him at least it was better that the blood should flow in
Paris	LOCATION	than that the wine should flow any longer in
London	LOCATION	.

		And if I say that even now the guillotine might be the best cure for many a
London	LOCATION	lawyer , I ask you to be - lieve that I am not merely flippant .

		But you will not believe it . ''

		No one can glance however hurriedly through Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's book without having his eye caught by innumerable striking guesses at truth , although these guesses are clothed in language that is poles asunder from the timid phraseology of modest conjecture .

		Every Ameri - can reader will be glad to learn of
Dickens	PERSON	that '' all his grumblings through this book of American Notes , all his shrieking satire in
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	are expressions of a grave and reasonable fear he had touching the future of democracy .

		And remember again what has been already remarked instinctively he paid
America	LOCATION	the compliment of looking at her as the future of democracy . ''

		In the opening paragraph of the essay on '' Sketches by Boz '' the author allows himself , not for the first time , to generalize from a single iD stance , or at most from an insufficient number , and assures us that '' the fact is almost unquestionable : most authors made their reputation by bad books 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, and afterwards supported it by good ones . ''

		If
Dicken	PERSON	is as simple as Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, in a sentence already quoted , pretends to regard him , how strange , as well as fortunate , that this substantial octavo of exegetical essays on the novelist 's works should have been called into being !

		Possibly the agreeable phenomenon is largely due to the subtlety of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		At any rate , it is a thought-stirring and at times a protest-evoking volume , and is not likely to put the reader to sleep .

		At the very worst , one can say of its author what he himself says of Dickens : '' If his writing is not amusing us , at least it is amusing him .

		Even when he is tiring he is not tired . ''

		Eight portraits of
Dickens	LOCATION	, chronologically arranged , increase the interest and value of the book .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A NEW STUDY OF CHANCELXORSVILLE .

		* In
1894	DATE	Major
John Bigelow	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, was assigned as
Professor of Military Science	ORGANIZATION	and Tactics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech	ORGANIZATION	- nology , and selected the Campaign of
Chancel	LOCATION	- lorsville as his subject for a course of lectures .

		This campaign had been treated , in
1867	DATE	, by Captain
Hotchkiss	PERSON	and
Lieut	PERSON	- Col.
Allan	PERSON	, both staff officers of the
Second Corps of Lee	ORGANIZATION	's army , and later by
Bates	PERSON	,
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	, and
Hamlin	PERSON	, of the Federal service , not to mention the well-known works of
Swinton	LOCATION	, Ropes ,
Henderson	PERSON	, and others .

		There was , however , room for another book on the subject , as
Major Bigelow	ORGANIZATION	has well shown .

		It would be difficult to find a volume on any campaign of the Civil War that has treated its subject more fully , and embellished it with more numerous and excellent maps , so necessary to the intelligent study of military campaigns .

		Major
Bigelow	PERSON	well says , in his Preface : '' There is no comfortable way of reading mili - tary history .

		Whoever expects to follow a cam - paign reclining in an easy chair , with a book in one hand and a cigar in the other , is doomed to disappointment . ''

		I would add that he is doomed also to know little or nothing about the campaign when he finishes the volume .

		The student must read carefully , with maps spread out before him , and frequently referred to for information ; for without them it is not possible to bear in mind the mass of details needed in * THE CAMPAIGN OF

		following a campaign .

		There is no more inter - esting study than military history ; but the work studied must be worth while , and the writer must be able to grasp the salient points , not to let the details master the situation , not to let the irrelevant obscure the relevant .

		Also , he should `` hew to the line , no matter where the chips fall . ''

		Fifty years after the events there is no excuse for maintaining prejudices , for ex - aggerating the achievements of the one side or depreciating those of the other .

		That might have been excused some years ago ; but the day for such writing of so-called history is gone , and now we want the abiding truth .

		The great mistake on the part of the Federal commanders at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	was a total misconception of the situation .

		They get it into their heads that the Confederates were withdrawing , which they had no idea of doing ; and it took
Jackson	PERSON	's sudden flank attack on their extreme right to correct this fatal mis - conception .

		The original mistake was made by
Hooker	PERSON	; and
Howard	PERSON	did not correct it .

		Schurz appears to have been the only one of the Federal generals who had a correct idea of what was going on ; and he was third in rank on the right , and so was not chiefly responsible .

		It is seldom that troops on the field of battle are found so unprepared when the thunderclap comes .

		No troops could have stood their ground under such circumstances .

		The Confederates had things all their own way until darkness fell upon the scene .


Jackson	PERSON	was eager to press on , even in the dark ; but the change of the Confederate troops ruined his plan .

		Lane 's brigade had not seen
Jackson	PERSON	and his staff go to the front , hence their unexpected return caused the Confederates to anticipate a cavalry attack and to fire the volley which laid
Jackson	PERSON	low .

		Oh , the irretrievable disaster of that volley !

		But for that , a glorious victory would have been won by the Confederates that night .

		The next day the situation had changed .

		Even
Stuart	PERSON	's elan , with his troopers ' loud and joyous refrain , '' Old
Joe Hooker	PERSON	, wo n't you come out of the Wilderness ? ''

		required hours to win success .

		Considering the number of Federal troops at hand three corps really being unengaged
Hooker	PERSON	's failure to retrieve the day can only be attributed to the shock he received by the cannon-ball 's striking near him at his head - quarters , and to the hesitation of Couch to take command and to give the necessary orders .

		THE DIAL 217 Just as
Hooker	PERSON	was forced back to his second position , and
Lee	PERSON	was ready to attack his lines , a halt was called to the Confederate forces in consequence of
Sedgwick	ORGANIZATION	's success over
Early 's Division	ORGANIZATION	on the Federal left at
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, compelling Lee to suspend his attack and hasten with
McLaws 's Division	ORGANIZATION	to the field at
Salem Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here was another splendid chance for
Hooker	PERSON	to take advantage of the division of the Confederate forces ; but he did not avail himself of it .

		It took Lee all the afternoon to fight the battle of
Salem Church	ORGANIZATION	, and push
Sedgwick	PERSON	back across the
Rappahan	PERSON	- nock at Banks 's
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, which was accomplished by dark , but too late to return upon Hooker at
United States Ford	ORGANIZATION	and renew the attack .

		This shows the mistake of Hooker in separating his wings so far that neither could support the other .

		Either was strong enough to sustain itself , but the respective commanders did not think so .

		In view of the actual results , how curiously were fulfilled
Hooker	PERSON	's General Or - ders No. 47 of
April 30	DATE	and No. 49 of
May 6	DATE	, for which there was no excuse !

		The unequal numbers of the two armies are seen from Major
Bigelow	PERSON	's statements ; and so with respect to casualties and prisoners .

		I have no fault to find with his figures , and consider that he has been eminently fair in his account .

		Hooker has thrown too much blame upon Sedg - wick .

		While the latter might have moved faster ,
Hooker	PERSON	might have got along without his assist - ance if he had had more confidence in himself .

		It is almost amusing to read the correspondence between the two as given in
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's book on
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	.

		Each expected the other to prove the Deus ex machina who would rescue him from his dilemma .

		A word of comment may be given , in con - clusion , to the movements of the cavalry in this famous campaign .

		Neither of the Federal com - manders accomplished what was expected of him , and
Hooker	PERSON	removed Averill from com - mand , considering him the most to blame .

		But
Stoneman	PERSON	can hardly be regarded as having carried out his orders .

		It would seem that , having been in chief command ,
Stoneman	PERSON	bore the chief responsibility ; and he could not rid himself of it by telling Averill he turned the enemy over to him .

		Hooker was to ' blame for separating himself from his cavalry , as he was for his other grave error of placing his wings so far apart that neither could support the other .

		Worse than all was his failure to take advantage of two critical situations when the Confederate forces were dangerously divided and exposed to an attack which , if made vigor - ously and at the right moment , could hardly have failed of success .

		With a commander of the first military order in place of
Hooker	LOCATION	,
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	might have been the
Gettys	PERSON	- burg of the Confederacy .

		Hooker congratulated his army oh having crossed the rivers and taken position at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, but only then did his troubles begin ; for Lee had no intention of resisting the passage of the rivers , any more than when Grant crossed the Rapidan in
1864	DATE	, and then found himself unable to move out of the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	.

		Major
Bigelow	PERSON	's book de - serves the highest praise .


JAMES M. GARNETT	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		As an agreeable supplement to the more formal and detailed accounts of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	's life and labors , there now comes from the pen of Mr.
Philip Jourdan	PERSON	a reminiscent volume entitled ''
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	: His Private Life , by his Private Secre - tary '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		Avoiding as far as possible all reference to the politician , the statesman , the empire-builder , and drawing merely upon his notes and recollections of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	in the intimacies of a personal connection that extended over the eight years preceding his death , his private secretary has filled nearly three hundred pages with anecdotes and bits of conversation and other miscellaneous matter , all tending to show the great man as a person of amiability and charm and of unstinted kindness to those whom he liked .

		In fact , it was to correct prevalent contrary impressions of his personality that the writer at last , after seven years of silence , consented to share with a misinformed public his store of authoritative personal reminiscences ; so at least he informs us in his Introduction .

		There is , naturally , a good deal of hero-worship in the book .

		The author 's ecstatic admiration of Rhodes becomes evident on an early page , where , describing the events leading up to his secretarial engagement , he says : '' I used to take long solitary walks , some - times extending over several hours , into the country , thinking of nothing else but
Rhodes	LOCATION	,
Rhodes	LOCATION	,
Rhodes	PERSON	and my devotion towards him .

		I had heard if one had a great wish , if it was a genuine and earnest one , that in the end it would be fulfilled .

		I did not really believe it , but still I clung to it in the same way as a drowning man clings to a straw . ''

		To be able to figure as a hero to one 's private secretary , if not to one 's valet , is certainly much to a man 's credit .

		Among the marks of confidence reposed in Mr.
Jourdan	PERSON	by his employer we note the latter 's explanation of his choice of celibacy . ''

		I know everybody asks why I do not marry , '' said he . ''

		I can not get married .

		I have too much 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, work on my hands .

		I shall always be away from home , and should not be able to do my duty as a husband towards his wife .

		A married man should be at home to give the attention and advice which a wife expects from a husband . ''

		Of such and also of some more weighty matters the book is filled .

		The near view we get of
Rhodes	LOCATION	during the siege of Kimberley is instructive .

		Portraits and South African scenes illustrate the volume .

		Only the modest sub-title of Mr. A survey of * lire-Renaissance Ezra Pound 's '' The Spirit of Ro - literature .

		mance : An attempt to Define Some - what the Charm of the Pre-Renaissance Literature of
Latin Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- disarms the inevitable criticism that a book of two hundred and fifty pages can give only the barest treatment of this very con - siderable field of literature .

		The work opens with '' The Phantom Dawn '' of Apuleius in the
second century	DATE	, jumps to
Arnaut Daniel	PERSON	in the twelfth , and proceeds through the leading writers and schools of Romance to Camoens in the sixteenth .

		Somewhat characteristic of the temper of the book is the re - mark about
Daniel	PERSON	, that he has been forgotten for five hundred years , since '' poets have not been able to read his language , and the scholars have not known anything about poetry . ''

		The whole treatise is a protest against regarding the literature of this period merely as a stamping ground for philological investigation , no matter how thorough or , as Mr.
Pound	PERSON	says , how '' Tedescan '' such investigation may be .

		The book , therefore , aims to survey the whole field of Romance literature before the
Renais	PERSON	- sance in such a way as to give an idea of the worth of this literature as art .

		The method pursued is that of interpretation by means of brief expository and narrative comment , and of illustrative selec - tions in translation .

		Within his limits Mr.
Pound	PERSON	succeeds pretty well in making real the spirit of Romance , though these limits are considerably contracted at times .

		Thus , what can be done with the vast subject of '' Geste and Romance '' in a chapter of twenty-five pages , which attempts appre - ciation of the '' Poema del Cid , '' the '' Chanson de Roland , '' the lais of Marie de
France	LOCATION	, `` Aucassin et Nicolette , '' the '' Romance of the Rose , '' along with passing reference to the work of Crestien and the versions of '' Tristan and Ysolt '' ?

		More satis - factory are the chapters on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Villon	PERSON	, and
Lope de Vega	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's enthusiasm for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	leads to his speaking of
Milton	PERSON	's '' Paradise Lost '' as con - ventional melodrama and to his saying other unpleas - ant things about
Milton	PERSON	and his epic .

		The translations are chiefly the author 's own ; they are not attempts , like
Rossetti	PERSON	's , to substitute the poetry of one nation for that of another , but are '' merely exegetic . ''

		For example , this from Betrans of
Provence	LOCATION	: '' No man is worth a damn till he has taken and given many a blow . ''

		After one such shock we are the more prepared for this calm deliverance : '' If in the future anyone should ever become interested in the mid-eighteenth century atmosphere of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
More of Emerson 's Journals	ORGANIZATION	.

		he would find the works of
Longfellow	LOCATION	most valu - able as archaeological documents . ''

		Perhaps it is not necessary to carry comment further - To the curious reader , who enjoys memoirs and diaries for their `` human interest , '' the third and fourth vol - umes of
Emerson 's Journals	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be of value chiefly for the account of the author 's European journeyings in
1833	DATE	.

		It is something to be in the confidence of the
New England	LOCATION	preacher and philosopher as he attends the governor 's masked ball at
Malta	LOCATION	, or sees his first ballet at
Florence	LOCATION	, or hears French opera and visits Frascati 's gambling house at
Paris	LOCATION	; and it is still more profitable to trace the impressions that he receives from classic art and from the formalism of the Roman Catholic worship .

		For once
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	wrote of the affairs of his daily life , and interspersed his ethical and religious specula - tions with shrewd and thrifty traveller 's com - ments on manners , customs , and prices .

		After his return to
America	LOCATION	in
October , 1833	DATE	, however , the so-called Journals were merely commonplace books in which he stored sentences and paragraphs to be used as occasion demanded .

		There are six words on his marriage , and a page on the birth of his child , and a few other brief references to per - sonal matters ; but most of the entries are the de - tached utterances of Emerson the professional author .

		It was apparently his own practice that he had in mind when he wrote -LRB-
August 31 , 1834	DATE	-RRB- : '' It is as lawful and as becoming for the poet to seize upon felicitous expressions and lay them up for use as for
Michael Angelo	PERSON	to store his sketch-book with hands , arms , triglyphs , and capitals to enrich his future compositions . ''

		From this store of material he drew freely , as the editor 's notes continually remind us , in the preparation of lectures and essays .

		What is now published is , therefore , the residue left after many cullings .

		It presents few ideas that are not as well or better stated elsewhere in the author 's works , though occasional comments and observations too personal to be incorporated in published writing show the human side of the philosopher .

		On the whole , the Journals are something of a disappoint - ment at first reading , though they are likely to prove an invaluable document to the careful student of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's mental development .

		Bookbinding for libraries .

		The need of a handy practical book of information and instruction on bookbinding must have been felt by many librarians and others with collections of books to keep in usable and presentable condition .

		From the
London	LOCATION	house known as
Libraco Limited	ORGANIZATION	there now comes the desired handbook , with the title , `` Manual of Library Bookbinding , Practical and Historical , '' written by Mr.
Henry T. Coutts	PERSON	,
Branch Librarian of the Islington Public Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
George A. Stephen	PERSON	, Chief Assistant Li - brarian of the
St. Pancras Public Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, and
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 prefaced with an Introduction by Mr.
Douglas Cockerell	PERSON	, known as a writer on the craft of biblio - pegy and himself engaged in its exercise .

		With a view to the special needs of the librarian and of the binder who specializes in library work , the authors have sought '' to give a succinct account of the pro- cesses of binding at the present day , by describing the methods of hand and machine binding respec - tively ; to indicate the essential features of library binding ; to describe and give actual examples of some of the best and most suitable materials for library binding ; to describe the different methods of recording and checking books despatched to the binder ; to give practical information on the equip - ment of small binderies in libraries , and on the repairing of books , as well as to give recipes , mis - cellaneous information , and a glossary of terms . ''

		Seventy pages are devoted to a '' Historical Sketch of Bookbinding '' in the chief European countries , and a considerable number of advertisements inter - esting to librarians concludes the volume .

		A note - worthy feature of the book is the selection of twenty-four actual specimens of leather and cloth for binding , gummed to blank leaves provided for the purpose .

		A useful folder gives in diagram the dimensions of the various sizes of books , but , rather strangely , omits entirely the duodecimo , although the term occurs in both text and glossary .

		In the chapter on `` Materials '' it is stated of cowhide that '' in
America	LOCATION	it is commonly used for popular books of fiction . ''

		It may have been formerly so used in library binding , but certainly at present the more durable buckram is in greater favor .

		On an early page , in defining what is meant by a well-bound book , the authors say that '' it will always open out flat and remain open at any page without assistance '' a test that very few volumes except quartos and folios will stand , and which the work under review most emphatically refuses to respond to .

		The illus - trations , diagrams , tables , lists of authorities , ex - planations of terms , etc. , show care and thorough - ness .

		One can not see how , within its modest com - pass , the book could be appreciably improved .

		A tound piece Prof essor
Pasquale Villari	PERSON	is so well of historical known as a sound historian of his tchoiarthip .

		own land tnat nig Mediaeval
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- was sure to be greeted warmly by En - glish and American readers .

		The volume opens with the familiar crowning of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	on
Christmas	DATE	day of the year eight hundred , and closes with the burial of
Henry the Seventh	ORGANIZATION	at
Pisa	LOCATION	in thirteen hundred and thirteen ; and it may be said at once that as a political history of the inter - vening years the work can be unhesitatingly recom - mended .

		Those of us who are prone to emphasize the social and economic phases of any national life must feel that we should like to have an additional volume , or pair of volumes , dealing with our side of these five centuries in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps no other historian would carry out the task as well as Pro- fessor Pasquale .

		But as it stands , the volume runs to nearly four hundred pages , and he has chosen to adhere closely to the lines of political history .

		Throughout , one is impressed by his critical acumen , his impartiality , his unsparing search for reliable foundations , and his clarity of exposition , in short , by his ability as an historian .

		Apart from the gen - eral usefulness of the volume , we should recognize our indebtedness for the author 's insistence on the importance of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	under the Normans and the
House	ORGANIZATION	of
Swabia	LOCATION	, and on the frequent connections between genuine religious movements during the period , and political events .

		Whether or not he has insisted a shade too strongly , may be fairly asked ; but it was desirable that these two points should receive considerable stress .

		On the whole , the rendering into English is well done ; but one finds a few irritating reminders that one is dealing with a translation .

		A word should be given to the admirably chosen illustrations , and to the gen - erally excellent workmanship of the volume .

		Note * from Passing fancies , whimsical notions , a noreiitt 's tender sentiments , humorous conceits , bits of personal experience , reflec - tions in serious mood of such is composed Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	's inviting little volume of mis - cellanies , partly reprints and partly new , which he gathers together under the all-inclusive title , `` The Patchwork Papers '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The opening chapter introduces a bright little old lady who at seventy retires to a country cottage and the enjoyment of a pension of five shillings a week , spending the rest of her days in the composition of a patchwork quilt which shall carry down her memory to succeeding ages .

		From her , if she be indeed a real person , the author seems to have got the suggestion of a title for his book , although he can hardly expect the slender volume to perpetuate his fame at the expense of his more elaborate literary productions .

		The little sketches have something of the brevity and the unstudied quality of conversational utterances ; and therein consists the chief of their charms .

		The theme of the entire twenty-four short papers may be called , in the words of the publishers ' announce - ment , `` the beauty of life 's simple things . ''

		Ap - proaching the book with no expectation of being either thrilled with emotion or convulsed with mer - riment or spellbound with wonder , or otherwise rapt into total oblivion of the here and the now , a sym - pathetic reader may derive considerable enjoyment from its unpretending pages .

		Dr.
Thomas C. Hall	PERSON	's `` History of Ethics within Organized Christian - .

		, ,0 -1 i ity -LRB- bcnbner -RRB- is a volume of wide horizon , extensive learning , catholic spirit , and hospi - table outlook upon modern science and scholarship .

		The author 's acquaintance with the literature of the many subjects which he discusses is comprehensive and accurate ; and his pages show that he has fully in - formed himself before stating his opinions .

		But the book is far more than a storehouse of facts .

		It is andethict .

		220 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, a work full of illuminating interpretations .

		Great masses of mere facts have been so penetrated with thought that they disclose essential principles and reveal great historical laws .

		The mastery of details is evident in the clear style , in the orderly arrange - ment of parts , and in the sure touch with which all matters are handled .

		The book is noticeable also for its modernness of spirit and sanity of judgment .

		It shows no trace of intolerance , dogmatism , or uncharitableness .

		Appreciation of all forms of faith is abundant , and ungracious criticism is nowhere present .

		No extreme claims are made for any Christian party , while the good in all churches is generously acknowledged .

		The assured results of New Testament scholarship are frankly admitted , the fragmentary character of the
Synoptics	ORGANIZATION	, the un - historical character of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	, and the speculative element in
Paul	LOCATION	.

		And yet it is assumed that Christian Faith will adjust itself to these conclusions not only without loss , but with positive gain .

		It is not practicable to speak of the work here with the detail which its merits deserve .

		It should be noted , however , that it is more general in scope than its title implies , for it contains a great deal besides moral ideals much about doctrine and philosophy , much also about the church and general culture .

		All in all , it is a valuable work which fills admirably a place not before occupied .

		Originally presented as a thesis for .

		.

		the bachelor 's degree to the
Board of Modern History of Oxford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , `` The Buccaneers in the
West Indies	LOCATION	in the XVII Century '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , by Mr.
C. H. Haring	PERSON	, now appears as a substantial octavo , provided with maps from early cartographers , illustrations from old prints , lists of sources of various kinds , abund - ant footnotes , and a careful index , as well as preface and introduction and certain appended items not included in the aforementioned bibliographical lists .

		Much has already been written about these hardily - adventurous sea-rovers of the Antilles , as Mr.
Haring	PERSON	admits in his preface ; but as all previous accounts have been based on Esquemeling , the Jesuit his - torians , and a few narratives like those of
Dampier	PERSON	and Wafer , he feels himself justified in producing a work resting on a wider range of authorities , including especially manuscript archives of .

		both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and the Colonial Series of printed
State Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of his book , he explains further , `` is not only to give a narrative , according to the most authentic available sources , of the more brilliant exploits of these sea-rovers , but , what is of greater interest and importance , to trace the policy pursued toward them by the English and French Governments . ''

		Despite the somewhat formidable appearance of so much scholarly '' ap - paratus '' hedging in the writer 's narrative , the story itself has such a wealth of stirring incident and daring adventure as to make it by no means dull reading .

		Seen through the kindly haze of two and three centuries , the horrors of these piratical ex - peditions become softened , and their romance notably heightened .

		To have them presented , too , with particular reference to their historical signifi - cance , is of value .

		An Italian Mr '
Christopher Hare	PERSON	, favorably soldier of the known as the author of several agree - wth century .

		a y e studies in Italian history , now adds to them a volume with the following title : '' The Romance of a Medici Warrior : Being the
True Story of Giovanni delle Bande Nere	ORGANIZATION	; to which is added the Life of his Son ,
Cosimo I.	PERSON	, Grand Duke of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is further described on the title-page as '' a study in heredity . ''

		Giovanni did indeed inherit from his mother ,
Caterina Sforza	PERSON	, the renowned
Madonna of Forli	ORGANIZATION	, a fearless spirit and great firmness of purpose .

		On his father 's side he was of the house of Medici , and for wife he took a granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent .

		His memorable deeds , chiefly martial , were all performed within the short span of twenty - eight years , at the end of which he died from the effects of a wound received in battle .

		He and his formidable '' Black Bands '' furnish abundant matter for stirring narrative through two-thirds of the book , when the fortunes of his son
Cosimo	PERSON	, cold-hearted , taciturn , cunning , and perfidious , the strongest possible contrast to his father , claim the reader 's attention .

		The writer has succeeded in making his narrative as interesting as a historical novel , his conversational and descriptive passages being treated with that freedom of the reconstructive imagination which infuses new life into the driest of annals .

		Though he quotes freely and with due acknowledgment from certain trustworthy sources , one should bear well in mind that the book is , as its title confesses beforehand , a romance , although one with a substantial historical foundation .

		The num - erous portraits are reproduced from Italian masters , notably from Titian , whose name is attached to five .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Three new volumes , embodying the complete Poems , have just been added to the definitive `` Memorial Edi - tion '' of
Meredith	LOCATION	, published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Only a single volume of bibliographical material now remains to complete the set .

		A study of ''
Blake	PERSON	's Version of the Book of Job , '' with reproductions of the illustrations , is the work of Mr.
Joseph H. Wicksteed	PERSON	, and comes to us from
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a handsome volume , well furnished with notes , appendices , and other critical apparatus .

		That standard biography , '' The Life of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	, '' by Professor
William Milligan Sloane	PERSON	, has attained a new edition , considerably less expensive than the first , without the colored pictures , but with a re - vision of the text and the addition of more than ten per cent of new matter .

		A useful volume for the prospective home-builder is Mr.
U. M. Dustman	PERSON	's '' Book of Plans and Building Construction , '' published by the
Charles C. Thompson	PERSON	1911 . -RSB-

		THE

		Besides illustrations and floor plans of one hun - dred and fifty modern houses , barns , etc. , the book in - cludes a large amount of practical information and estimates related to building work , not readily avail - able elsewhere .

		A new translation of
Bjornson	PERSON	's rather trifling early comedy , `` De Nygifte , '' made by Miss Grace
Isabel Colbrun	PERSON	, and called '' A Lesson in Marriage , '' is pub - lished by
Braudu	ORGANIZATION	's ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		It makes a good acting play , and has always been popular on the stage , both in
Norway	LOCATION	and in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Stories of the King '' is a book of Arthurian tales retold for the young by Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	, and pub - lished in the '' Eclectic Readings '' series by the Amer -
ican Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another volume in this series is Miss
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	's '' The Story of Old
France	LOCATION	, '' planned for somewhat older readers .

		Two additional portfolios of '' Longman 's Historical Illustrations , '' providing plates of the architecture , costume , and social life of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , will be welcomed by teachers who are ac - quainted with the four portfolios previously published in this series of illustrations of the history of
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	's '' History of the Civil War '' appears in a new edition , revised and enlarged , with the imprint of the
Wessels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		For nearly a quarter of a century this work has held its place as a concise one - volume history of the war ; and in its new form it will have a still stronger claim to popular favor .

		The
Engberg-Holmberg Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, have issued an illustrated gift-book edition of `` The Angel of Death , '' by
Johan Olof Wallin	PERSON	, as translated from the Swedish by Mr.
Clement B. Shaw	PERSON	.

		This poem , by the official hymn-writer of his country , is the author 's masterpiece , and is familiar to every Swedish household .

		We can not say much for the poetical quality of the translation .

		The
Windsor Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, send us '' A Synchronic Chart and
Statistical Tables of United States History	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
George E. Croscup	PERSON	.

		The chart is accompanied by many maps and tables , and by a chronological text which Mr.
Ernest D. Lewis	PERSON	has prepared .

		As a compendium of the bare facts of American history , the volume should be found of much value for reference , both in the school and in the home .

		What can we say of the English '' Who 's Who '' that has not already been said many times ?

		The volume for
1911	DATE	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is , of course , bigger than ever , and for that reason alone more useful than any of its predecessors .

		There are nearly twenty-three hundred pages !

		Truly , the editorial tribe has reason to be grateful for this ready means of learning the essential facts about the life of any living Englishman who is worth knowing about .

		A limited edition of
Donne	PERSON	's '' Letters to Severall Persons of Honour , '' prepared under the supervision of Mr.
Charles Edward Merrill , Jr.	PERSON	, is published by the
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These letters have naturally been used by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in his biography of
Donne	LOCATION	, but have not been reprinted in full since their seventeenth - century publication .

		Mr.
Merrill	PERSON	has provided some forty pages of notes , and his tasteful and dignified vol - ume has the portrait of
1633	DATE	and a facsimile of the title-page of
1651	DATE	.

		A complete printed catalogue of a large library is now comparatively seldom seen .

		The
Woodside	ORGANIZATION	Dis - trict Library , one of the
Glasgow Corporation Public Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, has just issued , in one compact volume , the second edition of its '' Index Catalogue . ''

		Authors , subjects , and , when they are distinctive , titles are ar - ranged in one alphabetical list .

		The library contains nearly sixteen thousand volumes , classified by a system based on the Dewey decimal scheme .

		The catalogue shows good workmanship , and its plan is the one best suited to i ^ s users ' needs .

		A little greater generosity in the supply of cross-references might have been appre - ciated , though the avoidance of undue bulkiness was an urgent necessity .

		Mr.
J. X. Larned	PERSON	's '' History for Ready Reference '' -LRB-
Springfield	LOCATION	:
Nichols	PERSON	-RRB- is a work that has found a cordial welcome in the school and in the private library .

		It consists of the five original volumes , the supplementary volume covering the years 1894-1900 , and the second supplementary volume , just now published , covering the
first decade of the twentieth century	DATE	.

		These two added volumes are , of course , very different in scale from the set of five at first published , and contain a much larger proportion of original matter .

		Such subjects as railways , combinations , labor organization , and municipal govern - ment loom large in the new volume , whereas the chron - ological continuations of the histories of separate coun - tries are of subordinate importance .

		Certainly , the new volume , although out of relation with the scheme of the original work , is a book of great independent value for reference to topics of contemporaneous interest .

		Shelley 's wonderful volume of
1820	DATE	, containing the '' Prometheus Unbound , '' the '' Sensitive Plant , '' and the great odes , is reprinted -LRB- with corrections of the obvious misprints -RRB- by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, who also sends us , in the same charming Oxford series , the '' Poems of Clough , '' edited by Mr.
H. S. Milford	PERSON	.

		From the same source we have '' The Ox - ford Book of Ballads , '' edited by Mr.
A. T. Quiller	PERSON	-

Italy	LOCATION	, '' published a year or so ago .

		Finally , we may mention in this group '' The Glamour of Oxford , '' of which Professor
William Knight	PERSON	is the editor , and which gives us poetry and prose in about equal measure all devoted to the praise of the university city on the

		The magnificent quarto which appears as Volume II .

		of the '' Memoirs of the

		It is a work of 283 pages of text and 85 plates , besides maps and indexes .

		Many of the plates are from photographs , and thus show the natural surroundings of the trees they illustrate .

		The number of species described is 92 , of which 49 are indigenous , and 18 peculiar to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` In addition to the tech - nical description of each tree from the standpoint of the botanist , the book concerns itself with many matters of general popular interest , such as the distribution of the several species throughout the
State	ORGANIZATION	, their relations to topography , rainfall , and temperature , their char - acteristics of life-history and reproduction , with several tables of ages and dimensions of some of the more im - portant species , the economic uses of the trees , both by the native tribes and by civilized man , their kinships , as shown by the classification , with other trees both in

London	LOCATION	publishing house a new and complete translation of
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		It may be noted in this connection that '' Crime and Punish - ment , '' with an introduction by Mr.
Lawrence Irving	PERSON	, has just appeared in the admirable '' Everyman 's Lib - rary '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Two interesting volumes soon to be issued by Mr.
Frederic Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	are `` A Painter 's Holiday , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	; and ''
George Inuess	PERSON	: The Man and his Art , '' by Mr.
Elliott Dangerfield	PERSON	.

		Both books will be hand - somely printed on handmade paper , and issued in limited editions .

		Mrs.
Anna Robeson Burr	PERSON	, author of `` The Auto - biography , '' is engaged upon a study of '' the religious confession , '' in both its history and its psychology , aiming to give a historical account of the development of introspection , and to collate and make abstracts of the available material for a definitive study of religion in the individual .

		The
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	announces that it has taken over the entire management of the publishing business conducted under its name and imprint .

		The sales agents of the publications of the Press are now
Messrs. Lemcke & Buechner	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, for
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the colonies .

		Two sumptuous gift-books now in course of prepara - tion for Fall publication by
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust , '' in Abraham Hay ward 's transla - tion , with an introduction by Mr.
Roger Ingpen	PERSON	and numerous illustrations in color by Mr.
Willy Pogany	PERSON	; and '' Guinevere and Other Poems , '' by
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, illustrated in color , etc. , by Miss
Florence Harrison	PERSON	. ''

		The Graphic Arts , '' a new magazine '' for printers and users of printing , '' has recently made its appear - ance .

		The mechanical dress is dignified and imposing , and the contents of the first two issues comprise many interesting features .

		Worthy of especial mention is Mr.
Henry Turner Bailey	PERSON	's article in the
February	DATE	number on '' Pernicious Illustration , '' a merited scoring of the vulgar pictorial attempts at humor that fill certain sections of our newspapers and cheaper maga - zines .

		American editions of four of the works of
J. M. Synge	PERSON	, the Irish dramatist and poet , will be published shortly by
Messrs. J. W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are : '' The
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, '' with twelve illustrations by Mr.
Jack Yeats	PERSON	, a picturesque account of
Synge	PERSON	's stay on the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, off the west coast of
Ireland	LOCATION	; ''
Kerry	PERSON	and Wicklow , '' a record of wanderings in rural
Ireland	LOCATION	; `` The Tinker 's Wedding , '' a comedy in two acts ; and '' Riders to the Sea , '' a one-act tragedy .

		Mr.
J. H. Whitty	PERSON	of
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, has edited a list of
Virginia	LOCATION	copyright entries , which is now on the press and will be issued by the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	early this month .

		These titles cover the period from
1790	DATE	to
1844	DATE	.

		They are not recorded in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the original entry-book having been de - stroyed by fire during the Civil War .

		The list was given to Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	many years ago by the late Judge
Robert W. Hughes	PERSON	.

		Among the many interesting entries are some hitherto unknown writings of
Samuel Kercheval	PERSON	, the
Virginia	LOCATION	historian , an unknown title - page of
Burk	PERSON	's History of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the early Ger - man '' Heukle '' book titles .

		ANTONIO FOGAZZARO .

		The most eminent of Italian novelists ,
Manzoni	PERSON	alone excepted , died on the seventh of this month , toward the close of his sixty-ninth year .

		Born at
Vicenza	LOCATION	in
1842	DATE	, he was educated for the law , and practised his profession for a time .

		But literature was his true metier , and before he was forty he had become known as a writer of lyrics , and of the melancholy poem '' Miranda . ''

		His first novel , '' Malombra , '' bears the date
1882	DATE	, but it was not until
five years later	DATE	that ''
Daniele Cortis	PERSON	'' took the public by storm , and placed him in the front rank of modern Italian writers .

		Since that time , he has produced numerous books , the most important among them being the series of three ''
Piccolo Mondo Antico	PERSON	, '' ''
Piccolo Mondo Moderno	PERSON	, '' and `` II Santo '' - which are linked together in a sort of trilogy , and which constitute Fogazzaro 's chief liter - ary monument .

		It was with the publication of the last of these three that his fame became cosmopolitan , and his name familiar to readers all over the world .

		It was not that this philosophical romance was intrinsi - cally finer than its predecessors , but because it dealt frankly and boldly with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in its relation to life and thought , and thus made its author the subject of much excited discussion and a target for all the envenomed shafts of ecclesiastical intolerance .

		In this work the author was clearly declared a modernist , and his subsequent submission to the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	could not undo -LRB- although it might somewhat weaken -RRB- the en - lightening influence of the book .

		Fogazzaro was one of the most conscientious of artists , and his books were , in the words of one of his critics , '' the fruits of a deliberate and rich nature , and not the windfalls of a mere literary trick . ''

		He was also one of the most spiritual and wholesome of novelists , and thus stands in striking contrast to the brilliant but perverse genius whose name is most frequently associated with his not for any likeness of method or ideal , but solely because it is the one other name in contemporary Italian literature to achieve an equally widespread reputation .

		The judgment of posterity , we have little doubt , will hold that the pagan indecencies of d'
Annunzio	PERSON	are far outweighed by the sane teachings and exalted morals to be found in the books of Antonio Fogazzaro .

		J THE DIAL 223 OF SPRING BOOKS .

		An interesting epitome of American publishing activities for the present
Spring	DATE	and coming Sum - mer is contained in THE DIAL 'S annual List of Books Announced for
Spring Publication	ORGANIZATION	, herewith presented .

		In the preparation of this list , every effort has been made toward accuracy and com - pleteness ; and the omission of any prominent pub - lisher is due only to the fact that such publisher failed to respond to our several letters requesting the necessary data .

		It should be said that all the books here listed are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

THE Press of the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
England	LOCATION	-RRB- , publishers of the New Encyclopaedia Britannica , recently invited applications for the work in advance of publication and offered highly advantageous terms to all advance subscribers .

		An entirely new departure was being made in issuing the work in two formats , one impression being on ordinary book-paper -LRB- each volume 2 ?

		4 inches thick -RRB- , the other on
India	LOCATION	paper -LRB- each volume i inch thick -RRB- .

		Six different styles of binding had also been planned .

		The Object of the Advance Offer was to ascertain , in view of the large prospective demand for the new edition , the relative proportions in which the two formats and the various bindings would be required by subscribers .

		That object has been attained ; the relative demand has been determined , and the publishers are now in possession of data which enable them to make reliable estimates and place large orders for paper and binding material .

		Overwhelming Preference for the
India	LOCATION	Paper Edition The Orders Received in Advance of Publication have shown an overwhelming preference for the
India	LOCATION	paper edition .

		In
New York	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, the total orders received down to
March	DATE	ist were more than 18,000 , of which 89 per cent were for sets on
India	LOCATION	paper .

		It is estimated that 40,000 sets will be required by
May 31	DATE	st. Production on a Scale Without Precedent The Purpose of the Advance Offer having been Achieved , the manufacturing will now proceed rapidly and on a scale altogether without precedent in publishing .

		Delivery to early subscribers has already begun in the case of Vols .

		I. to XIV. , and Vols .

		XV .

		to XXIX .

		will soon be in the binders ' hands .

		Complete publication will therefore be effected soon after this issue of THE DIAL is in the hands of its readers .

		In order that all who are interested may have ample notice and an opportunity of obtaining the work on the most favorable terms possible , it has been decided to allow the `` Advance-of - Publication '' prices to remain open till
May 31	DATE	next , when they must be withdrawn .

		The first printing of 17,000 sets -LRB- 12,000 on
India	LOCATION	paper -RRB- will , in respect of the
India	LOCATION	paper , be oversold by the time this announcement is read , so that those who do not order promptly will find their names far down on the list of subscribers , to whom deliveries will be made in impartial rotation from the further stock of sets which has been put in hand .

		Immediate applications in the case of those whose names were not entered on the first subscription list will be dealt with with all possible dispatch that is , as quickly as printers and binders can produce complete sets .

		* > 76 NEW CRITICISM .

		The confusion of purpose which baffles every student of the history of literary criticism , and which seems more and more perplexing the deeper he penetrates into the subject of his investigations , is admirably set forth by Mr.
Joel Elias Spingarn	PERSON	in a lecture which he gave at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	a year ago , and which he now publishes in a booklet entitled '' The New Criticism . ''

		It would be too much to say that the writer clears the difficulty away , or that the formula which defines '' literature as an art of expression '' which he credits to that rather misty philosopher ,
Signer Benedetto Croce	PERSON	is adequate to resolve all our doubts , but we may fairly say that he discusses the subject upon a basis of broad historical knowl - edge , and in a highly suggestive and stimulat - ing fashion .

		First of all , he brings to our attention the seemingly hopeless divergence between the methods of subjective and objective criticism , incidentally noting that there were subjective critics long before MM .


France	LOCATION	and
Lemaitre	PERSON	.

		Scaliger and
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	were as far apart as any pair of modern critical duelists , and it was a Frenchman ef the classical age of the
Roi Soleil	PERSON	who wrote of Virgil : '' The world will continue to think what it does of his beautiful verses ; and as for me , I judge nothing .

		I only say what I think , and what effect each of these things produces on my heart and mind . ''

		Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	calls the opposed ideals the two sexes of criticism ' the masculine criticism that may or may not force its own standards on literature , but that never at all events is dominated by the object of its studies ; and the feminine criticism that responds to the lure of art with a kind of passive ecstasy . ''

		In the one case , we have `` judgment erecting its edicts into arbitrary standards and conventions , '' in the other , '' enjoyment lost in the mazes of its sensuous indecision . ''

		The two must be '' mysti - cally mated , '' if they are not to fall short of their highest powers .

		The mating impulse or the coordinating thought comes to us as a legacy of the romantic movement , traceable in the writings of Mme. de Stae ` l , Cousin ,
Sainte	LOCATION	- Beuve ,
Hegel	PERSON	, and
Taine	PERSON	.

		With Sainte-Beuve we reach , in a sense , the parting of the ways 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, -LRB- as far as nineteenth century criticism is con - cerned -RRB- , for both the impressionist and the dog - matist of later days derive from his example .

		The common ground upon which the old dis - putants are to become reconciled is to be found in a recognition of the principle that criticism , whatever else it may be incidentally , is at bottom a study of the writer 's expression .

		`` What has the poet tried to do , and how has he fulfilled his intention ?

		What is he striving to express , and how has he expressed it ?

		What impression does his work make on me , and how can I best express this impression ?

		These are the questions that nineteenth-century critics have been taught to ask when face to face with the work of a poet . ''

		Again , it was
Carlyle	PERSON	who discerned in the German criticism of his time the aims which these questions set forth . ''

		The problem is not now to determine by what me - chanism
Addison	PERSON	composed sentences and struck out similitudes , but by what far finer and more mysterious mechanism Shakespeare organized his dramas and gave life and individuality to his
Ariel	PERSON	and his Hamlet .

		Where - in lies that life ; how have they attained that shape and individuality ?

		Whence comes that empyrean fire which irradiates their whole being and appears at least in starry gleams ?

		Are these dramas of his not veri - similar only , but true ; nay , truer than reality itself , since the essence of unmixed reality is bodied forth in them under more expressive similes ?

		What is this unity of pleasures ; and can our deeper inspection dis - cern it to be indivisible and existing by necessity be - cause each work springs as it were from the general elements of thought and grows up therefrom into form and expansion by its own growth ?

		Not only who was the poet and how did he compose ; but what and how was the poem , and why was it a poem and not rhymed eloquence , creation and not figured passion ?

		These are the questions for the critic .

		Criticism stands like an interpreter between the inspired and the uninspired ; between the prophet and those who hear the melody of his words and catch some glimpse of their material meaning but understand not their deeper import . ''

		These questionings of
Carlyle	LOCATION	go to the root of the matter , and the passage is one of the weightiest of critical utterances .

		The first two of Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's questions adumbrate the same doctrine , but we do not see what the third is doing in that galley .

		For the critic 's state - ment of the impression that a work makes upon him is either impertinent or superfluous , accord - ing as the critic is not or is qualified for his task .

		In the former case , objectivity is thrown to the winds , and without objective detachment there can be , in our view , no such thing as criticism ; in the latter case , no reader need be told in so many words how the critic is impressed .

		Up to this point , we may remain in reason - able accord with Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	, despite the hostages which he gives to impressionism , but we must part company with him when he fol - lows his statement of general principles with a ferocious onslaught upon most of the time - honored methods of critical procedure . ''

		We have done , '' he informs us dogmatically , '' with all the old rules , '' `` with the genres , or literary kinds , '' `` with the comic , the tragic , the sublime , and an army of vague abstractions of their kind , '' '' with the theory of style , with metaphor , simile , and all the paraphernalia of Graeco - Roman rhetoric , '' '' with all moral judgment of literature , '' '' with ' dramatic ' criticism , '' `` with technique as separate from art , '' '' with the history and criticism of poetic themes , '' '' with the race , the time , the environment of a poet 's work as an element in criticism , '' '' with the ' evolution ' of literature , '' and '' with the old rupture between genius and taste . ''

		We are a little breathless from the shock of this ten - barrelled discharge , but still stand facing the enemy , for the simple reason that his cartridges are all blanks .

		For the plain truth is that criticism has not '' done with '' these things at all , bivt has come to a somewhat clearer under - standing of their relative importance , and has learned how to use them , each in its own fitting time and place , with a nicer discrimination than of old .

		After all , it is only a question of emphasis .

		The mind of the philosophical critic may be likened to a concave surface with many facets , each of them receiving light from its own par - ticular quarter , and all of them reflecting the rays to a common focus .

		If Aristotle has erred , or
Horace	PERSON	, or
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, or
Taine	LOCATION	, or
Brunet	PERSON	- i6re , it is because some of the facets have been dimmed , and others have reflected the light unduly .

		Authority , or didacticism , or meta - physics , or environment , or evolution , has been intensified at the expense of other equally im - portant elements .

		All these things enter into legitimate criticism , and it is mere iconoclastic bravado to assert that their day is past .

		The reason why modern criticism is so much richer and so more nearly adequate than the older styles is that it has acquired more points of view , and learned to use them all for its obser - vations .

		We are willing to allow that criticism is essentially an examination of the writer 's ex - pression , but only with the understanding that it is to be examined in every possible light .

		If it is to mean that we are to cast aside the store of critical wisdom amassed by centuries of effort , we will have none of it .

		There are such things as aesthetic principles in literature , and right - eous judgments may be based upon them .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 Style is a matter that can not be ignored in any examination of literature .

		Literary genres give us norms that are indispensable for purposes of comparison , and the doctrine of evolution enables us to understand transitional types and puzzling reversions .

		Race , period , and milieu are considerations by no means to be despised , and the critic who tries to get along without them will be like Arnold 's '' ineffectual angel , beating : in the void his luminous wings in vain . ''

		o o And the criticism that leaves moral standards out of its reckoning will always be an art atrophied in its vital parts .

		That `` no critic of authority now tests literature by the standards of ethics '' is Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's amazing statement .

		If this were true , it would be so much the Worse for criticism , for literature can have no meaning apart from its relation to life , and all ` the great poets give eloquent testimony to their conviction of this supreme truth .

		Our own opinion , briefly stated , is that the business of criticism is to account for literature , and to justify it .

		In the accounting , all sorts of means may be employed , and the most trivial may have some useful function .

		\ Ve may still learn something from
Quintilian	PERSON	and
Boileau	PERSON	and Herder : we may still learn much from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Taine	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		In the justifi - cation , we are bound , on the one hand , to recog - nize the body of doctrine slowly built up by the labors of rhetoricians and aestheticians , and on the other , to admit the validity of the judg - ments upon which the moralists have been united .

		Can we make any use of the impres - sionists ?

		AVell , if there are enough of them impressed in substantially the same way by a particular work of literature , we may even look to them for inductions that may prove of a cer - tain value .

		But in this case , it is the impres - sionist 's own mind that is most likely to be accounted for , and not often , we fear , likely to have its existence justified by the naive bab - blings which , with somewhat impudent self - assurance , it offers us as a substitute for the serious criticism of literature .

		FOE 'S USE OF THE HORRIBLE .

		Nothing in the prose tales of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is more trouble - some to his critics than the constantly recurring element of the horrible .

		Persons with a certain degree of taste commend the author for his ability to harrow their emotions .

		Devotees with finer sen - sibilities speak little and apologetically of this ele - ment of the tales .

		Unfriendly critics dwell on it to
Poe	PERSON	's disadvantage , and assume that it is a deliberate device for the production of emotional effects .

		A recent essayist says , in one of those complacently elaborated phrases that delight a certain school of American rhetoricians : '' His design is , crassly , to wring the withers of our sensoriums '' ; and more di - rectly : u In the most characteristic of bis writings his motive is exactly that of the fat boy in ' Pickwick , ' who announced to his easily thrilled auditors that he was going to make their flesh creep . ''

		This charge is the most serious that has been brought against the artistic quality of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's tales .

		To thrill the reader for the mere sake of thrilling , to make his flesh creep simply for the sake of the creepiness , can never be a worthy object ; and work that is written with such an aim can never rank high as art .

		It must be remembered , however , that much work of the highest artistic value may thrill , and may even thrill the particular sensation of creepiness .

		For some persons the ghost of Hamlet 's father induces this sensation as surely as does a crude device in a melodrama ; yet one has , and the other has not , a real significance .

		If
Poe	PERSON	uses the horrible to shadow forth the deeper meanings of things , then his tales may be judged by the artistic nature of his conceptions , and the skill with which these conceptions are bodied forth .

		If he introduced the horrible for its own sake , then his art is mere charlatanism , and the tales can have no serious value as literature .

		There is no doubt that the element of horror is present in many of the tales , that it is sometimes inartistic , and occasionally so strong as to overshadow all other impressions .

		There is no doubt , either , that some persons read the tales for the thrill that the horror gives them .

		The question is whether
Poe	PERSON	intended his tales to be read in this way .

		Poe 's own opinion regarding the short story is ex - pressed in the familiar passage from the review of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Twice Told Tales , '' in which he says : '' A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale .

		If wise , he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommo - date his incidents ; but having conceived , with de - liberate care , a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out , he then invents such incidents he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect . ''

		The use of the word '' effect '' which the author liimself italicizes , seems at first glance to warrant the belief that
Poe	PERSON	approved of arousing emotions for the mere sake of arousing them ; and this supposition may be strengthened by a mention of terror and horror in the next paragraph .

		But in interpreting any pas - sage in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's critical work we must bear in mind certain facts respecting his method .

		One of these is that he never formulated a system of literary criticism , and never created the special vocabulary without which exact discussion of literary matters is almost impossible .

		The most valuable pages in the critical writings of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	and Arnold are those which define and give new meanings to such terms as '' fancy , '' '' imagination . '' ''

		criticism of life . ''

		In brief book reviews written for popular magazines
Poe	PERSON	could do nothing of this sort .

		He 252 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, was forced to give his judgments as best he could in the loose and ambiguous language of ordinary discourse .

		Another fact to be noted is that
Poe	PERSON	found himself , both in temper and in belief , opposed to the literary spirit of his time , and that a great part of his literary criticism is controversial , not judicial , in manner and tone .

		Throughout the writings on poetry he fought the idea , so fatally common in the
America	LOCATION	of his day , that a poem was a work of inspiration , to be produced at one heat and never revised ; and in the '' Philosophy of Composition '' he tried to oppose this view by an ob - viously exaggerated account of the opposite process .

		Similarly he opposed , in his review of the `` Twice Told Tales '' of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, the tendency of con - temporary story writers to think of a tale as a series of incidents leading to a climax , and perhaps teaching something by means of a more or less per - tinent moral tag at the end .

		Even
Hawthorne	PERSON	enters in his note-book the outline of a narrative , and adds : `` It would be symbolical of something '' leaving the '' something '' to be determined later , possibly after the tale was written .

		In his quarrel with this practice
Poe	PERSON	uses '' effect '' as a convenient and exaggerated expression of the idea that he wishes to convey .

		It repeats in part the idea of the word '' thoughts '' in the preceding phrase , and it seems to signify little more than that indefinite something which gives to a tale what the author elsewhere calls `` unity of impression . ''

		If this is a fair interpretation of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's critical theory , what of his practice ?

		Before noticing any of the stories in detail it may be well to recall that
Poe	PERSON	was fascinated by many questions concerning the ultimate meaning of things .

		His prose poem , '' Eureka , '' however poor its philosophy , shows this interest .

		His prose rhapsodies , `` Shadow '' and '' Silence , '' however unsuccessful their manner , show his questioning of ultimate mysteries .

		Prob - lems involving the nature and workings of mind , and especially the relations of the spiritual to the physical , are propounded or hinted at in many of the tales .

		Thus the strange something in our natures that impels us to do what we wish not to do is expounded in `` The Imp of the Perverse , '' `` The Tell-Tale Heart , '' and even `` The Black Cat . ''

		The relation of the body and the soul , with the associated thought of the sentience of the body after death , is considered in such different tales as `` Ligeia , '' `` The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	, '' ``
Morella	PERSON	, '' ''
Eleanora	PERSON	, '' and `` The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar . ''

		Some aspects of these and similar problems naturally lead to a consideration of un - pleasant topics , such as physical death .

		It seems reasonable to believe that the excess of horror in such tales is to be explained by the fact that the author did not fully realize how his treatment of these topics would affect the reader .

		In some way , which it would be interesting to consider if space permitted ,
Poe	PERSON	had become hardened to the horrible , as an anatomist becomes hardened to the sights of the dissecting room .

		If he was interested in some favorite speculative idea , and if the motive of his tale called for a scene of horror , he followed his logical rather than his artistic bent , and introduced details that are repellent to the reader .

		The conclusion of '' The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar '' is disgusting , but it is the natural result of a speculation in which
Poe	PERSON	was interested , and which he treated in another tale , `` Mesmeric Revelation . '' ''

		Berenice , '' one of the most obvious artistic failures among the serious stories , is really a study of a peculiar type of monomania .

		Given the intention of the tale and the situation , the teeth are the one feature of Berenice which could be sup - posed to exercise a hypnotic influence on her lover , and the unpleasant climax comes naturally enough .

		In `` The Black Cat '' the author wishes to show the depths to which a man has sunk , and he devises the incident of cutting out the cat 's eye , not for the shiver that it gives the reader , but as an indication of the character of the actor .

		In '' The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' he wishes to provide an outr6 mystery for unravelling , and he fails to realize that some persons will be more impressed by the grue - someness of the murder than by the analytic power of
M. Dupin	PERSON	.

		In all these tales not only is the horror incidental , but it is of the natural , physical , not unwholesome kind .

		With all his lapses of taste
Poe	PERSON	never was guilty of anything like Irving 's '' Tale of the
Young Robber	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Another class of stories , such as '' The Descent into the Maelstrom , '' and `` The Pit and the Pen - dulum , '' are studies of the effects of horror on the persons in the tale .

		In still another class , like '' The Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' and ''
Ligeia	PERSON	, '' an element of horror is mixed with something of wierdness for the sake of the atmosphere ; but in no tale of this class is the horror sufficient to repel any but a squeamish reader .

		Every story that has been mentioned is a study in the peculiar working of the human mind , or suggests some question of the relation of mind and body .

		This is not the place to consider whether such philosophical problems are as well adapted for treatment in fiction as are the purely ethical prob - lems that
Hawthorne	PERSON	preferred .

		They are what
Poe	PERSON	chose ; and in every case the element of horror is a natural , or at least a convenient , incident in the development of the tale .

		Surely the character of
Dupin	PERSON	and the unravelling of the mystery in `` The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' were not created for the sake of the few sentences that describe the horrors of the death-chamber .

		It is unfair to suppose that even in the '' The Black Cat '' and `` Berenice '' the author presents repulsive things for their own sake .

		This conclusion is supported by the analogy of the better stories , and by what we know of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's ideals .

		It necessitates the ad - mission , of course , that he sometimes lacked in sureness of artistic conscience , but it leaves his readers free to enjoy his works and still keep their self-respect and their respect for the author .


WILLIAM B. CAIRNS	PERSON	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LATE RIPENING - OF FOGAZZARO 'S GENIUS is indicated by the fact that he was in his fortieth year when his first novel , '' Malombra , '' was finished , after more than six years of careful work on its details .

		There is , however , nothing that should surprise one in this .

		Why should the first produc - tion with which an artist appeals to the public for recognition be sent forth at an earlier age , with all its sins of crudeness and youthful bumptiousness upon it ?

		Surely there is something wrong in the scheme of things if after the age of thirty or forty a man can not produce increasingly better , richer , riper fruits than ever before .

		The best-flavored and most abundant crops of apples are gathered from the oldest trees in the orchard .

		It is only a weak and mistaken yielding to a vicious popular prejudice that causes the too frequent lapsing into 1 impotent senility before half the course of what should be the normal human life is run .

		The qual - ities that were destined to make Fogazzaro famous as a romancer were mostly present in that first novel , but were to undergo development with the passage of mellowing years . ''

		The spirit of obser - vation which afterwards allowed him to paint so many people in his books , '' writes
Signer Vittorio Orlandini	PERSON	of his recently deceased compatriot , '' the extraordinary perception of the right light in which to place his characters , according to their artistic and real value , the keen sense of humor a quality so rare in modern Italian writers which never fails to let Fogazzaro catch the human side of his personages , are already present in '
Malombra	PERSON	' and suffice to make its author a novelist of first rank . ''

		... THE NEWSPAPER 'S DEBT TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY will never be paid .

		Not one reader in ten thousand stops to ask himself , as he scans his morning jour - nal and skims various paragraphs or articles con - taining detailed information on persons and things of current interest , where all this miscellaneous knowledge is obtained .

		By no means all of it is the fruit of personal interviewing , and , in a reput - able paper , no large proportion of it is evolved from the reporter 's inner consciousness .

		The re - sources of a good reference library have to be drawn upon , and the best reference library in almost every city or village is the one owned by the community and supported by its tax-payers .

		Library workers are familiar with the inevitable descent upon them of newspaper writers whenever , for example , a city in southern
Italy	LOCATION	is overwhelmed by a volcanic eruption , or an oriental despot is assassinated , or a popular author marries or dies .

		Whatever the startling occurrence , it must be writ - ten up , and immediately .

		Dr.
Bernard Steiner	PERSON	, in the current report of the
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	Free Library of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, says of its reference department that it '' has had a busier year than ever .

		It is applied to by all sorts of people on all sorts of subjects , and the queries constantly sent in or directly asked at the desk take much time in their answering .

		The
Baltimore News	ORGANIZATION	and the Sun have made great use of this department .

		Indeed , the greater part of some days has been spent in looking up material for these newspapers . ''

		Gradually it is becoming apparent how many important activities are more or less dependent on the public library , and its insistent demand for more generous financial sup - port should be heeded .

		THE INTUITION OF A PUBLISHER , as also that of a magazine editor and of a theatre manager , is not uncommonly the most valuable asset in his entire stock and equipment .

		Theflaire for the desirable thing in literature that made the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	brothers so successful as publishers seems to be possessed in an unusual degree by the present head of the Mac - millan Company of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	forms the subject of an appreciative sketch , in the
March	DATE	'' American Magazine , '' from the pen of his friend and client -LRB- if the word is permissible -RRB- , Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	.

		It is Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's energy and ability that have transformed what was a mere branch of the
London	LOCATION	house of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	into one of the leading publishing houses of this country .

		His interest in and acquaintance with literature , especially in certain departments conspicuously repre - sented by his publications , prove him to be a scholar as well as a brilliantly successful business man . ''

		Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's character , '' we are told , '' combines boldness with caution , and this is best shown by his attitude toward the much discussed policy of advertising : if his instinct tells him that a book is good , he believes in advertising it liberally ; yet on the other hand he declares that a publisher who considers the com - mercial value of his wares alone is not only apt to find that his published books have no value from the standpoint of time , but that a loss ensues of pub - lishing reputation , and of ultimate commercial profit also .

		Another and by no means small factor in his success has been his knowledge of and belief in the innate idealism of the American man and woman . ''

		Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's occasional writings , on such diverse sub - jects as Poverty ,
Finance	ORGANIZATION	, the Tariff on Books , and How to Enjoy a Vacation , are spoken of as his diversions and distractions from the cares of busi - ness .

		THE HOOSIER FARMER 'S LOVE OF BOOKS may be inferred from a study of the map of that agricul - tural commonwealth , with a list of
Indiana	LOCATION	's public libraries and library stations at one 's elbow for frequent consultation ; also by a study of
the State Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, which was framed and adopted almost a century ago , and which contains a wise and lib - eral provision for the establishment of county libra - ries ; and , thirdly , by a careful reading of the '' Sixth Biennial Report of the
Public Library Commission of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	, '' which brings the library history of the
State	ORGANIZATION	down to the end of
September , 1910	DATE	.

		The county system has been superseded by a more widely beneficent plan for the establishment and operation 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, of libraries , both stationary and travelling , but so early a constitutional provision for public libraries as is found in the charter of
Indiana	LOCATION	's statehood is certainly memorable .

		To promote the usefulness of libraries to the rural public , the above-named Report makes certain recommendations , as for ex - ample , '' Establish a system of permanent deposit stations and , if necessary , branch reading-rooms in villages .

		Allow long time on books to those who live far from the library and deposit station .

		Pur - chase books and periodicals of special interest to farmers .

		See that the people in the country know about the library and what it contains .

		Advertise .

		Make it possible for the librarian to go out into the country and know the station borrowers .

		Make the reading room an attractive place for farmers when they come to town . ''


Indiana	LOCATION	's record in the edu - cational and literary history of the country is one to be proud of .

		Its list of recent writers of note ought to gratify Hoosier pride , and may serve as a sort of testimony to the excellence of the school and library laws of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF LITERARY CELE - BRITY might without much difficulty be shown to overbalance its rewards and satisfactions .

		Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, in some of his recent books , has made it plain that his own success as an author has not been to him a source of unmixed joy .

		The chase for fame , if one fancies that one cares for that sort of thing , is doubtless more exhilarating than its possession .

		That popular and delightful writer known to her readers as
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	, and to her friends and acquaintances as Mrs.
George C. Riggs	PERSON	, has for years been the victim of a vexatious confusion of names .

		Hundreds of unthinking per - sons persist in associating her with '' Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	of the Cabbage Patch , '' either as author or -LRB- who knows ? -RRB-

		as Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	herself .

		At any rate , the stories that Mrs.
Riggs	PERSON	can tell of the blunders committed by intelligent and cultured persons con - cerning her identity almost pass belief . ''

		Dear
Miss Wiggins	PERSON	, '' blandly writes the unknown and admiring correspondent , '' will you kindly send me your autograph ?

		I should prefer a quotation from
Rebecca	LOCATION	or Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	. ''

		Even those who do not go so far as to confuse her with Mrs.
Alice Hegan Rice	PERSON	, too often insist on endowing her with a superfluous s or two , and write her name , ''
Kate Douglass Wiggins	PERSON	. ''

		No wonder she has despair - ingly exclaimed : '' Unless I have my tombstone carved during my lifetime , they will put an s on
Wiggin	PERSON	and a double s on
Douglas	PERSON	.

		If there is room at the bottom they will probably add : ' Here lies the author of `` Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	'' ! ' ''

		NATIVE LITERATURE IN
INDIA	LOCATION	, written in various dialects of that vast empire of many tongues , divers religions , and a bewildering variety of manners and customs , has experienced the quickening influence of the reactionary wave against things English that has lately been sweeping over the length and breadth of the land .

		The vernacular writings of
India	LOCATION	must constitute a terra incognita for the mass of western readers , but it is interesting to note a few particulars from the literary letter of Mr.
Saint Nihal Singh	PERSON	to a late number of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . '' ''

		Many women , '' he says , '' use their native dialects to write novels .

		Most of these are poor things , but some notable volumes have been issued . '

		A Fatal
Garland	PERSON	, ' written by a Bengali woman , Mrs.
Swarana Kumari Devi	PERSON	, in
Bengal	LOCATION	, recently Englished , is a powerful and fascinating romance of the days when Moslems ruled
Bengal	LOCATION	... Many men , also , try their hand at fiction .

		Indeed , novels in the different dialects are becoming very popular in this country .

		Not only do the half-educated men devour them , but the middle-class and aristocratic women with primary schooling are greedy for them .

		As a rule , Indians write much better novels in their native tongues than they do in English , '' naturally enough , '' and , as a result , several notable volumes have been pro- duced during the last generation . ''

		Insatiable and all-pervading is the story-hunger ; and the demand will always , in the end , evoke the supply .

		A MARVEL OF LEXICOGRAPHIC INDUSTRY , in the shape of a Gaelic dictionary , the first complete work of its kind , will presently be available for those comparatively few enthusiasts who never weary of singing the praises of that language and its ballad literature .

		Mr.
Edward Dwelly	PERSON	, of
Herne Bay	LOCATION	in
Kent	LOCATION	, has for thirty years been gathering material , in the native habitat of the Gael , for this magnum opus of his .

		Twelve hundred pounds , saved in ten years from his modest earnings as a
London	LOCATION	clerk , have cheerfully been devoted to the great work ; and for lack of a publisher bold enough to undertake its issue , the compiler himself has provided himself with a hand press , learned the mysteries of type - setting , stereotyping , and printing , and at last the final sheets have been struck off and the book itself , in three volumes and containing a vocabulary of more than eighty thousand words , is on the point of becoming an assured fact .

		A touching tale is told of the inexorable necessity that forced Mr.
Dwelly	PERSON	to part with his painfully-acquired Gaelic library in order to complete the printing of the dictionary .

		It is also reported that he receives a civil list pen - sion of fifty pounds a year , and it has been sug - gested that he be knighted .

		He certainly deserves the honor .

		THE ILLUSTRATED LIBRARY REPORT can , in these days of cheap and effective half-tone reproductions of photographs , be made a rather imposing and really artistic piece of work .

		Not only do exterior views show up well in this species of mechanically faith - ful illustration , but interiors , even those of small rooms , are handsomely and often flatteringly ren - dered .

		As is well known to the amateur photog - rapher , a room no larger than the cramped cubicle of a college student can by means of the camera be
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 255 made to appear almost like a bedchamber of state .

		Hence the pleasing vistas offered to the eye of one turning the leaves of an illustrated annual report of some public library .

		Children 's rooms , thronged with prodigiously studious and sedate infants , have an astonishing air of spaciousness bordering on mag - nificence .

		Even the frouzy habitues of the news - paper reading-room , being all reduced to uniform tone and complexion , have a beguiling aspect of neatness and order .

		These somewhat trite obser - vations are prompted by the inviting appearance of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's Twentieth Annual Re - port , just come out of the far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	with fifteen agreeable pictures to enliven the statistical monotony of its chronicle of recent progress .

		Decidedly , we should advise the librarian who wishes to impress his community favorably in bis yearly report , to illustrate that report generously with the aid of the camera , though of course no librarian worthy of his calling will allow the pictures to cover a multitude or even a smaller number of sins in the adminis - tration of his high office .

		LlTEKABY ASSISTANCE TO THE FOREIGNER Seek - ing to gain a knowledge of our manners and cus - toms , our laws and institutions , could advantageously be rendered , writes Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' through the columns of the many journals in foreign languages that are published in this country . ''

		We may be sure , '' says Mr.
Dana	PERSON	, `` that the editors of almost every one of these publications would be pleased to pub - lish material coming from a reliable source which would be helpful to their readers in learning about
America	LOCATION	, its history , laws , and its customs .

		This would be true even of the editors of radical journals in foreign languages , for they all hold to the value to their makers -LSB- readers ? -RSB-

		of education in American ways . ''

		He adds a list of journals , other than French and German , published in alien tongues in this country .

		They number five hundred and thirty - two , with a combined circulation of three million one hundred and eighty-one thousand , and embrace twenty-seven languages , including even Slovenian ,
Welsh	LOCATION	, Chinese , Japanese , Croatian , Lithuanian , Ruthenian , Bulgarian , Armenian , and Arabic .

		Our German and French newspapers , numbering six hundred and thirty-two and six hundred and thirty - four respectively have a combined circulation of one million six hundred thousand .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's sug - gestion , if widely acted upon , could hardly fail to produce important results .

		FACILITIES FOR STUDY IN
ROME	LOCATION	have recently been made more abundant and attractive than ever before for American students .

		The American Acad - emy in that city , an outgrowth of the
American School of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	, and chartered by act of Con - gress in
1905	DATE	, has now been united with the
Ameri	PERSON	- can
School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	, which has been doing excellent work on an inadequate financial basis since
1895	DATE	.

		But the consolidated
Academy	ORGANIZATION	will enjoy the income from a fund of considerable pro- portions .

		Generous gifts have been received from Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Walters	PERSON	of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, Mr.
William K. Vanderbilt	PERSON	, Mr.
James Stillman	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry C. Frick	PERSON	, and a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate who prefers to remain anonymous .

		One hundred thousand dollars from each of these men , another hundred thousand from various givers as a memorial tribute to the late
Charles F. McEim	PERSON	, and , subject to the life interest of his daughter , two hundred thousand from Mr.
McKim	PERSON	's estate these gifts bring the endowment up to a substantial sum and , so far as mere endowment can do it , give promise that the Academy will take rank among the foremost institutions of its kind .

		THE SUCCESS OF THE SEVENPENNY REPRINTS now issuing from the
Nelsons	ORGANIZATION	' standardized book - factory in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	at the rate of twenty-five thousand volumes a day is something surprising .

		It is reported that the publishers have now sold seven million volumes and that still the public is crying for more .

		Even with a liberal discount this announcement is enough to arrest the reader 's eye and to make him hope well of a nation that in - dulges so generously in the purchase of its literary masterpieces .

		Moreover , it is interesting to learn that the publishers of this popular series have invaded foreign territory with their cheap and serviceable reprints and are doing a large business in supplying the French with a '' Collection
Nel	PERSON	- son '' at a franc and a half a volume , and in print - ing for a German house a very successful edition of pocket volumes for Teutonic lovers of the inex - pensive and handy in literature .

		If this publishing enterprise accomplishes nothing more for the world 's civilization than to diminish the excessive reading of daily newspapers , it will have justified itself to mankind .

		... AN UNEXPECTED AGITATOR AGAINST UNCUT LEAVES comes into newspaper publicity in the per - son of that meditative recluse , the author of '' The House of Quiet , '' '' Beside Still Waters , '' and '' The Silent Isle . ''

		That Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	should shatter our pleasing illusions as to his hermit habits by this unlooked-for announcement that he is a busy man , that he grudges the time spent in cutting the leaves of books , and that he regards an uncut book as an '' unfinished article '' and a '' most irritating survival of barbarism , '' is indeed grievous when we had fondly pictured him as sitting of an evening in dressing-gown and slippers before his cheerful fire , paper-knife in one hand and a new book in the other , leisurely laying open its virgin pages , and protract - ing his enjoyment by cutting only as he went along .

		A hard-pressed reviewer may pardonably demand machine-trimmed volumes for his professional hand - ling ; but a dweller in the '' Silent Isle '' should take aesthetic delight in leaves whose fair margins have suffered no detriment , and whose feathered edges -LRB- after the reader 's ivory cutter has performed its function -RRB- so gently caress the hand .

		256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, AN INCENTIVE TO FRENCH NOVELISTS to ` aim high , and to be content with nothing short of the hest that is in them , has been wisely provided by the French Academy .

		At its meeting of
March 2	DATE	it was decided to found a new '' Grand Prix '' in literature , a prize of ten thousand francs , to be conferred annually on the author of a work -LRB- pub - lished within the two preceding years -RRB- in the de - partment of fiction ; or , more specifically , the book is to be a novel or other imaginative prose produc - tion , but it must be '' d ` une inspiration e ` leve'e . ''

		This is well .

		While history , poetry , criticism , philosophy , and other branches of literary art have had their public honors and recognitions in
France	LOCATION	, the novel has been left to its fate ; and this although novelists have been freely admitted to membership in the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tone of French fiction , though not so low as seems to be indicated by the bulk of yellow-covered novels that reach the out - side world , can well bear a considerable elevation .

		A BOHEMIAN TRIBUTE TO AN INDIAN AUTHOR takes the shape of a request that Dr.
Charles Alexander Eastman	PERSON	will allow the chapter on '' Barbarism and the Moral Code '' in his book '' The Soul of the Indian , '' elsewhere noticed in this issue , to be translated into the language of the Czech .

		The rare quality of this fine study of the Indian -LRB- even though he be an idealized Indian -RRB- can not fail of wide and appreciative recognition .

		The whole book ought to be translated , not only into Bohemian , but into many other languages , as a commentary on and a lesson to the Christian civilization which our Sioux author finds to be naught but an empty name .

		There is such a thing as Christianity , and there is something that is called civilization ; but the two have not been welded together , so far as he can discover .

		ANOTHER FREAK OF MISPRONUNCIATION is chron - icled in an editorial note in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' apropos of our late reference to '' misled '' and the letter it elicited from
Miss Richards	LOCATION	.

		After quoting the latter 's communication , the '' Transcript '' writer continues with a story about
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	and the word '' awry . ''

		A long-standing member of his company declared that he never heard
Mansfield	PERSON	pronounce the word otherwise than '' aw-ry , '' and indeed it is said that at a rehearsal of Ibsen 's '' Peer Gynt '' he astonished his fellow-actors by expressly insisting on that pronunciation .

		The imitative or , as the grammarians would say , the onomatopoetic quality of '' aw-ry '' does in truth have much to com - mend it , and one can readily understand
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's unwillingness to discard the word in favor of '' a-wry . ''

		ROOF-GARDEN READING-ROOMS FOR
BOSTON	LOCATION	are in prospect .

		If the plans of the trustees of the public library of that city are carried out , the old church of
St. John the Baptist	ORGANIZATION	at the North End will be bought and converted into a branch library having two stories and a roof-garden , thus provid - ing the first of what we hope may be a series of open-air reading-rooms for
Boston	LOCATION	readers .

		To the North-Enders , largely the children of sunny
Italy	LOCATION	, such a resort for physical and intellectual refreshment should prove especially welcome .

Concord	LOCATION	some three years ago was sadly marred for me by the appearance of this spot , which should be held sacred by every American and English girl and boy , for thousands of English girls and boys love '' Little Women '' and admire its author as much as do their cousins here .

		I raised my feeble voice for its preservation at the time , but it was not strong enough to be heard .

		Now that one of the many-voiced Women 's Clubs has taken the matter up , I hope that the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	will endorse and support its action .

		If every woman 's club in
America	LOCATION	will aid in the movement , and if an effort is also made to enlist sympathy in
England	LOCATION	, there is no doubt that there will soon be an
Alcott Memorial	ORGANIZATION	at Con - cord and that the reproach of the present condition of the old house will be wiped out .

		TOMBSTONES AS A SOURCE OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A unique source was recently made use of in the
Texas State Library	ORGANIZATION	for securing a bit of fugitive infor - mation .

		The day of the month of the death of former Governor
Hardin R. Runnels	PERSON	was desired .

		The year -LRB- 1873 -RRB- was noted in most biographical sketches , but neither month nor day was given .

		The historical archives of the library possessed a photograph of the grave of the former Governor , in
Bowie County	LOCATION	.

		The date on the tombstone was discernible in the photo - graph
December 25 , 1873	DATE	.

		Of course the newspapers of
1873	DATE	could have been searched , but a weary hunt was thus avoided .

		The tombstone inscription or its photograph as a source of modern contemporary history is not an immediate rival of the Etruscan or Runic remains , but it is well to remember that it will have in time its paleographical significance , as well as an oc - casional present use .

		THE DIAL 257 tfc THREE PL.AYS FOB ICOXOCL.ASTS .

		* There is far too much of writing about Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	except when Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	does it .

		The thing to do with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is to read him .

		Whatever else may be thought of him , it can not be denied that he excites thought .

		Unfortunately , also , or perhaps Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	would prefer us to say fortunately , he gen - erally excites feeling .

		And as most thought is muddled , and strong feeling always tends to a confusion of issues , the result to the read - ing public is a slightly helpful consideration of vital questions and a more or less complete misunderstanding of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		Now all this would change instantly if the reading public could be persuaded to attack Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	direct , including his Prefaces , instead of persisting in going to lectures about him .

		For Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's style certainly possesses two out of the three attributes demanded by some old-time text - books of rhetoric .

		It can surely
Jay	PERSON	claim to clearness and to force ; as for elegance , that is , as always , a matter of opinion .

		But how Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's meaning can ever be a matter of opinion is beyond our comprehension .

		His reputation for being '' difficult '' must have sprung entirely from a few jesting epigrams of his own and a great deal of over-serious , under-digested com - ment from intellectually-lazy critics .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's new book of plays has been so long on the way to us that it is more than ever superfluous to write about it at length .

		All the plays have been performed , or refused perform - ance , in
London	LOCATION	and other European cities ; and reviews of them and echoes of the bitter controversies they evoked have reached our distant shores no longer distant as regards dramatic enterprises .

		The newest thing about the new volume is therefore the Prefaces , which occupy considerably more than half its pages .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	belongs to a choice , if varied , company of English playwrights and novelists who are grouped definitely in the minds of many of us as Men of Ideas .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is one of them , and the much-discussed Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, and -LRB- with a very different emphasis -RRB- Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	also t ; belongs , '' but he is an essayist , and essayists are expected and even encouraged to have ideas ; * THE DOCTOR 'S DILEMMA , GETTING MARRIED , and THE SHEWING-UP OF BLANCO POSNET .

		By
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Brentano 's whereas novelists and playwrights occasionally subsist without them , and many novel-readers even go so far as strongly to resent being obliged to moderate the romantic pleasure of reading with the unpleasant scrutiny of life in its unromantic and problematical phases .

		One difference between Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and his colleagues is that he has learned rather better than they , in the bitter school of experience , to distrust the reading public 's understanding .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	may conceivably have abandoned the writing of essays and returned to the writing of novels , in order to widen his public . ''

		The
New Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, '' whatever else may be said of it , stands a chance of being at least begun by many persons who would keep their distance from un-sugar-coated sociological dis - cussions like `` New Worlds for Old '' and '' The Future of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Of course many tentative investigators of `` The New Machia - velli '' will resent the peculiar combination therein effected by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, and abandon him entirely hereafter .

		But , though he has perhaps gone too far technically in his latest attempt to make the novel-reading public think , the new genre has come to stay ; a small but influential section of the reading public recog - nizes that it is , to quote one of them , '' a deadly delight '' to think , and they refuse to substitute therefor the placid pretty interest evoked by a Christy-girl 's love affairs , the tense excitement born of a
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	man-hunt , or any of the fifty-seven other inanities cleverly em - ployed often with a quite admirable tech - nique , a style worthy of clothing better things by that curiously knowing person generally described as a Best-Seller .

		Realizing -LRB- as being of at least average in - telligence , he can hardly help doing if he ever reads his press-notices or engages admiring readers in conversation -RRB- the rarity of clear thinking , the muddle-headedness that so often accompanies the most earnest efforts to assim - ilate new ideas , and the strength of the tradition that one goes to the theatre to be amused and reads plays as a poor substitute for going to the theatre , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has astutely armed him - self with a two-edged sword : the Play and the Preface .

		The frivolous reader in search of mere amusement will undeniably find it in any
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	play , together with hints and innuendoes , which , if he be not an inveterate `` skipper , '' must give him a few moments ' pause .

		The clever , clear-headed reader does not need the Preface , but he will take infinite delight in its cleverness ; one valuable bird has thus been 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, hit with two stones .

		The earnest plodding reader will sigh with relief at the prefatory prospect of finding out , not without much plod - ding effort , what that queer Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is really driving at .

		And , lastly , the reader who can - not '' go '' plays may be tempted by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's brilliant resistless logic , and merciless even - tempered criticism , to `` go '' Prefaces .

		The fame of the Prefaces is their justifica - tion ; it is also the astute Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's justifi - cation for having developed them , in his new book , to a bulk and an elaborateness and fine finish of argument that make them equally im - portant with the plays which they introduce . ''

		The Doctor 's Dilemma , '' the first of the three plays in the new volume , is a five-act comedy , which , besides setting forth and developing an extremely interesting , because human as well as medical , dilemma , presents studies both instruc - tive and entertaining of five doctors , one wealthy patent-medicine vendor , one artist , one jour - nalist , one ugly and intelligent serving - woman , and one beautiful , determined , and efficient if not intelligent Lady .

		The Preface knocks down the idol popularly known as the nobility of the medical profession , throws all the blame for present conditions on an anti-Socialistic public , and thus sets up the idol again higher than before , in so-called paradoxical
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	fashion .

		Vivisection , vaccination , fumigation , the eating of meat , and other popular misconceptions are discussed en route to a remedy for everything , including poverty ; that remedy being Organi - zation and
Public Control	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essay is a splen - did bit of controversial writing , and its incidental wit is delicious .

		It is worth reading for one epithet alone , employed when Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	char - acterizes the average doctor as '' made of the same clay as the ignorant , shallow , credulous , half-miseducated , pecuniarily anxious people who call him in . '' ''

		Half-miseducated '' is a creation of genius .

		In both this and the Preface to '' Getting Married , '' which is introduced by a very fran ' k discussion of the marriage question , there are many phrases taken bodily from the plays , and all the best points of the Prefaces are incipient in the plays for those who can read a little between lines . ''

		The She wing - up of Blanco Posnet '' serves Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as a horrible example of the intelli - gence of an English Stage Censor .

		The preface , which is more than twice as long as the one-act drama it precedes , contains a lively account of how a '' Joint Select Committee '' of Lords and Commoners investigated the whole subject of the Censorship , including Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, who states plainly that he made the committee '' wildly angry , '' and adds that only '' public experience and skill in acting '' enabled him `` to maintain an appearance of imperturbable good-humor '' when , in fact , he was '' equally furious . ''

		The play which follows is the most striking in the new group .

		Instead of the company of con - ventional middle-class English people that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	usually assembles for his dramatic pur - poses , we have here a mob of riotous , half - drunken cow-punchers in a Western American mining camp , intent , with the aid of some women as bad as themselves , on hanging a horse-thief .

		In
Blanco Posnet	PERSON	's plain-spoken view of the situation , he is up against a '' rotten jury '' in a '' rotten town '' in a '' rotten world '' ; and he naturally sees God in terms of the `` rot - ten game '' of life that they are all playing , a conception which the Censor held to be blas - phemous and wished to expurgate .

		But when
Blanco	PERSON	, most reluctantly , discovers that , besides the `` rotten game , '' there is also a `` great game , '' he is '' for it every time '' ; and he launches forth at once upon an eager , vivid account of his new view of God and the '' jobs '' He has for them all to do .

		The sheriff and the jury do not understand his change of heart very well , and the Censor must have shared their difficulty .

		He may have been somewhat con - fused by the unfamiliar Western American atmosphere and the American slang .

		There is a sort of primitive force and fire in the one short , lurid scene of this piece , with its quick play of comedy , pathos , and tragedy , its elemental passions , and its picturesque uncouth imagery , that suggests
Synge	PERSON	's `` Playboy '' ; and it is in - teresting to know that the
Irish National Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, which has brought
Synge	PERSON	's plays before the world , has given '' The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet '' a completely triumphant public per - formance . ''

		Getting Married '' is as refreshingly comic as anything Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has written ; '' The Doctor 's Dilemma '' is as deliberately and pains - takingly fair-minded .

		Dubedat and Emmy and Sir
Patrick	PERSON	, the Mayoress and
Collins	PERSON	-LRB- the green-grocer-alderman -RRB- ,
Blanco	PERSON	and
Elder Daniels	PERSON	, are notable additions to the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	gallery ; but so is practically every character in the three plays .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has gained in ex - pressiveness without losing his subtlety .

		He has chosen bigger issues than usual , and he hits a little straighter and a little harder , but not so strenuously as to spoil his impersonal enjoyment of the fray .

		More people than the Censorship committee will go '' dancing mad ''
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 259 over this his latest exuberance .

		And it is very small credit to Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	that '' public experi - ence and skill in acting '' enable him '' to main - tain an appearance of imperturbable good - humor '' ; for in the end Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	always wins , a consummation conducing to serenity , gaiety , audacity , and full appreciation of the '' deadly delight '' of straight thinking .

		We have tried to keep to the main point : that the thing to do is to read Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		Comparative rating of a man 's mature works means little .

		It is enough to say here that this man is too conscientious to fall below his level , and too much alive not to rise with each fresh achievement to a keener , finer , kindlier appre - ciation of life and his relation to it .

		We have waited long and eagerly for these plays .

		Even those of us who are doomed to go '' dancing mad '' over them will admit , we think , that they were worth waiting for .

		OF PUBLISHING AXD PUBLISHERS .

		* The manifest opportunity for interesting literary anecdote that offers itself to the writer on the history of book-publishing and book - selling has been grasped with both hands by Mr.
Frank A. Mumby	PERSON	in his copious work on '' The Romance of Book Selling . ''

		Nearly five hundred compact octavo pages are filled with instructive and entertaining matter collected from sources whose unsuspected abundance is revealed in an appended bibliography -LRB- compiled by Mr.
W. H. Peet	PERSON	-RRB- containing about six hun - dred items .

		But the title chosen for his book by Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	is a little misleading , since it is to English book publishing that he almost ex - clusively confines his attention , although a per - functory chapter of twelve pages on '' The Beginnings of the Book World '' opens the volume .

		In his Preface , however , he explains the real plan of the work , which is to give , for the first time , something like a connected and adequate history of the trade in books in his own country . ''

		Ten ordinary histories of kings and courtiers , '' said
Carlyle	PERSON	, '' were well exchanged against ' the tenth part of one good History of Booksellers . ''

		This saying had been so often met with by Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	that a.t last he felt ashamed to face it again until he had done some - thing to remove the reproach that seemed to lie * THE ROMANCE OF BOOK SELLING .

		hidden in the words , since he himself had under - taken a series of '' Histories of Kings and Courtiers . ''

		With a preliminary glance at the baked clay tablets of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	, which we are wont to regard as the beginnings of literature although we have no assurance that recorded speech may not date back hundreds or even thousands of years earlier , the author dwells more at length on what little is known of the book trade in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The rigors of censorship under some of the Roman emperors are briefly recalled .

		Domitian , ac - cording to Suetonius , not only went so far as to put the historian
Hermogenes	PERSON	of
Tarsus	LOCATION	to death because of certain passages in that author 's writings to which the tyrant objected , but he even crucified the copyists who had been engaged on the work .

		Concerning the business relations between authors and publishers in classic times we are left in the dark , with ex - pert opinion about evenly divided on the ques - tion whether or not the author received any more tangible returns than fame from the publication of his books .

		With no copyright law , and with the multiplication of copies reduced to the simple process of transcribing , by cheap slave labor , it is difficult to see how any satisfactory system of royalties could have been devised .

		Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	sides with the negative and believ.es the author to have received no payment from his publisher .

		But in a letter from
Cicero	LOCATION	to
Atticus	LOCATION	, as quoted in this connection , we read : '' You have sold my discourse on Ligarius so well that I shall entrust you with this duty for all my future works . ''

		Is that exactly the lan - guage in which the astute Tully would have written to a publisher with whom his relations were merely those of friendship and a common interest in the cause of letters ?

		The bulk of Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	's work concerns itself , as already indicated , with the history and traditions of the English book trade , and its pages are enriched with the names and achieve - ments of such famous masters of that trade as
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	,
John Day	PERSON	,
Jacob Tonson	PERSON	,
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	,
Edward Cave	PERSON	, and the Blackwoods ,
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	, and Longmans of a more recent period .

		The first beginnings , too , of the his - toric
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Company are traced in the penumbral antiquity of five centuries ago ; and the earliest copyright law of the realm , or , in fact , of any country , the Act of Parliament of the year
1709	DATE	, is duly recorded .

		Also , the history of the publication of such important works as the English Bible ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, and poems ,
Milton	PERSON	's '' Paradise Lost , '' and
Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary , receives appropriate at - tention from the author .

		The final chapter , devoted to `` Publishers of To-day , '' contains an account of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	, the
Murray publishing-house	ORGANIZATION	, the
Bohn Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, and the fortunes of other recent enterprises in the book world , closing with a review of the rapid rise of Mr.
William Heinemann	PERSON	to that command - ing position in the publishing business which was fitly recognized in his recent election to the presidency of the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		An instructive glimpse of the bookseller , or stationer , of the early seventeenth century is given in George Wither 's ''
Schollers Purga	PERSON	- tory , '' where both the honest and the dishonest dealer are quaintly described .

		The honest stationer is thus pictured in a passage quoted by Mr.
Murnby	PERSON	: '' An honest Stationer is he , that exercizeth his mys - tery -LRB- whether it be in printing , bynding , or selling of Bookes -RRB- with more respect to the glory of GOD , and the publike advantage , than to his owne commodity : and is both an ornament , and a profitable member of a civill Commonwealth .

		He is the Caterer that gathers to - gether provision to satisfy the curious appetite of the
Soule	PERSON	, and is carefull to his powre that whatsoever he provides shal be such as may not poyson or distemper the understanding .

		And , seeing the
State	ORGANIZATION	- intrusteth him with the disposing of those Bookes which may both profitt and hurt , as they are applyed , -LRB- like a discreet Apothecary in selling poysnous druggs -RRB- he observes by whom , and to what purpose , such bookes are likely to be bought up , before he will deliver them out of his hands .

		If he be a Printer he makes conscience to exem - plefy his
Coppie	PERSON	, i.e. , to compose his book fayrely , and truly .

		If he be a Bookebynder ; he is carefull his work may bee strong and serviceable .

		If he be a seller of Bookes , he is no meere Bookeseller -LRB- that is -RRB- one who sel - leth meerely ynck and paper bundled up together for his owne advantage only ; but he is the
Chapman	PERSON	of Arts , of wisdom , and of much experience for a little money .

		He would not publish a booke tending to schisme , or prophannesse , for the greatest gain ; and if you see in his shopp , any bookes vaine or impertinent it is not so much to be imputed to his fault , as to the vanity of the Tymes : For when bookes come forth allowed by authority , he holds it his duty , rather to sell them , than to censure them : Yet , he meddles as little as he can , with such as he is truly perswaded are pernitious , or altogether unprofitable . ''

		It is doubtless not generally known that as early as
1736	DATE	an association of authors , or , as it was formally named , a '' Society for the Encouragement of Learning , '' was organized by certain men of letters actuated by the same motives that were to call into being a similar society after the lapse of a century and a half .

		The benevolent purpose was '' to assist authors in the publication , and to secure them the entire profits of their own works . ''

		No less a personage than the
Duke of Richmond	ORGANIZATION	acted as president of this association , and on its committee of management were other noblemen as well as scholars and authors of repute .

		After a fine flourish of trumpets it began with a member - ship of more than a hundred , its secretary being one
Alexander Gordon	PERSON	, who had already , we are told , '' made a trial of all the ways by which a man could get an honest livelihood . ''

		That the book-sellers looked askance at this hopeful band of
Encouragers of Learning	ORGANIZATION	, and that its cor - porate existence covered no more than thirteen years of heroic struggle and desperate effort , does not surprise us now in the retrospect , however laudable its purpose and however dis - interested its management .

		Few books , and none of the first importance , seem to have come in the way of the Society for publication , though it is comforting to learn from an account based on its manuscript volumes of '' Proceed - ings , '' now in the British Museum , that the pro- moters of the enterprise '' closed their humane and honoured exertions by balancing the ac - counts of the association and bestowing the resi - due of their funds upon that noble charity , the
Foundling Hospital	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this time the
Duke of Leeds	ORGANIZATION	was President , and the sum so congenially appropriated was < 24 12s .

		the last legacy from the Foundlings of Literature to the hardly more forlorn Foundlings of Benevolence . ''

		Passing now to a considerably later period , we read concerning
Henry George Bohn	PERSON	, held in grateful remembrance by many a classicist , that at least nine collections or `` libraries , '' besides the set of translations from the Greek and Latin , bore his name . ''

		Some six hundred vohimes altogether standard works of every country in
Europe	LOCATION	were added by
Bohn	PERSON	before he retired , after doing ' as much for liter - ature , ' said
Emerson	PERSON	, ' as railroads have done for inter - nal intercourse . '

		Bohn himself selected most of the volumes included , and the list furnishes striking proof of his immense knowledge of European literature .

		His linguistic accomplishments he could speak five modern languages , besides being a Greek and Latin scholar were here of the utmost service to him , and also enabled him to translate several of the volumes which are still in - cluded in the series of ' Foreign Classics . '

		He contri - buted in various ways to many other volumes in his libraries , besides writing for the Philobiblon Society The Origin and Progress of Printing ' -LRB- 1857 -RRB- and < A Biography and Bibliography of Shakespeare ' -LRB- 1863 -RRB- . ''

		Among matters of miscellaneous interest in Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	's generously inclusive volume is an account of the invention of the famous
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , whose combined toughness , thin - ness , and opaqueness are the wonder of the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 book world .

		It was in
1875	DATE	that , through the energy of Mr.
Frowde	PERSON	, the secret was discovered by persistent experimentation , and an edition of the
Bible	LOCATION	was published similar in all respects to the two dozen copies printed in
1842	DATE	on paper brought by .

		an Oxford graduate from
India	LOCATION	, and never before successfully imitated .

		Except to the officials of the
Wolvercote Mills	PERSON	, the paper still remains a mystery , and in the place of its manufacture no workman is allowed to understand more than one of the steps that lead to its production .

		In conclusion , it may be said that Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	's is undoubtedly the fullest and most generally informing book that has yet appeared on the rise and progress of English publishing and book-selling .

		Its illustrations are many and well - chosen , and its thirty-eight-page biblio - graphy -LRB- reprinted , with additions , from '' Notes and Queries '' -RRB- is of an exhaustiveness that ought to satisfy even the most enthusiastic specialist .

		AMERICAX FOLK-SONGS .

		* Most text books on literature begin by defin - ing their subject in a way that excludes the primal form of literature oral literature .

		Folk-songs are one kind of oral literature .

		Professor
Francis J. Child	PERSON	's great collection of '' English and Scottish Popular Ballads '' was published at intervals from
1882	DATE	to
1898	DATE	, the final part appearing after the editor 's death .

		For some ten years before
1882	DATE	, as he tells us in Part I. , Professor Child had been endeavor - ing '' to stimulate collection from tradition in
England	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	'' ; and he was much disappointed that the returns were so meagre .

		Later developments have made it clear that Child 's original impression was cor - rect , and that many excellent ballad versions were in existence in
America	LOCATION	that he had failed to secure .

		Indeed , a few striking versions of this kind came to him after the above words were in print , and appeared in the later parts of his work .

		Noteworthy among these are : `` The Hangman 's Tree '' -LRB- p. xxv .

		in the one - volume edition of Child -RRB- , a form of No. 95 , '' The Maid Freed from the Gallows '' ; and a version of No. 79 , '' The Wife of Usher 's Well , '' -LRB- in the one - volume Child -RRB- , into which has come * COWBOY SONGS , AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS .

		Both of these were obtained among illiterate people by
Miss Backus of North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		It has long been known that the folk-songs flourish among some isolated communities in the
Appalachian Mountains	LOCATION	.

		Professor
H. G. Shearin	PERSON	of
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	,
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Ken	PERSON	- tucky , is an enthusiastic collector , and he has persuaded several others to give their treas - ures into his keeping .

		He writes the present reviewer that ''
Eastern Kentucky	LOCATION	is a surpris - ingly rich field . ''

		The entire collection now in his hands consists of at least 274 separate folk - songs song-ballads , lyrics , dance-songs , jigs , play-songs , and number-songs . ''

		In this esti - mate , variants are not counted , though '' it is very hard , at times , to distinguish between an independent ballad and a variant . ''

		This is an astonishing body of folk-poetry , and should be published in full .

		Child 's great work contains 305 separate ballads .

		Rev.
W. E. Barton	PERSON	, of
Oak Park	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, collected the songs of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountains nearly twenty-five years ago , when living in that region , preserving both the words and the music .

		But we have made a mistake in thinking of isolated mountain regions as almost the sole places where American folk-songs can be found .

		In the '' Journal of American Folk-Lore '' for
1905	DATE	, Mr.
Phillips Barry	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	published nearly fifty octavo pages of good versions of fourteen of the ballads in Child , accompanied by the airs to which he found them sung .

		These were collected during two years , the best of them coming from
Vermont	LOCATION	, the greater number from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		These versions were wait - ing discovery at
Child	ORGANIZATION	's very doorstep .

		Mr.
Barry	PERSON	squarely opposes the usual view when he says : '' Unrecognized in its extent , if not indeed unknown as an element in American literature , is a widespread undercurrent of traditional folk-song .

		Popular poetry , even of the better sort , is by no means yet dead ; it lives on in every part of our broad land , as well in the heart of the populous city as on the lonely hillside ... Scattered over the country , versions of several ballads ... have been known to collectors for some time , supposed to be the last fading flowers of popular poetry in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		It seems , however , not to have occurred to the collectors to draw an infer - ence from the excellent condition in which they found them preserved .

		A ballad extinct , or nearly so , ap - pears in a short and mutilated form ; if it still retains the main facts of the story , and especially if the air has been preserved , its life is not yet ended , or near an end .

		Xew
England	LOCATION	, the oldest portion of our country , contrary to what has been supposed , is still the home of a large amount of traditional folk-song , much of it of the best order . ''

		262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, In the same Journal for
1909	DATE	Mr.
Barry	PERSON	says concerning the ballad-tunes : '' The melodies to which folk-songs are sung in
America	LOCATION	are of infinite variety , and in many instances rarely beautiful .

		To this source the composer of the future , who shall found a school of American music , will turn for his inspiration . ''

		Professor
H. M. Belden	PERSON	, of the
University of Missouri	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Missouri	LOCATION	Folk-Lore Society have found more than 150 different songs in oral tradition in that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Through his pupils the present writer has obtained some excellent versions of older British ballads , for example , an
Indiana	LOCATION	variant of '' The Two Brothers '' that is more effective than any form given in Child .

		Nearly or quite thirty of the choicest ballads in Child 's collection live in oral tradition in different parts of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Among those most common in the
North Central States	LOCATION	are : No. 4 , '' Lady Isabel and the Elf - Knight '' -LRB- in
America	LOCATION	the cruel husband has no supernat - ural character -RRB- ; 12 , ''
Lord Randal	PERSON	'' ; 73 , `` Lord
Thomas	PERSON	and Fair Annet -LSB- and the Brown Girl -RSB- '' ; 84 , `` Bonny -LSB- or Cruel -RSB-
Barbara Allen	PERSON	. ''

		Another mistake in the study of our folk - songs has been to give attention too exclusively to ballads of British origin , especially the older ones to be found in Child .

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	has insisted strenuously that the making of ballads is `` a closed account '' -LRB- `` The Begin - nings of Poetry , '' p. 163 -RRB- .

		We have obediently closed the account by shutting our ears to the many songs of native origin current in tradition .

		These are inferior in literary value to the older ballads , but they deserve our attention .

		More than forty years ago I heard the bal - lad of ''
Springfield Mountain	LOCATION	'' sung in
West	LOCATION	- ern
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		It began : '' On
Springfield Mountain	LOCATION	there did dwell A lovely youth I knew full well .

		Timmy-rye , timmy-ray , timmy-riddy-iddy-ay . ''

		Some twenty different versions of this song have been published , Mr.
Barry	PERSON	also printing several melodies to which it is sung . ''

		The
Springfield	LOCATION	Weekly Republican '' of
Oct. 8 , 1908	DATE	, prints the original poem from which this song is believed to have sprung .

		It tells of the death , from the bite of a rattlesnake , of
Timothy Merrick	PERSON	of
Wilbraham	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in
1761	DATE	, when '' very nigh marridge . ''

		Many versions of ''
Springfield Mountain	LOCATION	'' contain laughable touches ; but the best ones are both more musical and more effective than the original poem , and they tell the story in a very different way .

		This song is now widely diffused ; it has been found in tradition in many of the States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		In commenting on this song , the '' Spring - field Republican '' suggests a theory concerning the making of our older ballads , when it says that '' it was not until -LSB- the - ballads -RSB- had been repeated from sire to son down several centuries , until they had been filtered , as it were , through many better minds than those of the authors , that the flaws were eliminated and the folk - songs as we know them now had emerged . ''

		The ballad of `` Young Charlotte , '' who is frozen to death while being driven by her lover to attend a party , is also widely diffused , but the different versions agree closely .

		The present writer obtained the song in
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Barry	PERSON	tells me that the author is
William Carter	PERSON	, of
Benson	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		Professor
John A. Lomax	PERSON	's interesting and valuable volume of '' Cowboy Songs '' consists mainly of songs that originated in
America	LOCATION	.

		A letter from ex-President
Roosevelt	PERSON	commends the book to public favor .

		Though all the songs included have been found in the possession of the cowboys , the themes are widely various .

		Logging , the saw-mill , Indian warfare , the Mexican War , the Civil War , trapping , gold - mining , stage-driving , railroading , all contribute songs .

		One song is the meditation of a
Boston	LOCATION	burglar in prison at
Charleston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	; another has its scene in
Australia	LOCATION	; one of the many outlaw ballads tells of robbing on '' the famed
Hounslow	LOCATION	heath . ''

		One ballad glorifies
Jesse James	PERSON	.

		It is some - what widely known .

		Miss
Louise R. Bascom	PERSON	tells us , in the '' Journal of American Folk - Lore '' for
1909	DATE	, that the heroic ballads of
Western North Carolina	LOCATION	'' cluster for the most part around
Jesse James	PERSON	. ''

		The song which she prints has much in common with that in
Lomax	LOCATION	.

		I have heard before of the existence of a group of ballads about
Jesse James	PERSON	.

		I am inclined to conjecture that some of the other songs of outlaw life have been transferred to
Jesse James	PERSON	.

		We know that some English ballads became attached to
Robin Hood	PERSON	that did not originally concern him .

		Professor
Lomax	PERSON	prints ''
Young Charlotte	PERSON	, '' and a stammering version of ''
Springfield Mountain	LOCATION	'' entitled `` Rattlesnake A Ranch Haying Song . ''

		Here is a specimen stanza : '' O
John	PERSON	, O Joh-wa-wahn , Why did you go-wo-wo Way down in the mea-we-we-dow So far to mo-wo-wow ? '

		To my rattle , to my roo-rah-ree ! ''

		THE DIAL 263 American versions of the older British bal - lads seem to have been left out of this volume of set purpose , though '' The Old Man under the Hill '' is a form of Child No. 278 , '' The Farmer 's Curst Wife . ''

		The first song in the book , '' The Dying Cowboy , '' has a strange history .

		Mr.
Barry	PERSON	has pointed out that it is a transformation of a song well known in the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast states as '' The Burial at Sea . ''

		The following parallel stanzas show how the ocean song has suffered a land-change into something new and strange : '' Oh , bury me not in the deep , deep sea , TV here the billow 's shroud shall roll o'er me , Where no light can break through the dark , cold wave , Or the sun shine sweetly upon my grave . '' ''

		Oh , bury me not on the lone prairie , Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me , Where the buzzard beats and the wind goes free , Oh , bury me not on the lone prairie . ''

		The cowboy songs proper are the most import - ant element in the book .

		They vary greatly , and are of unequal merit ; but they all have an interesting flavor of real life .

		Three of them portray the Last Judgment in striking fashion under the symbol of a great `` round-up '' -LRB- pp. 248 , 18 , 282 -RRB- .

		Some of the songs show stinging satiric power , e.g. , '' Hell in
Texas	LOCATION	. ''

		In the case of eighteen of the songs , the mel - odies to which they are sung are also printed .

		There are many literary echoes in the book . ''

		The Last Longhorn '' imitates the cadences of '' Bingen on the Rhine . ''

		Kipling begot `` The Boozer , '' though some one else composed it .

		Professor
Lomax	PERSON	has been appointed by
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	''
Sheldon Fellow	PERSON	for the Investigation of American Ballads . ''

		He de - sires to collect folk-songs of every kind , lumber songs , sailors ' chanteys , mining songs , army songs , fishing songs , etc. .

		He may be addressed at the
University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	,
Austin	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	.

		He is especially interested at present in the native songs of the negroes .

		He says : '' No work worth mentioning has been done in this field , and both the words and the music of the negro ballads are of far more intrinsic in - terest even than the cowboy songs themselves . ''


ALBERT H. TOLMAN	PERSON	.

		THE first part of the long-awaited third edition of Dr.
J. G. Frazer	PERSON	's '' Golden Bough '' will be published im - mediately by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		This division of the work deals with '' The Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings , '' and in the present revised and enlarged edition it occupies two substantial volumes .

		THE RISE OF THE ELDER PITT .

		* The statesmen of
England	LOCATION	are frequently more than mere politicians they belong to other guilds as well .

		Though much of their strength is spent in the service of state or party , they have time and energy left for other labors of serious intellectual character , for history , philosophy , theology , and literature .

		This fact has long been accepted as a common - place , and the world no longer expresses sur - prise when
Lord Morley	PERSON	or Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	adds another title to the current book list .

		Among these literary statesmen ,
Lord Rose	PERSON	- bery has long held high rank .

		Recently the genial peer has been thought of in connection with a serious political mission : he has under - taken to save the historic constitution of En - gland by reforming and reconstituting the upper house .

		It would seem that the task of convert - ing the nation , and particularly his fellow peers , to his present views would leave little time for historical research ; but this has not been the case .

		During the past few months there has come from the press a new biography from his hand , this time a study in the early life of
Lord Chatham	LOCATION	.

		It is written in the author 's brilliant though somewhat unconventional En - glish , replete with enjoyable humor and striking characterizations , which make every page de - lightful reading .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	has a rare faculty for finding the kernel of interest , and for presenting it in a manner that never fails to leave an impression .

		Digressions are frequent , and sometimes they carry us far afield ; but the subject is broadly stated , and the discussions of
Pitt	PERSON	's '' connections '' often throw interesting side lights on the main theme .

		Of the political battles in which the author was engaged when the book was taking form , we have almost no echoes ; perhaps the only instance is in a paragraph where he discusses the cabinet changes in
1746	DATE	and adds half regretfully , '' The great posts were mainly given to peers , while a peerage is now as regards office in the nature of an impediment , if not a disqualification .

		In those days an industrious duke , or even one like Graf ton who was not industrious , could have almost what he chose . ''

		At first thought one should be inclined to question the need of a new study of
Chatham	LOCATION	's career .

		Biographies both brief and extensive are accessible , notably the three scholarly volumes of von Ruville and the earlier work of * LORD
CHATHAM	LOCATION	, His Early Life and Connections .

		By
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		264 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, `` who wrote his biography in quarto and who may be discriminated without diffi - culty from the genius of that name . ''

		Three reasons are advanced to justify the present undertaking : the need of a more sympathetic analysis , the need of a study directed toward the human side of the man , and the discovery of new materials .

		Englishmen have not been satisfied with the cold searching analysis of von Ruville .

		A politician who was not always strictly honest , an orator who was constantly striving after theatrical effects , can this be the real
Pitt	PERSON	?

		Von
Ruville	ORGANIZATION	's belief that the prospect of receiv - ing large legacies determined
Pitt	PERSON	's actions at certain important junctures is plausible , though scarcely proved .

		Nor do Englishmen like to think of
Pitt	PERSON	as taking refuge with his old com - panion , the gout , when circumstances threatened to force the adoption of an American policy that he had formerly condemned .

		The an - nouncement that
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	was preparing a book on
Chatham	LOCATION	was , therefore , good news .

		Peculiarly fitting , it also seemed , that one who has himself directed the empire , one who knows the practical difficulties of statesmanship , should undertake the work .

		It may be questioned , however , whether much has really been gained in the matter of inter - pretation : the theory of ethical weakness has apparently been replaced by one that supposes mental weakness . ''

		It is generally the gout or its allies which disable him ; but later it is a disorder akin to if not identical with insanity ... From his ancestors , most probably the Governor , who , we infer , was a free liver in a tropi - cal climate , he derived the curse of gout .

		From the same progenitor he inherited a nervous , violent tem - perament , and some taint of madness . ''

		The conclusion is cautiously stated , but there can be no doubt as to the impression intended .

		The author states on the authority of
Lord Shelburne	LOCATION	that there was much madness in the
Pitt	PERSON	family .

		The hypothesis is supported by the initial chapter of the work , on the eccentricities of the
Pitts	LOCATION	.

		It is a dismal story of domestic warfare , in which the hand of each seems to be turned against all the others .

		On this subject the author has been able to offer fresh informa - tion , drawn chiefly from a family document written by
Pitt	PERSON	's nephew , the first Lord Camel - ford , for the enlightenment of his son .

		It is a terrible arraignment by one who was clearly in position to know , and who seems to have hated his relatives most cordially . ''

		Putting this violent prejudice on one side , this memorial ... though too intimate for complete pub - lication , is a priceless document .

		... It may be inac - curate , and biased and acrid , but it presents the family circle from within by one of themselves , and no more vivid picture can exist of that strange cockatrice brood of Pitts . ''

		It is difficult to make allowance for prejudice , and it is to be feared that
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	's use of the Camelford document is not always criti - cal .

		There should be little hesitancy about accepting the facts that are given in the docu - ment , but the impressions and opinions of an ungrateful and hostile kinsman should be used with the greatest caution .

		It was not
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	's purpose to write a complete biography of
William Pitt	PERSON	.

		Such a work , he tells us , can not be written ; except for the early years of his public career , the materials are wanting . ''

		Of his conversations , of his private life nothing , or little more than nothing , remains .

		Except on the one genial occasion on which
Burke	PERSON	saw him tooling a
Jim	PERSON	- whiskey down to
Stowe	PERSON	, we scarcely see a human touch .

		After his accession to office in
1756	DATE	, his letters of pompous and sometimes abject circumlocution , intended partly to deceive his correspondent and partly to baffle the authorities of the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	, give no clue to his mind .

		He wrote an ordinary note as
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	wrote an ordinary couplet .

		Even his love-letters are incurably stilted .

		There is no ease , no frankness , no self - revelation in anything that he wrote after he embarked actively in politics . ''

		The study is therefore limited to the earlier years of
Pitt	PERSON	's career , the long struggle to get into office .

		It closes when success is attained .

		Of those great years from
1757	DATE	to
1761	DATE	, when
Pitt	PERSON	was one of the dominating personal forces of the world , we are told nothing .

		But a man 's public career is not biography , as Lord Rose - bery defines the term ; it is history .

		This limitation is a source of weakness as well as of strength : it gives unity and consistence to the work , but it also deprives it of a satisfactory ending .

		Just as the plot begins to thicken , the narrative ceases .

		After leading us to the threshold of a mighty career , the author sud - denly stops without any attempt at further exploration .

		The story , so far as it is told , is related with detailed completeness .

		It is the old story of intrigue and bickering and political immoral - ity , one that is familiar to every student of eighteenth-century life and history .

		On the side of the narrative the author has brought out very little that has not long been known ; his contribution is rather to be sought in his interpretation of the facts and in his attitude toward the important political characters of the time .

		George II .

		is painted in more favorable
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 colors than usual ; he is even credited with the possession of certain kingly virtues .

		The
Grenvilles	PERSON	come in for severe treatment , more severe , perhaps , than the family really deserves .

		An attempt is made to do fuller justice to
Newcastle	LOCATION	, but with slight success .

		The char - acter of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	is traced with strong , firm lines : his is the grand soul struggling to realize a mighty ambition in sordid surroundings and in the companionship of mean men .

		In a study devoted principally to the human side of the subject , the author could , of course , not fail to find certain prominent weaknesses ; but they are treated as unimportant . ''

		Whatever his failings may have been , his country - men have refused , and rightly refused , to take heed of them ... With
Pitt	PERSON	, as with
Nelson	PERSON	, his country will not count flaws .

		What do they matter ?

		How are they visible in the sunlight of achievement ?

		A country must cherish and guard its heroes . ''


LAURENCE M. LARSON	PERSON	.

		Ax AMERICAX VIEW OF THE MENACE OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		* Since the debut of
America	LOCATION	as a world-power , her pride in that new position has been mani - fested in several directions , not least of which is the literature on
International Relations	ORGANIZATION	.

		To ''
America	LOCATION	's Foreign Policy , '' by `` A Diplo - matist , '' recently reviewed in these columns , is now to be added a book by
Captain Mahan on International Conditions	ORGANIZATION	, which may be set down as his tenth volume dealing more or less directly with world-politics .

		The burden of this volume , though it is not set forth too obtrusively , is the menace of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As introductory to this , the author recounts a number of facts in regard to the origin and character of present international groupings in
Europe	LOCATION	, which , though more or less common - place in history , are necessary as a basis for an understanding of the present predominance of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Only within the nineteenth century has she attained nationality and thereby be - come capable of playing an effective part in world-politics .

		The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial community since
1870	DATE	now forces her to seek new markets and to control them to her advantage .

		This is the meaning of her dreadnoughts , and those of her ally ,
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Hitherto it has been the policy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to maintain a two-power stand - ard in her navy ; but that is passing , and will * THE INTEREST OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	IN INTERNATIONAL CON - DITIONS .

A. T. Mahan	PERSON	, D.C.L. , LL.D. , Captain in

		be no longer possible .

		The naval expenditure of
Germany	LOCATION	has risen from five millions a year in
1875	DATE	to a hundred millions a year .

		The relative decline of the naval power of
Great Britain	LOCATION	is not a matter of indifference to the
United	ORGANIZATION	JStates , for the rivalry between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	has already reached the danger-point .

		More than this ,
Germany	LOCATION	is none too friendly to us , being irritated by our two leading prin - ciples of external policy , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and the Open Door in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		This was clearly evidenced in her attitude toward us in the Spanish War , and nothing has happened since to convince us that she is any more friendly to-day .

		The only two nations capable of helping
Great Britain	LOCATION	are the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	; and this they must do in the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	by main - taining the balance of power there .

		The fact that the balance of naval power in
Europe	LOCATION	ties the German and British fleets to the
North Sea	LOCATION	, where they can watch each other , protects our own
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast and justifies shifting our naval force to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , that is our greatest danger-line now , for it is there the open-door policy is likely to be attacked ; and the attitude of
Japan	LOCATION	on that question is becom - ing open to doubt , if not suspicion , in view of recent negotiations between her and
Russia	LOCATION	and the rebuff to our proposal to neutralize the Manchurian Railway .

		All of these facts would seem to dictate the
Pacific	LOCATION	rather than the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as the station for our fleet .

		Such , in outline , are the contentions of Cap - tain
Mahan	PERSON	with regard to the present situation in world-politics .

		The two definite things that stand out prominently in the book are the men - ace of
Germany	LOCATION	, and the desirability of shifting our naval forces to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The author makes no reference to a '' naval program , '' that is , the building of more and more American battleships ; but that he considers such a policy advisable is not an unnatural conclusion from his fears and his Pacific -LRB- not '' pacific '' -RRB- policy .

		But there are a few forces now playing upon world-politics of which Captain
Mahan	PERSON	has not taken account .

		One of these is the peace move - ment , which has not only attained reputable proportions , but can no longer be counted as a negligible factor .

		Another is the prospective pacification of
Ireland	LOCATION	, which will add to the strength of
Great Britain	LOCATION	fully as much as the construction of several battleships .

		Still another is the growth of Socialism , especially in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In speaking of the naval pro- 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, gramme of
Germany	LOCATION	, the author says : '' This is no freak of a government , however little par - liamentary to our notions that of
Germany	LOCATION	is .

		It is the expression of the will of a people . ''

		That probability is true just now ; but the opponents of militarism are many , and are increasing .

		Socialism is international , having regard for the welfare of working men every - where , and war it regards as destructive of that welfare .

		It would be no wild prophecy to say that the peace of the world is practically assured from the day the Socialists control the German parliament .

		If given a fair showing , that day may not be far distant .

		At any rate , for awhile let us spend as much money on education as we do on militarism .

		FICTION .

		* The old , old story of a man 's life , beginning with boyhood recollections and ending with the broken years of later manhood , related in elaborate detail and plentifully adorned with comment upon the environing conditions , all told in the first person , is what we find in `` The New Machiavelli . ''

		This is the newest of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's novels , which we might better call social documents , and em - bodies , as usual , the author 's opinions de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis , with a leaning toward politics in this particular case .

		Mr.

		with unpleasant frankness .

		In fact , the whole career of the hero is shaped by his moral weakness in his relations with women .

		He is a rising states - man , having the most brilliant future well within his grasp , when he throws it all away for the sake of an illicit love .

		The cases of
Parnell	PERSON	and Dilke naturally come to our mind , and it seems probable that
Remington	PERSON	's story is to a certain extent based upon them .

		Writing from the Italian villa in which , after deserting his wife , he has sought seclusion with his paramour , he moralizes extensively upon his downfall .

		It is not wholly a case of '' the world well lost , '' for there is an insistent note of regret in his musings , and , although he freely admits that he has done wrong , he seems all the time to be pleading for sympathy on the ground that he has fallen victim to an uncontrollable passion .

		When we think of the disgusting immoralities to which he has previously confessed , and of the loveliness of the wife whom he has forsaken , we are not disposed to bestow upon him much of the sympathy which he seems to think his due .

		His political development is no less erratic and devoid of principle than his private life .

		He is at first a liberal , and even a socialist , but no sooner attains high office as a spokesman of these causes than he breaks with his following , and goes in for what he calls '' constructive aristocracy . ''

		His new political philosophy finds expression in the weekly review which he sets going , but does not have time for effective translation into act before he succumbs to the temptation which forever cuts him off from public life .

		Because
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	had a somewhat similar experience , the name of the Florentine states - man supplies Remington 's story with its title .

		But
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy found definite and logical expression , whereas we can discover in
Remington	LOCATION	's perturbed fancies nothing more than the outpour - ing 's of a hopelessly bewildered soul , at outs with itself and with the world .

		His story is told with immense vigor , with incisive characterizations , and galvanic shocks in every chapter , but there is no light in it .

		The writer who raises perplexities without helping to resolve them has no healing for the mind ; no thinker can be really helpful who has not somewhere a moral and intellectual anchorage .

		The hero of `` Lord
Alistair	PERSON	's Rebellion , '' a novel by Mr.
Allen Upward	PERSON	, is no less vigorous than
Remington	PERSON	in his onslaught upon the moralities and the decencies of life .

		He rails at everything and everybody , deliberately espouses the life of degradation , and flouts every effort made by his friends to reclaim him .

		On one memorable occa - sion , he unbosoms himself in these terms : `` I am a hooligan .

		I 've been trying to disguise it ever since I was a boy , but I 'm not going to try any more .

		I hate your law and order ; I hate your respectability ; I hate your civilization .

		Our forefathers were thieves and murder - ers , and I envy them .

		They lived a jolly life among the heather and the hills , and they were gentlemen .

		They did n't cringe to cobblers and butchers for votes , and go to church on
Sundays	DATE	to please their grocer .

		They swore and drank and diced as much as they liked , and never asked what the Dissenters thought of them .

		THE DIAJL 267 tail coats and prayer-books .

		Why should I torture myself in the effort to lead yonr unnatural life ?

		I protest against it all .

		Life is one long persecution of men like me , by men like yon . ''

		Being drunk when he thus confesses himself ,
Alis	PERSON	- tair has an advantage over
Remington	LOCATION	, and says openly the things that the latter hedges about with rhetorical reservations .

		But the madness of revolt is in the blood of both , and they are alike incapable of realizing that civilization , with all its faults , has many solid virtues , that its course , despite swervings and eddying currents , is on the whole directed toward the common good of humanity .

		When we leave
Alistair	PERSON	, he has given up the `` West as past redemption , and is on his way to the
East	LOCATION	, where he hopes to `` found a spiritual order like the old Knights of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` to preserve one spot of the planet alike from the millionaire and the socialist , the slave-driver and the slave . ''

		This Utopia is to be the home of love untrammelled by the marriage bond , and we trust that the young woman whom he invites to go with him is sensible enough to resist the lure .

		We think she is , and as the book ends with this invitation , our guess is as good as that of anyone else .

		It might be a good idea for
Alistair	PERSON	to stop on his way at the Italian villa , pick up
Remington	LOCATION	, and take him along .

		They would make a congenial pair .


Peter Vibart	PERSON	, late of
Oxford	LOCATION	, with an athletic record and a taste in literature which has led him to translate Petronius and Brantome .

		has expecta - tions from a wealthy uncle .

		But when the uncle dies and his will is read , it turns out that
Peter	PERSON	is cut off with a paltry ten guineas , save on the con - dition that within a year he marry the Lady
Sophia Sefton	PERSON	, a reigning toast in those days of the Regency , whom he has never seen .

		In the latter case , he is to be the residuary legatee , and the same condition is set for his cousin
Maurice Vibart	PERSON	, a notorious rake and dare-devil .

		Since
Peter	PERSON	is a man of much independence of character , he will not even consider the remote possibility of fortune thus offered him , and , pocketing his ten guineas , blithely faces his changed future , and sets out for adventure upon the road .

		Thus are we introduced to '' The Broad Highway '' of Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	's imagin - ing , which turns out to be a most fascinating and joyous romance of the open air , introducing us to all sorts and conditions of men , among whom rustics , tinkers , and outlaws largely figure .

		One of
Peter	PERSON	's first acquaintances neatly relieves him of the ten guineas , and he is thus thrown absolutely upon his wits , aided by the brawn that had won for him dis - tinction at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		He makes good by adopting the trade of village blacksmith , and his days run cheerfully on until fate makes him the rescuer of a distressed damsel named
Charmian	PERSON	, whom he takes to the shelter of his lonely cabin .

		This same
Charmian	PERSON	is no other than the Lady
Sophia Sefton	PERSON	, pursued by the wicked
Maurice	PERSON	, and
Peter	PERSON	is marked for her prey .

		Of this design he remains unconscious until he is completely trapped by the wily young woman , and then he discovers that he is only too willing a victim .

		This picturesque -LRB- and picaresque -RRB- romance is a very spirited affair , packed | with adventure and vivid description , distinguished !

		in style , rich with humor , and displaying a notable !

		gift of characterization .

		It is a tale full-blooded | and wholesome , unflagging in its interest , and re - lated with a zest which it imparts in full flavor and measure to the reader .

		Its programme is poetically phrased in the following terms : '' This life is a Broad Highway along which we must all of us pass whether we will or no ; as it is a thoroughfare sometimes very hard and cruel in the going , and beset by many hardships , so , also , must its aspect , sooner or later , change for the better , and , the stony track overpassed , the choking heat and dust left behind , we may reach some green , refreshing haven , shady with trees and full of the cool sweet sound of running waters . ''

		To this scheme the story is faithful , and to the motto : '' Hee who myne heart would keepe for long - Shall be a gentilman and strong . ''

Astra	ORGANIZATION	'' is a romance of the '' Zenda '' type , and one of the best of the type that have recently appeared .

		Its scene is a Grand Duchy which in situation and in - ternational relations is more like
Luxembourg	LOCATION	than any other , and its plot concerns the attempt to keep the tiny state from falling into the hands of the Germans .

		This is to be accomplished by the thread - bare device of substituting a strange child for the still-born and secretly buried heir a plot which would have been successful had it not been for the keen intelligence of a travelling Englishman who ferrets it out , and at much personal risk , thwarts the nefarious purpose .

		The heroine is a princess of a neighboring state , who acts as Regent until the deception is made clear , when nothing seems to stand in the way of her espousing the adventurous Englishman .

		We have all the familiar apparatus of plot and counterplot , of secrecy and intrigue , of crafty statesmanship pitted against resolute courage and honesty .

		As a means of providing mild enter - tainment , the story is an unqualified success .

		Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	's memories of the
Virginia	LOCATION	of fifty years ago have already furnished him with the material for many books , and the source of supply is by no means yet exhausted .

		It must be admitted that the books are a little thin , that they repeat themselves to a certain extent , and that they are hopelessly old-fashioned in thought and sentiment .

		The last-named quality is not , to our thinking , a defect , for it connotes wholesomeness and sincerity . ''

		Westover of Wanalah '' is the newest of these stories of old
Virginia	LOCATION	, and its pattern is familiar .

		The hero is hard hit in the early chap - ters the victim of what seems a wanton caprice of fate , and misunderstandings continue to estrange him from the heroine , but all is well at the close .

		Our old friend
Judy Peters	PERSON	makes a welcome re - appearance in these pages , and figures as the dea ex machind of the hero 's fortunes .

		268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	,
Virginia	LOCATION	in the days just after reconstruction is the scene of '' The Betrayal , '' a novel by Mr.
Walter Neale	PERSON	, aided by Miss
Elizabeth H. Hancock	PERSON	.

		The author of this indignant and fiery work is evidently of the unreconstructed and unreconciled .

		The reader pricks up his ears with the very first paragraph , which runs as follows : ''
Virginia	LOCATION	, aided by her allies , had fought out the war between the American nations , parties to the treaty of
1788	DATE	and its amendments , and had survived the ordeals of reconstruction , when she faced a crisis that threatened her civilization . ''

		The first part of this quotation makes fairly plain the author 's somewhat antiquated theory of the constitutional relations between the States and the Federal government ; the remainder indicates that his work has to do with the struggle over readjustment .

		This revival of the political philosophy of
Calhoun	LOCATION	, coupled with this attempt to clear up the intricate subject of the
Virginia	LOCATION	debt and the malign influence of
Mahone	PERSON	-LRB- a subject which ranks fairly with the Schleswig - Holstein question in its difficulty -RRB- , makes a curious combination .

		It does not result in a work of fiction with any pretence of artistic construction , but it makes a book for which a '' live wire '' would be a fitting metaphor .

		The sinister figure of
Mahone	PERSON	-LRB- here called
Tim Murphy	PERSON	-RRB- occupies a central posi - tion , and it is surrounded by typical examples of the champions of dishonesty and of repudiation , and by figures which represent the social stratification of the commonwealth .

		The hero is `` a young aristocrat who is misled by the specious arguments of the readjusters , and casts his lot with them despite the pleadings of his sweetheart and his friends .

		He has his reward in his election to the governorship , but his eyes are at last opened to the fact that he has been
Mahone	PERSON	's dupe all the time , and he wins back something of his self-respect by vetoing the measure upon which the readjusters have staked their for - tunes .

		Whereupon his sweetheart confesses that she is now willing to become his wife .

		To Mr.
Neale	PERSON	's thinking , the old aristocratic social system of
Virginia	LOCATION	, which was cast into the melting-pot during the decade 1860-1870 , offered the most perfect example in history of a rationally-ordered community , and no words are vehement enough to express his contempt for the modern notion that peasants and yeoman can by any possibility approach the level of gentlemen .

		Carpetbaggers , of course , are beneath contempt , and negroes have no discover - able rights of any kind whatever .

		We are glad to get this standpoint , however far removed from it our own may be , and the violence of the author 's polemics does not lead us to doubt his sincerity .

		Some of his ideals are highly honorable to his heart and head , and those which we must hold mistaken are voiced with a conviction that at least sets us to self - searching .

		In form , the story is merely a conglomerate , but many of its individual types are strongly and truth - fully drawn .

		The author 's discursive method per - mits him at any time to say anything that comes into his head , and to this we owe some very surprising comments upon persons who have nothing to do with the action .

		Thus we get a page of sarcasm upon a popular novelist . ''

		Mr.
Francis H. Smith	PERSON	, a Vir - ginian who had the misfortune to be born in
Balti	LOCATION	- more , and who was plain
Frank Smith	PERSON	when a boy , at the time when he - became a Yankee notified
Yankeeland	LOCATION	that he was not without good blood when he became
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	. ''

		Even the Fathers are not spared , as the following quotations may witness : ''
George Washington	PERSON	, a yeoman who pretended to be a gentleman ... That stupendous failure , who could not write a grammatical sentence , was called from his failures to organize and to ad - minister a government . '' ''


Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	: part yeoman , part peasant , altogether a thief . '' ''

		Ben - jamin
Franklin	PERSON	: the peasant whose gross immorality ran the gamut of human vice was self-educated also , and sowed his half-baked ideas broadcast like the seed of tares blown by some evil wind over a field of wheat . ''

		Such choice bits of characterization are sown like the seed of tares over Mr.
Neale	PERSON	's pages .

		Whether proceeding from the author or from the persons in his narrative does not much matter ; in either case they come from a full heart .

		Appearing in the most unexpected places , these gentle tributes to conspicuous personalities ancient and modern afford our reason for styling '' The Betrayal '' a '' live wire . ''

		Wherever one picks it up , one has a fair chance of a shock .

		These
Virginia	LOCATION	novels are interesting , despite their loose construction , and their failure to meet the requirements of artistic fiction .

		Our present series of dissolving views of life in the Old Dominion is com - pleted by Mr.
Warrington Dawson	PERSON	's '' The Scourge , '' a story of the new South .

		Here we have , crudely etched with incisive strokes , a picture of very recent conditions , emphasizing the sharp contrast between the old laxity and prejudice and the new progressive spirit .

		A northerner of energy settles in a Vir - ginia town just after the war , finds the community prostrate and generally gone to seed , establishes a tobacco factory , and from the humblest beginnings creates a great establishment which brings prosperity to the whole neighborhood .

		Being philanthropically disposed , he bestows public buildings , paved streets , and water-works upon the community , and is re - warded by suspicion and distrust .

		He is an alien , and his success awakens only resentment in the pub - lic mind .

		Being childless , he adopts a waif from the gutter , who grows up into a graceless sort of youth , and bids fair to play ducks and drakes with the business when it shall come into his hands .

		When the old man dies , this youth becomes the cen - tral figure , and reveals heroic possibilities , awakened by his love for a young woman of the impoverished aristocratic stock .

		But the dead hand is laid heavily upon them both , for the man inherits the property only upon condition that he shall never marry , and the young woman is bound by her dying father to a pledge that she will not marry that particular man .

		Thus the two lives are wasted , and their story ends gloomily enough .

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's characters are real

		THE DIAL 269 by fits and starts , but no one of them is delineated with much consistency .

		Our estimates require to be readjusted over and over again , a necessity which does not make for the reader 's satisfaction .

		Life often makes this requirement of us , because we see so little of a man 's true nature , but it is the novelist 's business to improve upon life as a revealer , and to reconcile its apparent contradictions . ''

		The Prodigal Judge , '' by Mr.
Vaughan Kester	PERSON	, opens entertainingly at
Balaam 's Cross Roads	ORGANIZATION	, in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, with the settlement of the late
General Quintard	ORGANIZATION	's estate .

		With his death the family , ancient and once influential , had come to an end , after a long period of lingering impover - ishment .

		With one item of his belongings , not reckoned in the legal inventory , the present story is largely concerned .

		The item in question is a small boy , who had mysteriously appeared upon the scene some years before , had been given a home , but had otherwise been neglected .

		A woman had brought him in her arms one rainy night , left him at the
Quintard Barony	PERSON	, and then disappeared .

		Local gossip vaguely associated the strangers with the dimly-remembered story of
General Quintard	ORGANIZATION	's daughter , who had been wedded to a man named
Turberville	PERSON	, and who was known to have died many years before the incidents just related .

		When the Quintard affairs are cleared up , the boy , seemingly a negligible quantity , is taken to the cabin of a big-hearted and illiterate mountaineer , and the two soon become warmly attached to one another .

		Presently , mysterious emissaries from unknown parts appear upon the scene , and it soon becomes evident that they are seeking to get possession of the waif .

		To evade their pursuit -LRB- for they seem to have a colorable legal claim -RRB- , the boy and his protector pull up stakes , and strike westward over the mountains into
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		In the course of their wanderings , they have many surprising and exciting adventures , culminating in an attack which results in the mountaineer 's being left for dead .

		By a lucky happening , a new protector is forthcoming , and this is the device by which we are introduced to the central character of Mr.
Kester	PERSON	's tale to the besotted derelict who calls himself Judge
Slocum Price	PERSON	, who is a mixture of swagger and shrewd resourcefulness , and beneath whose unprpmising exterior we gradually come to discern the lineaments of the gentleman and the scholar .

		This disreputable and lovable figure dominates the story from the time of its first appearance , and in the end provides a key to the secret of the boy 's parentage , and an explanation to all the complication of relationships , covering the history of four generations , that keeps us in a condition of pleasurable puzzlement during the progress of the narrative .

		Who '' the prodigal judge '' really is we will not say , but confine ourselves to the statement that he is conceived in a spirit of rich and racy humor , and is a very human creation .

		Other character-studies in the story are also engaging in their several ways , the moun - taineer already mentioned -LRB- conveniently brought to life when needed -RRB- , the riverman who rescues him , and whose delusion that he is the rightful
Earl	PERSON	of Lambeth supplies the author with material of which
Mark Twain	PERSON	could hardly have made a better use , and the judge 's boon companion , the fellow-derelict who deals him the faithful wounds of a friend , chastening the judge 's exuberance with sardonic comment .

		There are also -LRB- at least -RRB- two villains , and enough figures of conventional pattern to provide the quantum satis of romantic sentiment .

		Altogether , the story is pretty well packed , with both people and incidents .

		All these scenes and situations take us back to the days of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, thus affording a vivid presentation of a period of American history which fiction has not often exploited , as well as of a country almost virgin to the novelist , and abounding in picturesque possibilities .

		The story is told in direct and homely language , and its tangle of loose ends is gradually woven into an intelligible pattern .

		On one point we are a little puzzled .

		At a critical moment , the discomfiture of one of the villains is made to de - pend upon his being held by federal authority for passing counterfeit paper money .

		Could this have been possible at a time when bank-notes constituted the only paper money in existence ?

		Another story having a derelict for its hero is Mr.
John G. Neihardt	PERSON	's `` The Dawn-Builder . ''

		This derelict is a very battered individual indeed , having a wooden leg and only one available eye , besides being a confirmed drunkard ; but despite these handicaps , he becomes the Ferdinand to the Miranda of an island in the
Missouri River	LOCATION	, and when that romance is ended with her death , still finds himself qualified for a second matrimonial venture -LRB- not without its own special quality of sober sentiment -RRB- , in which the widow Sprangs is impli - cated as the partner .

		This is doing fairly well for such a wastrel as he appears in the early chapters , and the author displays no little skill in making such a figure romantically possible and even accept - able .

		Fantasy and realism , the homely and the heroic , are delightfully blended in this original fiction , and over it all hovers the fitful gleam of a truly poetical imagination .

		`` The best things of life are apt to arrive by means of this three-cycle process : First , desire and dreams ; then disillusionment and distress some - times despair ; and then , at last , with patient and intelligent effort , a final adjustment to reality , with its humors , and its ironies , and its solid , secure satis - factions . ''

		This alliterative and pleasant philosophy is the text upon which Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	has told us of `` The Married Life of the
Frederic Carrolls	PERSON	, '' a story which , instead of ending with the wedding bells up to which its course has led , begins just after their last echoes have died on the air .

		This is the ultra-modern way , of which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is the exemplar , of dealing with life as affected by its most momentous happening .

		As contrasted with the approved old way , its advantages are obvious , if we once admit that fact is better worth recording 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, than sentiment , and that the real problem of mar - riage is not solved , but only propounded , at the steps of the altar .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has given us a fine ex - ample of domestic comedy , light-hearted and high - spirited , but by no means as superficial as one might assume from a hasty inspection .

		His
Frederic Carrolls	PERSON	are very natural people the one an artist of honest ideals and impressionable character , the other a sensible little woman who understands that it is better to humor a husband than to nag him and their story is told with a natural simplicity that is saved from dulness by the author 's sense of humor , imparted to both husband and wife with nicely meas - ured prescription , and comfortably relieving the ten - sion when their relations are in danger of strain .

		The masterly way in which the young wife handles the studio situation when she becomes aware of certain philanderings between her husband and one of the objects of his earlier adoration may be par - ticularly commended to the attention of brides who make similar discoveries .

		Her remedy is much move effective than any tearful and upbraiding scene , or extreme resort to the divorce court , could possibly prove .

		The author 's talent for comedy is displayed at its blithest in this situation , although it is hardly less pronounced in the episode which ends the honey - moon , in the story of the home-building , and in the account of the solemn function when all the relatives are assembled at a Christmas dinner .

		In the last - named instance , we are inclined to think that comedy verges a little too close upon farce , and the credulity of Aunt Bella , who is otherwise delightfully natural and diverting , is difficult to take seriously .

		The underlying intention of this novel seems to be that of showing how '' to make a real union out of a mere marriage . ''

		For the task a good many mutual con - cessions are required , a progressive development of the qualities of forbearance and consideration , .

		a readiness to give up some of the dreams of youth , and a willingness to compromise some personal ideals with those of a world in which , after all , people have to live , and with which they must come to some sort of terms .

		The success with which the
Frederic Carrolls	PERSON	work out the complicated problem is the measure of the novelist 's skill in dealing with it , for he meets his difficulties honestly , and over - comes them with the aid of a sagacious and mellow philosophy .

Byron	PERSON	, Shelley plain , '' none survived him and Trelawnev .

		\ onger or l ove d to talk about him more than
Edward John Trelawney	PERSON	.

		Byron , also ,
Trelawney	PERSON	knew well ; and , though loving him less , followed him to
Greece	LOCATION	where they worked together for a common cause .

		Surviving these friends of his youth for more than half a century ,
Trelawney	PERSON	wrote his well-known Recollections of them , and was always ready to talk on the same interesting subjects .

		Naturally , the octogenarian who had been honored by the friendship of two such great poets would be much sought after in
England	LOCATION	, where he spent his last days .

		Notes of his con - versations were made and some of them published ; and now we have the long-promised collection , edited by Mr.
H. Buxton Forman	PERSON	, of the `` Letters of Edward John Trelawney '' -LRB-
Henry Frowde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There are a hundred and thirty-seven of the letters , and they make a handsome volume of nearly three hundred pages .

		The first letter is dated
February , 1822	DATE	, and is peculiarly interesting as containing the instructions to the boat-builder for the construction of the `` Ariel '' - the `` fatal and perfidious bark '' that capsized and caused the drowning of Shelley a few months later .

		The last letter bears a date nearly sixty years after , and also connects itself with
Shelley	PERSON	; it is addressed to Mr.
W. M. Ros	PERSON	- setti , and contains a suggestion that
Swinburne	PERSON	should write a tragedy on Charles the First a task begun by
Shelley	PERSON	, but never finished .

		Twenty - six of the letters are addressed to
Mary Shelley	PERSON	, including one which proposes marriage to her , and another written after her rejection of his suit ; also letters to others , in which he alludes to this same lady as `` the blab of blabs , '' '' a conventional slave , '' '' the weakest of her sex , '' etc. .

		On the whole , the never-ending Trelawney-Mary discussion seems in nearly the same puzzling position as before .

		The largest number of letters written to any one person is sixty - seven to the lady who insisted upon being called
Claire	PERSON	, but whose real name was
Clara Mary Jane Clairmont	PERSON	.

		Few persons have wrought more havoc and misery in their immediate circle than this remarkable but undisciplined woman , who lived to be eighty-one years old without losing her powers of fascination over both men and women .

		The photogravure of her shown in this volume , made from a portrait painted while still in young womanhood , partially explains this fascinating quality .

		Not only is the face very beautiful , but it conveys an impression of that subtle something known as '' charm . ''

		Unrestrained by conscience or mastery of self , as Claire appears to have been , such a quality becomes fatal not only to a woman 's own happiness , but to the happiness of others .

		Trelawney 's own character reveals itself as full of strange contradictions .

		Wayward , impulsive , over - bearing , and intolerant of opposition , as he often appears , there is yet revealed an inner strain of considerateness and generosity .

		Resentful of all forms of oppression , bigotry , cant , and frivolity , he was capable of a splendid devotion to a cause and of devout attachment to an individual .

		That his strongest and most enduring attachment was mani - fested toward the personality , political attitude , and poetic genius of
Shelley	LOCATION	, is something for which we must always be grateful , since
Trelawney	PERSON	was among the few to give
Shelley	PERSON	his due while living , and to make him known in the light in which he appeared to those who knew him best , after he had '' awakened from the dream of life . ''

		THE DIAL 271 A cry to national repentance .

		There is a deplorable abundance of recent occurrences in public affairs to give special timeliness and point to a work recently appearing from the pen of Professor
Robert C. Brooks	PERSON	, of the
University of Cincin	ORGANIZATION	- nati , '' Corruption in American Politics and Life '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The use of such a term as '' Corruption '' is beset with many difficulties , but these are of a sort familiar to the political student , who by the very nature of his calling is denied the use of an esoteric jargon which he can make precise only by monopolizing its use , and is forced to sub - stitute the many-sided and expressive terms of the man in the street .

		The author defines corruption as `` the intentional misperformance or neglect of a recognized duty , or the unwarranted exercise of power , with the motive of gaining some advantage more or less directly personal . ''

		Duty of any sort may be the occasion of corrupt neglect or misperform - ance ; in the case of political corruption , it is the duty to the state or community that is neglected .

		Into this conception the author gathers such varied items as franchise-boodling , five-dollar vote-buying , railroad pass-riding , nepotism in appointments , connivance by inspectors , campaign contributions of several sorts -LRB- carefully and cleverly analyzed and differentiated -RRB- , and tax-dodging .

		Political corruption , however , is only an aggravated and obvious instance of a condi - tion which is as universal as sin , and is by no means the ' vice of low intellects . ''

		Corruption in business , in higher education , in the law , in journalism , in the ministry and other professions , in all these the author sets forth specific instances with illuminating remarks , and analyzes them with keenness and candor .

		He reminds us that bitter experience has shown that to regard a `` business administration '' of municipal affairs as a panacea for the ills of the body politic is as foolish as to expect salvation from a '' scholar in politics . ''

		What is needed is incor - ruptible , straight , uncompromising devotion to duty , in politics as in business and the professions .

		The author indicts no individnal , no class , no group , but rather the whole body of society which allows itself to be governed by purely commercial considerations .

		Like an Old Testament prophet , he summons a whole nation to repentance .

		The tone of the book is serious , but is hopeful .

		As he takes up the mani - fold forms of corruption , he finds antidotes which men may administer if they will , and points out cor - recting tendencies that are operating of themselves .

		He sees special privilege more heavily entrenched in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	than in our country , and rejoices in our growing habit of challenging and requiring such privilege to justify itself as free from taint .

		Furthermore , he points out that our short - comings ought to be measured with reference to our attempts .

		Our experiment in democracy implies a faith in political manhood that is unique in history : we invite the lower orders into the arena of political duty , from which they are largely excluded abroad ; and if there is some yielding to temptation , there is also much rising superior to it , resulting in a more robust political morality .

		Our author concludes that the greatest harm done by political corruption is not in its enabling some men to '' acquire fortune and power rapidly at the expense of others , '' but rather in its destruction of the '' confidence of men in their social institutions . ''

		This confidence is the life of political society ; corruption , unless checked , means that society 's disintegration and death .

		In the chaste style that comes only of earlv and appreciative study of the ancient classics , and with an inter - weaving of quotation and allusion that come readily to the pen of only him who is versed in all that is best in literature , Mr.
Henry Law Webb	PERSON	has brought together , under the title , `` The Silences of the Moon '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , some rarely beautiful passages of self-communing on the meaning and the mystery of nature , on the great questions of religion and philosophy , and on sundry minor problems of this our existence in time and eternity .

		It is the rich harvest of a quiet eye that he offers us , but of an eye that does not merely brood and sleep on his own heart : it is discriminatingly observant of the beau - ties of nature as well as open to their spiritual signi - ficance . ''

		From Nature , '' he declares , '' we may learn all virtues and true arts ; from the poplar its solitary introspection , and patience from the watch - ing heron . ''

		And again : '' Out of k dumb ' matter we derive all purity of color and most beauties of line ; and to the visible materialisations of Nature belong the accumulated wisdom and song of all the world since the Chaldeans first felt their kinship with the stars ; she is the
Pallas Athene	PERSON	, in wisdom eternally in her prime , in beauty immortally fair . ''

		Another sentence , in another strain , must be quoted : '' The mind can never know satiety , for as its desire is infinite , the highest delight to which it can attain has a beyond , just as on earth man can never reach the horizon . ''

		And still one more : '' A dominant religion and a sartorial craze pass away in about the same length of time the latter in a few weeks , the former in a few centuries ; in eternity the dif - ference is non-existent . ''

		The tone of the book is wisely and sanely optimistic . ''

		As we are happy , '' believes the writer , '' so is the good we do in the world ; no miserable man ever benefited the race . ''

		Suggestions of Pater come agreeably to the reader as he yields himself to the quiet charm of Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's pages .

		A passage on the
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	of Knidos is especially in
Pater	LOCATION	's manner .

		Reminders also of Mr.
W. Compton Leith	PERSON	, from whose '' Apolo - gia Diffidentis '' he admiringly quotes , and to whom he dedicates his own book , are not wanting .

		There is in both the same introspective mood , and the same susceptibility to the poetic appeal of nature .

		Those who enjoyed the '' Apologia '' will take equal if not even greater delight in '' The Silences of the
Moon	PERSON	, '' which , whether fortunately or otherwise , lacks the minute self-analysis that contributes to the peculiar fascination of the earlier work .

		Both are master - pieces , and both , by what may not be wholly a 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, coincidence , are brought out by the same discern - ing publisher .

		Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's peculiar and striking title is taken from the second book of the '' JEneid , '' line 255 .

		Spiritualism The late Frank Pod more , already sanely well known for his history of Spirit - considered .

		ualism and his contributions to the problems of
Psychic Research	ORGANIZATION	, has given us in his last book , called '' The Newer Spiritualism '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , a review of the more recent investigations in pur - suit of the same purposes .

		It finds an historical connection in the older spiritualistic manifestations of
D. D. Home	PERSON	, in whose presence marvels seem to have occurred , yet who seems to have been particularly successful in evading actual detection though not suspicion .

		The contrast of his sittings with those more recently held with
Eusapia Paladino	PERSON	shows the considerable increase in the critical spirit of latter days ; and this in turn but reflects a more thorough understanding of the logic , as well as the psychology , of this elusive field .

		Mr. Pod - more 's book takes the topic to the present year ; including a very brief account of the
New York	LOCATION	exposures , which in their completeness seem to have disposed of the
Paladino	PERSON	performances .

		It may well be that the next generation will regard the necessity of devoting so admirable a book to the serious consideration of these phenomena , as more remarkable than the difficulty of reaching the sceptical conclusions that are here enforced .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	concedes that the position of other hy - potheses than fraud is strong enough to merit the most careful examination ; but that as a result of such impartial examination , no other hypothesis holds water , and that , indeed , the positive evi - dence of fraud is comprehensive enough to carry over to the whole range of manifestations .

		The second half of the volume is devoted to the differ - ent types of evidence in regard to spiritualistic communications through entranced mediums , or through others by way of automatic writing or speech .

		Here there can be no question of exposure in the ordinary sense , but only of the weighing of evidence of coincidence -LRB- combined with an in - genious use of `` fishing '' for the data from the communicators -RRB- as opposed to the hypothesis of a force beyond normal perception .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	is equally sceptical in regard to the spiritualistic hypotheses as thus supported ; yet he has so charit - able an attitude toward the hypothesis of telepathy , that it is difficult to see why the same logic leading to a distinct conclusion for the one does not equally obtain for the other .

		With this exception the book may be most cordially welcomed for the library - shelf , where its largest use will be to serve as an antidote to the notorious examples of modern cre - dulity , both amongst the scientific and the unscien - tific .

		Whether this is to be the last word on Spirit - ualism , or whether there will again and soon be necessity to write a further book on '' The Newest Spiritualism , '' the future alone can decide .

		HOW the British Just one hundred and thirty-five were driven years ago -LRB-
March 16 , 1776	DATE	-RRB- General out of
Boston	LOCATION	.


Washington	LOCATION	, in command of the American troops about
Boston	LOCATION	, made that last ag - gressive move , the throwing-up of a redoubt at
Nook	ORGANIZATION	's Hill , that was received by General
Howe	PERSON	as a notice to quit ; and early on the following morn - ing he embarked his forces , sailed down the harbor , and thus inaugurated the Evacuation Day which subsequent generations of patriotic Bostonians have delighted to celebrate on every recurrent seven - teenth of
March	DATE	.

		It is fitting that there should appear at this season a detailed account , drawn from authoritative sources , of this historic event . ''

		The Siege of
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	French , furnishes a rapid recapitulation of all that led up to the British occupation , from the time when
Charles II	PERSON	.

		abrogated the charter of the colony , and the hitherto self-governed community became a royal province , up to the arrival of Gage , in
1774	DATE	, with an army at his back , to succeed
Hutchinson	PERSON	as gov - ernor of this fractious handful of
King George	ORGANIZATION	's subjects .

		Thenceforward , with the battles of Lex - ington and Bunker Hill to engage the reader 's interest , the movements of both British and Amer - icans become worthy of closer attention , until under
Washington	LOCATION	's splendid generalship the redcoats are driven from the shores of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	's share in the Revolution is practically ended .

		The story is well told by Mr. French , but certain topo - graphical passages might have been rendered clearer and fuller .

		For instance the term `` Dorchester Heights '' seems not to be sufficiently explained as indicating , not what is now
Dorchester	LOCATION	, but a part of the present
South Boston	LOCATION	, while
South Boston	LOCATION	itself is spoken of as being a mud-flat in
1774	DATE	.

		The headlands then known as
Dorchester Heights	LOCATION	were at that time , as now , well above the water-line , although the lower portions of the peninsula , to - gether with the adjacent parts now called the
South End	LOCATION	, were indeed either mud-flats or totally sub - merged areas .

		The book lacks a good map or plan of the siege operations , showing clearly such strate - gic points as
Copp	PERSON	's Hill ,
Fort Hill	LOCATION	,
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	, and the various outlying positions occupied by the colonial forces .

		The two small maps provided are inadequate .

		Appropriate illustrations are inserted , footnotes give references to authorities consulted , and a good analytical index closes the book .

		An English Successful as Mr.
Seymour Hicks	PERSON	actor 's amusino has shown himself in entertaining , reminiscences , both by his acting and by his play - writing , that portion of the public whose chosen diversion is the theatre , he has proved himself hardly less successful in his efforts to amuse the reading public with a rapid-fire account of his rather speedy rise from the obscure grade of supernumer - ary to the luminous height of `` star '' and popular favorite .

		THE DIAL 273 to the page stories of his own and other actors ' professional experience than can easily be found in any similar piece of autobiographic literature .

		Without attempting here even the briefest synopsis of Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	's chronicle of his own self-making , we will quote a bit of repartee which may contain a useful hint to authors and publishers troubled with bland requests for free copies of the books by which they earn their daily bread . ''

		Dear Mr.
Terriss	PERSON	, '' wrote a wholesale dealer in certain of the neces - saries of life to Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	's late father-in-law , '' Could you let me have a box or four stalls to see 4 The Harbour Lights ' ?

		Thanking you in anticipa - tion , I am yours , etc. , etc. , etc. ,
J. ARMITAGE	PERSON	. ''

		To which the other replied : '' Dear Mr.
Armitage	PERSON	, with all the pleasure in the world , and would you let me have two dozen eggs , a side of bacon , and a dozen pots of jam for home use ?

		Thanking you but with - out the slightest anticipation , I am yours , etc. , etc. , etc. , WILLIAM TERRISS . ''

		One chapter of his book the author devotes to the discouragement of would - be actors , and he gives them much wholesome and sobering advice , somewhat after the manner of Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	's reply to a person who an - nounced that he was thinking of playing '' Hamlet . '' ''

		Are y ou ? ''

		was the rejoinder . ''

		I should keep on thinking about it if I were you . ''

		A prepossessing portrait of Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	forms the frontispiece to his volume , and a useful index of names serves as a tailpiece .

		Com letion Within the past few months the of a notable cooperative work known as '' The historical work .

		p o ii t i ca i History of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has been brought to completion with the publication of the volume by Mr.
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	, of the
University of London	ORGANIZATION	, and of that by Dr.
Richard Lodge	PERSON	, of the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	.

		The general characteristics of this series , most ably edited by the Reverend Dr.
William Hunt	PERSON	and Mr.
Reginald L. Poole	PERSON	, were fully outlined in THE DIAL -LRB-
Feb. 16 , 1906	DATE	-RRB- in a review of the three volumes which were the first to appear .

		Somewhat to the embarrassment of reviewers , the several instalments have been published entirely without reference to their chronological order .

		Thus the three to which we have just referred Hunt 's -LRB- covering the period 1760-1801 -RRB- ,
Adams	PERSON	's -LRB- 1066-1216 -RRB- , and Tout 's -LRB- 1216-1377 -RRB- appeared in
1905	DATE	.

		The volumes by
Hodgkin	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- to 1066 -RRB- ,
Oman	LOCATION	-LRB- 1377-1485 -RRB- ,
Brodrick	PERSON	and
Fotheringham	PERSON	-LRB- 1801-1837 -RRB- , and
Fisher	PERSON	-LRB-
1485	DATE	-
1547	DATE	-RRB- , came out in
1906	DATE	;
Montague	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB-
1603	DATE	-
1660	DATE	-RRB- , and Low and
Sanders	PERSON	's -LRB- 1837-1901 -RRB- , in
1907	DATE	; Leadam 's -LRB- 1702-1760 -RRB- , in
1909	DATE	; while of the latest instalments .

		Pollard 's covers the latter part of the English Reformation -LRB- 15471603 -RRB- , and that of Dr. Lodge includes the reigns of
Charles II.	PERSON	,
James II.	PERSON	, and
William III	PERSON	.

		-LRB- 1660-1702 -RRB- .

		Both the editors and the authors -LRB- who , with few excep - tions , are now or in the past have been connected with the teaching of History in
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are to be congratulated upon the success of their endeavors .

		While both as to interest and as to scholarship the volumes necessarily vary , the range of such variation is very slight in comparison with the high general level that is maintained .

		The out - ward appearance of the work is attractive , and there are few typographical errors .

		There are no illus - trations other than useful maps .

		To each volume is appended a bibliography , which the limits of space render suggestive rather than exhaustive .

		While specialists in this or that field of English history may express different opinions as to partic - ular matters , all will agree that the completion of '' The Political History of
England	LOCATION	'' is a notable ac - complishment , eliciting the critical approval of the scholarly world both in
England	LOCATION	and in
America	LOCATION	.

		The nobility of The aboriginal American is pictured the primitive at his very best by Dr.
Charles	PERSON	red man .

		Alexander Eastman -LRB-
Ohiyesa	LOCATION	, in his own
Dakota	LOCATION	tongue -RRB- in a little book entitled `` The Soul of the Indian '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is the religi - ous side of the Indian 's inner life that the author especially seeks to show us , '' the religious life of the typical American Indian as it was before he knew the white man .

		I have long wished to do this , because I can not find that it has ever been seriously , adequately , and sincerely done .

		The religion of the Indian is the last thing about him that the man of another race will ever understand . ''

		The Indian 's God , it appears from Dr.
Eastman	PERSON	's pages , was -LRB- in the Indian 's best days -RRB- as high and awful , as mighty and as inscrutable , as the Jehovah of the Hebrews .

		He was the Unseen and Eternal , to whom a daily tribute of wordless devotion was to be rendered , and whose name was seldom so much as breathed in even the devoutest frame of mind ; much less was it profanely used even by the least reverent .

		What wonder , then , that the frontier white man , with his ready string of oaths , astonished and horrified the redskin , and that the religion of civilization failed to commend itself unreservedly to his untutored mind ?

		Dr. East - man 's chapters , treating of '' The Great Mystery , '' '' The Family Altar , '' '' Ceremonial and Symbolic Worship , '' `` Barbarism and the Moral Code , '' `` The Unwritten Scriptures , '' and `` The Borderland of Spirits , '' are extremely interesting ; and if he unconsciously idealizes his fellow-Indians , it is a natural and pardonable error .

		We would gladly believe that the red man in his golden age was all that
Ohiyesa	ORGANIZATION	's eloquence represents him to have been .

		Those communities and nations that Organized ... movement * for adopt the most constructive policy child-welfare .

		toward the welfare of their children , as future citizens , are likely to be among the most progressive communities and nations of the earth .

		In
America	LOCATION	the movement for child-welfare has expressed itself in various special organizations such as the
National Child Labor Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Playground Association	ORGANIZATION	, and in institu - 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, tions such as the Juvenile Court . ''

		Society is slowly beginning to realize that child problems are the greatest problems of our times . ''

		This is evidenced in the two recent conferences on Child Welfare , and in the proposed bill for a
Federal Childrens ' Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		In Mr.
George B. Mangold	PERSON	's book on '' Child Prob - lems '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we get a valuable statement of the principal social child-problems of to-day , with facts from the most recent sources .

		The discussion covers such interesting matters as infant and child mortality and the education of children , with such allied questions as recreation , health , and child labor .

		The problems of the delinquent child and the de - pendent and neglected child are so treated as to bring out the changes in methods , in recent times , from those of relief to those of cure .

		These matters are all discussed from a constructively social point of view , the chief stress being placed on a study of underlying causes .

		Definite suggestions are made for the treatment of these problems , with special reference to the more accurate and widely extended investigation of causes of delinquency , backward - ness , defectiveness , etc. .

		The need for a
Federal Childrens ' Bureau	ORGANIZATION	is strongly urged , to collect in - formation not now available and to coordinate effort in child-caring .

		It is not known at present , for example , how many dependent children there are in
America	LOCATION	; the 93,000 in institutions do not include many in foster homes , or uncared for .

		Such in - formation is very desirable , and Mr.
Mangold	PERSON	's book is a distinct contribution to the subject of which it treats .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's three - volume `` History of English Prosody '' is too formidable a work for most minds and purses ; hence the author has been well - advised to condense its contents into the more man - ageable '' Historical Manual of English Prosody '' now published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This work , '' not so much an abstract as a parallel with a different purpose , '' is well fitted for use as a college text-book , although , of course , it must be taken with due allowance for its author 's eccentricities of both style and argument .

		The volume is provided with a glossary which students will find particularly useful .

		One of those interesting miscellanies that are from time to time brought together as a testimonial to some veteran teacher is found in the volume of '' Studies in Language and Literature '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , which is published as a tribute to the inspiring leadership of Professor
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	, upon the occasion of his seven - tieth birthday .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	was one of the earliest Americans to lay the foundations of an education in
Germany	LOCATION	, and his example caused many young scholars to follow in his footsteps .

		The papers here collected are eighteen in number , mostly brief and technical , but we note a few of interest to the general reader , such as Dr.
E. J. Barley	PERSON	's ''
George Meredith	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
Lane Cooper	PERSON	's The Power of the Eye in
Coleridge	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
H. L. Fordham	PERSON	's English and the Law , '' and Dr.
Frank Thilly	PERSON	's Contemporary American Philosophy . '' -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT By
Frederick Winslow Taylor	PERSON	,
M.E.	LOCATION	, Sc.D .

		The author is the originator of the system which achieved wide celebrity when
Louis D. Brandeis	PERSON	declared that by its adoption the railroads of the country could save
a million dollars	MONEY	a day that is now wasted .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	is one of the distinguished engineers of the country , former president of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, and for nearly thirty years has been at work on the principles he sets forth in this book .

		Here , for the first time , its details are given fully by its inventor .

		It is the birth of a new science one which will go far toward revolutionizing present business and industrial methods .

		Wherever it has been adopted thus far , it has wholly changed the relationship of the employer and the employee , and it has produced greater profits to the owner and more wages to the worker .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	believes that the man is the main thing in industry .

		He believes that attention should be fixed upon the exact point of contact between man and nature which is the point of life and of production and of artistry .

		With the vast expansion of industry the old , intimate personal contact of employer and employee is impossible , and Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	would substitute a science of management , based upon a thorough-going , scientific study of the man at his job .

		A high school class in American history had spent an hour in discussing the struggle between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces about the year
1850	DATE	.

		Among the topics dwelt upon at length had been Clay 's compromise measure -LRB- including the Seventh of
March	DATE	speech -RRB- and the influence of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's great novel .

		At the close of the hour the instructor read
Whittier	LOCATION	's '' Ichabod '' to his class , without naming either its author or its subject .

		Then he asked -LRB- not without hopefulness , although experience should have taught him better -RRB- for the name of the man about whom the poem was written .

		Two answers were elicited : the first was '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	, '' the second ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	. ''

		When asked to account for the title of the poem , that assemblage of ingenuous youth was of one mind it must have been suggested by
Ichabod Crane	PERSON	.

		This strictly veracious nar - rative has two morals a pedagogical moral whose implications , if logically worked out , would condemn pretty much the whole of the educational process of which these youngsters of the average age of eighteen had been made the victims , and a cultural moral too obvious to need categorical statement .

		The first moral may be reserved for con - sideration upon other occasions .

		It strikes at the tap-root of the teaching problem , and must be faced sooner or later when sentiment shall give place to reason , and the delusion of a '' practical '' education shall burst like the bubble that it is .

		The second moral is just now borne in upon us by the fact that we are thinking for the moment about the English Bible during this
third century year	DATE	of its pub - lication in the authorized version , and are being made to realize in many depressing ways that the Book which is the chief treasure of our prose literature is to the younger generation a book with seven seals .

		There have been many investigations of late years into the furnishings of the youthful mind as far as knowledge of the Scriptures is concerned , and they all come out in about the same way .

		The case of the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	student -LRB- a Jew -RRB- who had never heard of Moses is one of countless cases that would seem incredible did we not know by melancholy ex - perience that there is absolutely no limit to the 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, ignorance of young people about matters of the most elementary cultural significance .

		A questionnaire of a few years ago , making the simplest of demands , revealed large numbers of boys and girls who could not name the first book of the
Bible	LOCATION	, who had never heard of Methuselah , and who did not know where Christ was born , or who betrayed him , or the goal of
Paul	PERSON	's journey when he experienced conversion .

		Testimony of this sort has been multiplied by thousands of inquirers , and partic - ularly contributed in voluminous measure by teachers who have based their inquiries upon the familiar scriptural allusions with which English literature is packed .

		It all goes to show a widespread and lamentable ignorance of the Bible which could not have been paralleled fifty years ago in any part of the English - speaking world .

		On the other hand , the generation which has so far lapsed from the culture -LRB- we are not now concerned about the faith -RRB- of the past has been exhorted by the most eloquent voices not to neglect our chief fountain-head of literary and ethical inspiration .

		Here , also , testimony in volume unlimited and of weight not to be ignored is at our service .

		The pleas of
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Huxley	LOCATION	, of
Kuskin	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, are familiar and shining examples of this advocacy .

		Less familiar , but thoroughly typical of educated opinion upon this subject , are the words of
R. H. Dana , Jr.	PERSON	, which we may reproduce : '' Our ordinary
English Bible	PERSON	is the foundation of our common views of morality , is the basis of our com - mon civilization , and is the bond of our common lan - guage ; apart from any opinion as to its religious teach - ings , every American child is entitled to be instructed in this book , his acquaintance with which is essential to his understanding of very much that he hears in public address , or reads in the public press , and this , though he be of a family which is Protestant or Catholic ,
Jewish	LOCATION	,
Mohammedan	LOCATION	, or Buddhist ... As a well of pure English , undefiled , as a fountain of pure , idiomatic English , it has not its equal in the world .

		... From the common English Bible , too , we derive our household words , our phrases and illustrations , the familiar speech of the people .

		Our associations are with its narratives , its parables , its histories , and its biographies .

		If a man knew the
Bible	LOCATION	in its original Greek and Hebrew by heart , and did not know the common English version , he would be ignorant of the speech of the people .

		In sermons , in public speeches from the pulpit , the bar and the platform , would come allusions , references , quotations that exquisite elec - trifying by conductors by which the heart of the whole people is touched.by a word , a phrase , in itself nothing , but everything in the power of conducting and all this would be to him an unknown world ... As a preparation for life , an acquaintance with the common English Bible is indispensable . ''

		Another writer , fully appreciative of the share of the English Bible in our spiritual life , is Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	, who says : '' For better or worse the ideals which underlie our blundering conscious life must always be the ideals which underlie the conscious life of the mother country , and which for centuries have rectified and purified her blunders .

		Morally and religiously these ideals are immortally con - secrated in
King James	LOCATION	's version of the Bible . ''

		And Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	, writing in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature , '' says with simple truth that '' no other book has so penetrated and permeated the hearts and speech of the English race as has the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		What Homer was to the Greeks , and the
Koran	LOCATION	to the Arabs , that , or something not unlike it , the
Bible	LOCATION	has become to the English . ''

		Such quotations might be multiplied indefin - itely , but to extend them would be '' slaying the slain '' for most readers of these pages .

		They make it clear that we may enter on behalf of the Bible the same sort of claim for renewed attention , now that its life has rounded another full century , that we would enter in a similar anniversary year in behalf of Shakespeare or
Milton	LOCATION	.

		But to enter the claim alone , and think that our whole duty has thus been done , will be a rather futile performance .

		Our real obliga - tion is to endeavor by continuous and unremit - ting effort to restore the
Bible	LOCATION	as an English classic to the possession of the people .

		Many persons , admitting the obligation , will shirk it and salve their consciences at the same time by suggesting that the burden be put upon the public schools .

		It is an easy way of evading a personal responsibility , and has been applied , with somewhat startling results , in many other matters .

		In the case of the
Bible	LOCATION	, it would be about the poorest expedient imaginable , to say nothing of the fact that in the present contro - versial temper upon religious subjects it could not be done without violating certain very funda - mental principles of fairness between creed and creed .

		Given our schools as they are -LRB- and their teachers -RRB- , we could not hope that teaching , or even reading , of the Bible would be done reason - ably , and by methods free from the influence of any theory of supernaturalism .

		The whole wretched history of the English political squab - ble over religious education , with its chatter about Cowper-Templeism and '' simple Bible teaching , '' shows us how wise has been the American policy of an absolutely secularized system of public education .

		It is not now through the schools , any more than it was through the schools of fifty
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 or a hundred years ago , that children are to be made to grow up with Biblical knowledge as an ineradicable possession .

		It is to the home that we must look supplemented to some extent by private and voluntary outside agen - cies to the home , which means , in the final analysis , to a reawakening of that sense of parental responsibility which , as our modern life has grown more complex and institutional , seems to have sunk into a sort of lethargy .

		It was as the result of influences existing or at least originating , in the family circle that our parents and grandparents came to know their Bible so well , and thereby became possessed of the master key to most of the treasure-houses of our literature .

		As the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' aptly says : `` A late and literary study of the
Bible	LOCATION	can never make it the instinctive possession , the man of our counsel , that it was under the old system of assimilating its con - tents .

		Assiduous reading in the family from earliest days , the memorizing of psalm and parable and prophecy and beatitude , the listen - ing to the rolling echoes of Sinai in church on
Sundays	DATE	, along with the lightnings and smoke of torment in the Apocalypse all this was a process to stamp upon the mind indelibly what no amount of sophisticated study can yield . ''

		There were elements of waste in the old system , but how effective it was !

		In giving it up , the children of this later generation have saved much time , and promptly devoted it to frivolous and mischievous occupations , or at the best to mean '' practical '' purposes .

		But what they have suffered in consequence is nothing less than an intellectual and moral calamity .

		WALTER PATER .

		The new
Library Edition of Pater	ORGANIZATION	can not fail to please the bibliophile .

		Completed now in ten beau - tiful volumes , tastefully bound in dark blue cloth , the quiet dignity of its type and format leaves little to be desired .

		Intrinsically , it is the old edition in a statelier form .

		No new material has been added , either textual or editorial ; the rest of the unsigned reviews must still be read in Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's collection .

		And after all we need not regret them , for the best of this literary journalism has been preserved in the rather mediocre '' Essays from the Guardian . ''

		What we shall regret , however , is the omission of the essay on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and , perhaps even more , the lack of a memoir or biographical study .

		We have as yet no adequate biography of
Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, to be sure , has given us an aesthetic study , and Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	a pains - taking collection of anecdotes .

		Here , as in many another case , the task of the biographer is no easy one .

		The anecdotes must be used with caution , for Pater liked to clothe his sensitiveness with irony .

		Did he confess himself in bis art , holding to that ideal of transparent simplicity set forth with such charm in the Platonic conception of Diaphaneite ?

		Earliest of all his essays , is it really autobiograph - ical ?

		Perhaps so .

		His style , certainly , has no trace of irony or even humor , and it does have a very personal warmth .

		As a critic , of course , he is thoroughly subjective , his very book-reviews being limited to the things that pleased him ; and no one can deny the subjective quality of his work in fiction .

		In any case , a very definite portrait lies concealed in these ten volumes , and its details tally singularly with the facts that one may glean from Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's laborious but inartistic memoir .

		The material for this '' imaginary portrait '' is widely scattered . ''

		One must read all of Pater , '' says a recent critic ; and an unsympathetic reviewer might rejoice that the total was limited by such artistic discretion .

		Yet it might have been smaller still .

		Only five of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's works six volumes in this new Library Edition were published in book form during the author 's life-time ; and , with the possible exception of '' Greek Studies , '' it is doubtful if any of the others would have received his sanction in their present form .

		All of them have their interest for us , surely , even the '' Essays from the Guardian '' ; but it is to the '' Renaissance '' and ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' to the '' Imaginary Portraits '' and ''
Plato	PERSON	and Platonism , '' that the admirer of Pater most frequently turns .

		Of these the '' Renaissance '' is the most impor - tant for the biographer .

		Earliest of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's works , written mainly between his twenty-seventh and thirty-fourth years , it exhibits most clearly what one might term the fundamental contradiction of his temperament .

		The '' Renaissance '' presents to us , as none of the later works do , the essential Pater , a highly imaginative but rather sensuous nature , curious of a somewhat morbid type of beauty .

		The passion of youth asserts itself in these essays , and the voice of a lyrical poet vibrates beneath their apparent restraint .

		Ascesis an ascetic control of one 's aesthetic attitude and its artistic expression was always
Pater	PERSON	's intellectual ideal , and it tended to give him more of a classical objectivity in his later writings .

		But here at least the author of those severer studies , like
Denys	PERSON	in the fable of the fallen god , ungirds the hempen cincture and casts aside the monastic robe .

		And what we find beneath it is not a pagan deity as in the fable , not a pagan philosopher as we might expect from '' Greek Studies , '' but a being of our own age , a follower of
Rousseau	PERSON	and the cult of feeling , a poet who has strayed into the domain of prose .

		A modern romanticist , but , let us add , a romanticist who has read his Plato and learned the message of the Greeks , the force of his imagina - tion draws him irresistibly to that period of '' bril - liant sins '' and '' fantastic theories '' which we call the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Romanticism tempered by tKe study of philoso - phy a poet corrected by the discipline of an intel - lectual ideal !

		For , after all , the sterner attitude is not wanting , even here .

		Earliest of all these stu - dies , the essay on
Winckelmann	PERSON	may serve as a measure of that ideal , clearly descried but still imperfectly attained .

		Like Goethe ,
Pater	PERSON	found in
Winckelmann	LOCATION	an intellectual prototype ; he , too , '' penetrated by instinct rather than by understand - ing , the subtlest principles of the Greek manner . ''

		How different from the attitude of the typical scholar , even in the Oxford of
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	! ''

		To penetrate into the antique world by one 's pas - sion , one 's temperament '' that surely is only a poet 's privilege , and the imagery of this volume of essays , sensuous , poetic , never quite subdued to the sober uses of prose , gives the critic a suspicion of the many lines of verse all destroyed after the manner of Goethe with his Juvenilia which Mr.
Wright	PERSON	tells us preceded these essays on the Renaissance .


Winckelmann	PERSON	was indeed an effective influence in the formation of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's ideals .

		The great German , also , '' rejects metaphysics , finding the true service of philosophy in its power to suggest questions which help one to detect the passion and strangeness and dramatic contrasts of life . ''

		Such was to be the service of philosophy for
Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		His , too , was '' a culture in which the moral instinct , like the religious or political , was merged in the artistic . ''

		He would have liked to `` attain not only as intense but as complete a life as pos - sible , '' although he early accepted the limitations which the aesthetic attitude imposes .

		And it is just here that
Pater	PERSON	's ideal touches that of Goethe : the ideal of one '' to whom every moment of life brought its contribution of experimental , individual knowledge , by whom no touch of the world of form , colour , and passion was disregarded . ''

		Nevertheless , we must admit that he fell short of Goethe by mistaking the means for the end .

		But we may not discuss
Pater	PERSON	's philosophy , even in so far as it illustrates his artistic theories .

		We must pass on to the other essays in this volume . ''

		A lover of strange souls , '' he studies
Leonardo	PERSON	and
Sandro Botticelli	PERSON	, finding in da
Vinci	PERSON	's work , in the work of the Renaissance generally , that union of '' curiosity '' and '' the desire of beauty '' which is the keynote , not only of this period and this particular master , but of the very spirit of romanti - cism and the work of Pater himself .

		In the curi - ously imaginative portrait of Leonardo he reads the secret of a life `` that fascinates or perhaps half repels '' ; the fascination of interests not wholly pleasant being one of the dangers of the romantic temper , best seen perhaps in Hugo 's abuse of the grotesque .

		In his later writings Pater largely overcame this morbidity , evident enough in certain parts of these essays , pervading the imagery and manifest in many exotic flowers of style .

		The interest in romantic landscape is there , and the interest in romantic personality , and all the poetry of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's own romanticism is summed up in the figure by which the incomplete realism of da
Vinci	PERSON	's backgrounds is explained as an effect of tempera - ment : '' through
Leonardo	PERSON	's strange veil of sight things reach him so , in no ordinary night or day , but as in the faint light of eclipse , or in some brief interval of falling rain at daybreak , or through deep water . ''

		It is the art of a poet who has made himself a critic .

		So back of the portrait of
Leonardo	LOCATION	, back of nearly every portrait in the volume , we see the figure of the author .

		His very artistic poise is that of da
Vinci	PERSON	, '' careless alike of present and of future applause . ''

		In Pater , too , one might fancy that '' this solitary culture of beauty ... hung upon a kind of self-love , and a carelessness in the work of art of all but art itself . '' ''

		Out of the secret places of a unique temperament he brought strange blossoms and fruits hitherto unknown , and for him the novel impression conveyed , the ex - quisite effect woven , counted as an end in itself a perfect end . ''

		Well !

		there we have the defects of the romantic attitude .

		That sensitiveness of temperament must be paid for by some weakness , and the reader need not pass beyond this essay to find the pitfalls that threaten a strongly sensuous or emotional mind .

		We need not dwell upon them .

		Only youth can re-read the '' Renaissance '' without some moments of cloying , only the effeminate can enjoy the sug - gestion of the perfume of the tuberose in its style .

		The very affectation of restraint gives relief to these blemishes , exaggerations of delicacy , '' thin and fine as some sea-shell worn by the wind . ''

		The wind , for - sooth !

		There is a sense of strain in all such minute - ness ; nothing is left for the imagination to supply .

		Yet it must be admitted that in proportion to the bulk of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's writings , faults of this category are few .

		They are the defects of his sensibility , redeemed by the warmth that a poet 's feeling can give to thought under intellectual control .

		Warmth , fervor , the force of a personal appeal these are the final justification of the romantic attitude ; and after all there is a very real splendor in even this early volume on the Renaissance .

		It has the beauty of atmosphere , ' * a beauty wrought out from within the deposit , little cell by cell , of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions . ''

		Its defects are the defects of young writers , outgrown as youth merges into maturity .

		And while Pater never quite outgrew his fundamental romanticism , as we may see from occasional lapses in '' Imaginary Portraits , '' he did learn to appreciate the value of the classical restraint .

		A genuine discipline , the slow practice of his art repressed the man of feeling ; the poet gave way to the priest of an aesthetic intellec - tualism .

		And it is this ideal , pruning away the excesses of his early essays , which we find beneath the measured beauty of ''
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean . ''

		How shall an admirer of Pater speak judiciously of `` Marius '' ?

		How shall we judge this romance of the intellectual life ?

		It is true that ''
Marius	PERSON	'' vio - lates nearly every canon of the novel , yet it is none
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 291 the less the finest of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's imaginary portraits .

		Always deeply autobiographical , it represents both sides of its reticent author ; in its pages we still find the poet , but the spirit of his apologia is pene - trated by a fine reserve .

		We all know that gracious figure , whose very ardor is touched with ascetic severity , vain seeker of a philosophy that shall satisfy both the artist and the puritan within him .

		Oxford alone could have produced such a character the atmosphere of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and the comely meas - ure of its cloistered life .

		So
Marius	PERSON	, after all , is perhaps less an ancient Roman than a type of modern character .

		What he really shows us is the other side of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's nature , the child who loved to play ' church '' in his tender years , the deeply re - ligious boy of the school-days at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		That early ideal of a priestly vocation , held to , in fact , until his twentieth year
Pater	PERSON	retained something of it through all the perplexities of his period of intellectual revolt , a true ascesis , consonant with those processes of cold philosophic thought that led to his final suspension of judgment , cherished '' as if to fit him for that closer vision of truth to which perchance he might be on the way . ''

		Like
Kenan	PERSON	's ,
Pater	PERSON	's mind remained to the end a catMdrale desaffectee .

		He felt the aesthetic charm of religion , no less than the hero of his novel , and if the final conversion of
Marius	PERSON	is a little uncon - vincing , the attitude involved is surely not so far to seek in the growth of ritualism everywhere in the present day .

		A real imaginary portrait , ''
Marius	PERSON	'' moves across a background remarkable for its antiquarian truth .

		There is a scholar as well as a poet in
Walter Pater	PERSON	, quite apart from the more formal scholarship of his '' Plato '' and '' Greek Studies . ''

		In ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' however , it is less a formal scholar - ship than a sense of the picturesque that gives color to his backgrounds ; they are really choice bits of his travel memories , refined into pictures , always poetic , and grown really atmospheric with the lapse of years .

		Take for instance the description of '' White Nights '' Ad Vigilias Albas .

		It is in such rapid sketches of romantic landscape , seen under broken lights or in strong shadow , that
Pater	PERSON	is often at his best ; and the result is like a modern etching or pen-drawing .

		Like the great masters of the line , he knows now to make his accents '' tell . ''

		Consider his description of a Roman winter , all the luxury and color of its life compressed into five lines : '' The habit-makers made a great sale of the spoil of all such furry creatures as had escaped wolves and eagles , for present * at the
Saturnalia	LOCATION	; and at no time had the winter roses from
Carthage	LOCATION	seemed more lustrously yellow and red . ''

		Here indeed we have the art of the etcher , and the single accent in the picture is as vibrant with color as the blacks of
Daniel Vierge	PERSON	.

		There are many such bits in '' Imaginary Por - traits . ''

		As portraits , nevertheless , they have a cer - tain unreality , despite the fact that Pater himself sat for most of them .

		Gaston ,
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	,
Duke Carl of Rosenmold	ORGANIZATION	, what are they but the various moods of Pater 's mind , so singular in its comtemplative ideals , so unreal against the strenuous life of to-day ?

		Dream-figures all of them , from the wistful Child in the
House to Emerald Uthwart	ORGANIZATION	, the children of his imagination bear the features of their creator ; they are all of them romantic idealists , they are spectators of life , celibates and dreamers every one .

		The pathos of early death is theirs , and the pathos of failure ; they pass across the stage like visions of youth , and leave the memory of a broken cadence in the air .

		Nor are the historical characters , the subjects of Pater 's '' Appreciations , '' more definitely outlined , except in those aspects of their genius that conform with their author 's interests or his varying moods .

		He is not a great critic , after all .

		A real critic , a genius like Sainte-Beuve or even
Monsieur Anatole France	PERSON	, Pater would undoubtedly have shown a wider critical range .

		A singular narrowness is traceable in the list of types which attracted him ; not one of
England	LOCATION	's older classics has a place , save
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	; not one of the classic writers of
France	LOCATION	except the tortured spirit of
Pascal	LOCATION	.

		This is the best proof of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's romantic tendencies ; a writer who speaks of the '' insipid ornament '' of
Racine	LOCATION	has not pene - trated the spirit of the
Grand Siecle	LOCATION	.

		His interests , in fine , were elsewhere .

		Aucassin and
Nicolette	PERSON	, Amis and Amiles , the work of Ronsard or of Mon - taigne , it was the romantic note , the touch of lyrical or personal quality , that mainly attracted him in his deep love of French literature ; and so he passed over the age of classicism to the subjec - tive writers of modern times .

		We may , of course , set over against this his studies in classical anti- quity , so important in any complete study of this writer ; but even then we must not forget his in - sistence upon the romantic aspects of Greek art .

		The '' Postscript '' of `` Appreciations '' gives us
Pater	PERSON	's justification of this aesthetic attitude , and the preface of the volume his theory of style .

		In this brief article it would be impossible to consider either .

		Taken together , these essays constitute the most valuable part of his studies in English letters .

		But the real significance of '' Appreciations '' lies in its slightness of texture , its inequality to the rest of his published work .

		In the field of modern literature ,
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's chief interests lay with the Ro - mance countries ; the most important part of his criticism deals , not with
England	LOCATION	, but with
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		His favorite authors , as enumerated by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, are largely French , and quotations from the great French writers slip readily from his pen .

		This preference is patent even in his English studies ; the essay on
Wordsworth	PERSON	alone has seven references to the literature of
France	LOCATION	.

		In the essay on Style , it is the theory of Flaubert that
Pater	PERSON	elaborates ; and we know that for many years he translated daily a page from Flaubert or from Sainte-Beuve .

		How deeply he was influenced by this may be seen in his Gallicisms : '' a poem still inedited , '' * ' the true intention of the myth '' ; '' the 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, perfect justice of his style '' permits him these in - fractions ; and '' what has not been so generally observed as the excellence of his literary criticism , '' he takes a na'ive delight in the use of these '' morsels '' of preciosity .

		His theory of the abso - luteness of art `` art for art 's sake '' is an echo of
The'ophile Gautier	PERSON	, and it was
Gautier	PERSON	's practice that taught him his devotion to the dictionary .

		His idea of romanticism is , in part ,
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's , his conception of the function of the humanist that of Sainte-Beuve , while his whole theory of criticism is colored by the writings of the same great French - man .

		No English critic , surely , was ever so per - meated by French influence as
Walter Pater	PERSON	, and we are not surprised to learn that his
summer	DATE	travels led him , not to
Greece	LOCATION	, which curiously enough he never visited , but to
Italy	LOCATION	, and prefer - ably to the grey midland towns of sunny
France	LOCATION	.

		His was a Latin temperament refined by an Anglo-Saxon mind .

		One might pursue the subject further , and spoil an excellent subject for a doctor 's dissertation .

		But such malevolence should not tempt the reviewer ; he will merely indicate the importance of the fact in the appreciation of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's influence and place in English letters .

		We can not estimate all that our literature has gained from contact with Latin culture and Latin ideals , presented in the work of one who was so faithful to their artistic spirit .

		We can not know what
Pater	PERSON	has done for us in an age de - voted to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	and the charms of journalistic prose .

		We can not perceive what the real fineness of his ideal , with its warmth and color and persuasive force , is doing for us in an age tending all too swiftly toward a morality either Stoical or grossly Epicurean , nor whether the '' ascesis '' involved in a true discipleship will over - come the dangers implied in a literal acceptance of its theory .

		Fifty years from now , students of lit - erary history will decide these questions .

		But we can admit the disinterested service of his literary scholarship ; we can praise him for resisting the pressure toward facile production and cheaply acquired fame .

		We can recognize , in fine , the intellectual beauty of his ideal .

		Will this ideal survive ?

		The future alone can tell .

		In the in - creasing organization of a commercial society , in the increasing demands of life for utilitarian art , it may be that we shall come to turn to it as our one chance of freedom , our one chance of escape from the tyranny of industrialism the pleasures of the intellect and the consolation of the arts .

		Certainly we can not read Pater without enriching our own intellectual life .

		We can not read him unmoved by his aesthetic rectitude , by his fine reserve towards experience , by his conception of life itself as the highest art .

		Like Plato , his master ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	can make us feel a sense of dedication in this de - votion to the
Highest Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, as in the mere regard for fidelity of style to impression he can make us feel the glow of an ethical grace .

PIAGKT SHANKS	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WAR AND POETRY has always been close .

		Those interested in one have , more than commonly , been interested in the other .

		Mr.
Hudson Maxim	PERSON	's book , `` The Science of Poetry , '' is the latest exemplification of this fact .

		It proposes to record the author 's conquest of criti - cism and his taming and breaking in of the steed
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.

		While we have considerable respect for the insight and good sense Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	occasionally displays , we doubt very much whether the Sphinx of poetry will sink into the ground at his reading of its riddle .

		The book bristles with the technicalities of modern science .

		It starts off with an array of fixed principles all made out of the brain of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		It would not be difficult for a meta - physician to pick holes in most or all of these ; and it is curious that at the moment when many of the world 's greatest scientists are taking the back track , a writer should base a study of so immaterial an art as poetry on the positive judg - ments of evolutionary science .

		Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	, in a recent address before the
London	LOCATION
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, threw up the sponge for the atomic theory . ''

		There is no matter , '' he admitted .


M. Flammarion	PERSON	, the French astronomer , is a convert to '' spookism , '' and the late
Cesare Lombroso	PERSON	went down before the proofs of occult phenomena .

		Some of the greatest science builders of the past were uncon - vinced by their own discoveries .

		Pascal , one of the world 's great mathematicians , grew to believe that mathematical axioms were baseless assumptions .

		Newton thought that it was impossible for one body to act upon another at a distance .

		Faraday urged arguments against his own
Conservation of Energy	ORGANIZATION	theory .

		But to Mr. Maxim '' the exact sciences have no differences of opinion . ''

		He decides that `` a living body is a body of matter . ''

		He is sure that '' consciousness is the sense of the awareness of the other senses . ''

		Being a sense it must therefore have extension , form , organs .

		Has anybody seen it ?

		He bases his psychology on
William James	PERSON	's restatement of
Locke	PERSON	's tabula rasa theory of the human mind , which ignores
Leibnitz	PERSON	's amendment of that theory and
Kant	PERSON	's confutation of it .

		Pro- fessor
James	PERSON	, in the passage quoted , propounds , as unalterable truths , that one born deaf can never be made to imagine what sound is like , and that one born blind can have no mental vision .

		We have in
America	LOCATION	to-day a most distinguished contradiction to these laws in the person of a young woman born deaf and dumb and blind , who , to judge from her writings , must be capable of conceiving both sound and image .

		Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	is particularly hard on the inspiration-intoxication theory of poetry which has been held by so many philosophers and poets , from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Byron	PERSON	.

		He objects that inventors have equal claim to any such divine fire .

		True ; and
Stevenson	PERSON	remarked that '' neither poetry nor the plastic arts can compete , sir , for a moment with the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 293 finished conduct of a large body of men in the face of an enemy . ''

		But though doubtless more important than the organization of poetic genius , no one has yet formulated a law by which great inventors or military commanders may be produced at will .

		This is what Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	has done for poetry ; and he exemplifies his '' machine method '' both by original verses of his own and by amended versions of great passages out of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		`` We have no wish to criticize these efforts , but we would ask , '' How can Mr.
Hudson Maxim	PERSON	be sure that he is not the victim of inspiration in producing them ? ''

		Poetic frenzy may have slipped in without his noticing it .

		... THE DESTRUCTION OF A PRICELESS LIBRARY , containing rare works that can be replaced only at vast expense , other books that can not be replaced at all , and manuscripts whose loss is obviously irre - parable , is always a grievous calamity .

		In the case of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, severely damaged by fire and water on the twenty-ninth of
last month	DATE	, when the twenty-five-million-dollar capitol building at
Albany	LOCATION	was ravaged by flames , it is not alone the splendid library itself , but also the library school connected with it , that suffers , thus bringing loss and some degree of becripplement to the whole public library system of the country .

		Probably some weeks or.even months must pass before it can be known exactly what portion of the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, as well as of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and Assembly libraries , is a total loss .

		All three collections contained much irreplaceable matter .

		According to the published statement of the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	numbered at the time of the fire six hundred thousand volumes , four hundred thousand pamphlets , and three hundred thousand historical manuscripts .

		Even allowing for error or consider - able exaggeration in these figures , we know that the library was one of the most valuable in the country , its department of genealogical works alone being unequalled , and its early Dutch records having a priceless worth in the eyes of historical writers and scholars .

		By a fortunate prevision of possible dis - aster , the Commissioner two years ago transferred from the library to his office safe the original manu - script of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's Emancipation Proclamation , that of
Washington	LOCATION	's
Farewell Address	ORGANIZATION	, also that of the
State Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, and fifteen or twenty other precious documents , together with the
Washington	LOCATION	relics owned by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		A rough estimate of the library 's loss of replaceable books and equip - ment puts it at
two million dollars	MONEY	.

		But it is the destruction of so many unique volumes , pamphlets , and manuscripts , that causes the sorest regret .

		.

		A GREEK SCHOLAR ON MODERN GREEK has uttered a word of interest to all who concern them - selves with the question whether it is desirable to learn the tongue now spoken in
Athens	LOCATION	, in connec - tion with or in preparation for the study of ancient Greek .

		Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	, one of the faithful few who have kept up their classics since college days , is moved by the perusal of his
London	LOCATION	''
Hel	PERSON	- lenic Herald '' to lament the deterioration in the noble tongue of ^ schylus and Aristotle .

		In his ``
Boston	LOCATION	Literary Letter '' to the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican '' he writes : `` That gift of effective expression * has not descended with the alphabet to the children of renowned sires , if you call the modern Greeks tliat Their language went through stages of descent and transformation ; it suffered by being the vehicle of ecclesiastical dogma and controversial Christianity , and then by falling among the medley of barbarian conquerors of the lands from which the once-planted Greek could not be extirpated .

		He stayed , but he was stripped and bound and flogged , like the victim of banditti else - where ; and the same that happened to the man in scripture travelling from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to
Jericho	LOCATION	, or to poor
Poe	PERSON	captured by roughs and plug-uglies in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, befell the Greek language also .

		Its fine draping garments were stolen , and a mass of fustian and tatters was substituted .

		The good Samaritans , who took pity on the fallen dialect , did what they could , but their oil and wine were not always of the best sort '' Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	admits that the spirit of poetry still lingers in the
Greece	LOCATION	of to-day , and he finds the language of her modern poets less sadly degenerate than that of her prose writers .

		But the charm of modern Greek , so far as it has charm , lies for most persons in its startling resem - blance , in general aspect at least , and on the printed page , to the language of Homer three thousand years ago ...
MRS. HOWE	PERSON	'S '' HIPPOLTTUS , '' which was pre - sented at the
Tremont Theatre	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, on the
afternoon	TIME	of
March 24	DATE	, by Miss
Margaret Anglin	PERSON	and a selected company , for the benefit of the
Howe	ORGANIZATION	memorial fund , has a rather interesting his - tory .

		Written half a century ago for immediate production , and specially adapted to the abilities of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, who was to have played the title role , and of
Charlotte Cushman	LOCATION	, who was to have taken the part of
Phaedra	LOCATION	, its rehearsals were suddenly discontinued because of jealousies on the stage that of the old
Howard Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	concerning the assignment of the
Phaedra	LOCATION	to
Miss Cushman	LOCATION	.

		The wife of the manager coveted the dis - tinction of appearing in that character , and the re - sulting discord resulted in the play 's being dropped , in Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's writing no more for the cantanker - ous player-folk , and in the near-loss to the world of a noble effort in dramatic poetry .

		The piece remained unpublished and all but forgotten until Miss
Anglin	PERSON	reminded Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	of its existence , asked permission to read it , and undertook to bring it out .

		Of the play itself , which is not at all a slavish imitation of either Euripides or
Racine	LOCATION	, it appears that no triumphant run , whether in Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's own city or elsewhere , can be hoped for it ; but it is a more than creditable piece of work , and its blank verse rises at times to a dignity and beauty 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, that increase our admiration for its gifted author .

		To be retired to the quiet company of the '' closet '' dramas is by no means the worst conceivable fate .

		What were
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing , in this respect , but '' closet '' dramatists ?

		A NEW DEPARTMENT IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY , or at least one not noted by us before , comes to our attention in scanning the pages of the '' Fourteenth Annual Report of the
Buffalo	LOCATION	Public Library . ''

		In addition to the rooms for adult readers and book - borrowers , and the now indispensable children 's room , the
Buffalo	LOCATION	librarian , Mr.
Walter L. Brown	PERSON	, reports on the work and the progress of the Inter - mediate Department . ''

		This , '' he says , '' is intended for the young people from fourteen to sixteen years of age , and the books are performing a very useful service in introducing them to many authors not found in the children 's collections . ''

		It is further added , in connection with the work of this depart - ment , that '' the head of the Children 's Room , with some of her assistants , has visited the department stores in the neighborhood of the main building , and has invited the young boys and girls employed there to spend their noon hour in the Library .

		Many who had not before used the Library are to be found there . ''

		Obviously it is among the `` inter - mediates , '' those passing through the critical and impressionable period of adolescence , that there is an unequalled opportunity for effective and benefi - cent work on the part of those striving to increase the patronage and enlarge the usefulness of the public library .

		We should be inclined , however , to extend the scope of the new department and to let it include boys and girls up to the age of eighteen or say , even , all those that are in their ` teens .

		NEW LETTERS OF
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON	PERSON	, to the number of some hundred and fifty , will be embodied in the forthcoming definitive edition of all the letters of
R. L. S.	PERSON	, upon which Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	has long been at work .

		In this new edition , comprising four volumes of medium size , the two separate series of '' Letters to his Family and Friends '' and ''
Vailima	LOCATION	Letters , '' together with those hitherto unpublished , will be combined and rearranged in chronological order .

		A pleasant foretaste of the new letters is offered to readers of the
April	DATE	'' Scribner 's , '' which contains an even dozen of them , with running comment by Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	.

		The specimen letters are widely varied in date and manner , from a lively narrative of an early trip to
Staffa	ORGANIZATION	, lona , and Earraid , and a whim - sical analysis of `` philosophical carelessness , '' to the suggestion of a design for his tomb sent to Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	, and the forcedly cheerful note to
James Walter Ferrier	PERSON	written just after a dangerous illness in
San Francisco	LOCATION	. ''

		Humanly attractive and com - panionable '' are Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's adjectives for the
Stevenson	PERSON	letters , new and old , and we can not better them .

		The geniality of the man breathes through the new letters as through everything else he wrote .

		And so the epitaph he composed for himself at the
Bohemian Club	ORGANIZATION	in
1880	DATE	has been realized in the happiest sense : `` You , who pass this grave , put aside hatred ; love kindness ; be all services remem - bered in your heart and all offences pardoned ; and as you go down again among the living , let this be your question : can I make some one happier this day before I lie down to sleep ? ''

		A
FRENCH E. P. ROE	ORGANIZATION	has been discovered by the
Paris	LOCATION	literary correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' in the person of that highly readable novelist whose '' Ironmaster '' is held in agreeable remembrance by many American readers of middle age .

		Mr.
A. F. Sanborn	PERSON	writes : ``
Georges Ohnet	PERSON	occupies a position somewhat akin to that which
E. P. Roe	PERSON	occupied in
America	LOCATION	a generation ago .

		His novels usually rank among the ` best sellers , ' but they are not taken seriously in literary circles .

		M. Ohnet obviously chafes under this literary ostra - cism the more so that he was regarded , at the outset of his career , as a writer of much promise ; and , now and again , he makes a strenuous effort to strike out in a new direction , in the hope of lifting the ban .

		Such an effort was his ' Route Rouge , ' in which he essayed , three or four years ago , to make a serious study of the vexed social problem .

		Such another effort is his recent historical novel , ' Pour
Tuer Bonaparte	PERSON	' .

		. ''

		Which is worse , to be taken without seriousness by the critics , but with seriousness , and eagerness , too , by the great reading public ; or to be taken with seriousness by the critics , but without seriousness , and perhaps not at all , by the reading public ?

		Tastes differ , and there are writers who would dislike to find themselves in the same class with the '' best sellers '' ; but there are also writers as for example ,
Miss Marie Corelli	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	who , we imagine , would think twice before exchanging their pecu - niarily profitable popularity for any amount of unre - munerative seriousness at the hands of critics .

		THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED LIBRARIANS has not yet been exceeded by the supply , and is not likely soon to be thus exceeded .

		The library-school grad - uate does not have to hang out his '' shingle '' and wait weary weeks and months for things to move his way .

		He commonly steps from his -LRB- or more often her -RRB- commencement platform right into a com - fortable , even though seldom generously remunera - tive , position that often has been waiting some time for a properly qualified incumbent .

		In the current report of the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlanta	LOCATION	it is an - nounced that the library training school of that institution has , in the five years of its existence , graduated fifty-two pupils , all of whom -LRB- excepting four who preferred either some other occupation or matrimony -RRB- are now pursuing the calling for which they were trained , a good number having found positions in the South .

		Twenty-two are in public
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 libraries , and seventeen in college and normal school libraries . ''

		The list of trained librarians in
Southern	LOCATION	educational institutions , '' writes
Miss Rankin	PERSON	.

		the
Atlanta	LOCATION	librarian , '' is particularly gratifying to all who are interested in the cause of education in the South .

		It shows a most commendable desire on the part of the authorities in charge , to build up the libraries and make them vital parts of the work of the schools , which have in the past been greatly handicapped by the lack of just such facilities . ''

		.

		A WOUXD TO THE PKIDE OF THE DlCKENS FAMILY has been inflicted by the widely circulated report in connection with the centenary
Dickens	PERSON	stamp , that the novelist 's descendants , or the major - ity of them , are in circumstances the reverse of affluent .

		Mr.
Henry F. Dickens	PERSON	now feels it in - cumbent on his father 's son to protest against this false assumption of a pecuniary need which the pro- ceeds of the stamp sale are to relieve .

		He had been assured , at the beginning of the beneficent enterprise , that the plan was simply to make a tardy atonement for injustice wrought by defective copyright laws , as a fitting observance of the novelist 's centenary .

		And of course it is this country that has been re - garded as the chief offender in holding back all these years the thousands of dollars in royalties that should have gone to
Dickens	PERSON	and his heirs .

		It is some comfort to learn , from the researches of Mr. La - bouchere in '' Truth , '' that the author so grievously defrauded left an estate amounting to the handsome total of ninety-three thousand pounds , besides a fund of good proportions set apart under trustees for a special purpose .

		It is also reassuring to be told once more that though there are some needy persons in the
Dickens	PERSON	clan -LRB- for every family has its poor relations -RRB- , most of the descendants of him whose birthday we celebrate are well-to-do .

		How TO BE A SUCCESSFUL WRITER is a question that puzzles many , and among them a recent con - tributor to `` Collier 's Weekly . ''

		In an article on '' The Rewards of Writing '' he sorrowfully relates his own meagrely remunerative experiences of twenty years , and pathetically exclaims , '' I do wish somebody would tell me how to break into the promised land . ''

		A reply is elicited in another journal from a penman who complacently describes his rapid rise from three-quarters of a cent per word to
five cents	MONEY	, and his sanguine hopes of several additional cents in the near future .

		And writing is not his vocation , either , but his avocation his evening amusement .

		Nevertheless he earns by his pen two hundred and
fifty dollars	MONEY	a month , and has been writing only half as many years as the unsuccessful writer whom he is telling how to do it .

		He reads assiduously , spending as many hours thus as in writing ; and after that it is all as easy as standing behind a counter and selling ribbon by the yard , and also considerably more dignified and remunerative . ''

		I have placed articles and stories , '' he says , `` with 35-cent magazines , 15-centers , 10-centers , and juveniles .

		I have run serials in newspapers and I have written special articles for magazine supplements .

		I began at three-quarters of a cent a word , lingered at that rate for a con - siderable period , passed to a cent , then to
two cents	MONEY	, then to three , and some time ago I reached the point wheie I could make the rate of
five cents	MONEY	a word for adult fiction and
three cents	MONEY	a word for juvenile material , and get it . ''

		He is a diligent reader of the classics , and he treats us , in closing , to the following : `` Ars longa , vita breva . ''

		At last we have revealed the secret , if not of genius , at least of literary success -LRB- in the market -RRB- .

		MR.
MAURICE HEWLETT	PERSON	'S FAITH IN FAIRIES is attested in an interesting study of the `` little people '' in a recent number of '' The English Review . '' ''

		I should like to think that I was to be the man to write upon this subject seriously , '' says Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, expounding his ideal fairy book , based not on literature , not on out-worn traditions like the fairy godmother , not on the pathetic fallacy that man is the centre of the universe , but on experience and a high , fine sense of the mysteries that lie all about us .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has found fairies asleep , `` and so profoundly that my clumsy tread or breath has not awakened them . ''

		He has seen a fairy playing with a rabbit in a wood .

		He has heard of many authentic marriages between fairies and mortals , and knows the laws that govern the transmission of the fairy nature .

		Fairies '' are as swift as swallows on the wing , but not so immersed in business ; they are as inconsequent as bats at dusk , but not so seemingly frivolous .

		These dis - tinctions are subtle , yet very necessary to be made ; and to any one who has seen fairies they will appeal immediately as being just . ''

		All this is tantalizing .

		If Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	is not ready to devote himself to the writing of the great book of the fairies , he might at least tell us more of his fairy visions unless he is afraid of invoking the wrath of the '' little people '' by betraying their secrets to blind and dull-eared humans .

		A `` COMPLETE WORKS '' DEPARTMENT has been established in the
Dubuque Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Library workers will be interested in the official report that this department is placed next to the fiction section and serves as a wholesome enticement away from exclusive novel-reading to the study of other works . ''

		The separate volumes are classified as individual books , '' explains the librarian , `` but each one is marked below with the volume number of the com - plete set .

		* THE LAST OF FOUR GIFTED BROTHERS ,
Henry Mitchell Whitney	PERSON	, librarian of the
James Black	PERSON	- stone Memorial Library of
Branford	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, died at the age of sixty-eight on the
26th of last month	DATE	.

		Son of
Josiah Dwight Whitney	PERSON	of
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and brother to
Josiah Dwight , Jr.	PERSON	,
William Dwight	PERSON	, and
James Lyman Whitney	PERSON	, he was mani - festly destined to win success in some walk of life .

		As a matter of fact he acquitted himself well in three or four professions , serving with credit in the Civil War , after that entering the Congregational ministry and filling several successive pastorates , including one at
Geneva	LOCATION	, 111. , and one at
Beloit	LOCATION	,
Wis.	LOCATION	, holding the professorship of English literature in
Beloit College	LOCATION
from 1871	DATE	to
1899	DATE	, and having charge of the public library at
Branford	ORGANIZATION	from the latter date until his sudden death in
New Haven	LOCATION	from heart failure three weeks ago .

		It appears in reviewing the enviable record of this gifted
New England	LOCATION	family that three out of the four brothers held college professorships while contribut - ing in other ways to the cause of learning or letters , and two of them
James Lyman	PERSON	and the subject of this note turned finally to librarianship and ended their days in that calling after rendering noteworthy service to the profession .

		THE GREATEST AUCTION-SALE OF BOOKS ever known is about to begin at
Anderson	ORGANIZATION	's in
New York	LOCATION	, where the first part of the famous Hoe library will come under the hammer on the twenty - fourth of this month .

		From then until the fifth of
May	DATE	two sessions will be held daily , except
Satur	PERSON	- days and
Sundays	DATE	.

		More than three thousand five hundred lots will be disposed of in that period , the entire collection comprising about sixteen thousand titles .

		It is in respect to the probable proceeds of this sale that we have used the word '' greatest . ''

		There are said to be as many as ten books and manuscripts that will undoubtedly bring more than ten thousand dollars each , and foremost among these is the vellum copy of the
Gutenberg Latin Bible	ORGANIZATION	printed by
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	and
Fust	ORGANIZATION	at Maintz in 1450-55 .

		It is described as bound in two folio volumes , in contemporary oak boards covered with pigskin .

		Its only defect is the substitution of two leaves in facsimile .

		At the
Perkins	PERSON	sale in
1873	DATE	this work was sold for
seventeen thousand dollars	MONEY	, and at the
Ashburnham	LOCATION	sale
twenty-four years later	DATE	it brought twenty thousand .

		It will be offered on the first day of the coming sale .

		AN INTERESTING LITERARY LAWSUIT , wherein
M. Anatole France	PERSON	is the defendant , presents a new legal problem .

		In
1882	DATE	this author , then far less famous than now , sold to a publisher the manuscript of a two-volume history of
France	LOCATION	.

		Last
November	DATE	the first proofs of the work were sent to the author for correction , but they have not yet been returned to the publisher , who is urgent in his demand that either they shall be sent back to him properly re - vised or permission be granted to issue the work without the author 's corrections of proof .

		Naturally enough
M. France	PERSON	has found his ideas and opinions of twenty-nine years ago not identical with those he holds to-day ; and he refuses to sanction this belated appearance of his youthful production .

		Doubtless the notable increase in the author 's fame since that far-off date of the purchase of his manuscript has influenced the publisher in his recent action , and it would seem hard if he should not be allowed to realize a little profit , however tardily , from his in - vestment .

		On the other hand , the author 's reluctance to have the book appear as a new work from his pen is not to be wondered at .

		The best solution of the diffi - culty might be a thorough revision of the book , with that additional compensation to which the author 's present vogue should entitle him in the book market .

		* * HOW TO MAKE THE MAGAZINE FUND GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE is an important question with most in - dividual purchasers and with all libraries and certain other public institutions .

		A help toward the selec - tion of periodicals is furnished by the

		The list should prove useful to libraries of moderate means , the selections being made with regard not only to the current interest and value of the periodicals , but also to their useful - ness as works of reference when bound .

		A CENSORSHIP OF FICTION , AND SOME OTHER MATTERS .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-


London	LOCATION	,
April 5 , 1911	DATE	.

		It is now more than a year since the
Liberal Government	ORGANIZATION	, led by a variety of causes which have never been accurately determined , instituted a
Joint Select Committee of the two Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	to enquire into the then pressing question of the Censorship of Stage Plays .

		In this country the
Lord Chamberlain	PERSON	, an officer of the
Royal House	ORGANIZATION	- hold , is responsible for the morality and respecta - bility of the plays produced , for in the old days the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 players themselves were part of the king 's private household .

		At least , I presume that this is the reason for the
Lord Chamberlain	PERSON	's having this pe - culiar and sometimes rather delicate task on his hands .

		Not that he attends to the matter himself : it is delegated to another officer , known as the
Examiner of Plays	ORGANIZATION	, who had absolute power to forbid the performance of any dramatic work that failed to come up to his standard of what was seemly .

		This important post has been filled of late years by Mr.
G. A. Redford	PERSON	; before him , if I remember rightly , it was held by a Mr.
Piggott	PERSON	, but that was so long ago that I may possibly spell his name wrong .

		Against the amiability , morality , and general capability of these gentlemen even censored dramatists have said remarkably little ; but it has been urged , with some show of reason , that the power they possess is too great for any one man to wield : that they have often , in Biblical phrase , strained at gnats while cheerfully swallowing camels ; and that , in short , the man who should fill such a difficult position satisfactorily would need a combination of qualities never hitherto discoverable in the person of a single individual .

		Some sug - gested recourse to that last refuge of the Englishman in a difficulty a committee ; others , more bold , proposed the abolition of the office altogether .

		Pub - lic opinion was aroused on the subject ; there were many private gentlemen anxious to ventilate their views in letters to the press ; Mr.
Harcourt	PERSON	, a young and clever member of the Liberal party , took the matter under his wing , and the
Select Committee	ORGANIZATION	mentioned above was the result .

		In Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's latest volume , `` The Doctor 's Dilemma , '' published two weeks ago , may be found a preface dealing at considerable length with the action of this
Select Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like all Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's prefaces , it makes very interesting and piquant reading , and gives incidentally a reason - able statement of his own views on the whole ques - tion of censorship .

		His own play , `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession , '' had come under the ban of the censor - ship , and he himself was one of the numerous wit - nesses called upon to give evidence before the com - mittee .

		I can not but think that the liberty of the drama might have gained if Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	could have been quietly hocussed and kept in bed while these examinations were proceeding ; for it is evident from his own amusing account of the matter that so ardent a revolutionary frightened the committee out of all its judicial calm .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, not content with oral evidence , must needs prepare and present to this
august	DATE	body a pamphlet setting forth his opinions on liberty in general ; and no doubt some of the committee heard in his sentences the prophetic rumble of twentieth-century tumbrils .

		It was clear , at any rate , that the majority regarded Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as a very dangerous person : they returned him his printed statement and refused to examine him further ; and in the end published a lengthy report and ceased from their labors , leaving things , for all practical purposes , just where they were before .

		That is to say , they recommended that the Censor 's permission should no longer be obligatory , but they coupled with this such suggestions that no manager of a theatre in his senses would dare to produce a play without that permission .

		As Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	points out , the license of the Censor is the cheapest and most efficient insurance possible against subsequent trouble , and any manager who neglected to secure it would be a fool for his pains .

		This agitation simmered for a while and then died down , as such agitations do , but it left a legacy .

		Since that committee retired from active service there has been a distinct recrudescence of energy on the part of those busy people who are in favor of Morality by
Act of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was a Censor of the Drama , why should there not be also a Censor of Fiction ?

		Certain novels had been coming out which the press declared to have a vicious and immoral tendency .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	pro- duced ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	, '' and the '' Spectator , '' that eminently sober and respectable weekly which still possesses a large circulation among lovers of domestic animals , gave it a slashing review in two heavy columns .

		At once there was another rush on the correspondence columns of the daily press , and wives of clergymen , headmasters of preparatory schools , and others demanded loudly that these things should be stopped .

		Something had to be done in the face of this outcry , and the chief circulating libraries stepped into the breach and instituted a little censorship of their own .

		During the hist year or so certain novels have been banned at the libraries , and in consequence have sold considerably more copies than if no library censorship had been in operation .

		Evidently this plan has not produced the effect desired and expected by its promoters .

		Something more drastic is required before the stream of fiction can be purified .

		Great public movements are almost invariably initiated in this country by a letter to the '' Times , '' and a few days ago a large and influential body , con - sisting of four peers , four members of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, the wife of the Archbishop of
Canterbury	LOCATION	, and about half a dozen headmasters , wrote to that eminent journal to suggest means for preventing the sale of a certain sort of fiction .

		In the end they wish to procure legislation ; in the meanwhile they hope -LRB- in the grandiloquent phrase employed by the framers of printed correspondence -RRB- to '' bring a wholesome pressure to bear '' upon publishers , a pressure , I understand them to signify , that shall be wholesome to the general public rather than to the unhappy publishers .

		In short , they propose un - ashamedly a Censorship of Books , a reim position of that '' imprimatur '' that provided
Milton	PERSON	with the theme of his '' Areopagitica . ''

		On the face of it , this seems a curiously retrograde step for anyone to propose in the twentieth century .

		But the signa - tories of the document have at least the courage of their opinions .

		They boldly state their conviction that matter which is '' unfit for the perusal of a modest girl '' must likewise do '' untold harm to the 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, moral character of all readers . ''

		Briefly , this is the Early Victorian view of the '' Young Person , '' which we had hardly expected to see revived in the days of the fifth
George	PERSON	.

		I can not believe that the proposal will have any serious consequences , except to promote a certain amount of rather uninteresting correspondence in the public press .

		Possibly it may induce the police authorities , who are already armed with sufficient powers , to take proceedings against one or two publishers for issuing indecent literature .

		If we could have any confidence in their judgment on such points , few of us would grieve over that .

		I confess I have often wished that something could be done to check the publication of trash , moral or immoral .

		The appalling rubbish that litters the bookstalls of our railway stations at the present time helps us to realise the degradation of modern taste .

		To improve this condition of things the only sensible way is to wait for that taste to improve .

		It will improve as time goes on , I have little doubt .

		Free education has produced a generation who can read but are incapable of literary criticism , incapable even of following the intricacies of a sentence or paragraph more than a line or two in length .

		This is the first crop , so to speak ; future generations will , we hope and believe , have acquired the rudiments of sound judgment : they will begin where their fathers left off .

		In the meantime no sane man pro- poses that the publication of silly rubbish should be arbitrarily stopped , because we all recognize the im - mense difficulty of drawing the line , of saying at what point the mediocre sinks into the worthless .

		Yet , compared with the difficulty of deciding between morality and immorality , this is as nothing . ''

		An attack on morals , '' writes Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, '' may turn out to be the salvation of the race , '' and he points out that a hundred years ago nobody could have foreseen that
Tom Paine	PERSON	's centenary would one day be the subject of a laudatory article in the '' Times . ''

		Who can decide to-day what the civilization of the twenty - first century may think of the works , say , of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	or of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	?

		Yet the wife of the Arch - bishop of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	and the six headmasters who associate themselves with her in this letter would almost certainly place ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	'' upon their Index JExpurgatorius , to say nothing of `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' and `` The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet . ''

		We can not afford to have our standard of good literature fixed by this self - appointed committee , large and influential as it undoubtedly is .

		We can not take their opinion ; but neither could we take the opinion on this subject of the most enlightened committee procurable in the country .

		All censorship is bad ; but of two evils a stupid censor is probably more endurable , less likely to do much harm , than a clever one .

		The latter would detect subtleties that might escape the former 's notice .

		An acute reader of plays would almost inevitably have forbidden the performance of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's works ; the actual reader -LRB- I forget whether it was Mr.
Redford	PERSON	or his predecessor -RRB- contented himself with the prohibition of '' Ghosts , '' which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	considers the least subversive of the
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	dramas .

		And in the same way , if we are to have any official censorship of books all lovers of good literature will pray for the appointment of some amiable but obtuse Philistine to that office .

		We should be content with the sup - pression of the obvious .

		And , as a matter of fact , no other appointment would be possible .

		A man of any intellectual calibre would certainly be driven mad by a single quarter 's conscientious work , ex - amining the autumn output of books for cunningly concealed scraps of false doctrine .

		Nearly one hundred years ago -LRB- in
1817	DATE	-RRB- there was laid to rest in the nave of
Winchester Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	a gifted woman who has been rightly called '' the mother of the nineteenth century novel . ''

		Upon the black marble slab which marks the spot is inscribed the name : ``
Jane Austen	PERSON	. ''

		Of late years , as is well known , the noble fabric that enshrines her remains has been in great jeopardy , its very foundations in peril .

		Colossal efforts for its preservation have already been made , but the need is great , and much work must still be done to secure the safety of this precious inheritance .

		Among the many memories by which its stones cry out to us for help is its association with the talented novelist , so witty and so wise , who first portrayed for us in faithful word-pictures the everyday of life .

		She has long held a warm place in the hearts of readers on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, but so far there has been no outward expression of this wide-spread appreciation .

		The time for it has now arrived .

		Will all who admire her delicate genre painting contribute for her sake their quota towards the work of restoring the stately old Cathedral , just a pebble , as it were , that the cairn so raised in her honor may be not only a tribute to
Jane Austen	PERSON	's genius , but the dead
Jane Austen	PERSON	's tribute to the Minster she loved ?

		Your reference in a recent issue to the mispronunciation '' aw-ry `` reminds me of two or three similar mispronunci - ations which I fell into as an omnivorous reader while a lad without opportunity to standardize my pronunciation aurally .

		One of these mispronunciations , '' rye-bald '' for '' rib-aid , '' has a strong onomatopoetic quality , more suggestive and effective than the traditional and correct pronunciation . ''

		Boolk '' is also a much larger , fuller , and heavier word than `` bulk . ''

		Altogether , these onomatopoetic mispronunciations appeal strongly to that not inconsiderable class who speak '' by ear '' rather than by note .

		A SOUL 'S STRUGGLE EVTO THE LIGHT .

		* Spiritual things are spiritually discerned .

		To many the little book of her soul 's history which Mrs.
John Albee	PERSON	has sent out into the world will have no meaning , and it will touch in them no responsive chord ; but there are others , not a few , to whom '' The Gleam '' will come as a veritable flash of light , a searching ray revealing to their awed gaze some of the un - suspected secrets of their inmost selves .

		And if the lesson the book teaches is read aright , it will brace and strengthen and purify the soul of the reader .

		It is a lifelong search for truth , religious and moral , artistic , economic , hygienic , that Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	's autobiography relates .

		Born under the old dispensation , she has slowly worked her way out into a larger environment and a freer atmosphere .

		She has had psychic experiences and telepathic adventures that might have turned a less sanely practical person to profes - sional clairvoyance and all its accompanying deception of self and others .

		The late Pro- fessor
James	PERSON	became interested in her peculiar sensitiveness to certain occult influences , and has quoted some of her experiences in his lec - tures .

		But this is merely by the way .

		Her mental and spiritual unfolding , her growth into an increasing perception of beauty in nature and in art , her work in the field of design in industrial art -LRB- notably her starting of the rural rug-making industry -RRB- , and her active interest in the arts-and-crafts movement , form the body and substance of her life-history , which is set forth with a simple directness and at the same time with a becoming reticence and restraint that make her pages nothing short of fascinat - ing to a sympathetic reader .

		Her later chap - ters gain a further interest and beauty from the writer 's whole-hearted and at times heroic devotion to a husband threatened with death in one of its most dreaded forms .

		And the isola - tion of the two in a little mountain town of
Xew Hampshire	LOCATION	made even more harrowing the harsh experiences through which they passed .

		The reader 's interest in Mr.
Albee	PERSON	, the friend of
Emerson	PERSON	and the author of a book of reminiscences of the
Concord	LOCATION	sage , strengthens the appeal of Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	's nar - rative .

		A few passages from her pen will be THE GLKAM .

		By
Helen R. Albee	PERSON	.

		Xew York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		all that is here needed to send the discerning reader to the autobiography itself .

		She refers often to the inner life and the higher self , that part of the inmost being that every intro - spective person is conscious of as superior to the vicissitudes of this earthly lot .

		Near the end of her book she writes : `` Do you long for a richer experience and a true knowledge of the inner life ?

		Are you ready to give real effort and time and study to secure them ?

		Have you regarded your soul growth as you do astronomy , mathematics , or any science , and devoted years to its development ; or have you passively waited , hoping that the kingdom of heaven would take you by storm , or that in some miraculous hour this inner world would somehow burst upon your dull mind like a vision ?

		Yon will wait in vain if thus you expect to pluck the flower of the Spirit . '

		Strive to enter in ; for strait is the gate and narrow is the way , and few there be who find it , ' says the great Teacher .

		The trouble is that many are incredulous of the reality and value of the higher experiences , and consequently to them they are not worth any effort . '

		Philosophy bakes no bread , ' says Novalis , and the business man may add : spiritual insight does not pay the grocery bill , and is therefore unprofitable from the worldly estimate .

		When you reach the point of absolute hunger that can not be satisfied on the lower plane , then you will yield all for the pearl of great price .

		You will allow no obstacle to interfere ; you must and will have communion at any sacrifice . ''

		Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	in her childhood refused to ac - cept without question the approved forms and methods of the good people about her .

		Look - ing back upon an unhappy attempt to `` con - vert '' her before she was old enough to know the meaning of sin , she writes : '' Growth is mysterious and sacred .

		Once I sought to open very gently , but forcibly , a water lily that had closed before I had a chance to make a sketch of it , and found it impossible .

		The next morning all the other lilies had unfolded naturally in their snowy per - fection save the one I had tried to force , and there it floated bruised and blackened and hopelessly mangled by my too eager fingers .

		Does not the prying hand of the zealous proselyter thwart the natural development , and give a false direction to a budding soul ?

		The sad part of it is that the results of these unconscious bru - talities never recoil upon the offender ; they arouse sensitive youth not to any real self-knowledge , but to a premature , morbid self-analysis .

		For several years I suffered the full reaction from the spiritual shock . ''

		Later in life Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	received with en - thusiasm certain suggestions offered by writers on what has been called the '' New Thought . ''

		They seem to have brought her an exhilarating sense of new powers of mind and will ; but the restraint she exercises in referring to the sub - ject proves that she did not allow herself to be swept off her feet .

		The following passage illus - trates her belief in the efficacy of a cheerful and confident faith in the future : 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, '' We undertook to make a
summer	DATE	home out of an old abandoned farmhouse , and with neither ready money nor sufficient furniture at our command , it seemed almost as if we summoned things out of a clear sky , as if we had gained control of the genii of the lamp and ring , who fulfilled our wishes .

		What we required came in prompt and orderly fashion .

		There was no miracle about it , no prayer to high heaven , no outward mention of our need ; but , through natural ordinary channels , results came . ''

		Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	is widely known for the Abnakee rug industry , wherewith she has brought a new interest and a fresh perception of beauty into the monotonous lives of many women living in the country and all without any desire or pros - pect of pecuniary gain for herself .

		In building - up this industry she has encountered formidable obstacles and had some extremely trying experi - ences .

		But in this as in all other portions of her active and useful life she has been cheered and strengthened by '' the gleam '' of a light not seen on sea or land , but very real and unmistakable to the inner eye trained to perceive it .

		It is almost an irrelevance , or an impertinence , to note regretfully , in closing , some lack of care in the revision of the author 's manuscript .

		A few slight corrections we wish might have been made , to render the manner of the book as excellent as its matter .

		But it is most cordially to be recommended to those to whom it is dedi - cated , '' those who seek truth and fearlessly follow the light . ''

		national life ; that colonies are an economic dis - advantage , and that the power of the mother country over them is really less than the power she exercises over independent countries ; that there is no connection between military or poli - tical leadership and economic supremacy , and that militarism is not a source of economic pros - perity , but an effect of it ; that the use of force is as harmful to the victor as to the vanquished ; that war makes for the survival of the unfittest in every respect , not the fittest ; that human nature is not unchanging ; these are some of the paradoxical theses that Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	vigorously maintains in '' The Great Illusion . ''

		He is thinking mostly of
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, but his arguments concern all '' fully civilized rival nations in fully occupied territory . '' ''

		The fact of conquering such territory , '' he says , '' gives the conqueror no material advantages which he could not have had without con - quest . ''

		Why , then , the present maintenance and increase of armaments ?

		Because the world is the pitiful victim of the Great Illusion that military strength and political influence have to do with economic advantage .

		And why are men so blind as not to recognize the mistake that is undermining national and individual happiness ?

		Simply because they are under the spell of the idea that a
State	ORGANIZATION	is analogous to a person , and are deluded by the use of an ob - solete terminology , unaware that the conduct of the world 's life has so changed during the
last half century	DATE	as to render war among enlightened nations not only needless , but actually impos - sible .

		In remote times a
State	ORGANIZATION	may have been homogeneous enough to resemble a person , and property may have been administered in such a way as not to be out of the reach of the in - vader , and this may still be true among uncivil - ized nations ; but it is not true of the civilized nations of to-day , whose commercial relations are so intricate and interdependent , and whose possessions , both public and private , are so largely in the form of paper , and therefore so intangible , that war would be the height of economic folly .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	is thus concerned chiefly with the economic effect of militarism .

		He starts with the bald assumption that self-interest is the basic and controlling influence in social moral - ity .

		Convince the world that war does not pay , and the greatest of all measures has been taken to promote disarmament and universal peace .

		Even in the second part of the book , where he turns his attention to '' The Human Nature of
1911	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 301 the Case , '' and where he leaves unchallenged and unref uted almost no contention of the mili - tarist , his argument is nevertheless based prin - cipally upon economics , and the reader finds himself not quite satisfied that the psychology of war has received the consideration it deserves ; he hopes that Mr.
Angell	PERSON	is right , and for the most part believes that he is , but can not help entertaining a degree of sympathy with the in - ternational banker who said to Mr.
Angell	PERSON	: '' I do not know what people go to war about , but I am quite sure it is not about business . ''

		A second defect in Mr. AngelTs presentation , if we may criticize without incurring the charge of hostility to the cause which he represents , is that he does not take sufficient account of private economic selfishness as a cause of mili - tarism .

		Nations as a whole may gain nothing by militarism , and the rank and file of the peo - ple may lose by it ; but those who think have more than a lively suspicion that individual citizens in considerable numbers reap immense profit from war and war preparation .

		We are assured by one authority that in
England	LOCATION	one person in six is financially interested in militar - ism .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's book leaves us with the im - pression that armaments and war are almost wholly due to the policies of patriotic and well - meaning , but economically ignorant and slow - minded , statesmen .

		Judging , too , from the expressions of which he makes liberal use in his references to them `` moonshine , '' `` fustian , '' `` rhetoric , '' `` nonsense , '' `` blatant , '' `` profound illusion , '' '' gross misreading of all the facts in the case , '' `` simply a parrot-like repetition of catch-phrases which lack common sense and fly in the face of facts of everyday experience , '' the proper education of statesmen would seem a task almost as difficult as the eradication of selfishness from the hearts of stockholders and high-salaried officials .

		Fortunately , however , both causes are so plainly operative that we need not take the trouble to make a choice .

		In the compact little book of
J. Novicow	PERSON	, Vice-President of the
International Institute of Sociology	ORGANIZATION	, entitled '' War and Its Alleged Benefits , '' the argument is more evenly dis - tributed , though hardly more comprehensive .

		Physiological , political , intellectual , and moral effects of war are as fully considered as eco - nomic effects , the whole briefly and concisely .

		The psychology of war , and antagonism and solidarity , are other topics .

		War is asserted to be no real solution of difficulties . ''

		From the year
1500	DATE	B.C. to
1860	DATE	A.D. more than 8000 treaties of peace meant to remain in force forever were concluded .

		The average time they remained in force is two years .

		... If war is able to decide dif - ferences , how is it that 8000 wars have settled nothing , and that in this year of our Lord we feel the necessity for the eight thousand and first war ? ''

		Novicow , too , finds no difficulty in toppling over the arguments of the militarist by employ - ing '' the \ nere say-so of ordinary common sense , '' and exclaims much over the ignorance of those whose views he combats .

		The truth of his gen - eral conclusions is indisputable , but the cock - sureness of some of his detailed proof begets the impression that the next writer of a text - book on logic would not find vain here a search for the example of fallacy .

		The pronounced spirit with which both he and Mr.
Angell	PERSON	de - liver their opinions adds to the inherent interest of their subject , but will hardly conciliate the opposition , and is not without its undesirable effect upon even the friendly reader ; but per - haps the increase of interest will compensate for the slight loss of sympathy .

		It gives us pleasure to turn to a third anti- militarist work , the volume entitled '' War or Peace , '' by
General Chittenden	ORGANIZATION	, of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, a calm and well-balanced dis - cussion which will command the respect and the sympathy of every reader .

		General Chit - tenden does not approach the economic phase of war with the keenness of the specialist , but his measured words are sprung of a thoughtful life of practical experience in the military ser - vice of his country .

		Under the caption , '' Mis - taken Sanctions , '' he disposes effectively of the various time-honored justifications of war .

		With Mr.
Angell	PERSON	, he insists '' that the whole argument for permanent peace rests upon the fact that the future of war can not be judged from its past ... War has outlived its usefulness . ''

		Next , he proceeds to the condemnation of war as a destroyer of morality , life , and wealth , and in the succeeding chapter discusses the re - lation of war preparation to national prosperity and to the maintenance of peace .

		The destruc - tion of the best lives of the nation is properly made one of the strongest grounds for condem - nation .

		* `` The Kationale of War , '' `` The Present Duty , '' and '' The Future Hope '' are the subjects of the remaining chapters , which are all informed by the same reasonable , sane , and courteous spirit .

		General
Chittenden	PERSON	is positive in his convictions , but he is no senti - mentalist ; he looks his enemy in the face and vanquishes him fairly and squarely , like a See President
Jordan	PERSON	's excellent `` War and Manhood , ' in the '' Popular Science Monthly , ''

		302 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, soldier and a gentleman .

		The familiar class who are unwilling to grant any concession what - ever to an opponent , and who are not satisfied with the judicial , open-minded consideration of questions in which they are emotionally inter - ested , may be offended to find him saying that war in the past has not been without certain benefits , though he distinguishes the future from the past ; but those who do not believe that the cause of peace may be helped either by suppressing the truth or by raising the voice to a shout will be pleased with his book and proud of their countryman .

		Conscious that something positive and con - structive is expected of them , both Mr.
Angell	PERSON	and
General Chittenden	ORGANIZATION	devote some space to the consideration of the present duty of their respective nations .

		Their recommendations are identical , and come like dashes of cold water after the warmth engendered by the glowing argument which precedes . ''

		So long as cur - rent political philosophy in
Europe	LOCATION	remains what it is , '' says the former , '' I would not urge the reduction of our war budget by a single sovereign or a single dollar . '' ''

		Disarm - ament by this government in advance of other great powers , '' says General
Chittenden	PERSON	, '' would be an unwise a perilous policy .

		The true line of duty is to maintain and even increase our military and naval strength , and this on the grounds -LRB- 1 -RRB- of prudent provision against possible danger , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of strengthening the position of the
United States	LOCATION	as a power for peace . ''

		So long as statesmen , or the parties that force leadership upon them , still base their reasoning on the assumption that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is a person and can benefit by conquest , a nation that should reduce its armament would invite the onslaughts of the unscrupulous .

		In a word , both authors are in agreement with the corre - spondent who recently wrote the present re - viewer : '' I have observed that a good big , fat , sleek , young , active , well-fed bulldog can gen - erally saunter down the walk without being much damaged by the horde of yelping curs that infest the hedges ; and I have always remarked that a poor , sick , weak , and feeble dog is likely to be torn in pieces . ''

		This is not to give up the struggle for disarm - ament , however .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	continues with practical suggestions for the future , and Gen - eral
Chittenden	PERSON	adds an inspiring chapter on '' The Future Hope . ''

		The campaign for the enlightenment of public opinion is to go on ; the mutual understanding of the rank and file of dif - ferent nations is to be broadened and deepened by educating them to a consciousness of their common interests .

		Before this treatment the war policy will gradually die away , as naturally and completely as the policy of religious perse - cution died in its time .

		To this campaign of enlightenment these three books are a magnificent contribution .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's book , issued simultaneously in eleven of the great countries of the world , in - cluding
Japan	LOCATION	, with its argument concentrated on the economic phase of the question , wilJ stimulate thought especially in the old world by the audacity of its assaults upon established lines of reasoning .

		It should be read in con - nection with one of the other two .

		ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DRAMA .

		* Speaking of the great history of French literature which has furnished a model for all similar ventures in the way of collaboration , the late
Gaston Paris	PERSON	remarked : `` A search , and a successful one , has been made for scholars of recognized ability and special attainments , whose names in each case assure us of the exact information and complete grasp of the subject which the writer possesses in the field that has been assigned to him . ''

		Though the two latest volumes of '' The Cambridge History of `` English Literature '' constitute the most noteworthy attempt that has ever been made to organize our knowledge of the Elizabethan and Jacobean drama , to - gether with its origins and its later develop - ment , no one would be bold enough to affirm that the separate chapters are in every case written by scholars already well-known for their special competence in the subjects which they have been invited to discuss not to speak of the instances in which the first choice among leading authorities has not been secured for the treatment of some definite and highly important topic .

		Thus , the beginnings of the drama in the Middle Ages are not dealt with by Mr.
Edmund K. Chambers	PERSON	; nor the life and works of Shakespeare by Dr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	; nor Shake - speare 's Sonnets by
Canon	ORGANIZATION	Beeching ; nor text - ual problems connected with the quarto and folio editions of Shakespeare by Mr.

		THE DIAL 303 nor the life and works of
Ben Jon	PERSON	son by
M. Castelain	PERSON	.

		And while we are touching on a possible oversight here and there , it may be added that there is no chapter at all on the language of the Elizabethan dramatists whose writings , as
Wordsworth	PERSON	said , are `` the gar - dens '' of our native tongue ; although the earlier volumes of this history of literature have not avoided disquisitions upon linguistics .

		Such a chapter could doubtless have been obtained from Professor
Vietor	PERSON	or Professor Franz .

		But the editors might have contented themselves with some one nearer home , on the strength of a general rather than a particular fitness .

		The general fitness of the actual collaborators can not be disallowed .

		The names of Ward ,
Boas	LOCATION	,
Moorman	PERSON	,
Baker	PERSON	,
Symons	PERSON	,
Koeppel	PERSON	,
Thorndike	PERSON	,
Manly	LOCATION	,
Neilson	PERSON	, and others , are sufficiently familiar to students of the drama to guarantee a substantial trustworthiness in the volumes to which these scholars have contrib - uted .

		Nor could a valid reason be alleged for discounting at the outset an article upon any aspect of Elizabethan literature by a writer who had won recognition mainly in another part of the field .

		At the same time , it is disconcerting , when we turn from a chapter to the appendix which indicates the sources from which the mate - rial is drawn , to find that the author hitherto has written nothing that is closely enough allied to his present topic to be included in its bibliography .

		Whatever the cause may be , too many of the chapters read like the briefs of a conscientious attorney , gotten up with the aid of the best treatises , let us say , upon copyright , bridge-building , and melancholia ; the method is good , and the information well in hand , but the insight is not of the sort that comes from a prolonged intimacy with the subject .

		Accord - ingly , the student of English will derive a peculiar gratification from such chapters as that by Professor Creizenach on Miracle-Plays and Moralities , and that on Early English Tragedy by Professor
Cunliffe	PERSON	, which display the ripe fruit of investigations that were begun , and commonly known , before the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	was dreamt of .

		On slightly different grounds , one may also single out the chapter by Professor
Gregory Smith	PERSON	on
Marlowe	PERSON	and
Kyd	PERSON	for particular commendation .

		It does not begin with the felicity that might be expected from the editor of '' Elizabethan Critical Essays , '' but it improves as it advances ; the ten pages -LRB- V. 167 176 -RRB- of constructive criticism on
Marlowe	PERSON	are so obviously superior to the main treatment of Shakespeare -LRB- V. 186 ff . -RRB-

		by another hand , that examples of the best and the worst in the two volumes are brought into sharp contrast .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's two chapters on Shakespeare are , indeed , very disappointing .

		They ar
$ clear	MONEY	enough obscurity is not a characteristic of his wayward style , and they disclose no important errors of fact , at least on a casual reading ; after all , a large part of the substance is common property .

		But the atti - tude of a literary dictator in Shakespearean biography and criticism will not be welcome to those who have tried to keep abreast of the more recent investigations and synthetic studies , as
Professor Saintsbury	LOCATION	has not .

		Nor will a slap-dash journalistic manner seem more grave when it is observed in what , as many would imagine , ought to be the most weighty exposi - tion in the fourteen volumes of this notable history .

		Compared with the discussion of Shakespeare as a tragic poet in the familiar book of Professor
Bradley	PERSON	, the utterances here on the art of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may be deemed almost negligible , with the exception , perhaps , of what is said concerning his versification .

		Yet Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's former inquiries into metre , and the habitual interest which causes him to lead up , finally , to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's blank verse as if this could furnish a worthy climax in the interpretation of a great dramatist have not been enough to prevent an odd bit of con - fusion on page 244 of Volume V .

		It is astonish - ing that any one who has written so copiously upon metre should identify the terms '' weak '' and '' feminine , '' as applied to line-endings .

		The most valuable thing in connection with the sequence of chapters -LRB- viii.-xii . -RRB-

		on Shake - speare is the Bibliography , in twelve sections .

		So far as I am aware , it is incomparably the best collection of titles on the subject now in print .

		Of course there are omissions , both intended and accidental .

		Professor Root 's dis - sertation on '' Classical Mythology in Shake - speare '' -LRB-
Yale Studies	ORGANIZATION	in English , No .

		XIX . -RRB-

		ought to have been included under '' Sources '' -LRB- p. 489 -RRB- ; possibly also Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	's '' Studies in Shakespeare , '' and one or two other titles for example ,
Carr	PERSON	's '' Four Lives from
North	ORGANIZATION	's Plutarch . ''

		Though the twelve sections -LRB- V. , 470-518 -RRB- could scarcely be thought of as the catalogue raisonne of works on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	for which many an investigator has been longing , they are an approach to it , and strengthen the hope that it may ultimately appear .

		304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, It is pleasant to observe the consideration that is bestowed throughout these volumes upon American scholarship , both in the choice of collaborators and in the tributes which are paid to authorities like Dr.
Furness	PERSON	and Pro- fessor
Schelling	PERSON	.

		The prefatory acknowledge - ment which the editors make to the work on Elizabethan Drama by the latter is refreshing after the unsympathetic , and even unjust , remarks about it in the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum . ''

		The simultaneous publication of '' The Cam - bridge History '' in this country and
England	LOCATION	is , of course , significant of a united interest in a common object , and a matter of congratulation for us in
America	LOCATION	.

		However , we must regret the presence of a number of trifling errors in the Putnam edition which may not occur in that of the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chapman 's rendering of
Ovid	LOCATION	's '' Banquet of Sence , '' for example , appears as a '' Banquet of Sauce '' both in the text -LRB- VI. , 35 -RRB- and the Index -LRB- VI. , 570 -RRB- .

		And for '' bare '' -LRB- V. , 296 , Note 3 -RRB- we should have `` base '' as the reading of the
First Folio of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the last scene of '' Othello '' ; but here it is the sub - stance of the note that seems to be at fault .

		The American printer reproduces the English orthography of words like color and vigor though our form was known to Gray ; yet he makes a single word of some one , and similarly of any one , though , as `` C.S.C. '' might put it , someone and anyone were `` unknown to Keats . ''

		The printer may be referred to
Calverley	PERSON	's poem entitled '' Forever . ''

		There is but one thing more to say .

		In his '' Tractate on Education , ''
Milton	PERSON	speaks of an antidote which must be given to the students who may busy themselves with certain speci - mens of the Attic drama .

		Throughout these monumental volumes on the English drama , the various specialists and generalizes for the most part seem to have forgotten , or never to have recognized , the need of an antidote for some of the noxious weeds that flourished in the luxu - riant '' gardens of our language . ''

		The great literary critic in the age of Elizabeth recog - nized this need , and never forgot it .

		We may therefore deplore the arrangement through which the contemporary criticism of the drama by Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	and others is chiefly rele - gated to a different section of this history , and otherwise receives so little emphasis in compari - son with the lives of the dramatists and the chronology of their plays .

		LANE
COOPER	PERSON	.

		A PHILOSOPHY or LIFE .

		* Few have lived as long , or to such good pur - pose , as Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	.

		To most of us the Darwinian period , when the battle for evolution was fought and won , seems already to belong to a distant past .

		Yet
Wallace	PERSON	and
Hooker	PERSON	, evolutionists who stood fifty years ago second only to
Darwin	LOCATION	, are still living and active .

		Many years ago Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	published his `` Darwinism , '' containing a summary of the theory of organic evolution , with a discussion of the principal facts bearing on the subject .

		This has appeared in several editions , and is still very widely read .

		The new work , `` The World of Life , '' is not intended to take its place , but gives the author 's most mature thoughts on life in general , its meaning and cause .

		Being thus a work of philosophy as well as science , it necessarily covers much de - batable ground , but the author tells us that in every case his opinions result from a careful study of the facts , and whether correct or false , are at any rate not the fruits of mere inclination or fancy .

		The ground covered is so vast that no two really original writers , cultivating it during a lifetime , can be expected to garner the same harvest , nor is it desirable that they should do so .

		Hence almost every reader will find things that he himself would have put dif - ferently , if only because his temperament and ex - perience differ from those of the author .

		Many , however , will object to Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	's opinions simply because they are largely metaphysical , forgetting that the dogmatic negations of the materialistic are in their essence equally so .

		On the emotional side , the book is chiefly notable for its expression of a great delight in every form of life , from man down ; perhaps richer in quality than that shown by any other writer .

		I am inclined to think that Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	is absolutely preeminent in this quality , because few naturalists have interested themselves in so many different aspects of life , while those who are not students of nature simply do not see many of its manifestations .

		The best of the nature-poets may doubtless have depths of feel - ing , as well as modes of expression , beyond the power of a biologist , but their writings suffi - ciently indicate the limitations of their field of vision .

		For the ordinary reader I believe this glow of pleasure in the contemplation of life of * THB WORLD OF LIFE .

		A
Manifestation of Creative Power	ORGANIZATION	, Directive Mind , and
Ultimate Purpose	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 every kind is the most precious attribute of the book , because if it is communicated to him in any degree he will be enriched for the rest of his days .

		Even the statistical data concerning the number of species of plants in different areas have a charm for us when we realize with the author how much beauty and interest diversity implies , and how this leads to a still more wonderful diversity of animals dependent on the plants .

		As is indicated by the sub-title , Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	regards life as manifesting a creative power , having the definite purpose of evolving spiritual beings capable of surviving death .

		He does not thereby abandon any part of the theory of evolution , as set forth in his earlier v ^ ritings ; but it is well known that in matters of this kind he differed from
Darwin	PERSON	, who felt unable to formulate metaphysical theories , or at any rate to give them any prag - matic value .

		Logically , according to the ordin - ary doctrines of science , man is the outcome of what has gone before , and might conceivably have been predicted at any stage of the process by a being of sufficient reasoning power ac - quainted with all the facts .

		The process of evolution is such that at each stage things fit together , as it were , and appear as though made for each other .

		Man appears on the scene with conscious purpose , and is unable to imagine a universe without something of the kind .

		Is it altogether a quibble or play of words to put things this way ?

		Let the lifeless universe exist for an x period , undergoing various physical and chemical changes until life appears , and with it consciousness .

		At this last moment value and purpose arise ; until then they simply did not exist .

		We commonly hold that whatever produces value has thereby a value of its own , or in a sense purpose ; hence as a matter of argument it may reasonably be maintained that life was the purpose of pre - existent lifeless being .

		This may be an '' absurdly human '' point of view ; but being absurdly human , what are we to do ?

		The contemplation of such a philosophic system necessarily arouses in us a sense of its incom - pleteness ; and as though to fill a void , we are led to believe in some sort of conscious being or beings presiding over the destinies of the ostensibly azoic universe .

		We are in some such way started on the path .

		Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	follows , and guided by him we may arrive at a theology more in harmony with science than those handed down to us by the churches .

		Even the doctrine of the multiplicity of creative agencies , put forth at the end of the book , may then seem to have much in its favor , especially as contrasted with that of a single omnipotent , all-knowing , unchanging God .

		Those who utterly refuse to consider ques - tions of this kind will thrust all this aside as so muchv trash .

		For some , this limitation of the intellectual field may be a sort of necessity .

		There will , however , be many who with
Darwin	PERSON	are keenly alive to the mystery of things , and freely acknowledge their personal need of light , while at the same time refusing consent to a series of '' explanations '' which they feel do not explain , and are not fortified by known facts .

		At this point a practical dilemma arises .

		If humanity is led to confine its thought entirely to limited fields , abandoning the celestial j heights entirely to insincere litterati who play with great questions merely to tickle the pass - ing fancy , will there be any loss ?

		May we not answer , that the loss will be tremendous , incal - I culable ?

		Yet this may come about from mere inertia , aided by fashion , our species '' going to the dogs '' in a veritable psychological fashion .

		On the other hand , history abundantly shows how heavy is the burden of a mass of theological or metaphysical dogma , supported by custom and tradition , but deadly to the free exercise of thought .

		It seems to me that we can only arrive at a sort of middle road , that of feeling keenly that things after all have a `` meaning , '' that virtue is a reality , not an abstraction , that somehow the universe has a soul of its own ; while at the same time guarding ourselves con - tinually against those artificial thought-castles in which we are so liable to be imprisoned .

		Looking at the matter in this way , those of us who are not prepared to follow Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	in all the intricacies of his personal faith , may nevertheless feel very strongly that he has done well in bringing forward his solution of the riddle of the ages , the result of more than fifty years of thought .

		The book contains many interesting and illuminating discussions of particular questions , and many expressions of opinion on debatable points , so that it will prove stimulating in a variety of ways .

		The reviewer is tempted to write at greater length than space permits .

		I have been inter - ested to compare the American and English editions .

		Although they contain exactly the same material , the American book is consider - ably larger , with 441 pages against the 408 of the English .

		The English is on whiter paper , and the printing is blacker and more even .

		In the American edition figures 40 and 41 are upside down .

Rouen	LOCATION	of to-day -LRB- the Rotomagus of yesterday -RRB- , after he has looked up the various streets and squares and monuments that perpetuate the name and fame of
Jeanne	PERSON	d' Arc , will very likely go , though he may have but a minute to spare , to the
Vieux Marche	PERSON	and see the spot on which , on
May 31 , 1431	DATE	, the victime glorieuse breathed out her last on a stack of burning wood .

		Born early in
January 1412	DATE	, at
Domremy	LOCATION	, on the Mason-and -
Dixon	PERSON	line , as it were , between
Teuton	LOCATION	and
Gaul	PERSON	, where patriotism always runs highest , she accomplished a stupendous amount of good in a seemingly inexplicable way , and in compen - sation was burned and her ashes thrown into the river .

		And from
Christine de Pisan	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- d.
1429	DATE	-RRB- to
Anatole France	LOCATION	, her unique and elusive life has attracted some of the world 's greatest poets , artists , and historians .

		In an incomplete bibliog - raphy brought down to
1894	DATE	, there are found 667 works that deal only with her life , and it in its entirety .

		There are 849 monographs that deal with particular phases of her life .

		There are 160 dramas in verse , and 21 operas
2286	DATE	works in all , the compiler ,
Pierre Lanery d'Arc	PERSON	, admitting that it would have been easy to pass the three thousand mark had certain other publications been taken into account .

		And all these antedate

		Yet it is entirely pos - sible that the greatest works on
Joan	PERSON	, excepting those by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schiller	PERSON	, postdate

Schiller	PERSON	,
Johanna	PERSON	geht , und immer kehrt sie wieder I And now she comes twice more .

		Miss Bangs , starting from the sane proposi - tion of Sainte-Beuve that the miracle of the Maid 's life can best be honored by the simple truth , has traced her career from the cradle to the stake with a simplicity and a sympathetic love of accurate detail that are very pleasing .

		Her aim is to tell the story of how a thoroughly good woman was abused and then burned by thoroughly bad men , because she lived in an age when the power that comes from goodness was so rare that it was confused with the weak - ness that emanates from evil .

		She treats the

		will work , God will work .

		The style is always clear and occasionally sparkling .

		Though plainly aiming at simplicity , it is refreshing to meet such
Sunday	DATE	words as '' doddering , '' '' bid - dableness , '' `` pick-a-back , '' '' sacring , '' `` was - trel , '' '' miniver , '' '' caracoled , '' '' gabelle , '' '' tumbril , '' and others , words that fit in so well just here .

		Except the oft-repeated '' so says the chronicle , '' and the occasional refer - ences to the poet
Alain Chartier	PERSON	, there is no indication of the sources utilized in the pre - paration of this confessedly historical work .

		This makes reading the book somewhat like listening to a good lecture without knowing who the lecturer is or whence he comes .

		All in all ,
Miss Bangs	LOCATION	has re-told the time-honored and time-worn story of the Maid with the same evident interest in her theme that one would expect if it were as fresh and original as a descriptive account of the
South Pole	LOCATION	.

		Miss
James	PERSON	's work , on the other hand , pos - sesses the conventional devices known to book - makers : bibliography , index of names , and a dozen illustrations that are illustrations in the original sense of the word .

		Only four of the twelve chapters bear directly on the heroine .

		These contain the traditional data .

		There is an introductory chapter on the impotent
Charles VII.	PERSON	, his unscrupulous mother Isabel of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, his gentle wife
Marie	PERSON	of
Anjou	LOCATION	, and his capable wife 's mother
Yolande	PERSON	of
Aragon	LOCATION	.

		There are chapters replete with uncanny though interest - ing material on visions and voices , mystics and visionaries , black magic , V amour de grace , and the bourgeois of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The two chapters that most cordially invite careful study are the two that respectively describe the nature , and ac - count for the effect , of the supernatural elements in the Maid 's life .

		Miss
James	PERSON	argues that to disprove that
Joan	PERSON	had these we will have to reject the very foundation on which history is based ; that she did exercise the powers of telepathy , pre-cognition , and clairvoyance ; that she did have visions , hear voices , unearth the
King	PERSON	's secret , and discover the sword at Fierbois , unless documentary evidence taken under oath be apocryphal .

		But how are we to explain the situation ?

		Four contingencies are set up :
Joan	PERSON	was either a prodigy , a sorceress , a fraud , or a victim of a fraud .

		The fraud and sorceress ideas Miss James rejects once for all ; and certainly no one will quarrel with her for this .

		The idea that
Joan	PERSON	was a victim of a political and religious fraud is no new one : '' Beaumarchais entertained it in
1730	DATE	, and
Anatole France	LOCATION	in
1908	DATE	. ''

		But this is also
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 rejected as unconvincing .

		Joan was , then , a prodigy .

		Now the author does some interesting reason - ing , without getting nearer to a scientific solu - tion than her predecessors .

		First , she calls to the rescue
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
William James	PERSON	, all of whom help , none of whom decide .

		Then she herself falls into such a statement as that the Maid `` probably suffered from a unilateral hallucination , or hemianaesthesia . ''

		But she immediately turns her back on this sort of language , and concludes : '' For the simple-minded and the faithful there remains a more perfect solution it lies in the belief in the power of God . ''

		Some readers will see in this more reverence than reason .

		But is there not about an equal deal of both ?

		Can not the success of
Joan	PERSON	, to go just an inch further than Miss
James	PERSON	has gone , be set forth about as follows : Every great man who has done anything eternally worth while within the
last two thousand years	DATE	has at some time in his life expressed an un - shaken belief in God .

		Joan believed in God , and -LRB- because -RRB- she believed in herself .

		Who , aside from her , believed in himself or herself at that time ?

		Charles VII .

		doubted his own legitimacy .

		With her , the belief and the deed were consubstantial .

		And she was mightily convinced that if she would act , God would act .

		So she went to work .

		And
France	LOCATION	followed .

		Now , a large percentage of her contemporaries who were in a position to do things were im - mature idiots anchoretically encysted in thick and contagious lethargy .

		But she went to work .

		To accomplish what for that age was prodigious , she did not need to be a twentieth - century prodigy .

		And great as she was , she undoubtedly stood at the head of her class partly because , in the choice nouns of
Addison	PERSON	, the other members of the class were ninny - hammers , dotards , and nincompoops .

		But after all is said and done , one of the most remarkable things in connection with the Maid is the amazing amount of art and history and poetry that owes its most remote inspiration to her baffling life .

		She has been a grateful theme for many men of many minds .

		Poet - ically , any thesis can be proved or disproved by her case .

		For example , just as the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	people glory over '' Beowulf , '' despite the fact that the subject matter concerns neither the Angles nor the Saxons , so did
Schiller	PERSON	dramatize her of
France	LOCATION	, and the Germans exult over
Die Jungfrau von Orleans	LOCATION	just as much as they would have done had she been born on the right rather than the left bank of the Meuse .

		A great national poem does not need to patronize local talent .

		And
Joan	PERSON	disproves more completely than does
Calderon	PERSON	's El Principe Constante the stoutly maintained thesis of \
Lessing	PERSON	, that the life of a true
Chris	PERSON	- tian does not lend itself to tragic treatment .

		As a poetic subject , her life far outstrips the fondest dreams of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	.

		She was a brave and beautiful girl .

		Men swore she was the simplest thing they had ever seen .

		She liked fine clothes , and was fonder of the banner than the sword .

		From the time she enlisted she wore male attire , and
Mark Twain	PERSON	gives a most reasonable explanation of this also .

		She liked to skip and romp about , and gather flowers from the field ; she was occasionally caught praying when her mother thought she was at work ; she was fond of babies , and stood godmother to several ; she was an adept at watching the sheep and crocheting .

		And in addition to all this childlike simplicity , she possessed lovely womanliness , while the Queen - mother so say the chronicles was proverb - ially vain , passionate , and dissolute .

		She was a devoted patriot , says
Mark Twain	PERSON	, when
France	LOCATION	was a British province .

		She was a saint when to be a saint was to be considered a `` lyme of the Feende . ''

		She was martyrly constant when there was nothing in
France	LOCATION	worth such lavish constancy .

		She was a cour - ageous soldier when
France	LOCATION	was carrying on a war through three generations without a stand - ing army .

		And she dared nobly to die for the sweet mother-land that gave her birth .

		All of which makes her life a fertile field for poets and artists .

		And to these we can only say , En avantf and Gliick auf !

		But there is another side to the matter .

		There have been , and are being , too many semi-erudite works written on such worthy and suggestive but elusive and uncontrollable sub - jects as the Maid 's life .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	says : Les textes relatifs a la Pucelle sont presque tons suspects a divers egards et souTevent a chaque instant des objections .

		Fresh from writing two enormous volumes on her , he ought to know .

		This being the case , it is extremely questionable whether we would really know any less accurately and appreciate any less keenly the Maid 's worth if we had only the works of three writers :
Jules Quicherat	PERSON	's documents ,
Anatole France	LOCATION	's biography , and
Schiller	PERSON	's drama .

		But we have three thousand works !

		Of these , Martial would undoubtedly say , in his epigrammatic way , Sunt bona , sunt quaedam 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, mediocria , sunt mala plura .

		Now , an author does not have the same ethical right to tell a story over and over that a musician has to play a piece of music over and over .

		The music comes and goes like a pleasant thought , but the book goes babbling on forever .

		And so , just as certain states every now and then pass a game-law , making it illegal to kill , say , any partridges for the next five years , would it not likewise be a relief and a potent blessing if all publishers could combine and pass a law making it illegal to write within the next twenty-five years any more books on certain subjects among others , these : Goethe ; the French Revo - lution ; the Authorship of '' Beowulf '' ; Romanti - cism ; the Interpretation of the Nibelungenlied ;
Napoleon	LOCATION	; and
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , Her Visions and Her Voices .

		SPAnsr OF TO-DAY .

		* Because
Spain	LOCATION	at one time was the ruling force in all
Europe	LOCATION	, if not , indeed , in both hemispheres , and is so no longer , materialistic critics have some - times been tempted to sneer at her as a dead nation , sterile and insignificant .

		That point of view is changing , wherever it once prevailed .

		First of all , the picturesqueness of the country as a field for travel has been discovered : '' Rugged and wild , wind-swept , and bleak , and drear , She has a rugged splendor all her own . ''


Spain	LOCATION	is made the subject of many returned travel - lers ' narratives most of them illustrated with numerous photographs .

		Nor is that all .

		The land that produces a Sorolla and a
Zuloaga	LOCATION	is conceded to have a present as well as a past .

		There is an interest everywhere to-day in contemporary Span - ish fiction .

		Several of the writers whose books we have now to consider , Mr.
Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	and
Miss O'Reilly	PERSON	among them , answer that tedious old ques - tion , `` What has
Spain	LOCATION	done for civilization ? ''

		very satisfactorily .

		Some of the books about
Spain	LOCATION	published during the last few months are of American authorship , and some of English .

		`` Quiet Days in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' `` Things Seen in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' `` Home Life in

		One can positively see the tweeds and smell the pipe-tobacco .

		Yet the last of the three , and the most important of them , is , at least , the work of one whose acquaintance with the land of which he writes is of some twenty years standing .

		Mr.
Bensusan	PERSON	has been more fortunate than
Gautier	PERSON	, about whom legend says that he first wrote his travel-book , then crossed the Pyrenees on the royalties , to see whether the kingdom measured up to his description of it .

		Mr.
Bensusan	PERSON	, for his part , writes a pleasant sort of book , with chapters on Idle Days in the South , and other accounts of journeyings , but also with more general chapters , relieved by anecdote and illustration , on such sub - jects as the Church , the Theatre , the Kitchen , the Cafe ' , the Plaza de Toros , the Literature , and the Law Courts , of the sunny land .

		As for the Home whose life he sets out to describe , it is , he writes , `` all things considered , '' a very happy one .

		One of our other authors , Mrs.
Nixon-Roulet	PERSON	, in speaking of
Spain	LOCATION	as a land of petticoat-rule offers a possible explanation . ''

		The most striking thing about Spanish home life is its mirthfulness , '' adds the same vivacious narrator .

		But , to return to Mr.
Bensusan	PERSON	, there is also a respect for tradition , and a simplicity thereof , that favors happiness .

		The house is generally built round a central court - yard , square or oblong in shape , and of larger or smaller proportions according to whether one is in the South or the North .

		If the various floors of the house are divided among several tenants , it is by friendly arrangement that lines are stretched and the family wash hung up ; and at the proper hour the smell of cooking and the clatter of dishes arises from the several kitchens as evidence that everyone in
Spain	LOCATION	eats now and then .

		What is more , '' everybody having prepared the same material in the same kind of utensil is now cook - ing it in accordance with one recipe '' a recipe that has probably not varied for hundreds of years .

		Even the superficial tourist realizes , on his circular tour , that this is a land ruled by tradition .

		It is obviously dangerous to generalize in a country whose history , if one studies it , one dis - covers to be the history of a good many different kingdoms .

		The strongly marked regionalism of the land , and its divergences , are brought out by all our writers .

		But so is
Spain	LOCATION	's traditionalism .

		There is , of course , a great difference to be observed in the impression made by the same phenomenon upon the various witnesses .

		The Catholic regards the tradi - tion that is so often an expression of Catholicism with a favoring eye .

		And of the books whose titles are noted in our footnote , Miss
Elizabeth Boyle O'Reilly	PERSON	's '' Heroic
Spain	LOCATION	'' may be recommended as likely to give the reader most pleasure .

		Here is a travel-book full of personality .

		Both the person - ality of the land visited and that of the traveller find expression in it . ''

		I would beg every unhurried traveller to carry in his pocket the ' Romancero del Cid , '
Spain	LOCATION	's Epic , and '
Don Quixote	PERSON	, ' her great novel , the truest-hearted book ever written , '' urges
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE 309 Miss
O'Reilly	PERSON	.

		Let us add as a further piece of advice , in case you are planning a Spanish excur - sion , '' and read ' Heroic
Spain	LOCATION	' before you engage passage . ''

		But if
Miss O'Reilly	PERSON	's book is altogether charm - ing , that by Mr.
Rafael Shaw	PERSON	is perhaps the most informing of our little library ; and it certainly has most of journalistic interest . ''

		I have endeavored to show , '' writes Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, '' what the people of
Spain	LOCATION	believe to be the truth about those who exer - cise authority over them , as gathered from conver - sation with Spaniards of all classes , but principally working people , in town and country , and from my own reading and observation . ''

		The resulting vol - ume is inevitably interesting , even though its pages sometimes express crude partisanship and radical - ism .

		But , whereas most of our other travellers stop short with describing the railway train , the inn and its table d'hote , the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, and the holy-day festival , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	takes for his theme taxation , the economic situation , education , the army , the devotion of the aristocracy , and the religious laxity of the working classes .

		As for Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's reports of the corruption of the confessional and of the general unscrupulousness of the Spanish clergy , he himself admits , after retailing a number of old wives ' tales and not a little servant-girl gossip : '' The hostility of the people towards the priests doubtless colors their views . ''

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's views are colored as well : and not rose-colored .

		Everywhere he sees the omin - ous shadow of the Jesuit .

		But he makes an inter - esting reporter .

		He is , also , correct enough in con - tending that economic , social , and moral abuses have been associated with Spanish priestcraft and mon - asticism ; but in making no apparent effort to sift the truth of his horrifies he impairs the value of what might have proved a much more valuable contribution to our knowledge of modern
Spain	LOCATION	.

		WARREN
BARTOX BLAKE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON XEW BOOKS .

		An account of
Professor Payson J. Treat	ORGANIZATION	's book our national on '' The National Land System '' landwtem .

		-LRB-
R Tre & t & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- embodies fa e results of much patient delving in the statutes and the journals of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and in the
American State Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		It successfully summarizes the complicated history of the public lands of the
United States	LOCATION	, and of their management , from
1785	DATE	to
1820	DATE	.

		The first chapter , which treats of the Origin of the
Public Domain	ORGANIZATION	, is in the nature of an introduction .

		This must account for the omission of any mention of
Thomas Paine	PERSON	's `` Public Good , '' and the neglect of the wider relations of the land question to the '' States ' - rights conflict '' of the later years of the Confedera - tion .

		Nor is the second chapter , on the Origins of the
Federal Land System	ORGANIZATION	, altogether exhaustive .

		With the third chapter , however , Professor Treat reaches the fundamental and most valuable part of his work .

		Here he gives a particularly clear ac - count of the transitional years of 1787-1789 , and presents a minute and accurate narrative of the development of the land system after the beginning of the government of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Constitution .

		Besides correcting some errors in the hitherto accepted chronology of this development , Professor Treat presents here and there some valuable criticisms which are the outcome of his investigation .

		Such , for example , is his analysis of
Hamilton	PERSON	's report of
1790	DATE	on the disposal of the public lands .

		The limit of time set to this volume is the year
1820	DATE	, when the credit system of land sales was abolished ; but many topics of special interest are carried to a logical conclusion at some later date .

		Thus , the '' relief '' laws are brought down to
1832	DATE	, and the land grants for military and naval service to
1856	DATE	.

		In addition there are chap - ters on the system of surveys , the confirmation of foreign titles , land grants for education , and special grants , public and private .

		The last chapter , upon the relation of the land system to the westward movement , constitutes a summary of the whole book , but seems hardly representative of the full import - ance of the subject .

		Throughout , indeed , it is in the clear analysis of legislation and administration from a legal and technical standpoint that Professor Treat 's book excels .

		This is a sufficient accomplish - ment , marking a welcome advance over the com - pilation of Donaldson and the ill-arranged though meritorious work of
Shosuke Sato	PERSON	.

		Except for these , no other work is comparable to this of Pro- fessor Treat 's for the period which the latter covers .

		The volume is enriched by helpful maps , by many statistical tables taken from official sources , and by a good bibliography .

		Sketchet of recen ^ ^ a ^ ^ the French cab - Parisian politics inet lends a particular interest to and literature .

		j ^ r >
Lawrence Jerrold	PERSON	's journalistic articles , lately collected and published under the somewhat arrogant title of '' The Real
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		`` The Obvious
Paris	LOCATION	'' would have been a far better caption for this little book , which pre - sents certain aspects of politics and literature in the French capital , sketching picturesquely the figures of
Messieurs Clemenceau , Briand	ORGANIZATION	,
Delcasse	PERSON	, and President Fallieres . ''

		Realism in Politics '' is Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's characterization of the recent ministry ; and by realism Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	means the passing of political theorists and the rise of opportunistic politicians like
Messieurs Clemenceau and Briand	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contest between the blague of the boulevard and the solidity of French home life , between the dreams of young socialists and anarchists and the steady conservative commonsense of the nation in practical politics , only emphasizes that divorce of theory and action which is the guarantee of Gallic freedom of thought .

		The careful student will sup - plement this opening chapter by the far more search - ing analysis of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	-LRB- `` French Traits '' -RRB- .

		310 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Chapters on Lourdes and the coal-country the only glimpses we get of extra-Parisian
France	LOCATION	serve as a boundary between the discussion of politics and the last third of the volume , which takes up literary matters under the chapter-headings `` Les Jeunes , '' `` The Heirs of Les Jeunes , '' and `` The French Stage of To-day . '' ''

		Les Jeunes '' were certainly interesting young men , but our final estimate of the importance of all this post-Romanticism must be modified by the fact that Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	was himself a `` Jeune , '' and `` founded at twenty with other
Jeunes	LOCATION	, a Jeune Review : The Magazine Inter - national , in which he published translations into French of the most Whitmanish of the Leaves of Grass , and which started a new French literary move - ment in praise of Nature and Life , and thereupon died . ''

		The quotation is from the English `` Who 's Who , '' but the style is a rather mild analogue of the careless diction that is the chief defect of Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's interesting little volume .

		But no En - glishman who '' starts a new literary movement '' in
France	LOCATION	should be expected to remember the tongue of his fathers .

		.

		TWO plays by
August Strindberg	PERSON	, the greatest
Sweden	LOCATION	's greatest dramatist of
Sweden	LOCATION	, has been little dramatic writer , known in English-speaking lands , primarily because of the subject-matter and point of view of his plays .

		He is a pessimist , a misogy - nist , an extreme realist ; and these characteristics have kept him from that wider vogue which other - wise his remarkable technique and undoubted power would have won for him .

		His strange gripping drama , `` The Father , '' appeared in an English translation several years ago ; but with this excep - tion , he has been practically inaccessible to English readers .

		This lack is now partially supplied by translations -LRB- only fair in quality -RRB- of the short one - act play , '' Mother Love , '' and the longer play , '' The Creditor , '' also in one-act form .

		The former piece is an intensely disagreeable picture of the sordid sin and loveless attitude of a mother toward her actress daughter ; it spells complete disillusionment of the writer with regard to one of the holiest of relations . ''

		The Creditor , '' regarded abroad as
Strindberg	LOCATION	's masterpiece , is terrifying as a study , subtle , penetrating , and acid-like in its satire , of the husband-wife-lover triangle .

		The lover in this case is a former husband , and the climax depicts him as returning to distill the poison of suspicion into the mind of husband number two , and bringing about his tragic death .

		The profound cynicism of the thing centres in the woman herself , although the revenging first husband is a very Mephisto in his cool and calculating hate .

		It is easy to believe in the frightful strength of this play as an acting piece ; but the mind insists on asking , cui bono ?

		when admiration of its dramatic skill and force has given way to reflection upon it as a study of life .

		It is to be hoped that other dramas , modifying the drastic impression created by these two , will in time be added to the list of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's translated plays .

		Mr.
Francis J. Ziegler	PERSON	is responsible for the English versions of '' Mother Love '' and '' The Creditor , '' and Messrs.
Brown Brothers	PERSON	of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia publish the books .

Clara Schumann	PERSON	,
Moritz Arndt	PERSON	,
Bernays	PERSON	,
Fanny Lavater	PERSON	,
Bunsen	LOCATION	,
Perthes	LOCATION	,
Karl Sohn	PERSON	, and the
Valette	PERSON	family .

		Of a more intimately autobiographic character are chapters on '' Grand - mamma , '' '' My Tutors , '' and '' My Brother Otto . ''

		Particularly are we impressed with the range of her girlhood studies under a certain
Herr Sauerwein	PERSON	. ''

		Sanscrit and Russian were as familiar to him as the Neo-Latin tongues or Celtic idioms ; snatches of Hungarian song alternated on his lips with verses of the Persian and Arabic poets ; and his reading was as extensive as his literary taste was sound ... It was
Sauerwein	PERSON	's aim to give me something more than a superficial acquaintance with all that is best in the literature of the whole world ; our course of reading was in consequence strangely diversified . ''

		It was this book-loving German tutor who first en - couraged the gifted girl to cultivate her talent for poetry .


Carmen Sylva	PERSON	's readers would have been glad to have many more details of her life and its crowded interests and activities .

		She has kept her - self too modestly in the background , or behind the scenes , in her otherwise attractive volume .

		We hope she will at some future time again unlock the Shrine and open its door wider .

		The translation of the book from the German has been made by Miss
Edith Hopkirk	PERSON	, formerly the author 's secretary .

		Portraits accompany the reading matter .

		The author , an Irishman by birth and education , became attached to the
Home Office	ORGANIZATION	in
1868	DATE	as adviser in matters relating to political crime , and was made Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and Head of the
Criminal Investigation Department	ORGANIZATION	in
1888	DATE	.

		He retired from service in
1901	DATE	, after dealing with enough famous criminal cases to fill many more pages of print than he has chosen to offer to his readers .

		It is , as the title of his book indicates , only the more diverting incidents that he thus places on record . ''

		And yet , '' he takes occasion to add , '' I do not wish to convey

		Both my prede - cessors in office suffered from the strain , and retired after five years of it .

		And if I was able to hear it for thirteen years , and to be ' fitter ' on leaving
Scotland	LOCATION	Yard than when I entered on the high duties of the office , this was due mainly to a native sense of humour and an acquired capacity for turn - ing away from anxious and engrossing work . ''

		He learned , in short , the lesson left unlearned by so many , that `` to have interests that are infinitely higher and more absorbing than sublunary matters of any kind this , to put it on the lowest ground , is a mental tonic of inestimable value . ''

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which , like the earlier work , handle with an amus - ing freedom , and also with the wit and learning of a scholar , a considerable number of historic char - acters , chiefly of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Con - tributed originally to the
London	LOCATION	`` Morning Post , '' these pieces all have the brevity and the snap without which they could not have achieved the success they seem to have enjoyed .

		They are but single scenes , or scraps of scenes , each occupying only five or ten minutes in the reading , and all but one in comic vein .

		The single exception is entitled , '' The Death of Alexander , '' from an imaginary blank-verse tragedy of anonymous authorship .

		This is the least happy -LRB- naturally enough -RRB- of the twenty-two '' dimin - utive dramas . ''

		Among the best is `` The Aulis Diffi - culty , '' presenting the domestic confabulation that preceded the offering of
Iphigenia	LOCATION	on the altar of the injured
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	in order to facilitate the passage of the Greek fleet to Troy .

		Naturally the proposed victim is at first not at all eager to play the leading part assigned her in this sacrifice .

		After a trying interview between father and daughter the mother enters . '

		What is this ? ''

		demands Clytaemnestra . ''

		Papa says I must be sacrificed to
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	, '' replies the indignant maiden , '' in order that they may have a smooth passage to Troy , and to prevent Ajax being sea-sick .

		Mention at least must be made , in closing , of '' The Blue Harlequin -LRB- with apologies to Mr.
Maeter	PERSON	- linck -RRB- '' and '' Xantippe and Socrates . ''

		There is rare sport in Mr.
Baring	PERSON	's pages .

		Those who remember Miss
Betham	PERSON	-
Edwards	PERSON	's solid if somewhat prosy '' Home Life in
France	LOCATION	'' must regret this writer 's desertion of the field of fact and per - sonal impression .

		Literary criticism is not
Miss Edwards	LOCATION	's forte ; and even in the popular essay a background of scholarship is needed .

		It would be cruel to compare ' Literary Rambles in
France	LOCATION	'' with similar work by Messrs.
Henry James	PERSON	or
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and the `` Literary Rambles '' is certainly superior to the newly-published volume ch theme * .

		entitled '' French Men , Women , and Books '' -LRB- Mc - Clurg -RRB- .

		A rather heterogeneous collection of a dozen articles , the volume begins with an account of '' French Domestic Poetry , '' w.hich serves as an introduction to nearly thirty pages of domestic English versions by the author .

		Then comes an account of .

		Balzac 's courtship of Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	, the idealized traditional account accepted before Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	made available in English the revela - tions of recent French research .

		English views and the feminine standpoint are evident here as throughout the volume , which meanders dully among such subjects as
Barbey	PERSON	d' Aure `` villy ,
Jean Reynaud	PERSON	,
Edmond Demolins	PERSON	,
Joseph Reinach	PERSON	,
Mary Clarke	PERSON	-LRB- the forgotten love of the forgotten Fauriel -RRB- , the brothers
Margueritte	PERSON	, and MM .

		Boylesve and
Bordeaux	LOCATION	acclaimed under the rather inclusive caption of '' The New Fiction . ''

		The collection ends with a review of some recent French estimates of `` la perfide Albion , '' balanced by an essay in French , '' La
France	LOCATION	vue de 1 ` Angleterre . ''

		Why such a production as this latter was included in a popular work is not clear , unless it was to overcome the prejudice that might arise from numerous petty errors , the most amusing of which is a triple refer - ence to the husband of
Balzac	LOCATION	's inamorata as '' Monsieur de Hanska '' ' .

		i ^ vo i ume O f lectures entitled `` A Study of Greatness in Men '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		No mere efficiency , no amount of force and energy , can render a man great , in his opinion .

		Very naturally he takes issue with
Carlyle	PERSON	, in his opening chapter , on what constitutes greatness , whose factors he groups under three heads , the ethical or moral , the rational or purely intellectual , and the dynamic or energetic . '

		If not aimed by his reason , '' asks Mr.
Larned	PERSON	, '' inspired by his imagination , motived by his conscience , wherein do the energies of a strong man differ from the energies of a beast of prey ? ''

		With these guiding principles in mind , the author then proceeds to a study of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, whom he characterizes at the outset as ' a prodigy without greatness , '' of
Cromwell	PERSON	, whom he calls '' imperfect in greatness , '' of
Washington	LOCATION	, who is '' impressive in greatness , '' and of Lincoln , '' simplest in greatness . ''

		As a clear-sighted , dispassionate review of the achievements of these men , the book is excellent , and is especially to be commended to young readers , either as a corrective to
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant per - formance in the same field of literature , or as an independent work -- Wh imt of ^ r '
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	, editorial writer -LRB- he patting on the

		Anything and everything suggested to this frequenter of the 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, crowded haunts of men is dexterously worked into the pattern of his breezy little essays , with plenty of imagination and clever invention to help out at need .

		The style is frankly journalistic crisp and '' snappy . ''

		Here is an illustrative sentence , open - ing the chapter entitled `` 60 H. P. '' : `` For the purpose of getting one 's name into the papers , the acquisition of a high-powered automobile may be recommended to the man who has never given a monkey dinner ; whose son was never married to a show-girl in a balloon at 2.30
A.M.	LOCATION	; whose son-in - law is neither a count , a duke , nor a prince , and does not beat his wife ; who has never paid
$ 100,000	MONEY	for a Velasquez painted in
1897	DATE	, or for a mediaeval Florentine altar-piece made in
Dayton	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	. ''

		There is in these sketches the zest of life as it is lived by the many , and they are calculated to give a keener savor to the common things of every day .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
W. J. Baltzell	PERSON	's `` Dictionary of Musicians , '' published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume of concise biographies , ranging in length from a paragraph to a page , calculated to supply a useful means of refer - ence , particularly to composers and artists now living .

		Pronunciations are carefully indicated , which is not one of the least important features of the work .

		Battles are not usually the most important of histori - cal happenings , but we sometimes wish to put our hands upon an accurate statement of the esential facts about some particular battle .

		For this purpose -LRB- in American history -RRB- '' From Bunker Hill to
Manila Bay	LOCATION	, '' a work compiled from records in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
John F. Dobbs	PERSON	, will be found useful .

		The arrange - ment is chronological , and there are numerous illustra - tions of the pictorial sort .

		We have had more battles as a nation than one would imagine , and a large propor - tion of their names would puzzle even well-informed readers .

		Auerbach 's ''
Das Landhaus	LOCATION	am Rhein '' is better - worth reading than nine-tenths of the novels that ordinarily come to hand .

		In
James Davis	PERSON	's transla - tion , `` The Villa on the Rhine , '' -LRB- copyrighted in
1869	DATE	-RRB- , with an introduction by
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, it was first intro - duced to American readers , and its original publisher -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- now has enough faith in its sterling value to put out a new edition -LRB- two volumes in one -RRB- , which makes a book of almost exactly a thousand pages .

		The type is rather small for our pampered modern vision , but it packs a large amount of matter between a single pair of covers .

		Future historians of our Civil War will have recourse not only to general histories and documents , but to the more minute records contained in regimental histories and in the personal reminiscences of individuals who had their share , however humble , in that great conflict .

		Much valuable material of this sort is to be found in the `` History of the 103d Regiment
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Volunteer Infantry , '' a substantial volume prepared and published by
Luther S. Dickey	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, a veteran survivor of that historic regiment .

		The volume con - tains a mass of interesting matter well arranged , and presented in good form , with some good maps and portraits .

$ 1.00	MONEY	Jones : Education as Growth ; or , the Culture of Character
$ 1.25	MONEY	These readings are selected from documents , speeches , and other articles bearing on every important current phase of American state government .

		They are selections which present a realism about the machinery of our government and give the student an intimate understanding of it .

		Essentially a first book in psychology .

		This book is notably simple , straightforward , and interesting .

		It is the normal development and workings of the reader 's own mental experience which the book helps him understand , the mind being considered a part of a psychophysical organism adjusting itself to its life .

		Selection has been made of the more important features of psychology and greater emphasis is laid on those matters which should be most serviceable to the student .

		Here is a stimulating and entirely new point of view in the study of oral expression .

		The method is inductive and follows out the unique plan of comparing the four departments of vocal expression in speech with the similar departments in music , so that we have discussions of speech melody , speech quality , speech rhythm , and speech dynamics .

		There is an abundance of illustrative selections .

		This book , by President
Jones	PERSON	of the
Michigan Slate Nornal College	ORGANIZATION	, is principally for parents and teachers , and makes simple applica - tions of the latest results in the study of psychology to the problems of home and school education .

		The chapter headings , Self-activity , Self-revelation , Self-direction , and Self-realization , fully exemplify the order of the unfolding thought .

Carpentry Outdoor Sport Outdoor Work Needlecraft Home Decoration That Boy of Yours	ORGANIZATION	- And the Girl , Too !

		It is acknowledged that a boy -LRB- or girl -RRB- must do some useful work with his hands in order to get the best out of his brain .

		Children are being taught
Housekeeping	ORGANIZATION	,
Carpentry	ORGANIZATION	, and all sorts of manual training : and preferably work that is necessary that needs to be done .

		Anticipating a demand for a new land of book for young people
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have been prepar - ing for several years The Children 's Library of Work and Play It is not the plan of this set of books to make carpenters or farmers or cooksbut to restore that old lost balance between working with the head and working with the hands , which existed in perfection with the country boy of a few generations back .

		The task of preparing a set of books like this has been a diffi - cult one , because it is essentially a new idea .

		It needed to be , in a way , a Children 's Encyclopedia with all the helpful qualities an
Encyclopedia	ORGANIZATION	possesses ; yet it must be what such books of refer - ence are not READABLE AND INSPIRING .

		This has been accomplished by securing writers whose narrative is entertaining and interesting .

		The individual volumes have been written by the most competent authorities and the set has been thoroughly edited and is endorsed by the foremost educators of this country .

		The working out of the plan and the arranging of the work has occupied several years and the result is a work which will , we hope and believe , be the standard for all time .

		The Children 's Library of Work and Play is complete in 10 vol - umes ; the books will be sold exclusively by subscription , and if desired , on convenient monthly payments WE HAVE PREPARED AN AT - TRACTIVE BROCHURE DESCRIP - TIVE OF THIS GREAT NEW WORK , A COPY OF WHICH WE SHALL BE GLAD TO SEND TO YOU UPON REQUEST .

		364 '' IDOLS OF EDUCATION .

		It used to be said that the ideal of education was to know something of everything and everything of something .

		But the conditions of modern university culture seem to have created for us the newer ideal recently phrased as follows : '' One must know too much about some one thing , and nothing about everything else : that is true scholarship . ''

		Those who have much acquaintance with scholars of the type that our modern specialism tends to produce , and that is fostered , almost to the exclusion of any other , by the academic standards upheld in the eyes of students , know how frequently this newer ideal is exemplified , and how slight is the exaggeration of the satire .

		The most elementary matters , facts and phrases and allusions which are the common coin of really cultivated minds , are apt to be received with wide-eyed wonder by men whose accomplishments , in their own departments , are of national or world - wide repute .

		Abreast of the latest developments of their
Fach	PERSON	, pedantically informed concerning its minutest details , these men are blissfully innocent of all sorts of matters that were once held to to be essential elements of culture .

		The system of water-tight compartments is so nicely fitted that there is little leakage , and it is thought something of a reproach to the scholar if he permit the contents of his own compart - ment to become diluted by tricklings from any other .

		This ideal of personal obligation to the ex - actions of modern scholarship creates a curious sort of academic aristocracy .

		Its members recognize one another alike by the symbols usually attached to their names and by certain tricks of speech or manner which betoken their entire self-sufficiency and confidence in the superiority of their caste .

		These are the signs of a free masonry jealous of its prerogative , and determined that no rank outsider shall share in its arcane mysteries .

		When its initiates fore - gather , either in casual groups or formally upon stated occasions , they put themselves in mutual touch by the use of passwords so subtly man - aged that an accidental intruder upon their fellowship finds himself isolated and as it were encysted with only a dim realization of the process to which he has been subjected .

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, For this class there is only one point of view , and whoever for a single tentative moment ven - tures to occupy any other lays himself open to suspicion .

		So narrow are the specialties rep - resented by these men that even when they are assembled in their organized councils they are apt to bore one another , because their bond of union is not so much an intelligent comprehen - sion of the papers to which they listen as it is a sense of class-consciousness and a comfortable conviction that they are all of the very elect .

		Meanwhile , the world at large goes on its way unperturbed , and , if it pays any attention at all to their rites and posturings , is likely to dismiss the subject with an irreverent jest such as that of the wit who recently queried : `` Exchange professors ?

		Why not give them away ? ''

		The intellectual world which these men create for themselves is not a real world at all , but a cloistered corner of existence into which the sunlight of liberal culture finds it difficult to penetrate , and in which only pallid growths may flourish .

		It is cut off from the common interests of mankind , and has little sympathy with the causes that should enlist the best thought and the most earnest endeavor of nor - mal humanity .

		Let one of its inmates show a deep concern for the vital issues of social or ethical science , let him bring his special knowl - edge to bear upon the problems of conduct by means of the press or the platform , and his fellows at once view him askance , as a traitor to his caste and a violator of its tradition .

		He becomes discredited as a seeker for notoriety , and is dubbed '' popularizer , '' which is the last word of contempt in the scholastic world .

		The ideal of knowledge for its own sake , pursued into the remotest confines of minute or abstruse investigation , is a fine and inspiring one , but it is made even finer and more inspiring when it is associated with the ideal of service , and when service , not to the few but to the many , is kept constantly in view as the ultimate goal of all intellectual activity .

		We fear that this ideal finds little to feed upon in the arid soil of the Seminar and the journal devoted to the interests of the
Fach	PERSON	.

		While it is doubtless true than knowledge is best advanced by extreme specialization , it is also true that the specialist tends to become something considerably less than a man , and that he is in danger , from his very zeal for learning , of missing the best part of life .

		Edu - cation does not mean much when it gets far away from the root signification of the word , and our modern training for the higher scholar - ship is only too apt to result in atrophy of the affective and aesthetic faculties .

		There is a certain satisfaction in having '' settled Hoti 's business '' once for all , but it is possible to have gained it at too heavy a cost .

		Scholars presumably have or once had souls like other people , and it is a rather serious thing to lose them , even if thereby a whole world of pedantry be gained .

		Carlyle once said : '' It is not because of his toils that I lament for the poor , but what I do grieve over is that the lamp of his soul should go out . ''

		If there is one thing more grievous than to see the lamp go out in the scholar 's soul it is to see the lamp in the child 's soul left un - kindled .

		A wilful default of oxygen is the cause in both cases , but in that of the scholar it is his own will that cuts off the supply and thus quenches the light , while in that of the child it is the will of his misguided elders that forbids its kindling .

		This offence against child - hood is the most damnable that can be imagined , and yet it is constantly committed by those in whose hands lies the shaping of systems of public education .

		Thus we may witness work - ing at both ends of the educational scale forces which in the last analysis tend to rob the soul of its birthright , and which flout all the funda - mental teachings of the wise from Plato to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	who have told us the deeper meaning of education .

		Such are the '' idols '' in whose worship we have gone so far astray from the true faith .

		Nothing could be more wrongheaded , in our opinion , than the prevailing notion that our schools should be made more '' practical , '' noth - ing more mischievous than the displacement , now everywhere going on , of school pursuits that contribute to the nurture of the spirit by exercises and activities that have in view only bread-and-butter aims .

		This spirit of narrow utilitarianism infects the whole educational organism , and the '' job '' is taken to be the final cause of going to school at all .

		The would-be doctor of philosophy in the university , the student in the college or high school , and the child in the elementary grades , are all thinking of the '' jobs '' they hope to get when they have finished the distasteful work of pre - paring for them .

		They are encouraged in this low aim by their parents , who are older and should be wiser , and by the pressure of public opinion everywhere .

		As we have said before , this condition is peculiarly lamentable in the lower schools , where droves of hapless children
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE ELDER
MR. WELLER	PERSON	.

		are herded into '' vocational '' courses of study when they might be storing their minds with the riches of science and history and literature .

		The short-sighted pettiness of all this finds ex - pression in a passage both just and eloquent which we quote from the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' as a fitting supplement to our own remarks . ''

		We are allowing these lads and girls between fifteen and eighteen , at the time of life when the mind is singularly plastic , with a zest for discovery , and a generous passion for new impressions , to devote themselves almost exclusively to ` bread-and-butter ' studies .

		It is a deplorable and perverted aristocratic prejudice which misleads us .

		We think of the liberal studies as the natural monopoly of the leisured and the well-to-do .

		We fail to realise that precisely in propor - tion as his daily life must plunge a manual worker in the deadening monotony of the mill 's routine , is he forced to seek far outside it the interests which can bring to his mind a human dignity and a contact with eternal things .

		A just society would offer to the mill - hand the mental distractions which it squanders on the idle children of his landlord and his employer , not be - cause he needs ' accomplishments ' for his wage-earning , but because his mind must be bent without them to the inhuman service of the machines it tends .

		It is only a mechanical pedagogue who can think of the disinterested studies as something difficult and external and remote from the life that even the poorest worker leads .

		Over his head , also , are the stars , and under his feet the rocks .

		He , too , can understand the movements of a bee , or the unfolding of a flower .

		It is not beyond him to learn enough of history to prefer the novel of
Scott	PERSON	to the serial in his evening paper .

		The govern - ing classes have reached that stage of enlightenment at which they understand that the wealth of nations demands industrial efficiency and bodily fitness in the worker , and of these they make the exclusive idols of the schools .

		They have not yet realised that the organised pursuit of wealth , which has destroyed the joy of craftsmanship and driven the worker from the soil , has imposed also on the national school the obligation of aiding the minds which pass through it to reach the exits from the cave . ''

		`` I took a great deal o ' pains with his eddication , sir ; let him run in the streets when he was wery young and shift for hisself . ''

		The brilliant result of that course of training was the character who sup - plies most of the wit and commonsense of `` The Pickwick Papers . ''

		And , it may be added in pass - ing , the education of the creator of that character was carried out almost on the same plan .

		It is a dangerous ideal , perhaps ; but it begins to !

		look as though mankind would have to revert to it , I in defense of the young who under the present edu - cational system are so assisted and pampered and petted that they can not stand alone ; who , like
Stras	PERSON	- burg geese , are stuffed with carefully prepared learn - ing until the only result to them is enlarged and languid livers .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, at least , it is apparent that we are not getting the value we ought from our enormous expenditure for education .

		We are not getting value in the happiness and pros - perity of the people at large , nor in the production of great men , whose flowering seems to be almost the final purpose of human existence .

		For the first of these contentions we may point to the recent pinch of high prices which has reduced the standard of living all over the land .

		After every other explanation that can be offered for the rise in the cost of living , the fact remains that our educational system has been turning out far too many people who want to live by their wits -LRB- of course in an honorable sense -RRB- , and left far too few who are willing to live by their hands .

		The inhab - itants of the
Scilly Islands	LOCATION	are said to live by tak - ing in each other 's wash ; but surely we can not all get an income by doctoring each other 's infirmities , pleading each other 's law cases , or criticising each other 's criticism .

		That our recent rage for education has not been favorable to the production or maintenance of genius , may be regarded by a democracy as a good thing .

		Certain nations ,
England	LOCATION	for instance , have been hardly more than plants for the manufacture of great men .

		We may possibly say that we do not want any more of that .

		If nature has been so unjust as to privilege certain minds , it is our busi - ness to even things up and give everybody a chance .

		And in politics , at least , our late lack of stars of the first lustre is due to lack of opportunity .

		We can - not have great generals without great wars , or mighty statesmen without mighty issues .

		It is difficult for the people themselves to take a deep heart-interest in the tariff , and we can not expect politicians to rise to greatness on the wings of ad valorem duties .

		But in the arts and sciences there is no such excuse , and it is generally regarded that , '' Our builders are with want of genius cursed , The second temple is not like the first . ''

		If we have preeminent stars in these fields , they are lost in the Milky Way of mediocrity .

		What is education ?

		Goethe said that the longer he lived the more he believed in the qualities born in men and the less he cared for those that are acquired or stuck on .

		We can not educe or draw out of people something that they have not in them .

		Unless all history is at fault , really great parts are sparsely distributed , and when they do occur they are just as likely to be drawn out by the contact with life , the struggle to exhibit themselves , as by an ordered and overlooked course of training .

		Emerson thought it was better for a young man to be thrown into a vortex of exciting action and to be made to swim , than for him to go through college .

		We need not be afraid that talent will fail of learning .

		The real workman will get at his tools .

		Lincoln will walk forty miles for his copy of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, and will study it by the pine-knot fire .

		Whitney will invent his cotton gin though he never 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, saw a cotton field in his life .

		The electric spark of genius is developed by resistance .

		Men are much like mules ; if you want them to enter a cer - tain field you must fence them out of it .

		Widespread education is certainly unfavorable to the development of genius or remarkable talent .

		Greatness , as it were , is put in commission .

		As every one has a little tincture of talent , no one is allowed to possess a monopoly .

		There is a story of a Roman poet under the Empire who sent some verses to a rich man whom he wished to secure for a patron .

		The latter returned them with the com - ment that he himself wrote poetry and did not admit that anyone save
Homer	PERSON	was his superior .

		We have taught everybody to write verses , and poetry is despised .

		Colleges , High Schools , and Correspondence Courses are making every man his own artist and architect and engineer , so that the world will soon be able to do without the profes - sional product altogether .

		If the loss to the world were only the obelizing and obliteration of genius we might let it pass .

		Perhaps mankind may learn to do without genius .

		Perhaps the mariner by some new trained instinct for locality may be able to dispense with compass and lighthouses .

		But education seems to be robbing the masses of the power to appreciate the products of education .

		The comment is on everyone 's tongue that the world of to-day has but a languid interest in things of the mind .

		There is probably three times as much effort and bustle and fuss about edu - cation now , proportionately , as there was sixty years ago .

		Yet there was proportionately ten times as much mental alertness then .

		Then were the palmy days of the drama .

		The tragedies of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	and Hugo met with an appreciation and applause that they do not begin to receive now .

		The same class of audiences to-day flock to the moving picture shows .

		Then the actor 's art was in its zenith .

		Great players drew after them more than a third part of the population .

		Then litera - ture was a matter of universal interest .

		The latest oracle from
Concord	LOCATION	was discussed everywhere ; the blue and gold editions of
Longfellow	LOCATION	and Whit - tier were in most households ;
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	could make a triumphal tour through the country .

		Then our artists received prices for canvasses which are the despair of painters of to-day .

		Then music and dancing , as exemplified by
Jenny Lind	PERSON	and
Taglioni	PERSON	, created an enthusiasm that is difficult to imagine now .

		And of course the politics of those times were far more tremendous than ours .

		Looking back , it is impossible to resist the conclusion that our people were far more vividly alive then than they are to-day .

		Possibly many causes have con - tributed to the deadening of our sensibilities ; but one of these causes , at least , must be the extension of education .

		The amount of education which the average per - son takes , which enters his system and becomes a part of him , is very small .

		How many men who went through college thirty years ago can do a problem of Euclid or construe a sentence of Greek or a paragraph of Latin ?

		The Chancellor of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Rayleigh	PERSON	, in a re - cent speech said : '' I rejoice in the number of successful mathematicians which our
University	ORGANIZATION	graduates , but I can not help wondering what be - comes of them all in general society .

		It is rare to meet anyone who has any knowledge of science , and I might say even of arithmetic .

		I remember a few years ago being stopped in the street by an acquaintance who had lived some while in
India	LOCATION	, and I think was getting out statistics on Indian af - fairs , who told me that he had been on the point of writing to me to know whether I could recommend someone to him who could do a calculation for him .

		I said , ` Well , what sovt of a calculation is itr '' He said ' Only a rule of three .

		I can not do it myself and I can not find anybody who can do it .

		Perhaps among your acquaintances of the scientific world you might know somebody who could help me . ' ''

		The fact is , the main difference between most edu - cated and uneducated men is that the former know of the existence of certain provinces of learning of which the latter are ignorant .

		They have , like
Moses	PERSON	, been taken up on a height and shown the Promised Land , but they have declined the ordeal of conquering it .

		But as the young woman in
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's play says , '' It is understood here that we all speak Greek . ''

		Of course each of the several professions , arts , and sciences requires a special training without which it can not be successfully practiced .

		But the contention is , in the first place , that we are turning out too many practitioners of these branches of learning to give them all the thorough training they should have ; and , in the second place , that in the eye of absolute truth many of these sciences are '' not what they are cracked up to be . ''

		Their votaries quarrel so much among themselves , expose so much of the hollowness of their respective mys - teries , that common people begin to believe it is better to be ignorant than to know a great deal that is not so .

		The higher education of women , though by no means the new thing it is supposed to be , has probably had a wider extension than ever before .

		Some authorities are concerned over the physical effect of intense application to study by women ; In exceptional cases their fears may be justified , but there is something in the nature of women that will generally prevent their taking much harm from education .

		They stand for the individual , the in - stinctive , and refuse to be formalized and flattened out and drilled and trained as men permit them - selves to be .

		Bhavabhuti , a Hindoo poet of twelve centuries ago , put an eternal truth in a couplet , '' Nature itself gives women wit ; Men learn from books a little bit . ''

		What , then , is the moral of these rather rambling remarks .

		This : that we are forcing the season in education in
America	LOCATION	and getting a hot-house pro- duct rather than a hardy natural growth .

		That
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 337 there should be a universal diffusion of the elements of education no one doubts .

		But here the
State	ORGANIZATION	should stop .

		Whatever more is wanted should be left to the free initiative of the individual .

		People rarely value what they get for nothing .

		In the matter of manual training , it might be well to re - turn to the apprentice system , in both the shop and the farm .

		And the gathering of all kinds and degrees of workers into guilds , for inspiration , ap - preciation , and support , might be encouraged .

		From such associations has come much of the best work of the world .

		CHAKLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE MODERNITY OF
THACKERAY	PERSON	is remarked upon by Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	in the course of a judicious appreciation of the novelist contributed to the Thackeray Centenary Number of the
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' which also prints an article on ``
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	. ''

		Beginnings of centuries , '' says Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, `` have often had a quaint habit , like other children , of regarding their imme - diate elders as removed from them by almost im - passable gulfs .

		But the fact remains that every person who is still middle-aged , besides those who are no longer so , was an actual contemporary of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and that while the general atmosphere , say of ' My Novel ' itself , has an indefinable but distinctly perceptible old-worldness about it , large passages of ' The Newcomes ' might , with the slight - est changes of mere ' furniture ' in slang , etc. , have been written to-day .

		It must take another genera - tion or two before men can at least before most of them can take even such a comparatively achro - matic estimate as they can take -LRB- and this is by no means quite ' dry-lighted ' -RRB- of Scott or
Miss Austen	PERSON	, much less such a one as can be taken of Fielding ; least of all such as can be taken of
Milton	LOCATION	or of Shakespeare . ''

		This moves one to query whether the authors whom we thoroughly enjoy ever do become '' achromatic '' to us .

		Even Shakespeare himself and , to go much further back , Aristophanes and
Lucian	PERSON	, and whole passages in
Homer	LOCATION	, are as vivid and present to their hearty admirers as is the latest popular novelist to his particular public .

		On the other hand , there must be many who even now see
Thackeray	PERSON	in as dry and colorless a light as the most impartial criticism could require .

		But why , pray , is '' The Bookman '' in such haste with its centenary number three months ahead of time ?

		MORE ABOUT THE ORCHARD HOUSE , where
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	wrote her `` Little Women , '' and where the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	held its sessions , may not be out of place , in view of the growing interest manifested in its proposed restoration and preservation as a memorial to the famous father and still more famous daughter who once lived there .

		Built , as is supposed , under the protectorate of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	, it boasts an antiquity exceeded by that of comparatively few houses in
America	LOCATION	.

		Its present name became attached to it late in its his - tory , being derived from the old apple orchard planted Half a century before the
Alcott	PERSON	family took possession .

		The quick-witted
Louisa	LOCATION	, given on occa - sion to satire and feeling keenly the family 's failures in various experiments , suggested '' Apple Slump '' as an appropriate name .

		`` All-Cottage '' was pro- posed by some one else -LRB- Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, we believe -RRB- as a tribute both to the tenant and to the great god Pan , whose worship , it was thought , might perhaps be suggested in the couplet composed by
Ellery Channing	PERSON	and painted by
May Alcott	DATE	over the fire - place in her father 's study : '' The hills are reared , the valleys scooped in vain .

		If Learning 's altars vanish from the plain . ''

		But the name ''
Orchard House	ORGANIZATION	'' became its ac - cepted designation when the
School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	took temporary possession of the building and its pleasant grounds thirty years ago .

		The hope of having the house put in order for a memorial recep - tion on the nineteenth of
April	DATE	the most glorious day in
Concord	LOCATION	's calendar was disappointed .

		But a later date , when the tide of
summer	DATE	tourists is at the flood , will suit the convenience of a larger num - ber of visitors .

		A STERN ARRAIGNMENT OF THE DRAMA OF IDEAS is contained in an interesting article by Mr.
W. L. George	PERSON	, in the
April	DATE	'' English Review . ''

		As offset to the seven cardinal sins of the conven - tional dramatist , Mr.
George	PERSON	makes a list of ten of which he holds the playwrights of ideas as a body guilty : to wit , '' the shadowy plot , the play without a climax , hypertrophy of the atmosphere , sentiment -LRB- sometimes -RRB- , garrulousness , the exaggerated type , inveterate gloom -LRB- sometimes optimism -RRB- , obscurity , length , and shapeless purpose . ''

		It is not because the drama of ideas is too good that it fails , Mr.
George	PERSON	declares ; it is not yet good enough . ''

		Strife , '' is gloomy and cruel ; '' Getting Married '' is not a play at all ;
Miss Robins	PERSON	's '' Votes for Women '' lives only in one gorgeous tableau : '' The Passing of the Third Floor Back , '' '' The
Madras House	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` Mid - Channel '' all lack climax ; '' What Every Woman Knows , '' Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's `` The Earth , '' and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's '' What the Public Wants '' are over - sentimental .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is generally all talk and no action ; Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	is also too loqua - cious .


John Synge	PERSON	, Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, and sometimes Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Barker	PERSON	, are obscure and esoteric .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's only fault is gloom .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	ranks the last-named writer as unquestionably a great dramatist , while he bases his hopes for the future chiefly upon Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, with the unaccountable Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in the offing , capable of anything and sure to do the unexpected .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	's discussion of the modern drama is 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, vital and interesting .

		Like all argument involving a question of taste it is vulnerable here and there ; but the point we particularly wish to take exception to is the surprising assumption on which the whole arraignment is based ; namely , that plays of ideas always fail on the stage .

		Granted that Mr.
George	PERSON	's examples are fairly chosen , anybody can pick from them three or four conspicuous successes in the theatres on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Is
America	LOCATION	, then , more hospitable to the drama of ideas , or less sensitive to poor dramatic construction , than
London	LOCATION	?

		And why does Mr.
George	PERSON	absolutely ignore Amer - ican triumphs in reckoning the assets and achieve - ments of the virile drama ?

		THE INFINITE VARIETY OF THE '' ONE WAY OUT , '' which is never the same way for any two persons , is emphasized in an open letter from Mr.
William Carleton	PERSON	-LRB- author of that vivid and appealing bit of autobiography entitled '' One Way Out '' -RRB- to one of his critics . ''

		I suppose , '' he says in closing , '' that
Poor Richard	PERSON	, and ages before him
Solomon	PERSON	, wrote down in simple and terse language wise epi - grams enough to have brought about the millen - nium had they been followed .

		I suppose that every old man learns enough in the progress of his life to guide any youngster along the path to happiness and fortune could he impart it .

		But each of us seems to have to learn for himself , and a great many of us learn too late .

		I do n't expect anyone to follow the road I took , but if only from having watched me a few will learn some of the things I learned and put them into practice in their own way I shall be very glad .

		A house in the country , a flat in the tenements , a tent in the woods it does n't much matter so long as the dweller therein comes to know how really simple the essentials for life and happi - ness and fortune are and how accessible they are to those who go after them in independent fashion . ''

		It is noteworthy , although not surprising , how much more persuasive -LRB- or `` convincing '' might be the better word -RRB- such pictures of real experience with elemental things as Mr.
Carleton	PERSON	has presented are to the reader than any amount of abstract laudation of the simple life .

		Among recent notable books that impress the value of the elemental and the genuine and the unconventional , more or less after the manner of `` One Way Out , '' are Mr.
Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	's '' Against the Current , '' and Mr.
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Irvine	LOCATION	's '' From the Bottom Up . ''

		A MONUMENT TO THE BUSINESS CAPACITY OF MEN OF LETTERS has its history briefly and inter - estingly told in the
April	DATE	`` National Review . ''

		Mr.
C. Hagberg Wright	PERSON	describes '' The Beginnings of the
London	LOCATION	Library , '' tracing those beginnings back to that hot
June	DATE	afternoon in
1840	DATE	when
Carlyle	PERSON	, wearied with the delay and red tape inci - dental to the prosecution of his researches at the British Museum , strolled down Piccadilly and , turning into one of the streets in
Mayfair	LOCATION	, knocked at the door of the brilliant and accomplished Lady
Stanley of Alderley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Being admitted , he found a company of not too sympathetic listeners to his woes , but one containing such men of light and leading as
Hallam	PERSON	,
Maurice	PERSON	, and
Gladstone	PERSON	, who seem at last to have been aroused by the vehement eloquence called forth by their very indifference .

		The subsequent forming of a library committee , which included
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Clarendon	PERSON	,
John Forster	PERSON	,
Arthur Helps	PERSON	,
George Cornewall Lewis	PERSON	,
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	,
James Spedding	PERSON	,
Gladstone	PERSON	, and others , and the early opening of the library itself , with its later rapid development , and its policy and methods , are the matters chiefly dealt with by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	.

		To hold steadfastly to its original aims and ideals , the
London	LOCATION	Library has not found an easy task . ''

		It needed and needs all the dogged obstinacy of the librarians , backed as they have been by their committees , to resist the clamour , not to mention the personal attacks , of the impatient readers . ''

		In other words , the
London	LOCATION	Library , organized by scholars and writers and men of wide culture , always has been and wishes to remain something better than a mere circulating library for novel-readers .

		THE DEATH OF THE `` HOOSIER SCHOOLMASTER , ''
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, the model for his brother
Edward	ORGANIZATION	's most celebrated creation in fiction , fol - lows all too soon the publication , last year , of his autobiographic '' Recollections . ''

		The
Virginia	LOCATION	ancestry of the two brothers and the Southern up - bringing of the younger one go far to explain the latter 's warm espousal of the Confederate cause in the Civil War .

		The elder brother , though physi - cally incapacitated for military service , was almost as ardent a sympathizer with the North .

		This dif - ference , however , appears not to have affected the brotherly love of the two Egglestons .

		The long and varied journalistic and editorial service of
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, particularly his connection with '' Hearth and Home , '' the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' the `` Commercial Advertiser , '' and `` The World , '' need only be mentioned here , as his auto - biography has recently told the whole story .

		Some of the best of the books he so rapidly produced while engaged in journalism , and afterward , are `` A Rebel 's Recollections , '' `` The Big Brother , '' '' Southern Soldier Stories , '' '' A Captain in the Ranks , '' and '' The Warrens of
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		His is a pleasing narrative style , but in his art as a novelist one can discover many flaws without exercising a very searching scrutiny .

		His brother
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, from the comparative seclusion enforced by a delicate constitution , sent forth works of the imagination that far excel his own efforts in that field .

		THE READER OF SERIOUS BOOKS , especially the rapid and omnivorous reader who draws in quick succession from the public library a great number of learned works in all departments of science , is a joy to the heart of the public librarian endeavoring to diminish the relative prominence of fiction circu -

		THE DIAL 339 lation in his annual report .

		From
Leavenworth	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, there comes a word of cheer to those who lament the frivolous taste of the average reader .

		By nearly two per cent has this taste been elevated in
Leavenworth	LOCATION	during the past year .

		In other words non-fiction has gained in circulation over fic - tion by that encouraging amount .

		At the same time there chances to come from the other side of the globe a word of comfort to those librarians whose statistics display a decided increase in the public appetite for story-books . ''

		Do not worry , '' says Mr.
Arthur Spurgeon	PERSON	, the English publisher , in a public address on '' Literature and the Com - monwealth , '' `` when you read that an overwhelming percentage of books taken out of public libraries are novels .

		If they bring a dash of colour into lives that are drab and grey , do not regret the fact , but be thankful that such an excellent result can be at - tained with so little expenditure of public money . ''

		The ideal reader would perhaps be one who could read and digest and enjoy four books -LRB- in poetry , history , philosophy , and science -RRB- with only the sprinkling of sauce furnished by a single good novel .

		Twenty per cent fiction to eighty of non - fiction : will that ever be the record achieved by any public library ?

		Probably not , and probably we need not strive too hard to bring it about .

		SOME BOOKS ONE WOULD LIKE TO OWN come to one 's notice in the library of the late
E. Dwight Church of Brooklyn	ORGANIZATION	, which has just passed into the possession of Mr.
Henry Edward Huntington	PERSON	of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	.

		The price paid is said to have been over
a million dollars	MONEY	, and the thirty-thousand - dollar catalogue of the collection inclines one to believe this is not an exaggeration .

		Nor do we question the assertion that this is the largest siugle transaction in rare books that has ever taken place .

		Now as to a few of the treasures enumerated among the early printed works , the manuscripts , and the autographs .

		What lover of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	would not barter his birthright for the fine collection of
Eliana	LOCATION	, with its autograph letters , including the gentle Elia 's marriage proposal to Miss
Kelly	PERSON	?

		And there is a copy of the first edition of ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' and the original manuscript of Franklin 's '' Auto - biography , '' whose market value is estimated at fifty thousand dollars , and
Washington	LOCATION	's genealogy writ - ten in his own hand ; also a copy of the first edition of '' The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' and one of
Walton	PERSON	's '' Compleat Angler '' in the original binding , and other good things innumerable .

		Who would not be willing to assume the cares and anxieties of great wealth in order to become possessed of some of these ines - timable treasures ?

		.

		THE ADVANTAGES OF UNTRAMMELED IMAGINA - TION over a rigid adherence to fact , in fiction - writing , are illustrated in an amusing anecdote with which Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	closes his preface -LRB- which merits an unabridged reading -RRB- to the new American edition of his acknowledged masterpiece , '' The Old Wives ' Tale . ''

		After detailing the genesis and growth of that novel , he concludes : '' It has been asserted that unless I had actually been pre - sent at a public execution , I could not have written the chapter in which Sophia assists at the Auxerre solemnity !

		* I have not been present at a public execution , and the whole of my information about public executions was derived from a series of articles on them which I read in the
Paris Matin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, discussing my book in Vanity fair , said it was clear that I had not seen an ex - ecution -LRB- or words to that effect -RRB- , and he proceeded to give his own description of an execution .

		It was a brief but terribly convincing bit of writing , quite characteristic and quite worthy of the author of ' Montes the Matador ' and of a man who had been almost everywhere and seen almost everything .

		I comprehended how far short I had fallen of the truth !

		I wrote to Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, regretting that his description had not been printed before I wrote mine , as I should assuredly have used it , and of course I admitted that I had never witnessed an execution .

		He simply replied , ' Neither have I. ' '' .

		THE PROPOSED CANADIAN COPYRIGHT ACT con - tains certain clauses of lively interest to authors and publishers of our own country .

		Hitherto our northern neighbor has practically had no independ - ent copyright law , but has enjoyed the benefit of British legislation as a member of the Empire .

		Henceforward , however , if the proposed law is enacted , copyright in the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	will require that the copyrighted work be manufactured there , with certain reservations in favor of English copy - righted books , which , by some process little more complex than registration at
Ottawa	LOCATION	, will be entitled to the protection of the Canadian law .

		Further - more , '' the Governor in Council may make arrange - ments with foreign countries whereby the subjects or citizens thereof may obtain copyright protection in
Canada	LOCATION	upon such terms and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order . ''

		Thus , until some sort of reciprocity agreement can be arrived at between
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, the latter will be barred out from what has long been a profitable trade , both in American books copyrighted in
England	LOCATION	and in English books copy - righted here .

		In copyright legislation and in the passage of Canadian reciprocity acts this country moves with a truly majestic deliberation .

		THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY becomes apparent even to the least care - ful observer .

		The recent erection of fine library buildings , especially in the eastern States , serves as a visible indication and reminder of this import - ance .

		The magnificent
New York	LOCATION	structure , the stately New Bedford building , the new and spacious quarters just provided for the
Connecticut State Library	ORGANIZATION	, the Hay Memorial at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, and the chastely-beautiful white marble edifice 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, that will soon shelter the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Free Library these and other new and admirably - planned homes for the '' people 's university '' are encouraging signs of a growing public consciousness of the value of that education which only books can give .

		Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	has gone so far as to assert , in a recent article on '' What the Modern Library is Doing , '' that '' high skill in reading and in the art of using books and a library is the one thing of supreme importance in education . ''

		And in closing he says , in similar vein : '' Reading is the most important of all the arts .

		It is taught now chiefly through the yellow journals .

		The founda - tions of its proper teaching with proper and helpful material should be laid more broadly and more carefully in our colleges and universities . ''

		It is certainly true that to a large number of civilized mankind reading is not only the most important art , but also the only art practised with even approxi - mate mastery .

		MR.
BROWNELL	PERSON	ON '' CRITICISM , '' a paper origin - ally presented before the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , and now published in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly , '' will have been read with keen enjoyment by many admirers of his clear thought and incisive style , before this brief note appears .

		It only remains for us to urge all who have not yet treated themselves to the pleasure afforded by this masterly essay to make haste and do so .

		Of course Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	is unhesitating in his declaration that criticism is `` a distinctive branch of literature , having a function , an equipment , a standard , and a method of its own . ''

		The end and aim of the critic 's researches we find admirably stated in a brief passage . ''

		Personality , '' asserts the essayist , '' is the most concrete and con - sistent entity imaginable , mysteriously unifying the most varied and complicated attributes .

		The solu - tion of this mystery is the end of critical research .

		To state it is the crown of critical achievement . ''

		He ends by reminding us anew that '' the highest service of criticism is to secure that the true and the beautiful , and not the ugly and the false , may in wider and wider circles of appreciation be esteemed to be the good . ''

		A MISUSED ADJECTIVE is crying aloud against the violence that some careless recent writers per - sist in doing to its meaning .

		The word is preten - tious ^ whose etymology and legitimate meaning are plain .

		Nevertheless we find it used , not as indicat - ing a disposition to lay claim to virtues and excel - lences not actually possessed , but as denoting positive merit ; for example , `` a large , well-built , and pre - tentious mansion , '' or '' a man of dignified mien and pretentious bearing . ''

		This elevation of a word into better society than that to which it originally belonged is , as we have before remarked , far less usual than a corresponding degradation .

		Inveter - ate , for instance , has fallen from grace since the time of
Bacon	LOCATION	, who wrote , '' It is an inveterate and received opinion . ''

		The long-established we now , too readily , incline to regard as reprehensible ; and we speak of inveterate drunkards , but never of in - veterate tee-to talers .

		Egregious is another fami - liar example of a word that has seen better days .

		Against the present tendency to ascribe to preten - tious an excellence to which , obviously , it can only pretend , we must strenuously protest .

		THE CLOSE OF THE ASTOR LIBRARY in
Lafayette	LOCATION	Street ,
New York	LOCATION	, on the fifteenth of
last month	DATE	brings regrets to many a visitor to that historic building , which has provided shelter for one of the largest and most valuable collections of books in the country , has had a useful existence of fifty-seven years , and is familiar to hundreds of thousands as a famous landmark .

		Built with money bequeathed by
John Jacob Astor	PERSON	, it has the distinction of hav - ing come under the administration of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	as the president of its first board of trustees .

		A sale of the building will follow the removal of its literary treasures to the new library at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street , after which the ancient edifice is likely either to be refitted for commercial uses or to give place to a new office building .

		THE VALEDICTORY OF THE SMALL COLLEGE 'S BENEFACTOR , Dr.
Daniel K. Pearsons	PERSON	, was pro- nounced on the fourteenth of
April	DATE	, when the vener - able donor of
five million dollars	MONEY	to needy educa - tional institutions throughout the land celebrated his ninety-first birthday by adding to his benefac - tions a final three hundred thousand dollars .

		Un - dazzled by his opportunity to do some one big and spectacular thing with his great wealth , Dr.
Pear	PERSON	- sons has sought out the inconspicuous and needy and deserving seminaries of learning , and has helped to show the world what the now too-often despised small country college can do when relieved of the burden of poverty and not obliged to spend three - quarters of its energy in contriving ways to make both ends meet .

		One of the colleges selected by him for special favors was
Berea	LOCATION	, in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, among a race of mountaineers described recently by Governor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	as '' a great left-over fragment of the original stuff out of which
America	LOCATION	was made . ''

		PROBLEMS OF MODERX EDUCATION .

		* In the presence of Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's two formidable yet engaging volumes of educational essays , the first duty of the reviewer is to indicate their scope and trend .

		Their crowded and varied con - tent represents the cumulative harvest in many and rich fields , in turn winnowed and ground into the raw material out of which is to be prepared by the skilful , according to their pre - ferred recipes , the staff of the educational life .

		Although presented as lectures to teachers and special students of education , the appeal of speaker to hearer in this instance needs little concession to be transferred from writer to reader ; indeed , the more reflective reaction of the latter has the advantage .

		The first volume is devoted to a smaller group of larger problems .

		It begins with rather heavy guns levelled at the Kindergarten ; and con - siders next most sympathetically the values , for the educational procedure , of Dancing ,
Panto	LOCATION	- mime , and Music .

		Central in the volume , and not far from this position in the didactic per - spective , is the treatment of
Moral Education	ORGANIZATION	, the worldly problem of good conduct , flanked on the one side by the saintly perplexities of Religious Training and the diabolical outcrop of Children 's Lies .

		Almost equally large in the perspective , and certain to impress many as quite out of focus in the picture , is the truly formidable chapter on '' The Pedagogy of Sex . ''

		The concluding topic is a direct , practical , and convincing appeal for that comprehensive need , if not panacea , of the day and the generation ,
Industrial Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second volume contains more specialized studies .

		The
Child Welfare Agencies	ORGANIZATION	in and out of the school are surveyed , together with considerations from another approach akin to those set forth in Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's former great work on Adolescence .

		`` The Budding Girl '' has the honor of a chapter to herself in the debut of volume two .

		The religious interest reappears in '' Missionary Pedagogy '' and ''
Sunday	DATE	Ob - servance . ''

		An engaging text , '' The German Teacher Teaches , '' introduces the series of ped - agogical applications that follow .

		These cover the subject of ways and means and purposes in the pursuit and so much of capture as the * EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS .

		President of
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .


Xew York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		chase yields of Modern Languages , History , Mathematics , Reading , Drawing , Geography .

		A critical review , which does not spare the sting - ing rod to spoil the too complacent educational systems , is centered upon the problem of the
High School	ORGANIZATION	, and branches out to the more public interests of the Press and Citizenship .

		The readers and they are many , and of many kinds of Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's '' Adolescence , '' in either its original or its abridged -LRB- or , as it has been dubbed , the expurgated -RRB- edition , will be prepared for the plan , presentation , and style of the present chapters .

		There is here greater variety in all respects ; yet the standard is the same .

		Many of the chapters such as those on Moral Education ,
Industrial Education	ORGANIZATION	, Child Welfare , etc. , contain incorporated sub-chapters in fine print , full of compilations of data bearing upon the fauna and flora of the educational world , gathered with patience from all lands , languages , and sorts and conditions of writers and views .

		The encyclopaedic scope of the volumes is superhuman .

		The reference value of the summaries of educational move - ments , appliances , experiments , data , results , and conclusions makes the work indispensa - ble to every self-respecting educational library .

		In this stupendous task Dr.
Hall	PERSON	has wisely and appreciatively used the aid of many of his ardent disciples and assistants .

		The argumentative appeal is often scattered by these interpolated compilations ; but the whole is a dual-purpose work , and must in the nature of the case be many things to many seekers after truth .

		Even though this emphasis of the tentative and the temporal will the sooner leave the discussions out of relation to advancing changes , it will the more directly influence the pedagogical practice of the future , which is the author 's cherished hope .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's style can not be covered or dis - covered in a sentence .

		even in a long and involved and equipped-for-all-emergencies sen - tence , such as he is fond of constructing .

		The style reflects the purpose .

		But in travel through countries or sciences or literatures , a too crowded bag or kit is an illusory conven - ience .

		The increase of equipment is offset by the trouble of finding what is wanted without examining the whole confused content .

		How - ever , the style , like the presentation , is the author 's venture : and the pertinent word of the hour should be sharply addressed to book - reviewers , who conceive their task as a mandate to display their personal sensibilities .

		It is an admirable discipline for keeping readers catholic to expose them to many styles of many minds : 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, and Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's substance and doctrine will keep his readers and keep them interested .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	relates that when , in the early eighties , he gave his first lectures on pedagogy under the auspices of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, he was introduced by President
Eliot	PERSON	somewhat as follows : `` I have never had much faith in pedagogy , for it has seemed to me too often only to make mediocrity and the commonplace respectable .

		Here is a young man who has studied this science and is fresh from
Germany	LOCATION	, its home '' ; the implication being : `` Let him convince you and me if he can . ''

		Presi - dent Eliot remained unconverted , and despite the warranted triumphant tone of the preface to the present work , the original educational problem as to the possibility , place , and value of pedagogy remains unsolved , though with very different reservations .

		It has been said that Sociology grew up in the irregular residual area where the frontiers of the surrounding sciences failed to meet , that it homesteaded there and gradually staked out claims over large tracts of the adjoining ter - ritory .

		Yet if the subject matter of these vol - umes belongs by right of inheritance , dower , conquest , or settlement to pedagogy , sociology is a modest claimant .

		Obviously the bounda - ries of the sciences are as artificial as the cur - riculum ; and may be quite properly pragmat - ically conceived in terms of convenience .

		But there is danger in the looseness as well as in the constraints of conception , and a yet more practical danger in encouraging the appropri - ations of areas of specialized thought and effort , under the warrant of an unguardedly liberal franchise .

		There is presumably not another man in the country who could acquire the first - hand command of this range of knowledge , and at the same time possess the training of the supporting disciplines to give weight to his opinion and grasp to his attack of concrete problems .

		Will not the patent of authority , so deservedly earned by one , lead to its assumption by others of the '' pedagogical '' calling , in order '' to make mediocrity and the common - place respectable '' ?

		It is not fair , however tempting and however much some of its advocates invite it , to praise pedagogy with faint damns ; nor need the reviewer choose the thorny path of answering questions , when the roseate one of asking them is still open .

		The history of the term shows merely that words may be used to cast a slur , to honor , and , more neutrally , to describe .

		The Greek slave who led his master 's children to school seems to some still to represent the best service that a pedagogue can perform ; to others he still seems rightly defined as a pedant , grown ambitious , prosperous , or presumptions ; to yet others , he is an unabashed or accredited professor of pedagogy .

		What he professes , if he belongs to Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's profession , is the study of the child , and of the influences , potential , actual , and desirable , surrounding its develop - ment and maturing in this complex , socialized , organized , institutionalized , experience-satura - ted , yet withal natural , world of ours .

		Educa - tion takes these comprehensive findings and applies them to the shaping of the child 's mind to an efficient conformity with accepted ideals .

		The groundwork of it all is , persistently and consistently , psychology .

		Child nature must be known intimately , directly , naturally .

		What the child would naturally do , feel , say , want , think , long for , or rebel against , must condition what can be made out of him in these respects .

		Pedagogy studies , investigates , quizzes , '' ques - tionnaires , '' observes , experiments , and then diagnoses .

		It pronounces upon educational procedures by standards thus derived , by the insight thus conferred .

		It aims to do con - sciously , analytically , explicitly , what the im - plicit subconscious , fused emotional impression - ism and rational groping of the natural folk - consciousness has imperfectly and with disaster in terms of error and waste , yet creditably , accomplished .

		In addition there is technical pedagogics , the study of those specific processes , profici - ences , and complexes , which serve as the in - struments of education , and whose efficiency must pass the assay test of pedagogy .

		The three R 's must be analyzed , and the language - processes psychologically interpreted , the tech - nique of mathematics reviewed , the meaning of history examined , the potency of drawing or geography formulated .

		Yet the instrument implies a service , and the service a goal .

		So the special and undisputed fields lead back to the general and contested ones ; and it is ever the whole child and the whole educational procedure that make the problem .

		For the illumination of the professional aspects of pedagogical questions usually so crudely and unintelligently attacked , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's volumes are invaluable and will promptly assume a standard place .

		As an educationalist , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	is a radical ; he is so because his loyalty is to a much older conservatism than that sanctioned by a brief tradition , the conservatism of nature .

		Man

		THE DIAL 343 is an animal like the rest , who feels and does , but accompanies emotion and conduct by a little more thinking than seems necessary for the dumb creation .

		The tree of knowledge is the source of his fall .

		His self-classification as homo sapiens is presumptuous , or fits only the purposes of books ; in life he remains homo sentiens , and as such he must be treated pedagogically .

		The deadly sins of education -LRB- and thirty odd are cited in a prefatory enumer - ation -RRB- are violations of child nature ; its cruel waste is the non-conformity with the laws of growth ; its intolerable stupidities are the set - ting up in the place of natural food scholastic artifacts , varying in ingenuity and pernicious - ness from Kindergarten to and through College .

		The only hope of salvation of doctrine and of amelioration of practice lies in deep exploratory diagnosis , drastic discipline , and reformatory endeavor .

		It is the ably fulfilled purpose of these volumes to diagnose , prescribe , discipline , and reform .

		If emotions and their service for conduct are central in the child , then moral education must be the commanding and critical business of all our provisions ; and our failure to make them so is our chief neglect , our unpardonable misun - derstanding .

		Moreover , morality , like all else , has become traditional and false .

		By not heed - ing nature , we have become at once too severe and too lax .

		Our adult ethics do not fit the child , and our theoretical principles do not fit our practices . ''

		For the young child the law of justice should not be keyed too high .

		He must not be eternally under a sense of deserving evil , and retribution must be mild . '' ''

		For even girls , cloistered though they be , but especially for open-air boys , the prayer not to be led into temptation is a fatuitous and iridescent dream .

		We should rather pray for all the temptation that we can successfully and triumphantly over - come . '' ''

		Children should honor and respect their parents as the decalogue requires .

		They should do this so far as the parents deserve it . ''

		If this seems heretical , there is much more specifically directed against Church doctrine and
Sunday	DATE	School practice , that is far more so .

		Pedagogy can be no respecter of prejudices in any field .

		Our neglect of the moralizing values of educa - tional procedure is due to the over-estimation of knowledge , '' which has little or no intrinsic value in and of itself ; that it has , is the super - stition of rationalism , and is just as misleading on one side as the merely commercial view of knowledge is on the other .

		Like light , know - ledge is good not to see but to see by . ''

		Hence morality must be made a matter of emotion and habit , not too much of reflection , which in its ex - treme as casuistry is '' moral Fletcherism . '' ''

		To be conscious of conscience '' is doing right '' with a majority of our faculties and not unanimously with alir '' Now the chief enemy of virtue is laziness , and one of the most common uses of intellect is to find new devices for shirking . ''

		It is hard to reason , decide , judge ; and so the minimum of labor often comes to seem the sum - mum bonum '' as the college student too pointedly illustrates .

		The unreality of modern education is but part of its false perspective .

		Its chief violation is the ignoring of sex .

		To treat boys and girls alike , especially on the stultifying plea of equality of privilege or capacity , is the colossal blunder or crime .

		To ignore sex distinctions leads to the ignoring and suppression of sex in educa - tion , of that which is the very climax of nature 's emphasis . ''

		Our children are generally edu - cated as if they were of the neuter gender . '' ''

		The sex instinct is so ignored that school - mistresses have been caricatured as regarding sex as ' an indiscretion if not a positive impro - priety on the part of the Creator . ' ''

		Few will go so far as Dr.
Hall	PERSON	in sexualizing character and conduct ; but all must recognize its intrin - sic and all-pervasive encroachments upon the purposes of education , its commanding pertin - ence to such '' touchy '' subjects as co-education , segregation , and , again , the feminization of cul - tural interests or of the '' teaching profession .

		The contention that such subjects should be debated expertly may be warmly commended , i however unlikely this Utopian ideal is of reali - zation , owing to the fact emphasized by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	himself , that men -LRB- of both genders -RRB- are emotional and not notably rational creatures . ''

		Like fire , sex is a wonderf ully effective servant , but the most disastrous of all agents , if it be - comes master . '' ''

		Puberty is the birthday of the feelings and the emotions . ''

		To affect a realization of the inflammability of the material with which the teacher in high-school and col - lege is dealing , requires first of all the lifting of the ban from the discussion of the problem .

		Along with feeling , doing is the business of life : and industrial education is its apprentice - ship .

		Again , teachers must frankly realize that '' very few children have any real intellectual interests .

		Very few have taste or ability for learning .

		Most boys are in school to get some - thing out of it . ''

		What they want and need is training in doing things and all the moral steady - 344 THE DIAJ , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ing benefits of mastery . ''

		Industrial education brings a far greater good to a far greater num - ber . ''

		It also brings it in a better way .

		The boy respects the man who can do things and will show him how ; such teaching is real and masterly , not schoolmasterly . ''

		Anything is cultural that arouses the ambitions of young people to do their best . '' ''

		To put thought into work is to idealise existence . ''

		This text is so large , so pertinent to our national wastefulness , municipal unkemptness , trade incompetency , that it may serve for years of sermons . ''

		America to-day needs a new educational dis - pensation . ''

		These are a few of the main propositions of the work ; its corollaries are many and signifi - cant .

		Because emotion sets the key of educa - tion , music is its most effective expression ; but appreciation and feeling , not wooden perform - ance , should be its purpose .

		Because education must be natural , the whole elaborate method - ology , sheltering the dulness of teachers , from the symbolic pap of the Froebelites -LRB- who culti - vate children in pots instead of in gardens -RRB- to the futile apologetics of the forced-respiration classicists or the dessicated pabulum of the his - tory lesson-setters with their '' antiquated busy - work on kippered events , '' are all false , delusive , and ensnaring .

		Because education must be real , teachers must be full-blooded men and women , teaching real things in real ways ; and they must feel and know how .

		Germans know how , and German methods show how .

		Yet there is hope . ''

		We need nothing less than a great edu - cational revival all along the line , and I believe that it has already begun and that a greater transformation than we have ever had impends . ''

		Without attempting further to suggest the many positive and vital positions vigorously advocated by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, let the concluding con - siderations be devoted to the initial and perva - sive problem of the source of substantiated ideals and their guidance to substantial results .

		That the rationalization and coordination of educational procedures in needed and valid , is clear .

		Teachers can not be like factory-hands , each making one sixty-fourth of a shoe .

		But will the confusion of cross-purposes , and the drifting of no purpose , and the distraction of shallow purpose , yield to the wisdom of ped - agogy and its statistical tables and inquisitive analyses ?

		If interest and devotion to these topics be the test , and the '' Babel-babble '' of professional educators gathered in convention be the evidence , scepticism is warranted .

		In - deed , the exposure to half-baked theories , and the amateurish confidence in the efficacy of platforms , are no imaginary obstructions to the development of a true pedagogical sense and a worthy educational judgment .

		One of the cen - tral theories in Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's philosophy of educa - tion is that of recapitulation : that the child follows and should follow the course of the racial development , and that this gives the clue to our efforts as well as to our interpretations .

		The theory is suggestive , often helpful .

		At times one can cite parallel chapters in the two revelations , rarely chapter and verse .

		In the hands of the cautious and the learned , the principle is relatively safe , though Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's use of it has exposed him to legitimate criticism ; but in the hands of the students of pedagogy it becomes a bid for shallowness , and a blind .

		The same applies differently but quite as insidi - ously to many other favorite tenets of pedagogy .

		The fate of pedagogy depends upon the manner of men who become its leaders .

		The insight and judgment which they display will give the temper to their teachings and set the tone of their influence .

		That the study of pedagogy does not of itself confer these benefits , that indeed these benefits arise from virtues of other disciplines and are far from being the natural or acquired prerogatives of pedagogues , is still the conviction of many competent judges .

		How far , then , are the conclusions of these volumes the result of the author 's general wisdom and culture , as well as of his personal predilections , and how far do they follow from the data collected ?

		Will the same data in other hands yield the same conclusions , and be equally worthy of regard ?

		Let these queries stand without prejudice .

		The essential need is the culture and poise that can see largely , temperately , and penetratingly .

		As against the present chance method of plac - ing in control of educational interests , from county superintendent to university president , men of limited , one-sided , and wholly uncor - related proficiency , the advocates of pedagogy have a strong case .

		Certainly these volumes set forth the arduous conditions that must be satisfied to qualify for a worthy opinion on educational matters .

		If by so doing , they will check the stream of vapid rhetoric , ignorant boasting , crude culture , puerile and petty system-making , and self-seeking promoting that make up the mass of current educational speech and thought , they will perform one of several Herculean labors , for of such propor - tion seems the scale of present-day Educational Problems .

		THE D1AJL 345 WITH THE PRE-RAPHAELITES AXD OTHER VICTORIAN CELEBRITIES .

		* The delightful and surprising thing about ' Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	's '' Memories and Impressions , '' a few chapters of which have already whetted the appetite of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' readers , is that , although still in his thirties -LRB- having been born in
1873	DATE	-RRB- , Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	can bring us so many personal reminis - cences of such Victorian celebrities as
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, the Rossettis ,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	,
William Morris	PERSON	,
Millais	PERSON	, and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		Even if some of his memories are of the deriv - ative nature of
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's , whereby that venerable author was able to produce a book covering a round century of recollections , his narrative is none the worse for that reason .

		Being the grandson of
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	, whose artistic genius seems to have been insuf - ficiently recognized in his lifetime , and the son of
Francis Hueffer	PERSON	-LRB- or , more properly ,
Franz Hiiffer	PERSON	-RRB- , a Westphalian of encyclopaedic J earn ing and an extraordinary command of languages , the author came into the world with such en - dowments , of varied sorts , as to generate high hopes in his elders that he would develop into a genius of the first rank .

		Against the parentally prescribed career of a genius , however , he him - self early offered vehement objections , and took his fortunes into his own hands , with some note - worthy results that afford interesting matter for certain portions of his book .

		As it is the abundance of new and amusing anecdotes , rather than the philosophical reflec - tions prompted by the incidents related , that constitutes the main attraction of Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	's chapters , and as these anecdotes bring the Pre - Raphaelites before us in the veritable warmth and glow of flesh-and-blood reality , we can do the reader no better service than to reproduce a few of the more characteristic manifestations of genial idiosyncrasy , as noted by the observant author .

		First , of the Pre-Raphaelite poets as a body , he says what many a reader of their verses must have said to himself at times , and at least half in earnest : `` They took themselves with such extreme serious - ness these Pre-Raphaelite poets and nevertheless I have always fancied that they are responsible for the death of English poetry .

		My father once wrote of Rossetti that he put down the thoughts of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in the language of Shakespeare ; and the words seem to me * MEMORIES AND IMPRESSIONS .

		to be extremely true and extremely damning .

		For what is wanted of a poet is that he should express his own thoughts in the language of his own time .

		This , with perhaps the solitary exception of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, the Pre-Raphaelite poets never thought of . ''

		But an assertion far two sweeping follows soon after , to the effect that ever since
Rossetti	PERSON	's day '' the idea has been inherent in the mind of the English writer that writing was a matter of digging for obsolete words with which to ex - press ideas forever dead and gone . ''

		Of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	's favorite among the nineteenth-century poets -LRB- despite her connection with the Pre-Raphaelites -RRB- , he presents a pathetically beautiful picture .

		The marriage connection that united the two families gave him abundant opportunity to cultivate
Christina	PERSON	's acquaintance .

		Most engaging is her modest shrinking from any open recogni - tion of her merit . ''


Ruskin	PERSON	pooh-poohed her because she was not important .

		And I fancy he disliked her intuitively because importance was the last thing in this world that she would have desired .

		I remember informing her shortly after the death of
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	that there was a strong movement , or at any rate a very strong feeling abroad , that the Laureateship should be con - ferred upon her .

		She shuddered .

		And I think that she gave evidence then to as strong an emotion as I ever knew in her .

		The idea of such a position of eminence filled her with real horror .

		She wanted to be obscure , and to be an obscure handmaiden of the Lord , as fervently as she desired to be exactly correct in her language .

		Exaggerations really pained her .

		I remember that when I told her that I had met hun - dreds of people who thought the appointment would be most appropriate , she pinned me down until she had extracted from me the confession that not more than nine persons had spoken to me on the subject . ''

		The author 's father , a brilliant and versatile man of letters , and a music critic of authority , is the subject of an amusing anecdote illustrating his unusual powers of memory and his extraor - dinary audacity .

		The story refers to the arrival of a certain Prussian prince at
Berlin	LOCATION	, where young
Hiiffer	PERSON	was about to take his degree . ''

		One evening my father was sitting upon his balcony , while next door the worthy rector -LSB- of the
University	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- read the address that he was afterward to deliver to the prince .

		Apparently the younger members of the institution addressed the prince before the dons .

		At any rate , my father , having heard it only once , de - livered word for word the rector 's speech to his
Royal Highness	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result was that the poor man , who spoke only with difficulty , had not a single word to say , and my father was forthwith expelled without his degree .

		Being , though freakish , a person of spirit , that same day he took the express to
Gottingen	LOCATION	and , as a result , in the evening he telegraphed his mother : Have passed for doctor with honors at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, ' to the consterna - tion of his parents , who had not yet heard of his ex - pulsion from
Berlin	LOCATION	. ''

		346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Certain glaring improbabilities , especially the incredible celerity with which the journey to
Gottingen	LOCATION	and the securing of a degree were accomplished , in the same day with a necessarily tedious public function at the
Berlin	LOCATION	university , make it impossible to accept the story in its present form ; but one is ready to believe extraordinary things of a man who , while his native tongue was German , acted for many years as music critic to the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , ''
London	LOCATION	correspondent to the
Frankfurter Zeitung	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	music correspondent to Le Menestrel of
Paris	LOCATION	and to the
Rome Tribuna	LOCATION	, and was at the same time an authority on the Troubadours and the Romance languages , and the author of poems in the Proven9al dialect .

		A homely detail , delightfully characteristic , is brought out in connection with
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	's patronage of
Whistler	LOCATION	, whose etchings the older artist especially admired .

		Going on a certain occasion to a tea party at the Whistlers ' in
Chelsea	LOCATION	, Mr.
Brown	PERSON	'' was met in the hall by Mrs.
Whistler	LOCATION	, who begged him to go to the poulterer 's and purchase a pound of butter .

		The bread was cut , but there was nothing to put upon it .

		There was no money in the house , the poulterer had cut off his credit , and .

		Mrs.
Whistler	PERSON	said , she dare not send her husband , for he would certainly punch the tradesman 's head . ''

		It was a troubled and more or less quarrelsome -LRB- genially and good-naturedly quar - relsome -RRB- existence led by the artists and the authors with whom Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	was brought in daily contact during his boyhood , which appears to have been largely spent in his grand - father 's large old house at No. 120
Fitzroy Square	ORGANIZATION	, the very house once occupied by Col - onel
Newcome	PERSON	, if we are to credit the combined testimony of
Thackeray	PERSON	and Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	.

		The admirable part , however , of the turbulent con - duct of all these irritable bards and fractious painters was that , however hotly they abused one another to one another , they loyally cham - pioned the common cause and defended their comrades against assaults from without .

		In the latter part of his book the author gives expression to some unexpectedly pessimistic opinions concerning modern ideals , modern liter - ature and art , and modern literary methods .

		He professes to find the commercial instinct pre - dominant in writers , and the beautiful enthusi - asms all dead and buried .

		Surely Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	is not yet old enough to be entitled to the priv - ileges of a laudator temporis acti .

		It must be the buoyancy of youth that makes him indulge in this luxury of lamentation , an indulgence common to all of us before we thoroughly learn how many hard knocks and how many cruel disillusionments we can receive without appre - ciably diminishing the zest of life .

		However , let us quote from one of his despondent pages , if only for variety 's sake : '' And along with all this there has gone the tremen - dous increase in the cost of living and the enormous increase of the public indifference to anything in the nature of the arts .

		This last and possibly both of these factors began with the firing of the first shot in the Boer War .

		That was the end of everything of the Pre-Raphaelites , of the
Henley	PERSON	gang , of the New Humor , of the Victorian Great Figure , and of the last traces of the mediaeval superstition that man might save his soul by the reading of good books . ''

		If it were not that so many others , in all ages , had solemnly assured their contemporaries that the bottom had dropped out of everything , we should be alarmed by the foregoing and other passages in the same key .

		As it is , we shall con - tinue to take hopeful pleasure in life and in literature , including in the latter Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	's excellent book .

		A single regret tempers our satisfaction , and that is that Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	has not more of his aunt
Christina	PERSON	's passionate de - sire to be '' exactly correct '' in the use of lan - guage , a little more of the Pre-Raphaelites ' fondness for digging into the old authors for lessons in style .

		Not all those who lived before the blessed seventies and eighties are dead yet .

		DISENGAGING THE ESSENCE OF GREEK POETRY .

		* Most lovers of life and literature experience an occasional mood of rebellion against the pervading tyranny of Greek influence on the history of culture .

		It is so irritatingly unes - capable .

		And in the development of art one feels instinctively challenged when the ivory sceptre of perfection seems to be transformed into the iron mace of authority .

		But rebel as we will , we finally submit .

		We may hold out against both mace and sceptre ; but we must yield our homage to the divine right of vital charm .

		And back of all criticism and praise lies that final mystery .

		A thousand eulogists may insist that it was the gift of the Greek to combine direct naturalness with formal perfec - tion , to reconcile spontaneity with discipline ; that it was their privilege never to do too much or too little ; that they of all artists attained * LECTURES ON GREEK POETRY .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 unity , harmony , and simplicity .

		All of this is true .

		But at the end we are prone to say that the Greek writer of verse or worker in stone wrought and achieved by the grace of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	, and to feel that the
Virgin Goddess	ORGANIZATION	has never vouchsafed a full explanation of her largess .

		Howbeit , each generation of men may receive a new message from Greek poetry , for each generation sees with new eyes and hears with new ears .

		Furthermore , a thoughtful student will now and then discover some tiny secret that has escaped his predecessors ; and once in a thousand years the supreme critic will arise and reveal some new and splendid vista .

		But in the realm of literary criticism the genuinely apocalyptic vision can be granted but seldom , so we may well be grateful for the loving , care - ful presentation of any profound scholar who is at the same time a gifted writer and is willing to speak to our heart as well as to our brain .

		This is the sort of critic we have in Professor
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	, who is just retiring from the chair of Poetry in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The immediate predecessor of the present vol - ume was '' The Springs of
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	, '' a study in the progress of English poetry from Chaucer to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		Some of Professor
Mackail	PERSON	's earlier works were his delightful '' Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology , '' his fine biography of
William Morris	PERSON	, and an unpretentious but admirable History of Latin Literature offered as '' a last tribute to the memory of my dear friend and master , '' Professor
William Sellar	PERSON	.

		And the names of
Morris	PERSON	and Sellar are of special significance for the present volume , inasmuch as almost every page therein reveals the influence of the great socialist-poet and of the polished classical critic ; of the former by its insistence on the close relation between life and art , and by frequent explicit mention ; of the latter in its masterly style and its literary judgments .

		But I do not mean that there is anything like imitation or borrowing ; the in - influence is purely spiritual , if I may so word the thought , and in every way helpful .

		In his '' Lectures on Greek Poetry , '' Profes - sor Mackail is '' dealing with one chapter in the larger and more comprehensive study of the
Progress of Poetry	ORGANIZATION	.

		That study regards poetry , from first to last , and in all its contemporary or successive incarnations , as a continuous function of life , of which it is at once an interpretation and a pattern . ''

		And these words , '' an inter - pretation and pattern of life '' occur so re - peatedly throughout the volume , that there can be no possible doubt that they are intended to give us the leit motiv , promptly and unmistak - ably .

		As to the method followed , we may let our author speak for himself : '' In ' The Springs of
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	, ' I dealt with the prog - ress of poetry in
England	LOCATION	as , in the course of its evolu - tion , it took shape in the work of three great poets ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		In these three poets , at long intervals , the movement of poetry became as it were visible and incarnate .

		Each absorbed into himself , and communicated to his own age , and to us , the effec - tive integrated meaning of poetry as it had then been reached .

		The rest of English poetry , during the three centuries in question , places itself in relation to them .

		They supply key-notes , points of arrival and points of departure , for the whole of English poetry regarded as a continuous , progressive , and organic evolution . ''

		This volume of lectures proceeds on a somewhat analogous method .

		It does not on the one hand make any attempt to give a general history of Greek poetry , or any complete review of the work of the Greek poets ; nor on the other hand does it deal with its subjects by abstraction and generalization ; and it treats of the poetical movement which was part of the life , and is still part of the vitalizing force of Hellenism , mainly as that movement was embodied or manifested in the work of single poets . ''

		In accordance with this plan the author gives us three chapters on Homer ; two on the lyric poets ; and one chapter each on Sophocles , Theo - critus and the Idyl , and Apollonius Rhodius .

		His treatment of the Homeric question is the treatment of a literary man who is not in - terested primarily in archjeological controversy but in '' the two things that really matter , the Iliad and the Odyssey ? '

		However , it is sig - nificant that after all the extremes of polemics he can quietly take the position that the Iliad , essentially the Iliad as we now possess it , is the work of one poet .

		By the beginning of the ninth century B.C. the potentialities of epic poetry had been created by thousands of singers and countless songs . ''

		Then the epic poet came .

		Somewhere on the Ionian coast or among the adjacent islands , in a sky sown with the dust of stars , a great planet rose .

		Homer conceived and executed the Iliad . ''

		We are a long way from the romantic criticism that regarded the Homeric poems as a sort of unconscious outwork - ing of the folk soul , or even from the confident separatism that still dismisses unity of author - ship with a contemptuous shrug .

		Professor
Mackail	PERSON	not only accepts this unity for the Iliad , but even admits the possibility that the Odyssey may be a later work of the same author , although he thinks a separate author - ship more probable .

		In this connection he points out some fruitful analogies from '' the works of the most Homeric of English poets ''
William Morris	PERSON	, and from
Milton	LOCATION	.

		On the whole our author says little about Homer that is 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, really new .

		Indeed , what is there left to be said ?

		But he does write enjoyably and finely , and there is real suggestiveness in his parallel between the periods represented by the Homeric poems and by the Arthurian cycle .

		One will seldom read seventy-nine pages on the same themes with equal pleasure .

		After Homer a strange confusion sets in for Greek history .

		We have grown to know that old Epic world fairly well ; and we naturally know historic
Greece	LOCATION	, beginning , let us say , with the age of tyrants .

		But the intervening cen - turies are provokingly dark .

		It must have been a period of rude and rapid reconstruction , not so cataclysmic in either political or literary history as our critic assumes , but still a period of hurrying change .

		People were migrating hither and thither ; new centres of civilization and power were arising ; new political forms and civic institutions were moulding society .

		We are getting ready for the
Sparta	LOCATION	and
Athens	LOCATION	and other states of historical times .

		And in the course of literature there was much the same sort of confused activity , destruction , and devel - opment , until we find that in
Ionia	LOCATION	and the islands the forms of iambic , elegiac , and melic poetry are ready for the master hand .

		But while we know a little of the process , and may conjecture more , the period is relatively dark , so that our critic is fairly justified in saying that the splendid epic sunset is followed by a night of one or more centuries .

		`` And then the sleepless magnificent dawn awakes the nightingales . ''

		With this line , a sort of immortal waif , Professor
Mackail	PERSON	passes to lyric poetry .

		It strikes a high note , but throughout the chapter on '' The Age of Free - dom '' the note is admirably sustained .

		Here our author is the same marvellous critic that one learned to honor in his '' Selections from the Greek Anthology , '' and we can do no better service than to quote a few of his sentences about Sappho : '' Only in the very greatest poets , and in these when they are at their best , do we find this inexplicable and overwhelming simplicity , the outcome of faultless in - stinct acting on elemental emotion .

		It is the ultimate magic of art .

		We read a few simple words simply put together ; we admire them and pass on ; and then we find that there is some witchery in them that makes us go back , and again back , and yet again back , to make sure that we have not missed something , to try to find what it is in them that moves us so .

		We dilute and dilate them -LRB- the phrase is that of
Swinburne	PERSON	in speaking of his own attempts to render the fragments of Sappho into English -RRB- ; we lavish our utmost re - sources on trying to express some mere fraction of the beauty we find in them ; and in the end we find that we have merely blurred and confused what we have been trying to elucidate , that the magic and mystery still seem , as they seemed at first , just beyond our reach . ''

		But I must utter one note of warning .

		Let not the ordinary mortal , who is fairly at home in the classic tongues , hope to equal our author 's enjoyment of the music of the Lesbian night - ingale in her tuneful native song .

		It is a ques - tion how many modern scholars can hear Greek as
Professor Mackail	ORGANIZATION	hears it .

		Indeed , one sceptic has openly doubted whether anybody ever attains such a delicate and accurate appre - ciation of the sound of an alien tongue as is implied by Professor
Mackail	PERSON	in some of his criticism .

		However , one could name a few enthusiasts who believe they have attained this perfection ; and in such a case the sweet delu - sion , if delusion it be , is almost the same as the reality .

		It would be a pleasure to take up the re - maining chapters in detail ; but perhaps the foregoing will serve to indicate our author 's method and strength , and I must omit much of what I should like to say .

		Obviously , the danger of Professor
Mackail	PERSON	's plan is that he may choose his particular poets unwisely , or neglect to indicate the thread connecting period with period .

		In the latter respect he has done all that the plan allows , and in the former he has been felicitous with one exception .

		But to me that exception seems important and regret - table , for he has limited his treatment of Greek drama to Sophocles .

		The period is familiar to all of us , and for Professor Mackail the crucial question was whether it was possible to find one poet who might be taken as the sole representa - tive of this remarkable age .

		He answers un - hesitatingly . ''

		Attic poetry is the drama : and the Attic drama is Sophocles ; for Sophocles is the single poet who embodied actually and com - pletely the spirit of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		But if Greek poetry is to justify Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's keynote and be an interpretation of Greek life , we must dissent most vigorously from his conclusion .

		Doubtless most of us would vote that Sophocles be awarded the tragic prize ; nor can we ever forget the line wherein Professor
Mackail	PERSON	's illustrious predecessor declared that the singer of sweet Colonus , and its child , saw life steadily and saw it whole .

		But no treatment of dramatic poetry in relation to the Athenian spirit , and to the subsequent influence of that spirit on the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	world and later thought , can be in any measure satisfying without some ade - quate discussion of Aristophanes and
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 It is true that these two dramatists are rather uncanny children to deal with ; but our author is himself aware of the lamentable incomplete - ness due to their omission , and 1 have no doubt that his powerful hand would have fitted them into his plan .

		As it is , one must feel that his treatment of the drama as the representative literary product of the period remains unfinished and unsatisfactory .

		To anyone who reads our author 's chapter on Sophocles this criticism will seem a bit ungrateful ; for the chapter is simply admirable from beginning to end .

		In - deed , its very excellence is an answer to Pro- fessor
Mackail	ORGANIZATION	's plea as to space ; for any lover of Greek literature would be grateful for the additional sixty or seventy pages .

		I append a few sentences just to show what we are missing : '' And thus to the
Electra	LOCATION	, as to the whole marvel and mystery of life embodied in the poetry of
Sopho	LOCATION	- cles , there is no solution ; for a solution would imply that there was something beyond life and greater than life .

		Or if we can speak of a solution , it is simply this , that life goes on , renews itself , and moves triumphantly forward for ever ; in a word , that life is .

		One might almost say that to his art , ethics and religion , the problem set and solved or declared insoluble by the thinkers , do not matter ... With a power , an ease , a skill which are the culminating achievement of the Greek genius , he employs the endless miracle of language to express and interpret , to set out in clear faultless pattern , the fathomless miracle of life . ''

		The rest of the book is marked off by the words , '' After
Athens	LOCATION	, '' a really felicitous touch , for it sums up the feeling of all readers of poetry .

		From the Athenian drama our au - thor moves to the varied poetry of
Alexandria	LOCATION	, hinting as he passes at those last notes of '' Hel - lenic poetry in its full purity and authentic tone '' that came appropriately from outlying lands .

		The Alexandrians he treats as `` the interpreters of Hellas and forerunners of Ausonia . ''

		And with that summary I must content myself , merely noting that he appre - ciates and succeeds in bringing out the real services of those Hellenistic workers and writ - ers .

		I may allow myself , however , one brief comment .

		Professor
Mackail	PERSON	shares a common difficulty of students of this period .

		`` The extraordinary and long-continuing popularity of the
Phaenomena	LOCATION	and
Diosemeia	PERSON	has long been one of the puzzles of literary criticism . ''

		It seems perfectly clear to me that the answer is to be found in the subject matter , not in the negative merits of style as enumerated in the text .

		These centuries were interested in scien - tific questions , and men read these treatises singly as being accessible and on the whole more readable than any others .

		The last chapter , on '' Apollonius of
Rhodes	PERSON	and the Romantic Epic , '' derives new interest mainly from the frequent references to
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , I am a rather blind admirer of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, so I am probably prejudiced ; but it does seem to me that this introduction of the modern poet has a genuinely vivifying effect .

		It is hard to grow enthusiastic about Apollonius .

		Nobody reads him except under duress ; but he did furnish material for the '' Aeneid '' and for the '' Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	, '' and so abides as a sort of warning that one should never despise tiresome things or people .

		In conclusion , may I say that the volume before me seems important and admirable ?

		I should presume to differ from many minor conclusions ; but it is the work of a reviewer to give the general effect of a book , rather than to quarrel about details .

		Here and there are tiny touches of over-refining or even of pedantry ; but they do not constitute a material blemish .

		I think a little is lost by not leaving the studies as frankly separate lectures ; but on the other hand much has been gained .

		The work is by no means intended for readers who have not already wandered freely among the fields and flowers of Greek poetry .

		But for those who have so wandered the author has done much .

		If he has not altogether succeeded in '' disengaging the essence '' of Greek poetry , he has encouraged his readers to attempt to disengage it for themselves .

		And after all , this may well prove to be the more valuable service .

		In this first volume there are articles on the following divisions of the general field : educational history ; educational biog - raphy ; the administration of education ; the supervision of instruction ; psychology ; school architecture ; the hygiene of studies ; educa - tional institutions ; systems of schools , native and foreign ; methods of teaching ; and what might be called the philosophy of education .

		About ninety of the most distinguished edu - cators in
America	LOCATION	, and fourteen or fifteen in foreign countries -LRB- mainly in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	-RRB- , have prepared the articles for this vol - ume .

		The majority of these writers are univer - sally regarded as the highest authorities in their respective departments ; but there are a few names that are new in educational literature .

		The editor states that the purpose in the preparation of the cyclopedia has been to make a work of reference that may be of service to students of educational theory , to practical teachers , and to professional men ministers , editors , and others whose interest in education is only general .

		To this end each of the main divisions of education has been placed under the supervision of an expert ; and it was in - tended that the complete work should furnish a condensed text-book on educational theory , the history of education , the administration of education , educational methods , and so on .

		Following the discussion of each important sub - ject , there are listed a number of references , so that one who is interested in a topic may pursue it further at his pleasure .

		To the present writer it seems that certain divisions of education have been especially well treated in this first volume of the cyclopedia .

		Topics relating to the history of education , educational biography , school systems , the ad - ministration of education , and the hygiene of studies appear to have been given particular attention ; and they seem , on the whole , to be treated in a more effective way than topics relating to the theory of education , educational methods , and the like .

		This is due to the fact that it is easier to secure definite data upon the former than upon the latter group of topics .

		When it comes to treating scientifically and effectively the principles of education and edu - cational methods in very limited space , the makers of cyclopedias encounter tremendous difficulties .

		In the present volume , the space devoted to these latter subjects seems inade - quate in view of their importance and their complexity ; and the present reviewer feels that on this account their treatment is not in some respects satisfactory .

		Take , for instance , the article on '' Art in Education . ''

		Its historical and psychological foundations , its present posi - tion in the curriculum of studies , and the methods of teaching art in the schools are con - sidered ; and the discussion of all these topics occupies not over nine pages of the cyclopedia .

		During the last few years , there have appeared numerous volumes dealing with the methods of teaching art , to say nothing about the history , the psychology , and the philosophy of art , and its place in an educational system .

		The article in the cyclopedia is in no sense a resume , of this literature , but rather a fragmentary view of the fields covered .

		For the student of edu - cation the treatment will seem rather common - place ; and for the novice it is too general , non-concrete , and non-specific to be of service .

		Again , the article on Arithmetic treats the history of the subject as a science , its general nature , the history of methods of teaching it , and its present status in the curriculum , all in less than four pages of the cyclopedia .

		At the same time four pages are given to education in the
Argentine Republic	ORGANIZATION	, over four pages to the history and organization of education in
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and about as much space to the his - tory and organization of education in
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		Over thirteen pages are devoted to a discus - sion of education in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		These instances are cited merely in illustration of the topics upon which the cyclopedia lays stress , many of which will be of very slight interest to the `` rank and file of the teaching profession , '' whose needs the cyclopedia is designed to meet .

		As intimated at the outset , educational men differ regarding the aim which should be kept in view in a cyclopedia of education .

		Those who hold that it should give general informa - tion , which may be of service to the man who is neither a specialist nor a practical teacher , will feel that the present cyclopedia has been wrought out on the right plan ; but for one who believes that it should strive to influence practice , to help the teacher at the point of contact in teaching , to bring to his aid all that is known regarding the tendencies , interests , and social and intellectual needs of childhood and youth , and the most economical and effec - tive methods of securing educative reaction from pupils , such a person will feel that the present work leaves something to be desired in this regard .

		The article on Arithmetic , for
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 instance , to which reference has been made , -LRB- and it is one of the best of the articles relating to educational values and methods -RRB- offers little if anything that the practical teacher can utilize .

		If teachers could be made to read the historical part of the article , it might suggest to them the order in which the child must assimilate the subject ; but yet the treatment is so very general , owing to limitations of space , that it does not bear concretely and definitely enough upon the actual processes of teaching to appeal to the practitioner .

		Scarcely a word is said regarding the proper methods of teaching this subject .

		A few suggestions are offered in re - spect to the place of arithmetic in the curricu - lum ; but these suggestions are of doubtful value , because it is possible they are not in accord with contemporary tendencies in respect to the position which this subject should occupy in a modern curriculum .

		To be specific , the article says -LRB- page 207 -RRB- that while there is some attempt to curtail the arithmetic in the elementary school , omitting it from the first school year , yet this is '' a doctrinaire idea that is not taken very seriously . ''

		But the next article , dealing with the hygiene of arithmetic , takes direct issue with this statement , present - ing arguments against beginning arithmetic in the first grade .

		It says -LRB- page 209 -RRB- that accord - ing to our present knowledge of hygiene in the teaching of arithmetic , '' formal instruction in this subject should not be begun before the age of eight or ten . ''

		Any teacher needing light upon the teaching of arithmetic to first-grade children would be rather more confused after reading these articles than he was before .

		It is doubtful if this confusion would have resulted if the articles had been worked out in greater detail , for the authors are the highest authorities on these subjects .

		But the subjects are too complex to be treated in so brief a way .

		To illustrate this point further , mention may be made of the article on Algebra .

		This subject is treated in regard to its general nature , its his - tory , and its present status in the curriculum , in a little over two pages .

		In dealing with present tendencies in regard to the subject , the article states in effect that there are tendencies at work which are likely to lead to the extension of alge - bra in the schools .

		At present algebra is taught for a year and a half in most high schools ; and according to this article , there is likelihood that in the future it will be extended over a longer period .

		During the past few years , the writer of this review has visited many secondary schools in various parts of the country , and in his opinion the statement that the time given to algebra is likely in the future to be extended is fundamentally erroneous .

		On the contrary , there seems in many sections of our country to be a disposition to curtail the time devoted to this subject .

		.

		In some cities , action has been taken looking toward making algebra elective in the secondary schools .

		In at least one state in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, the superintendents of the state are debating a proposal to shorten algebra to one year , and to make it elective .

		The appearance of new text-books in which arithmetic , algebra , and geometry are taught to some extent simul - taneously and interrelatedly , indicates a dispo - sition to minimize pure algebra , so to speak , and to make it become of service to arithmetic and geometry .

		It seems probable that a teacher in reading this article would get a wrong concep - tion of what the developing views in this country actually are in respect to the educative value of this branch .

		Of course , when it comes to treating contem - porary tendencies in a cyclopedia , authors are on insecure ground ; and yet this is precisely the phase of education that needs most to be effectively handled in order that practice may be affected beneficially .

		Those who deal with tendencies ought to have had an opportunity to come into intimate contact with teaching and teachers in various sections of the country in order to determine what the prevailing senti - ment is in regard to values and methods .

		The fact that we speak of tendencies indicates that they have not become well enough defined , so that one may consult literature in order to learn definitely what they are .

		Voume I. of the cyclopedia will be of value primarily to those who want to secure general information regarding educational biographies , institutions , the history of education , and the meaning of psychological and educational terms .

		It will meet the needs of the layman who wishes a brief survey of topics in any of the divisions of education , but who does not want to go far into any topic , and who has no need to apply in actual practice what he gains in his reading .

		It will be of value also to the student of edu - cation who may wish to have at hand accurate information upon the general phases of a great variety of educational subjects .

		In sum , the book will be valuable for the information it gives , rather than for its scientific treatment of any topic , or the light it throws upon the prob - lems arising in actual schoolroom situations .

		In order that it should be of great value to the '' rank and file of the teaching profession , '' 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, it would be necessary to change its character somewhat in succeeding volumes , treating the science and art of teaching in greater detail , and saving space by eliminating articles that can be of interest to only a very small number of teachers , such articles , for instance , as the one on Archaeology , which is just as well treated in other cyclopedias , and it hardly seems neces - sary to incorporate it in a cyclopedia of education .

		The nearest approach to the treatment of concrete school conditions and needs seems to be in the articles on school architecture and the hygiene of teaching .

		Such a term as `` Adjustment , '' say , which has recently come to occupy so important a place in educational literature , ought to be treated in some detail ; but as a matter of fact , it is here disposed of in two hundred words .

		Such subjects as
Child Study	ORGANIZATION	, Adolescence , and the like ought , it seems , to be given generous space in a work aiming to influence contemporary thought and practice in teaching , rather than simply to pre - sent established knowledge of general interest .

		It appears to the present reviewer that it is these great interests which are now in the process of taking definite shape that ought to be given primary place in a cyclopedia of education , in order that tendencies may be influenced and directed by an effective statement of the best wisdom in the world in respect to such matters .

		Due emphasis should be put upon the effective statement of educational truths .

		A book on education ought to observe psychological meth - ods of exposition and illustration in its own content .

		Pictures , diagrams , and especially a wealth of concrete detail ought to be freely employed ; effective method demands these aids to understanding , and these essentials for the awakening of interest on the part of the novice .

		It may be hoped that in future vol - umes of '' The Cyclopedia of Education '' more liberal use will be made of graphic and other aids in exposition .

		Every one will grant that great credit is due the editor , his associates , and the publishers for undertaking a work of this magnitude in so scholarly and dignified a way .

		It is safe to say that this cyclopedia will go quite beyond anything that has yet been done in any language in the direction of summing up in an authorita - tive manner what is established about education in all its varied phases .

		American teachers have a right to take pride in the fact that a work of this importance should be initiated and carried through in this country .


M. V. O'SHEA	PERSON	.

		MR.
CHESTERTON	PERSON	'S GARGOYLES .

		* About a book of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's the reading public needs to know nowadays but one thing : is it Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	in gay mood or serious ?

		A part of the reading public needs not even that crumb of interesting information ; it has no use for Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	in any mood what - ever .

		Of the rest , some enjoy him in every mood ; some prefer him in the studied solemnity of '' Orthodoxy '' and '' What 's Wrong with the World '' ; others are bitterly disappointed when - ever , by choosing to be problematical , he misses a half-yearly opportunity of being whimsical , of diverting us into by-paths of delicious non - sense , of teaching us how to spend such leisure moments as the strenuous spirit of the times leaves us for the enjoyment of what
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has delightfully called the `` Little Happinesses '' of our humdrum lives .

		It is perhaps already evident that we prefer Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	frivolous ; a preference which we strongly suspect Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	of sharing .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's new book of clever incon - sequential -RSB- ties is entitled `` Alarms and
Discur	PERSON	- sions . ''

		In a very amusing preface he explains that he wanted to call it '' Gargoyles . ''

		`` Traces of such an intention can still be detected -LRB- I fear -RRB- in the second essay .

		Some time ago I tried to write an unobtrusive sociological essay called ' What is Wrong . '

		Somehow or other it turned into a tremendous philippic called ` What 's Wrong with the World , ' with a photograph of myself outside ; a photograph I swear I had never seen before and am far from anxious to see again .

		Such things arise from the dulness and languor of authors , as compared with the hope and romantic ardour of publishers .

		In this -LSB- the present -RSB- case the publisher provided the title : and if he had provided the book too I dare say it would have been much more entertaining . ''

		The publisher 's title , if not as original and thought-provoking as '' Gargoyles , '' is still suffi - ciently apposite .

		There are naturally plenty of '' Discursions '' in the book ; also a reasonable number of '' Alarms , '' including at least one each for reactionary dukes , theorizing anar - chists , and over-confident criminologists , besides several for careless motorists , and a varied as - sortment for the casual reader , who has not hitherto had his eyes opened to the many '' wild and wonderful things that you can learn by stopping at home '' in the enlivening society of
G. K. C. Those	PERSON	persons who are wont to complain of a wearisome sameness in Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's topsy - turvy mental processes and attitudes , may be * ALARMS AND DISCURSIONS .

		THE DIAL 353 relieved to hear that he has recently made one tremendous change in his habits .

		He , who is '' a Cockney not only on principle , but with savage pride , '' who considers Nature-worship '' more morally dangerous than the most vulgar man - worship of the cities , '' who prefers green - grocers to greens , and supports his preferences by calling attention to the fact that when you want to compliment a man upon his solid worth you call him not a turnip , but , in the nobler Cockney metaphor , a brick , despite all these theories Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has finally struck his colors .

		He has abandoned
London	LOCATION	for a Country Seat .

		This estate includes a garden , in which Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	does not dig . ''

		When I find a Country Seat , '' he announces blithely , `` I sit in it . ''

		But the roses in the garden appeal to their owner as '' royal and dangerous '' ; the vegetables suggest observations on the spiritual value of the image of eating , and that leads to an enthusiastic encomium upon cheese ; while a raid of little black pigs upon the premises serves to introduce a particularly cogent discus - sion of Futurism , fools , and prigs .

		Some of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's best frivolities are to be found in his latest volume .

		There is , for example , his illuminating division of human - ity into '' The Three Kinds of Men '' : People , who have queer ideas that they can not express ; Poets , who make these popular sentiments seem as strange and delicate and satisfying as they really are by expressing them , whether in prose or poetry : and Prigs , who '' rise above the people by refusing to understand them : by say - ing that all their dim , strange preferences are prejudices and superstitions . ''

		There is , again , his approving analysis of '' The Strangeness of Luxury '' to normal minds , as typified by the harassed little seamstress from
Harrow Road	LOCATION	, who , being equally unfamiliar with meadows and motor-cars , will find the first only '' pleasant , free , and a little lonely '' and the second magical and monstrous , quite prop - erly , since motoring is almost as magical as going to the moon , and quite as monstrous as riding an avalanche '' another swift , successful , and thrilling way of coming down a hill . ''

		Parti - cularly complete and satisfying , as is becoming in a projected title-essay , is the treatment of '' Gargoyles , '' which involves neatly epigram - matic definitions of Greek and Gothic art , of realism and romanticism , and , finally , of Ches - tertonian journalism , that is , Chestertonian '' Gargoyles . '' ''

		The finest lengths of the Elgin marbles consist of splendid horses going to the temple of a virgin .

		Christianity , with its gargoyles and grotesques , really amounted to saying this : that a donkey could go before all the horses of the world when it was really going to the temple .

		Romance means a holy donkey going to the tem - ple .

		Realism means a lost donkey going nowhere ... '' I am a medisevalist and not a modern .

		That is , I really have a notion of why I have collected all the nonsensical .

		things there are .

		I have not the patience nor perhaps the constructive intelligence to state the connecting link between all these chaotic papers .

		But it could be stated .

		This row of shapeless and ungainly monsters which I now set before the reader does not consist of separate idols cut out capriciously in lonely valleys or various islands .

		These monsters are meant for the gargoyles of a definite cathedral .

		I have to carve the gargoyles , because I can carve nothing else ; I leave to others the angels and the arches and the spires .

		But I am very sure of the style of the architecture and of the consecration of the church . ''

		The people who dislike Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	are the people who would consider gargoyles mean - ingless and unnecessary .

		But to some churches some gargoyles are very necessary on a rainy day .

		Likewise is Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	very useful to some of us , in some moods .

		According to the mood we are in , he can make life interesting or at least tolerable , when all other resources fail .

		When the splendid dreams of the poets are far beyond our reach , when we are tired of strenuous convictions , and out of tune with '' sweetness and light , '' then it is Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton 's turn .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has provided for such occasions a world of interesting people ; Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	discovers the same subtle possibilities , the same unsuspected depths of bravery and beauty in facts and things .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	is a glorifier of plain people .

		Most of us are doomed to live most of our lives '' In a Cage '' ; Mr.
James	PERSON	shows us the undreamed-of advantages of a cage for watching the human drama .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	discovers to us `` the wild and wonderful things that you can learn by stopping at home '' ; and the romantic quality of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's common things matches the romantic quality of Mr.
James	PERSON	's every-day people .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	plumes himself on being bluff and downright and simple ; in method he is , but in matter never as no one probably knows better than he .

		Once in a while Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's method is annoying ; so very often is Mr.
James	PERSON	's .

		But we forgive them both their little idiosyncrasies for the sake of the service they do to romance , to '' Little Romance , '' we might call it , paraphrasing
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, in distinction from the greater and finer romance that is not possible or signi - ficant for some of us , every day .

		No portrait of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	embellishes the new volume .

		It is a pity that it did not 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, occur to his publishers to utilize a new one , recently published , which shows him sitting in the garden of his Country Seat at
Beaconsfield	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	objected ; perhaps he has seen this new portrait and '' is far from anxious to see it again . ''

		But , taken in connec - tion with the sparkling humor of '' Alarms and Discursions , '' its atmosphere of suburban peace and comfortable every-day serenity has a sym - bolic value that it is an artistic crime not to have utilized .

		SOCIAL , TENDENCIES IN ENGLAND AND
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's volume entitled '' A Modern Outlook '' is a reprint of essays on social ques - tions which have appeared at intervals during the past three years in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation . ''

		A rough grouping into five sections has been made .

		One section deals with a variety of topics classed as `` Life and Letters '' ; another with `` The Woman of the Future '' ; a third with '' American Traits '' ; a fourth with '' The Church of the Future '' ; while a fifth is given the com - prehensive heading , `` Of Politics . ''

		It is true , however , that there are at once more harmony and more diversity in the contents of the volume than the classification and grouping would indi - cate .

		Diverse as are their subjects , these frag - ments of discussion and commentary possess an unusual unity of spirit throughout ; while the titles assigned them , as well as their subject matter , would permit many to be placed about as well in one of the formal sections of the vol - ume as in another .

		Considered collectively , the essays constitute a general and inclusive criticism upon existing human relationships , an analysis of many current questions by a method of which the author is an undoubted master .

		He has a self - consistent social philosophy of his own , as well as exact reasoning powers , and his attempt is simply to interpret existing phenomena in a coolly critical and drily logical light .

		If it be possible to state Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's mode of analysis in a few words , it may be described as the application of enlightened commonsense ; and if it be pos - sible to state his general motive or animating purpose briefly , it may be said to be that of ex - posing and ridiculing sham .

		The book will be valuable throughout the English-speaking world because of its biting and austere comment * A MODERN OUTLOOK .

		upon many ideas , movements , and currently - accepted beliefs that are in themselves founded upon erroneous theories .

		It would not be possible to '' review , '' in the ordinary sense of the term , a volume composed of so many more or less separate units .

		The division of the work that will perhaps be read with the most interest in the
United States	LOCATION	is that which deals directly with conditions in this country .

		In this section are essays on such topics as '' The American Woman , '' '' Is America Heading for Aristocracy ? ''

		`` The Boom Child '' -LRB- an analysis of ex-President
Roosevelt	PERSON	-RRB- , and others .

		Possibly the most suggestive of the number is the discussion of aristocracy in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's view is that the social problem of the future in our country will assume form as an effort on the part of the workers to prevent the perma - nent establishment of an oligarchy of wealth based upon a new proletariat of subject races .

		He notes with anxiety the ingress of millions of depressed laborers supplying our industries with raw , cheap , and submissive labor , an ingress which he considers essential to the main - tenance of our modern feudal system .

		Material well-being , culture , travel , and leisure would in great measure pervade this oligarchy , while the gradual and only semi-conscious development of institutions and standards designed to promote class feeling and prevent the easy rise of men from the ranks of the workers into those of the rulers and directors of industrial society fills him with alarm .

		In all this , there is of course nothing new .

		Yet what Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	has to say is extraordinarily suggestive , made so by the piquant and incisive method of statement and the keen criticism of the pretentious which are characteristic of most of this author 's work .

		`` A Modern Outlook '' is not an original inves - tigation ; it is a volume that presents the inter - pretations and syntheses of an original mind in the field of social and economic science .

		Every page is informed with a sound philosophy , and the essays into which the treatment is broken are short enough to permit consideration from the busiest man of affairs .

		355 BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		Two English ladies who prefer a < ` en C ture .

		anonymity , deeming it '' a great ven - ture to speak openly of a personal experience , '' have discovered that the neighborhood of the Petit Trianon at
Versailles	LOCATION	is haunted .

		They made the discovery in broad daylight on a hot
August	DATE	afternoon in the year
1901	DATE	.

		They record this discovery circumstantially in a book called '' An Adventure '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They came upon buildings and grottos and groves that are not there now , but correspond to the indications on the older maps ; they were spoken to by attendants of the days of the Revolution ; and one of them caught a glimpse of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, passing her by at the time as a strange lady apparently sketching , and apparelled as the memoirs of her modiste show her to have been in the
year 1792	DATE	.

		On a second occasion , in
January , 1902	DATE	, one of the ladies re - experienced the adventure , saw some men with a cart accoutred as in older days ; heard voices and the rustle of unseen figures moving among the trees , and the strains of music afterwards identified as composed in the late eighteenth century .

		They then researched zealously and devotedly among archives and memoirs , and added many a detail showing that their retrospective vision was historic - ally correct .

		There is no explanation : '' It is not our business to explain or to understand nor do we understand what happened to put us into communication with so many true facts , which , nine years ago , no one could have told us in their entirety . ''

		They suggest that they may have `` in - advertently entered within an act of the Queen 's memory when alive '' ; and the revery that
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	may have entertained while a prisoner of the Assembly , uncertain of her fate , is reproduced at length to confirm the adequacy of the hypothesis .

		It is a strange tale to bear the imprint of
Macmillan	PERSON	and the date of
1911	DATE	.

		Those for whom psychic research is a portentous and solemn matter will read it with a thrill .

		Those inclined to scoff will note that the vision occurred to two tired English tourists in the
afternoon	TIME	, before the restoration to normality which is the sovereign virtue of a cup of tea .

		The tolerant will be reminded of the deep philosophy of the tale of the Snark , which likewise has '' a flavor of the Will-o ' - the-Wisp . ''

		Research is a wonderful invention , as the Baconian-Shakespearians have demonstrated . ''

		They sought it with thimbles , they sought it with care ; They pursued it with forks and with hope , '' and they found what they sought .

		`` Do all that you know , and try all that you do n't '' But the dire possibility ever remains : '' Beware of the day , If your Snark be a Boojum !

		For then You will softly and suddenly vanish away And never be met with again . ''

Ludwig Lewisohn	PERSON	's work on `` German Style '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The book has but 184 pages ; in fact , its main fault is its brevity .

		That the first selection should be from Luther and the last from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	is logical enough , but it is regret - table that , besides these , only
Lessing	PERSON	and Goethe and
Heine	PERSON	should be represented .

		Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	analyzes prose style from the triple standpoint of structure , diction , and rhythm ; and he claims for his scheme the virtues of originality , simplicity , and inclusiveness .

		It is simple and inclusive , certainly , but it is original somewhat in the sense that Shake - speare is original , despite the efforts of
Brooke	PERSON	,
Greene	PERSON	, and Lodge ; for he formulates his scheme in the concluding paragraph of a brief discussion of the theory of Style , in which the names of De Quincey ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Hegel	LOCATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	, Helm - holtz ,
Lessing	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, Swift , and Thucydides loom large .

		He justifies his book on the ground that , from this point of view , English has been `` sedulously cultivated , '' while German has '' scarcely been touched . ''

		This statement is , in a sense , mere antithetic than accurate .

		From the days of Puttenham -LRB- 1589 -RRB- and
Opitz	PERSON	-LRB- 1624 -RRB- , the question has been one of difference in method .

		English style has been studied as an art ; German style has been investigated as a science .

		Such men as
Pater	LOCATION	,
Newman	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederic Har	PERSON	- rison , and Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, have been writing appreciative studies on the beauties of English style ; while even men like
Fassler	PERSON	,
Sievers	PERSON	,
Unser	LOCATION	,
Hein	PERSON	- zel ,
Meyer	PERSON	,
Petrich	PERSON	, and
Steinert	PERSON	, to say nothing of the many who have written statistical dissertations , have been analyzing and classifying the individual elements of German style .

		But such a treatment looks too much like algebra , and is repellent even to the advanced student .

		Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	has happily adopted the English method .

		He compares English and German again in his historical outline , showing that when the one was on the crest of the wave the other was in the trough of the sea .


Germany	LOCATION	, for example , was enjoying in the fourteenth century the subtle expressiveness of
Eckhart	LOCATION	, Tauler , and
Seuse	LOCATION	; while
England	LOCATION	had to be content with the formless `` Ayenbite of Inwyt '' and the diffuse
Mandeville	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , in the sixteenth century
England	LOCATION	was enjoying the limpid charm of
Sidney	PERSON	and
Hooker	PERSON	, while
Germany	LOCATION	was struggling along with '' Till Eulenspiegel '' and '' Die
Schild	PERSON	- btirger . ''

		The discussion is excellent , written in a 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, bright and clear style ; but to treat seven centuries of German prose in twelve pages necessitates a brevity that would have been questioned even by Larousse .

		The part of the notes on which too much stress can easily be laid is that pertaining to rhythm .

		If
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's prose is sometimes more rhythmical than
Lessing	PERSON	's verse , no revolutionary conclusion should be jumped at as a result of this apparent anomaly .

		Root-accent plays an enormous role in German .

		Some writers have a rhythmical mind , others have not .

		If we hear one German say , '' Wir wollen heute in die
Schule	PERSON	gehen , '' and another , '' Heute wollen wir zur
Schule	PERSON	gehen , '' we must not at once insist that the former is much given to speak - ing in iambics , while the latter runs to trochaics .

		It is not to be inferred that Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	has made too much of this point ; but he has compiled such an interesting list of examples of rhythmical prose that the enthusiastic student may try to carry it too far .

		Professor
Wilhelm Ostwald	PERSON	is every - ofa P * nUsf V where recognized as one of the great leaders in the scientific advance of the
last quarter-century	DATE	.

		Withdrawing some years ago from active work in the science -LRB- physical chemistfy -RRB- which he had in large part created , and in still larger part put upon a sound foundation , he has turned his energies into other and very differ - ent fields , notably philosophy and the fine arts .

		In philosophy .

		Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	's work has at - tracted wide attention , and on its own merits rather than because of his reputation as a scientist .

		The result of a small portion of his activity in this direc - tion is presented in '' Natural Philosophy '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , a book first published as Volume I. of Reclam 's '' Bticher der Naturwissenschaft , '' and now trans - lated by Mr.
Thomas Seltzer	PERSON	.

		The purpose of this volume is to discuss the philosophic basis and im - port of the natural sciences .

		The first part deals with a general theory of knowledge , and is followed by sections dealing severally with `` Logic , the Science of the Manifold and Mathematics , '' '' The Physical Sciences , '' and `` The Biologic Sciences . ''

		The treatment is very elementary , and the style has all the clearness and simplicity for which Pro- fessor
Ostwald	ORGANIZATION	's popular writings are famous .

		The work brings out little in matters of detail that is essentially new , though the point of view that puts the energy concept in so important , indeed com - manding , a place is original .

		For the beginner just entering upon the study of science the book will prove a stimulating and helpful introduction to the scientific method .

		For the general reader the most interesting part of the book will be the last , which deals with the higher relations of the biol - ogical sciences .

		It is not without significance that a scientist approaching the matter along the path of pure reason should reach the following conclu - sion : '' At present mankind is in a state of develop - ment in which progress depends much less upon the leadership of a few distinguished individuals than upon the collective labour of all workers ... We are living at a time when men are gradually approximating one another very closely in their natures , and when the social organization demands and strives for as thorough an equalization as pos - sible in the conditions of existence of all men . ''

		A banner year Dr '
Brumbaugh	PERSON	, editor of
Lippin	LOCATION	- in educational cott 's Educational Series , '' believes advance .

		that << the educational developments of the past year surpass in significance those of any preceding year . ''

		If this be conceded , a detailed account of what was accomplished in that year , such as is contained in Dr.
John Palmer Garber	PERSON	's `` Annals of Educational Progress in
1910	DATE	, '' which constitutes the eighth volume of the above-named series , should prove interesting reading and at the same time inspire sanguine hopes for the future of humanity .

		And , indeed , Dr.
Garber	PERSON	's book , which is a compact and remarkably comprehensive volume , more than fulfils expectation .

		Not only topically , but also geographically , does it survey the spacious domain of twentieth-century education at the end of its first f decade , making sufficiently clear what is the general trend of educational development , and devoting appropriate attention to the now engrossing subject of vocational training .

		Among miscellane - ous items of interest with which the book closes are to be found paragraphs on such general topics as postal savings banks , old age pensions , irrigation , Professor
Wallace	PERSON	's Shakespeare discoveries , forest fires , and '' the city beautiful . ''

		More space might well have been given to the comparatively new but very important subject of open-air schools ; how - ever , the reader can easily turn to Mr.
Leonard P. Ayres	PERSON	's excellent book of that title , published a year ago .

		In the chapter on foreign educational move - ments , a picture of Mexican progress and peaceful prosperity is given that fails to correspond exactly with present regrettable conditions .

		One can not but wish that Dr.
Garber	PERSON	's highly readable and scholarly work had avoided the harsh vulgarism of like in the sense of as .

		So slight a blemish , how - ever , weighs as nothing in the scale against the solid merits of the book , which performs a highly useful function not undertaken , so far as we know , by any rival publication .

		The history of the invention and per - fection of the piano has in it all the elements of a romance .

		In his book on '' The Pianoforte and Its Music , '' published as a final volume in the '' Music Lovers ' Library '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , this history is clearly and interestingly presented by Mr.
Henry Edward Krehbiel	PERSON	, to whom music in this country is already under many obliga - tions .

		He takes us back to the savage , who , bend - ing his ear to the twang of his bow , learned the secret of sound as the expression of emotion and thought .

		He takes us through the age-long process until the strings are set in a frame with a key-board ; then gradually from clavichord and virginal , from 1 e piano

		THE DIAL 357 spinet and harpsichord , the modern piano emerges into the light of day .

		Of all the musical instru - ments thus far discovered , the piano on the whole serves mankind the hest .

		It is a veritable epitome of music .

		Under the right manipulation it can sing like the violin or the human voice ; it can also reproduce the effects and harmonies of the orchestra .

		In many respects it is the instrument of instruments .

		The composers have adopted it for their very own , and have made it the repository of their deep insight and fine imagination .

		The organ has been a dan - gerous rival , and the orchestra with its individualiza - tion of parts has felt a decided superiority ; but the piano , after all , is an intimate friend , and ever re - sponds to the touch that appeals to it .

		Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	makes us acquainted with its comprehensive litera - ture ; he shows us how on its developing forms were played the folk songs and dances dear to learned and unlearned alike ; then how the great men
Bach	PERSON	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Brahms	PERSON	employed it as the means of setting forth their noble messages ; how
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	, and
Liszt	PERSON	drew from it a musi - cal investiture of the restless modern consciousness ; how
Grieg	PERSON	and Tschaikowky made it the mouth - piece of hopes and ideas distinctively national ; how Debussy and his fellow impressionists produced from it their new and surprising effects .

		The musical reader will find this book both entertaining and valuable .

		A great English The beautifully printed monograph statesman and on
John Bright	PERSON	, from the pen of reformer .

		^ Ir R
Barry O'Brien	PERSON	, is not a formal biography of this great champion of the peoples ' interests .

		It is instead a series of chap - ters , most of them rather brief , on Bright 's connec - tion with the great movements of his time , to which his active and militant energies were freely given .

		Among these movements were the abolition of the Corn Laws , in which Bright and Peel were so in - timately associated ; Irish reforms -LRB- though Bright opposed Home Rule -RRB- ; the Crimean War , which he bitterly opposed ; and
Parliamentary Reform	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is also a chapter on the American Civil War as it appeared to the British , showing Bright as one of the few prominent Englishmen who saw the real meaning of the war .

		The personal traits and characteristics of this sturdy fighter are bound to interest the reader .

		He was a man of fine spirit , charming in his home and among his friends , yet really solitary in his inner life .

		He was outspoken to the point of rudeness in social life as well as in his speeches ; yet offense was rarely taken , for his sincerity and severe simplicity were everywhere recognized .

		His great oratorical power is unsur - passed in the whole course of British eloquence , if indeed it has ever been equalled .

		A fearless fighter with a passion for justice and this great gift of eloquence could not fail to play a great part in the history of his time .

		A preface by Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, taking the form of an appreciation , two fine portraits , and some facsimile letters , add to the interest of the volume .

		An educational The P r blem for solution that Pro- remedv for fessor
Melville M. Bigelow	PERSON	, Dean governmental ills .

		o f the
Boston University Law School	ORGANIZATION	, presents in `` A False Equation '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- can best be indicated in his own words , taken from the body of his book .

		`` The fundamental question is , how to uproot the habit of a people and plant another in its place .

		Can the False Equation be set aside for another which shall truly express the aim of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and give equilibrium to the insecure arch ?

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is in a strait betwixt two difficulties .

		On the one hand is privilege in the form of monopoly , moving forward at a rate which exceeds the movement of
the State	ORGANIZATION	to keep it under control ; on the other are the disintegrating forces moving at a similar rate and tending more and more to weaken public authority .

		What is to be done to enable the
State	ORGANIZATION	to control the hostile forces and make good the Great Trust it has assumed ? ''

		The book 's sub-title , `` The Problem of the Great Trust , '' will now have been explained to the reader of the foregoing .

		To meet the demands of the critical situation , says the author , '' men must be produced , '' by improved methods of education . ''

		The current idea ... is that the object of education is simply to furnish the mind ; fashioning the brain has no meaning or but the vaguest .

		It has yet to be learned that fashioning the brain is more important than providing it with furniture , however useful the latter . ''

		This is not quite fair and just to modern pedagogy , which has learned that cramming is not educating , and that the perfecting of the mental machine is of prime importance .

		Nevertheless , Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's book is timely and valuable , and will have amply justified itself to the world if it prompts others to attempt a more detailed solution of the problem stated than can be expected from a single thinker within the limits of one small volume .

		A
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	days after his graduation from graduate 's year
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Joseph Husband	PERSON	en - in a coal-mine , tered the business of coal-mining at the very bottom four hundred feet below the sur - face of the earth .

		His record of twelve months ' eventful and , at the last , extremely perilous experi - ence is told in a small volume entitled '' A Year in a Coal-Mine '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The mine was in
Illi	PERSON	- nois , the miners were of twenty or thirty different nationalities , the incidents of the year were varied and sometimes thrilling , and came to a close in a grand conflagration of the subterranean passages and chambers of bituminous fuel , which at last necessitated the sealing and abandonment of the mine .

		Rescue work and fire-fighting constituted a large part of the author 's strenuous labors in the latter months of this arduous apprenticeship , and one reads between the lines that Mr.
Husband	PERSON	showed himself a good deal of a hero , in a quiet and unobtrusive way , when disaster and sudden death swooped down upon the scene of his toil .

		The habits and superstitions of the miner , and 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, many of the mysteries of mining itself , as conducted in the soft-coal districts of the middle West , are graphically revealed in the straightforward fashion of one who has something to say and is bent on getting it said with no waste of words .

		A portrait of the author , in mining costume and grimy with toil , faces the title-page .

		Mind cure Dr -
George B. Cutten	PERSON	, author of through '' The Psychological Phenomena of the ages .

		Christianity '' and '' The Psychology of Alchoholism , '' has extended his studies in applied psychology by a survey of '' Three Thousand Years of Mental Healing '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is a book written for those who run as they read .

		Yet such personally - conducted tours through famous and interesting regions of thought and practice perform a service for the labor-and-thought-saving tourist .

		In early faith-cures , the religious element dominated , as it dominated again when the realm of the intellectual endeavor was Christianized in dogma , while yet awaiting a spiritualization of outlook and , later , the practical poise of scientific insight .

		The traditional survivals and revivals of the old amid the new ap - pear in the world-wide forms of the use of relics , amulets , charms , and systematized practices , the account of which in various lands and times con - tribute much of the material to the survey ; as do in equal measure the records of the methods and triumphs of healers , from the saints to those of the present day .

		The more detailed perspective natur - ally falls to recent periods and procedures .

		Dr.
Cutten	PERSON	's survey is creditable in its adaptation to the popular interests of miscellaneous readers .

		It has no claim to a more critical approval .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		There can not be too many children 's books of the type illustrated by Mr.
Francis Storr	PERSON	's '' Half a Hun - dred Hero Tales of Ulysses and the Men of Old '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Despite the best efforts of educators , our children are growing up in amazing ignorance of the great world-stories , mainly for the reason that the school is left to do the work proper to the home .

		The present volume is of English origin , and the work of various modern hands , with a savor of distinction im - parted by the inclusion of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's immortal ver - sions of the classical legends .

		Messrs.
Elias C. Hills	PERSON	and
Silvano G. Morley	PERSON	have collected into a volume published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, ''

		There are poems from
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Colombia	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, and
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		It is a Nicaraguan poet ,
Don Rube 'n Dario	PERSON	, who pays his respects to Mr.

		Dr.
Monroe N. Wetmore	PERSON	's '' Index Verborum
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	- ianus '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of those works of scholarship combined with painstaking industry which we trust are suitably rewarded in heaven , knowing well that they will not be on earth .

		Eight years have gone to its making .

		The author originally planned a still larger '' Lexicon Vergilianum , '' and the work was far advanced when he found the ground cut from under his feet by a German -LRB- whose name we will not advertise -RRB- , whose code of scholarly ethics seems to have varied somewhat widely from the standard usually set for scholars who are at the same time honorable gentlemen .

		Professor
William Allan Neilson	PERSON	has met a great need in college courses , as well as rendered a service to the general reader , by bringing together in convenient form the principal plays of '' The Chief Elizabethan Dramatists '' exclusive of Shakespeare .

		This with Dr.
Neilson	PERSON	's edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, published by the same firm -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will furnish a text sufficient for a good knowledge of the greatest period of our dramatic literature .

		The critical material consists of foot-notes explaining unusual words , of short additional notes on the plays , and of brief bibliographies .

		The additional notes touch upon dates , editions , sources , and the most notable characteristics of the plays .

		They are models of conciseness .

		A group of recent text-books in the sciences gives us '' Elements of Geology , '' by Professors Eliot Black - welder and

American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have a revised edition of the '' Elements of Zoology , '' by Dr.

Gertrude C. Davenport	PERSON	, an elementary work whose usefulness has borne the test of ten years or so .

		From the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have an '' Industrial and Commercial Geography , '' the work of Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	.

		We do not like to see foreign classics abridged , even for the purpose of making them available as language texts in school and college .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		evidently are not of this opinion , for they have just published abridgments of three important French books , '' Les Travailleurs de la Mer , '' edited by Professor
E. F. Langley	PERSON	; '' Les
Trois Mousquetaires	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
I. H. B. Spiers	PERSON	; and '' Tartarin de Tarascon , '' edited by Mr.
Richmond L. Hawkins	PERSON	.

		It is not exactly the same treatment that they have applied to an Italian classic '' I
Promessi Sposi	PERSON	, '' for in this case we are given the first eight chapters nearly complete , upon the theory that they constitute a story by themselves .

J. M. Barrie	PERSON	may be expected in the
Autumn	DATE	.

		It is now nearly ten years since Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	definitely turned aside from the making of books to the making of plays .

		Some time ago a rumor was afloat that Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	was thinking of telling the world what happened when

May 1	DATE	, drafts of his sketches and novels , but which was subse - quently stricken out either because it could not pass the press censorship , because it was thought by the
Countess Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	to be objectionable , or because it did not meet the approval of the magazine editors to whom it was originally submitted .

		The dramas are entitled , '' A Learned Woman '' and '' A Living Corpse . ''

		The latter is to be put on the stage of the Fine Arts Theatre in
Moscow	LOCATION	next

		The
Society of College Teachers of Education	ORGANIZATION	has entered into an agreement with the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago Press whereby the editorial management of '' The School Review '' will henceforth be under the control of an
Editorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	elected by the Society .

		This
Editorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	consists of Professors
M. V. O'Shea	PERSON	,
E. O. Holland	PERSON	,
William C. Bagley	PERSON	,
Frederick E. Bolton	PERSON	, and
Paul H. Hanus	PERSON	.

		To this
Editorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	representing the

Willard C. Gore	PERSON	,
Frank N. Freeman	PERSON	, and
Franklin W. Johnson	PERSON	, all of the faculty of the
School of Education of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Gore has been elected by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	managing editor of the Review .

		As a result of this agreement , '' The School Review '' will become the organ of the
Society of College Teachers of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is planned to make it of service to all who are concerned in any way with secondary edu - cation in this country .

		It has been decided also to publish in connection with the Review a series of sup - plementary monographs dealing in a detailed scientific way with problems of secondary education .

		Industrial training has come to be regarded as one of the most important features in the education of adolescent youth , in school and out ; and an urgent problem with parents to-day is how to present the in - dustrial occupations to the child in a way to attract and interest him , and to utilize his self-activity by directive rather than by coercive measures , so that the work will hold the free joyousness of play .

		It is in the effort to solve this problem that '' The Children 's Library of Work and Play '' has been planned by Messrs. Double - day ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The library , which has been four years in preparation , is complete in ten volumes , fully illustrated , embracing Carpentry and
Woodwork	LOCATION	, Me - chanics Indoor and Out , Metal Work ,
Housekeeping	ORGANIZATION	,
Needlecraft	LOCATION	,
Household Decoration	ORGANIZATION	, Gardening and Farming , Outdoor Sports and Games , Electricity for Everyday Uses , and Outdoor Work .

		The authors , who are special workers in their respective fields , have when - ever possible arranged the material in narrative form , telling of the many useful things done by boys and girls who are characters in the story and explaining in a practical way and in clear detail how they have done them .

		The aim has been to engage the interest of the youthful reader first in the story , and through that to lead him unconsciously to an understanding of the funda - mental principles involved in the various activities .

		As a guide to the many useful things a child can do and as a stimulus to interest in life activities the books will be welcome to parents who are seeking the right method by which to meet the child ?

		s play need and his desire to investigate , and to gratify his creative faculty in a way that shall insure precision and its resultant rectitude of character .

		Some three hundred titles , representing the output of twenty-five publishers , are included .

		It is believed that this list , constituting as it does a classified sum - mary of the educational publications of the entire

May 16	DATE	, THE SPECIAL RATES OF SUBSCRIPTION will be Withdrawn on MAY 31st and the prices charged for the I will then be advanced by not less than
$ 10.00	MONEY	\ N announcing , last
November	DATE	, the forthcoming issue of a new edition -LRB- the eleventh -RRB- of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	invited applications , in advance of publication , at specially low prices .

		The 28 Volumes of Text Are Now Published The new edition had been prepared greatly to its advantage as one consistent whole , and its publication , also , was to be as nearly simultaneous as possible .

		That some delays should have occurred in the printing and binding of the largest book that has ever been in the press at one time was , perhaps , inevitable .

		Nevertheless , in
England	LOCATION	, during
March	DATE	, the entire 28 volumes of text were in course of delivery to early subscribers .

		There lacked only the Index -LRB- Volume 29 -RRB- to make publication complete , and to justify the withdrawal of the special terms upon which applica - tions were to be accepted while the work was still in course of production .

		The Date MAY 31st 1 While , on the one hand , it is impossible at this stage to fix an exact date for the issue of the Index , it is , on the other hand , proper that the thousands of people , all over the world , who are acquainted with the favorable terms of the offer made in advance of publication , should be advised in time of a precise date for its withdrawal .

		By
May	DATE	3ist the publishers must know the total number of copies required to fill orders at the lowest price .

		Applications posted up to that day will be accepted by the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	at the special prices noted on the next page .

		Applications posted after that day will be accepted only at an advance of at least
$ 10.00	MONEY	.

		Economy of Production Attained by Manufacture upon a Large Scale and upon a Known Basis The reason for offering special prices at all to prompt subscribers is a purely material one , and the whole situation is governed by considerations of manufacture .

		In the early stages , it was necessary to discover at once the proportions in which copies were to be printed on
India	LOCATION	paper and on ordinary paper .

		To ensure economy in the purchase of skins , and in the business of binding , it was necessary to obtain a trustworthy estimate of the quantities required of the different styles of binding .

		The answer to these initial questions were supplied at a comparatively early date .

		Of the applications received , 90 per cent have been for the
India	LOCATION	paper impression , and , of these , nearly 80 per cent have specified either Full Sheepskin or Full
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		On this assured basis , the tentative orders previously given to paper makers , tanners , and printers were readjusted and greatly increased , owing to the large number of applications received .

		Thus the economies essential to the sale of the book at a low price were secured .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 371 The Advantage to the Subscriber In the disposal of any commodity , applications for thirty or forty thousand in the course of six months must be more advantageous than sales amounting to the same total in the course of four or five years , and of this advantage the purchaser of the new
Encyclopaedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	secures the benefit by subscribing before
May	DATE	3ist .

		There is , indeed , no industry in which the economy of manufacturing upon a large scale is more evident than it is * in the printing of a book , and manu - facturing upon a large scale means , in this case , not only the printing of a large number of sheets , but also the printing of this large number in one run .

		All whose applications are posted before
May	DATE	3ist are entitled to the lowest price , because their orders , being received while the whole machinery of production is still in motion , will be executed as part of an unbroken series of operations .

		A Very Cheap Book At the Present Price At the present rate of purchase ,
$ 4.00	MONEY	a volume of a million and a half words -LRB-
$ 4.25	MONEY	a volume on
India	LOCATION	paper -RRB- , the new Encyclopaedia Britannica is extraordinarily cheap .

		A volume contains between seven and eight times as much matter as does the ordinary biography or book of travels sold at
$ 5.00	MONEY	.

		The accepted scale of book prices , however , does not afford a satisfactory comparison , and the only true criterion in the matter is the price of the 9th edition .

		This was sold at
$ 7.50	MONEY	a volume , although each volume contained 100 pages less than do those of the new edition , which may now be purchased -LRB- in the same style -RRB- at little more than half that price ,
viz.	LOCATION	,
$ 4.00	MONEY	.

		To the former figure , however , of
$ 7.50	MONEY	-LRB- which may be regarded as the normal , the standard , charge -RRB- the price of the new edition will eventually be raised .

		An Immediate Payment of Only
$ 5.00	MONEY	The book is now , therefore , at its cheapest , and the present low price may the more easily be afforded owing to the institution of serial payments .


$ 5.00	MONEY	is the immediate outlay that is required to obtain delivery of the 29 volumes , and , after they have been received , purchase may be com - pleted in monthly payments of the same small amount .

		Should the subscriber find that it better suits his convenience to complete purchase in a shorter time , he may do so by making 4 , 8 , or 12 monthly payments , in this case paying only a fraction more than the cash price .

		Deferred Payment Subscribers who for one reason or another may prefer to take delivery of their books next fall or at the end of the year may do so , and their payments need not begin until delivery has been made .

		It is advisable , however , in their case , that their application shall be registered during the present month ; that is , before the closing of the period for making application at the lowest prices .

		Illustrated Prospectus -LRB- 40 pages -RRB- , 56 specimen pages on
India	LOCATION	paper , 4 specimen plates , a new pamphlet containing letters of appreciation from 177 American subscribers , and form of application showing the special advance terms , will be sent upon receipt of request .

THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON	PERSON	.

		A life of eighty-seven rich years of service the kind of service that goes hand in hand with ripe scholarship and liberal culture was ended on the ninth of this month , when Colonel Hig - ginson died at his home in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Fit - tingly , in commemoration of one of the most distinctive aspects of his activity in behalf of human welfare , his body was borne three days later into his old parish church by six members of the race that he had chosen to lead in the Civil War , and whose cause he had championed from the early years of the abolition movement .

		Just such a life as that which he led , and which fate so happily prolonged , will hardly be pos - sible for any future American , so completely have the conditions which moulded it passed away from our national life .

		The
New England	LOCATION	culture of which
Higginson	PERSON	was the fine flower is a thing now to be studied in old memoirs rather than by direct observation ; its noble tradition of plain living and high thinking is now hardly to be found anywhere .

		Where , for example , shall we look for families whose parents read to their children the whole series of the '' Waverley '' novels , or in which boys are made ready to enter
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	at the age of thirteen ?

		Higginson could boast of both these things , and of many others of like import ; it is by reading of them that we come to understand what manner of man he came to be .

		Those early days , and the many that came after , were days of serious and unremitting application to worthy tasks , but they do not give us the impression of a child parted from his birthright of natural and wholesome growth .

		In the retrospect , they appeared to
Higginson	PERSON	himself as '' Cheerful Yesterdays , '' and it is clear that he never thought that he would have preferred them to be other than they were .

		Their cheer was anything but that of careless - ness or indolence ; it sprang from the conscious - ness of duties performed and high aims realized .

		Those yesterdays were strenuous as well as cheerful , as we may read in the record of his militant abolitionism in the pulpit , his active participation in the rescue of fugitive slaves and the conquest of
Kansas	LOCATION	for freedom , and his leadership of a `` black regiment '' when the 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, gage of open battle was cast .

		The war over and its purposes accomplished the
Union	ORGANIZATION	preserved and slavery ended , he transferred to the arena of civil life all the ardor and energy that he had put to more active uses , and fought for many good causes with tongue and pen no less valiantly than he had been fighting with less spiritual weapons .

		And the light that ever guided him was that which was apostrophized in his own lines `` To Duty '' : '' Light of dim mornings ; shield from heat and cold ; Balm for all ailments ; substitute for praise ; Comrade of those who plod in lonely ways -LRB- Ways that wax lonelier as the years wax old -RRB- ; Tonic for fears ; check to the over-bold ; Nurse , whose calm hand its strong restriction lays ; Kind , but resistless , on our wayward days ; Mart , whose high wisdom at vast price is sold . ''

		`` Can it be , '' he says to the ideal thus variously symbolized , `` thine other name is Heaven ? ''

		The affirmative answer to the question is im - plicit in every page that he wrote .

		Not many years ago ,
Higginson	PERSON	wrote as fol - lows of his desires for his fellow-countrymen : '' Personally , I should like to live to see interna - tional arbitration secured , civil-service reform com - pleted , free trade established ; to find the legal and educational rights of the two sexes equalized ; to know that all cities are as honestly governed as that in which I dwell ; to see natural monoplies owned by the public , not in private hands ; to see drunkenness extirpated ; to live under absolute as well as nominal religious free - dom ; to perceive American literature to be thoroughly emancipated from that habit of colonial deference which still hampers it .

		Yet it is something to believe it possible that , after the progress already made on the whole in these several directions , some future genera - tion may see the fulfilment of what remains . ''

		This statement offers an epitome of the in - terests of his later life , although it is far from exhaustive , and makes no mention , for example , of his vehement protest against the wanton and wicked policy of imperialism into which our nation was plunged a dozen years ago , to the grief and indignation of all who held fast to the political ideals which had hitherto been their pride .

		He who had been a fighter against slavery on our own soil could not take any other stand than that of a resolute opponent of such human oppression abroad as that which still weighs in - tolerably upon the conscience of all Americans of the old-fashioned intellectual build .

		Some of his ideals are still far from accomplishment , but we can take comfort in knowing that prog - ress has been made along most of the lines specified , and in the thought that an existence which offered no causes worth fighting for would be an insipid and colorless affair .

		The story of
Higginson	PERSON	's life may be read with much amplitude of detail in his many books .

		His ancestry was uncompromisingly puritan , and his education began many genera - tions before he was born .

		He was less than eighteen when he was graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1841	DATE	, and only twenty - three when he left the
Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	in
1847	DATE	.

		His first pastorate was in the Unitarian church of
Newburyport	LOCATION	, where he preached Garrisonianism to the disgust of such of his parishioners as
Francis Todd	PERSON	and
Caleb Gushing	PERSON	.

		In
1852	DATE	he organized a free church at
Worcester	LOCATION	, remaining in charge for six years .

		His active service in the army was during the years 186264 , when he resigned for disability , and took up his residence at New - port .

		In
1878	DATE	, he removed to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where he passed the remainder of his years , except for his lecture journeys and his visits to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He was twice married , and his second wife survives him , together with one daughter .

		Higginson 's place in American literature is high and altogether honorable . ''

		My literary life , such as it has been , '' he modestly says , '' affords no lesson greatly worth recording , unless it be the facility with which a taste for books be transmitted and accumulated from one generation to another , and then developed into a lifelong pursuit by a literary environ - ment . ''

		This is not exactly an adequate state - ment in which to sum up the productivity of a writer whose published volumes number be - tween thirty and forty , and who must be reckoned as one of the half dozen leading essay - ists of American literature .

		One novel , several collections of poems , and numerous biographies and histories , are included in the list , besides the dozen or more volumes of essays in the form of comment and reminiscence .

		So grace - ful and polished a writer in this kind is now hardly left to us , or one so stimulating , so rich in suggestiveness , or so inspired by the highest ideals of thought and conduct .

		With
Higgin	PERSON	- son 's death , the chapter of our older
New England	LOCATION	literature is indeed closed .

		We may no longer look to the neighborhood of
Boston	LOCATION	for our literary veterans , but must turn rather to
New York	LOCATION	, where Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	is living at an unaccountable age , and Mr.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	still ripens in wisdom ; or to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	has safely rounded the eighties , and Dr.
Horace H. Furness	PERSON	is fast nearing them .

		Such geographical shif tings of interest are not the least important features in the history of any literature .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 A FAMOUS POEM AND ITS AUTHOR .

		In the well-known anthology of '' Famous Single and Fugitive Poems , '' edited by Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	, 1880 -RRB- , appear these familiar lines : A HUNDRED YEARS TO COME . ''

		Oh , where will be the birds that sing , A hundred years to come ?

		The flowers that now in beauty
spring	DATE	, A hundred years to come ?

		The rosy lip , the lofty brow , The heart that beats so gayly now , Oh , where will be love 's beaming eye , Joy 's pleasant smile and sorrow 's sigh , A hundred years to come ? ''

		Who '11 press for gold this crowded street , A hundred years to come ?

		Who 11 tread yon church with willing feet , A hundred years to come ?

		Pale , trembling age , and fiery youth , And childhood with its brow of truth , The rich and poor , on land and sea , Where will the mighty millions be , A hundred years to come ? ''

		We all within our graves shall sleep , A hundred years to come ; No living soul for us shall weep , A hundred years to come ; But other men our lands shall till , ' And others then our streets shall fill , While other birds shall sing as gay , As bright the sunshine as to-day , A hundred years to come . ''

		As has happened with many another famous fugitive poem , the authorship of this one has been made a matter of dispute .

		It has been '' cribbed '' unconscionably , and has appeared in print under a wildly assorted variety of names , from that of its real author to that of
C. F. Browne	PERSON	-LRB- `` Artemus Ward '' the humorist ! -RRB-

		.

		In Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's anthology the poem is credited to
William Goldsmith Brown	PERSON	; and with this for a starting-point an attempt is now made to search out the history of the poem and establish the facts of its origin .

		A note to the poem , in the volume referred to , says that it was '' published originally in ' The Mother 's Journal , '
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. ''

		A search in the
Periodical Division of the Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has resulted in the dis - covery of the poem in the '' Mother 's Journal and Family Visitant '' for
November , 1848	DATE	-LRB- Vol .

		13 , No. 11 , p. 332 -RRB- , where , as afterwards in Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's anthology , it was attributed to
William Goldsmith Brown	PERSON	.

		This establishes an early date of its publication , but probably not the earliest ; as it is believed to have appeared previously in a news - paper at
Brandon	LOCATION	,
Vt.	LOCATION	, with which Mr.
Brown	PERSON	was connected and in which many of his poems were first published .

		A manuscript copy of the poem , in his handwriting , is still preserved , dated by him
1839	DATE	.

		It would seem strange that a poem which has been a popular favorite for more than half a cen - tury , whose authorship was established by publica - tion sixty years ago and confirmed repeatedly in standard anthologies and books of various kinds , including the Biographical Record of the
Kappa Alpha Society	ORGANIZATION	of its author 's college -LRB-
Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , should now have its authorship questioned .

		But it is questioned , and in a way that can not be ignored .

		A volume entitled `` The Fugitives , a Sheaf of Verses , by
H. L. Spencer	PERSON	'' -LRB- St
John	PERSON	,
N. B.	PERSON	,
1909	DATE	-RRB- has been published , in which , in large and assertive print , we find , as the opening poem , '' A Hundred Years to Come . ''

		A few pages of biography , by
A. M. Belding	PERSON	, give some details of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's life , in which we are informed that `` there has even been a dispute as to the authorship of his most famous poem , ' A Hundred Years to Come , ' whose pathos and haunting melody have made it one of the immortals in the realms of American verse . ''

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	was born in
1829	DATE	; and in
1848	DATE	the year when this poem was published under Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's name in the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	magazine he was a bookseller 's clerk in
Rutland	LOCATION	, Vt , not far from where Mr.
Brown	PERSON	then lived .

		The production of such a poem by a youth of nineteen would have been indeed remarkable .

		We understand Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	is still living ; and while we would not willingly disturb the repose and feebleness of his advanced age by a controversy which must needs involve a question of personal integrity , yet the issue is one which he himself has raised , and the examination of it becomes unavoidable .

		We shall give only an outline of the known facts in the ease .

		Over fifty years ago there was published a very interesting anthology , known to all literary Ver - monters , called '' Poets and Poetry of
Vermont	LOCATION	, '' compiled by
Abby Maria Hemenway	PERSON	-LRB-
Rutland	LOCATION	, 1858 -RRB- .

		In this book ,
William Goldsmith Brown	PERSON	is represented by four poems , one of which , entitled ''
Vermont	LOCATION	, '' is the opening piece of the volume , and another is '' A Hundred Years to Come . ''

		In the same volume Mr.
H. L. Spencer	PERSON	is represented by a single piece , which is called ''
Rosa Bell	PERSON	. ''

		If Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	was , as he now claims , the author of `` A Hundred Years to Come , '' it seems strange that he should not have been represented by that poem in this anthology , instead of by a greatly inferior piece , while the poem which he now claims as his was allowed to appear in the same volume under the name of a different author apparently with no protest from him ; as a '' Revised Edition '' of the book appeared a few years later , in
Boston	LOCATION	, with no change in the authorship of this poem .

		And if his claim is true , what , it may be asked , would the astute and vigilant Miss
Hemenway	PERSON	have been doing while such a literary fraud was perpetrated under her editorial nose ?

		With ample opportunity for knowing all the facts , she evidently had confidence in Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, as her preface gives him special mention for his aid in the preparation of her collection .

		Miss
Hemenway	PERSON	's volume incidentally furnishes the key to further and more important evidence .

		In a biographical note on Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	, she men - tions that he '' published a small volume of poems 878 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, in
Rutland	LOCATION	in
1850	DATE	. ''

		This volume has been dis - covered in the
Harris Collection of Brown Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Library in which , if anywhere , obscure books of American verse may be found ; and an examina - tion of it -LRB- Poems by
Hiram Ladd Spencer	PERSON	,
Rutland	LOCATION	,
1850	DATE	-RRB- shows that it does not contain `` A Hundred Years to Come , '' which Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	now claims to have written
several years earlier	DATE	, but that it does contain the following : THE YEARS . ''

		Oh , where will be the birds that sing , When a hundred years are flown ?

		The sweet flowers that are blossoming , When a hundred years are gone ?

		The happy child , The spirit wild , The silvery tone Of some loved one , Oh , where will be the spirit free And the smiles of love that now we see , When a hundred years are gone ? ''

		And who will know where we have dwelt , When a hundred years have flown ?

		What thrill of grief and joy we 've felt , When a hundred years are gone ?

		Our smiles and tears , Our hopes and fears , Our hours of grief , Of pleasure brief ; Oh , who will note our smiles and tears , Our joys and griefs , our hopes and fears , When a hundred years are flown ? ''

		Our graves will all forgotten be When a hundred years are flown ; No one will think of you or me , When a hundred years are gone ; And our bright dreams , Like
summer	DATE	beams , Will all decay And pass away ; And this gay world will busy be , And give no thought to you or me , When a hundred years are flown . ''

		There is little that need be said after reading these lines .

		The question of the authorship of '' A Hundred Years to Come '' remains where it was before Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	made his unfortunate appear - ance as a claimant .

		The derivation of his piece published two years after Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's had appeared in print is obvious to anyone who will take the trouble to compare the two .

		How they became con - fused in the mind of the author of the later one whether by some trick of a sportive and giddy muse , a gradual obsession of the mental faculties with con - fusion of optical and ethical perceptions , a mix-up in the functions of absorption and reconstruction , so that from taking one poem as the model for another he came by degrees to fancy he had written both , or was unable to tell just which one he did write , these are matters we are not especially concerned with here .

		The essential thing is to have settled a question as to the authorship of an admired poem long a favorite and likely long to remain a favorite with lovers of simple and genuine poetry .


William Goldsmith Brown	PERSON	, the author of this poem , was born in
Whitingham	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, in
1812	DATE	, was educated at
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, and spent many of his mature years as a teacher and an editor in his native State and in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		He began writ - ing verse at an early age , and kept it up through life .

		Hundreds of his poems have been printed in newspapers and periodicals , and some of them like '' A Hundred Years to Come '' and '' Mother , Home , and Heaven '' have been set to music , and have found , as song or poem , a warm place in the people 's heart .

		The one last named , though long familiar , may be given space here .

		MOTHER , HOME , AND HEAVEN . ''

		Three words fall sweetly on my soul , As music from an angel 's lyre , That bid my spirit spurn control , And upward to its source aspire ; The sweetest sounds to mortals given Are heard in Mother , Home , and Heaven . ''

		Dear Mother !

		ne'er shall I forget Thy brow , thine eye , thy pleasant smile ; Though in the sea of death hath set Thy star of life , my guide awhile , Oh , never shall thy form depart From the bright pictures in my heart . ''

		And like a bird that from the flowers Wing-weary seeks her wonted nest , My spirit , e ` en in manhood 's hours , Turns back in childhood 's Home to rest ; The cottage , garden , hill , and stream , Still linger like a pleasant dream . ''

		And while to one engulfing grave By
Time	ORGANIZATION	's swift tide we 're driven , How sweet the thought that every wave But bears us nearer Heaven !

		There we shall meet , when life is o'er , In that blest Home , to part no more . ''

		Reference has been made in this article to Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's opening poem in the '' Poets and Poetry of
Vermont	LOCATION	, '' in which he pays sincere and eloquent tribute to his native State .

		This stirring piece , written and published more than sixty years ago , may be said to be the accepted
State	ORGANIZATION	poem of
Vermont	LOCATION	; and few States can lay claim to a better one .

		It is so fine in spirit and so strong in expres - sion that it seems well worth giving here as illus - trating another phase of its author 's poetic powers .

		VERMONT . ''

		Land of the river and the rock , Of lofty hill and lowly glen , Live thunderbolts thy mountains mock ; Well hast thou nursed by tempests ' shock Thy race of iron men . ''

		Far from the city 's crowded mart , From Fashion 's shrine and Mammon 's show , With beaming eye and loving heart In cottage homes they dwell apart , Free as the winds that blow . ''

		Of all the sister States that make This mighty Union broad and strong ,
From Southern	ORGANIZATION	gulf to Northern lake , There 's none that
Autumn	DATE	days awake To sweeter harvest song . ''

		And when the cold winds round them blow , Father , and son , and aged sire ,

		THE DIAL 379 Defiant of the drifting snow , With hearts and hearths alike aglow , Laugh round their wintry fire . ''

		When Freedom from her home was driven , Mid vine-clad vales of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, She sought the glorious Alps of heaven , And there , mid cliffs by lightnings riven , Gathered her hero band . ''

		And still outrings her freedom-song , Amid the glaciers sparkling there , At Sabbath bell , as peasants throng Their mountain fastnesses along , Happy , and free as air .

		`` And if , through Southern power and pride , This broad , free land , in future time Shall hear the slave-roll by the side Of
Bunker	ORGANIZATION	's shaft , that marks where died Her sons in strife sublime , '' Lo !

		as the bugle echo thrills ,
New England	LOCATION	's sons shall rally then , And build their homes by mountain rills , Far up among her wild green hills , And sing free songs again . ''

		The hills were made for freedom : they Break at a breath the tyrant 's rod ; Chains clank in valleys , there the prey Writhes ` neath Oppression 's heel alway : Hills bow to none but God ! ''

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's power of verse-writing was remark - ably preserved to an advanced age .

		His birthdays were the occasions of his writing special poems , which showed a clearness of thought , a tenderness of sentiment , and a felicity of expression , that called out surprise and admiration from those who read them .

		One such poem , written when he was past ninety -LRB- he died in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, in
1906	DATE	, at the age of ninety-four -RRB- contains a passage which may be quoted as indicating his poetic gifts , his tender and sympathetic nature , and his gentle and helpful life . ''

		If I have put one wounded bird Back in its little nest .

		If I have spoken one kindly word To give some sad heart rest , If I have made one tear-drop less , Or soothed one pang of pain , If one is left my name to bless , I have not lived in vain . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE TEST OF A GOOD BOOK FOR CHILDREN must have been long and eagerly and more or less un - successfully sought by many a children 's librarian .

		The supreme test adopted by the juvenile depart - ment of the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and rather well formulated in the preface to a carefully pre - pared and very useful list of '' Books for Boys and Girls '' just issued by the Library , is described as follows : '' The first test we apply to any book for children is that of moral tone .

		By this we do not mean the story of the drunkard-reforming child saint of Sunday-School library books so edifyingly contrasted with the naughty boy who goes fishing on the Sabbath and comes to a bad end ; nor the golden-curled , lace-collared , polite little prig who adorns the pages of scores of ' little child shall lead them ' stories of the present .

		Not pages slashed with cutlasses reeking with gore , not hairbreadth escapes aad feats of superhuman daring does the children 's librarian condemn , but heroes pre-eminent in lying and trickery , in smartness and swagger , in the loafer 's reliance upon luck ; books which subtly teach a lad to measure a man 's value and success by his money-making ability .

		If a book arouses in a child admiration for courage , honor , endurance , manliness or womanliness , faith - fulness , pluck , gentleness , then it is a moral book , whether it be a story of pirates , as '
Treasure Island	LOCATION	, ' of a schoolboy , as '
Tom Brown	PERSON	's School Days , ' of a mythical hero , as ' The Story of
Sieg	ORGANIZATION	- fried , '' of a hero of song , as ' Horatius , ' or a girls ' home story , as ` Little Women . ' ''

		After all , the best and surest touchstone is a small reader himself or herself ; but unfortunately this is a test not always practically applicable in the buying of new books for the juvenile department .

		THE MATHEMATICAL MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN GREATNESS , like the repeatedly attempted statistical evaluation of literature , has its fascinations for those who fondly imagine that spiritual realities can be weighed and measured , analyzed and dissected , and then labeled with a formula exactly expressing their nature and their comparative worth .

		In a late number of '' Science , '' Dr.
Frederick Adams Woods	PERSON	of the
Mass.	LOCATION	.


Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	discourses at some length on '' Historiometry as an Exact Sci - ence , '' including under historiometry ' '' that class of researches in which the facts of history have been subjected to statistical treatment according to some method of measurement more or less objective or impersonal in its nature . ''

		In his application of his method to biography , and , specifically , to a testing of the familiar assertion that
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has produced more eminent men in proportion to her white population than any other
State of the Union	LOCATION	, Dr.
Woods	PERSON	displays skill and patient research .

		But , after all , however earnest the endeavor to attain the purely objective , and to exclude all subjective sug - gestion in this estimate of men .

		the result is merely a shifting of ultimate responsibility on to others ' shoulders .

		The statistical use of biographical dic - tionaries and of handbooks like '' Who 's Who '' can never succeed in eliminating the element of prejudice or fallibility ; for the compilers of all such reference books are themselves human beings and liable to personal bias .

		Nevertheless some approach to dis - passionateness of judgment may doubtless be made by this averaging of many opinions .

		All this recalls , incidentally , an ingenious treatise from the pen of Dr.
Frederic Lyman Wells	PERSON	, published two years ago by the
Science Press	ORGANIZATION	as number seven in its series known as '' Archives of Psychology . ''

		The paper was entitled '' A Statistical Study of Literary 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Merit , '' and was a minute investigation and tabu - lation of the peculiar properties of ten leading American authors .

		But after getting the gist of the thing neatly packed into an algebraic formula , the author added this delightful confession : '' It is a not uncommon observation that we often form judgments for which we can not give satisfactory reasons , and it is perhaps not less common to observe that these judgments are about as likely to be correct as those for which we can ... We are more accurate in our opinions than in our reasons for them . ''

		LOCKING THE STABLE DOOR BEFORE THE HORSE is STOLEN is evidently what the
Connecticut State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	and the
Connecticut	LOCATION	legislators believe in .

		The new
State Library	ORGANIZATION	building , or rather the combined
State Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Memorial Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	building , which has sprung into existence at
Hartford	LOCATION	within the short space of two years and a half , and apparently without any such misappropriation of funds as usually attends the erection of our public buildings , is a happy birth that owes its timely conception to the brain of the
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
George S. Godard	PERSON	.

		It was he who years ago noted the rapid growth and inade - quate housing of the precious collection of books and pamphlets and manuscripts under his care .

		The capitol building , as in many another State , had provided quarters , cramped ` and exposed to risks of fire , for the library .

		But before such a catastrophe as that at
Albany	LOCATION	overtook it , a suitable structure for its reception was carefully planned and hand - somely executed .

		Among the valuable records preserved in the vaults of the library are the trans - actions between the first settlers and the Indians , recorded on parchment and with the signatures , or marks , of redskin chiefs side by side with the white man 's sign manual .

		There may be seen the great Mugwump 's private mark ; and , if the visitor desires , Mr.
Godard	PERSON	will explain the connection between this aboriginal Mugwump and the more recent rep - resentative of the species .

		He may also get sight of precious autographs of
William and Mary	PERSON	, of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, of the four
Georges	PERSON	, and of
Joseph Addison	PERSON	, and learn the whole history of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	legislature , which is said to have given the world the first written state constitution .

		But the Library and its finely appointed home can not be described in a paragraph .

		They should be visited in person .

		SlX MILLION PER CENT INCREASE IN BOOK VALUES , if realized within a single lifetime , would make a book-dealer rich beyond the wildest dreams of avarice .

		Something more than that percentage of profit -LRB- distributed among many dealers in the course of two centuries -RRB- has been achieved by the Hoe copy of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's '' Morte d'
Arthur	PERSON	, '' the only perfect copy known of the
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	issue of
1485	DATE	, which in
1695	DATE	is said to have commanded a price about equivalent to
sixty-eight cents	MONEY	of our money .

		Even in little more than a quarter of a century it has risen in value nearly four hundred and thirty - nine per cent , its last sale at auction -LRB- before the present sale -RRB- having taken place in
1885	DATE	, when it was bought in by
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	for Mrs. Nor - ton Q. Pope of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, at whose death it was ac - quired by Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	for an amount not made public .

		The late winning bid of
forty-two thousand eight hundred dollars	MONEY	, on the part of Mr.
J. P. Morgan	PERSON	, is accounted the second highest in the annals of bibliopoly , the highest being that of fifty thousand dollars for the
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	acquired at the same sale by Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	of
Los Angeles	ORGANIZATION	.

		An even more astonishing record , in its way , was made by the Greek grammar of
Constantinus Lascaris	ORGANIZATION	, which elicited a bid of
twenty-three hundred dollars	MONEY	after having cost Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	but three hundred and forty in
1891	DATE	.

		Some yet more startling and rapid jumps in value are reported from this sale , all largely accounted for , no doubt , by the recent re - markable growth of our plutocracy .

		A LIBRARY 'S PRESIDING GENIUS ought to be and commonly is the head librarian , though sometimes the name applies more properly to the chairman of the board of trustees .

		At the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, of which we doubt not Mr.
Edward F. Stevens	PERSON	, the librarian , is the real as well as the officially designated head , the circulating depart - ment has a genius loci of its own , more appropriate to the reading-room perhaps , which is thus described in the current quarterly Bulletin of the institution : '' Visitors to the library are attracted by the figure of Thackeray which stands in a prominent position in the
Circulating Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a replica of a statuette by Sir
Edgar Boehm	PERSON	now in the
National Portrait Gallery	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		It shows
Thackeray	PERSON	as he used to be observed in the
Reform Club	ORGANIZATION	standing in the smoking room , f his back to the fire , his legs rather wide apart , his hands thrust into his trousers pockets , his head stiffly thrown back while he joined in the talk of the men in the semi - circle of chairs in front of him . ' ''

		Patrons of the library are invited to read and re-read their Thack - eray and all about him in this centennial year of his birth , and in the reading-room will be found '' an exhaustive
Thackeray	PERSON	bibliography as well as a nearly complete file of Pimch , '' to which periodical the artist-humorist contributed from
1843	DATE	to
1854	DATE	, and of which he not untruthfully , though not quite grammatically , said : `` There never was before published so many volumes that contained so much cause for laughing and so little cause for blushing , so many jokes and so little harm . ''

		DR.
JOHNSON	PERSON	'S
LONDON	LOCATION	HOUSE ,
Number 17 Gough Square	ORGANIZATION	, has been bought by Mr.
Cecil Harmsworth	PERSON	with the benevolent intention of giv - ing it to his country as a national memorial to a great man .

		Just what steps will be taken for its restoration or preservation , and whether it will be converted into a Johnson museum or maintained without the addition of any such collection of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 381 Johnsoniana , remains to be determined .

		But the house where the great Dictionary was begun and finished , where `` The Rambler '' was conceived , and where many other works of
Johnson	PERSON	's were written , must long continue to be an object of in - terest to visitors .

		By turning to
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's famous essay on
Boswell 's Life of Johnson	ORGANIZATION	, one can get a glimpse of the building as it was in
1832	DATE	`` a stout , old-fashioned , oak-balustraded house . ''

		`` The actual occupant , '' says
Carlyle	PERSON	, `` an elderly , well - washed , decent-looking man , invited us to enter ; and courteously undertook to be cicerone ; though in his memory lay nothing but the foolishest jumble and hallucination . ''

		A clearer-headed , better - informed guide to the rooms of chief interest in the house should now be found , if possible , and installed .

		WHERE LIBRARY BOOKS ARE IN EXTRAORDINARY DEMAND , and where one may breathe the still air of delightful studies , enjoy an existence free from the ordinary cares of life , be fed , clothed , and sheltered with no drain upon one 's pocket , and at the same time uudergo -LRB- if one will -RRB- a thorough moral regen - eration this delectable retreat is to be found in every State of our
Union	ORGANIZATION	, though its charms appeal as yet to comparatively few .

		With an average population of seven hundred and three in the year
1909	DATE	, the
Minnesota State Prison	ORGANIZATION	reported a circu - lation of its six thousand library books amounting to nearly twenty-three thousand , or about thirty-two per capita .

		Is not that enough to make an unincar - cerated librarian turn green with envy ?

		Suppose the city of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, with its half - mill ion inhab - itants , to have a proportional circulation of public library books : that would mean some sixteen million volumes a year .

		As a matter of fact , it can boast a circulation of about one-ninth that amount , and as compared with other cities of the same size and even larger that is a remarkably good record .

		When it comes the time of year to issue annual reports , who would not wish to be a
State Prison	ORGANIZATION	librarian ?

		To these and other pleasant reflections we are moved by a perusal of the current Biennial Report of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, a well-printed , well-illustrated , and otherwise attract - ive pamphlet .

		WHAT CONSTITUTES VULGARITY IN LITERATURE will never be determined in so many words , any more than what constitutes beauty or truth or charm or romance .

		What is one man 's vulgarity is another man 's refinement , as may be illustrated by a few quotations from the newly-published correspondence of the late
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	-LRB- as Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	is best known in the world of letters -RRB- .

		She calls
Thackeray	PERSON	not simply vulgar , but `` atrociously so , '' whereas
Dickens	PERSON	is labeled '' not vulgar . ''

		In a quick succession of unhesitating judgments she de - clares that '' Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	was not vulgar .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was vulgar .

		Burns was not vulgar .

		Carlyle was a little vulgar .

		Froude was not vulgar .

		Motley was not vulgar .

		Macaulay was not vulgar .

		John - son was not vulgar .

		Addison was vulgar . ''

		And further : ``
William Morris	PERSON	vulgarity itself .

		Lord Lytton rather vulgar .

		Stevenson vulgar , very . ''

		Who , then , we ask in bewilderment , is free from vulgarity if
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	and
William Morris	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	are vulgar ?

		Or has vulgarity no objective reality , and must we conclude , Hamlet-like , that there is nothing either refined or vulgar but thinking makes it so ?

		THE PERILOUS STATE OF OUR NATIONAL AR - CHIVES , scattered as they are in many buildings , and in hardly an instance adequately safeguarded against fire , demands the erection of a special building at
Washington	LOCATION	to receive into its safe keeping those state papers and other documents whose historic value is priceless , and which have accumulated in larger quantity than has similar material in any of the single States , not excepting
New York	LOCATION	with its now charred remains of one of the most precious collections in
America	LOCATION	.

		The disastrous consequences of governmental neglect in this matter in the past are notorious .

		In
1800	DATE	the archives of the War Department were burned ; in
1833	DATE	the most valu - able of the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	's archives met with a like fate ; and in
1877	DATE	there was a similar disaster in the
Patent Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reckless throwing away of manuscript matter in the Capitol , to provide quarters for the soldiers in our Civil War , and the subsequent looting of the archives of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	on the part of autograph-hunters , are well known .

		A national archives building , of fireproof construction , and a properly qualified superintendent of archives are among the urgent needs of the hour .

		THE PERSISTENCE OF PLOTS comes up again for brief discussion in a contribution to the
May	DATE	''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' from the pen of Miss
Ellen Duvall	PERSON	.

		She begins with a reference to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's citation of
Gozzi	PERSON	as authority for the assertion that only thirty-six dramatic situations are possible , and
Schiller	PERSON	's rejoin - der that he could think of but fourteen ; and she ends with the regret that the supersubtle Venetian left no record of those thirty-six situations .

		As she makes no mention of Polti 's little book -LRB- called to our readers ' attention by two correspondents in our issue of
March 1	DATE	-RRB- in which a complete catalogue of these situations is attempted , it may be that she is not acquainted with it .

		In the body of her essay she displays ingenuity in fitting to her scheme of simple love plots , triangular love plots , and quadran - gular love plots , various masterpieces of romance .

		This is a fascinating field for research and for philosophical disquisition , and one in which both the monist , with his passion for unity , and the pluralist , with his love of diversity , can probably find about equal support for their pet theories .

		There is as yet no exact science of plots , although there does exist , and ever will , the sublime art of weaving them .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, COLLECTOR 'S MANIA EXTRAORDINARY exhibits itself in the passion for abbreviations that has long held possession of Mr.
W. T. Rogers	PERSON	,
F. R. L.S.	PERSON	, sub-librarian , until recently , at the
Inner Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	. ''

		For over thirty years , '' confesses Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	, '' I have been collecting abbreviations in my spare time .

		Hardly a day passes by in which I do not add one or two to my stock .

		A few days ago , for instance , as I was hurrying along near the Strand I saw the letters '
I. C. S. P.	PERSON	' on some offices .

		I wonder what proportion of the passers-by know that this indicates the offices of the Incorporated Church Scouts Patrols !

		Another day I brought back the magic letters 'S .


S. M. I. F.	PERSON	and G. ' , but have not yet been able to discover their hidden meaning . ''

		Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	does not pursue his fad purely for the fad 's sake .

		He is about to publish a dictionary of abbreviations , which will be a sub - stantial volume of about eight hundred pages , and will have a specially valuable appendix contain - ing `` all the legal abbreviations , '' treated with a scrupulous accuracy never before bestowed on the subject .

		The book will appear , it is hoped , in
August	DATE	, and is likely to take high rank among the products of plodding industry .

		THE APPOINTMENT OF
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	COUNTY LIBRARIANS , under the requirements of the new county library law approved
Feb. 25 , 1911	DATE	, is to be made only upon certificate of qualification from the
State	ORGANIZATION	board of library examiners .

		An examination open to all applicants , who may be of either sex and may come from any quarter of the globe , will be held at the
Hotel Maryland	LOCATION	,
Pasadena	LOCATION	,
Monday	DATE	,
May 22 , 1911	DATE	, at two o'clock in the afternoon under the supervision of Miss
Mary L. Sutliff	PERSON	, head cataloguer of the

James L. Gillis	PERSON	, librarian of the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.

		M. MAETERLINCK IN REFLECTIVE MOOD is re - ported in the
Paris	LOCATION	Figaro by
M. Francois Poncet	PERSON	- ton .

		Among a variety of topics touched upon reminiscently or meditatively was one of especial interest to those play-goers who have seen `` The Blue Bird . ''

		Speaking of the staging of the piece , its author said : '' It was a daily struggle for three solid months .

		It called for unremitting energy .

		Everything had to be done over and over again , despite most earnest advice to the contrary .

		And the children !

		Oh , the world of gentle discipline it took to train them !

		But they are perfect .

		At
Moscow	LOCATION	we could not find any children , though every one tried to help us .

		We were obliged to take young men , and we cut a row of deep grooves across the stage for them to move in .

		With trail - ing draperies , they managed in this way to look like children .

		But actors walking always along a fixed line had the appearance of mannikins .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	, thanks to these fine children , there was life and go . ''

		One is sorry to learn that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's beloved bees have fallen victims to the rigors of the Norman climate , and his hives are empty .

		DARTMOUTH 'S PLANS FOR A NEW LIBRARY BUILD - ING formed a part of the substance of President
Nichols	PERSON	's recent address before the
Dartmouth	LOCATION	alumni of
Western Massachusetts	LOCATION	at their annual banquet in
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		The trustees of the college are considering ways and means , and at their latest meeting they discussed plans for a structure to cost a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	and to call for an addi - tional quarter-million for equipment and endowment .

		The present building was provided when the whole student body did not exceed three hundred and seventy-five a smaller number than that of last autumn 's entering class , and the four years ' cur - riculum was a very simple and invariable programme contrasted with the manifold courses now offered .

		THE CLASS-DAY REJUVENESCENCE OF THE GRAY - BEARD ALUMNUS is truly a pleasing spectacle to the beholder and a delightful experience to the old '' grad '' himself .

		To be young again just for one day is well worth the price of an excursion ticket from
Galveston	LOCATION	to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, or from
Seattle	LOCATION	to
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		But for whole classes of ten or fifteen or perhaps twenty years ' remove from the com - mencement platform to parade the campus attired as clowns and blowing penny whistles , does at times almost make the judicious grieve .

		Accordingly we learn not without a measure of approval that the
Yale Alumni	ORGANIZATION	Day festivities this year are not to be diversified by excessive indulgence in puerilities on the part of the sedate .

		In the procession to the ball-game only the triennial and possibly the sex - ennial class will wear fantastic costumes , the older men being expected to content themselves with more sober attire .

		This timely hint from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	deserves to be heeded elsewhere .

		IMPORTANT LIBRARY LEGISLATION is reported from
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		The
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	has acted favorably upon every definite recommendation made by
the State Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at its meeting of
last October	DATE	.

		The most important enactment was that providing for an
Indiana Centennial Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion to `` formulate plans for the celebration of the cen - tennial of the admission of
Indiana	LOCATION	into the
Union	ORGANIZATION	by the erection of a
State	ORGANIZATION	building , and its dedication in
1916	DATE	, to be known as the
Indiana	LOCATION	Educational Building . ''

		The building , if erected , as now seems likely , will house the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	and Museum , the
Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and the educational and scientific offices of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		The next
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	will pass upon the plans submitted by the

		THE DIAL 383 CO M M UNICA TIOHS .

		LEON SECHE , THE '' ANECDOTALIST '' OF FRENCH ROMANTICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The champions of dry-as-dust erudition have tried hard to discredit the use of the anecdote in literature .

		Entertaining or interesting writers are branded as ' popular '' and dismissed with contempt .

		Literature must be austere , or not be at all .

		This absurd prejudice had assumed a very strong hold on modern generations under the double influence of the methods of natural sciences held up as models in all domains of research , and the minute , pulverizing scholarship of the Germans .

		There are , however , indisputable signs of a reaction ; and , indeed , reallv sensible writers have never ceased to realize that anecdotes are to literature and history exactly what natural facts are to sciences ; and moreover that they are as valuable information as any for the true historian .

		Let us recall what has long been termed Prosper Me `` rimeVs paradox : `` I love in history , '' he says in his `` Chronique de
Charles IX.	PERSON	, '' `` nothing but anecdotes ; and among anecdotes , I prefer those in which I think that I can find a true picture of the customs and people of a given epoch .

		This taste is not very noble ; but , I confess it with shame , I would gladly give Thucidides for the authentic Me ` moires of
Aspasia	LOCATION	or of a slave of Pericles . ''

		Barbey d'Aurevilly said about the same thing in the following : `` The anecdote is the very con - centration of history , when one knows how to choose it and how to place it . ''

		None understood better the value of the anecdote than
Taine	PERSON	, the grave and the great .

		And , only recently ,
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	made some re - marks of the same order in speaking of Sainte-Beuve .

		Indeed , what did Saiute-Beuve do in his famous '' Lundis '' but spread the anecdote method long ago in use by Tallemant des Re'aux , La None , Saint
Simon	PERSON	?

		And why not go back to Diogenes of
Laertes	LOCATION	, or
Plu	ORGANIZATION	- tarch -LRB- see the latter 's introductory words to his
Life of Alexander	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ?

		Of course , it will not be sufficient to tell anecdotes in order to be a good historian or a good judge in literary matters ; it is with the anecdote as with any other tool , it must be handled properly .

		Now , it is interesting to remark that in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- the mother country and the leading country of literary criticism -RRB- the period that has been for the first time studied scientifically by contemporaries , the period of Romanticism , is known almost exclusively by the anec - dote method .

		And again interesting is the fact that we owe by far the most considerable part of those valuable documents to one scholar , M. Le `` on Se ` che ' .

		M. Se ` che ' has devoted hjs time and money for years to the untir - ing searching of archives , libraries , and private corre - spondence .

		It is thought that , in his many publications , some pages are not very relevant ; but who is competent to decide whether any document may not sooner or later be relevant ?

		The fact is that for one who studies away from Parisian libraries , M. Se ` che ^ s books are treasures .

		His latest volume is on
Delphine Gay	PERSON	, * '' La Muse de la Patrie , '' who married
Emile de Girardin	PERSON	, the famous director of '' La Presse , '' a paper that did much for the progress of letters in those days .

		* Delphine Gay : Mme. de

		Here he deals more espe - cially with the woman .

		And indeed as a woman she is more interesting than as a writer .

		Moreover , no matter how creditable
Delphine	PERSON	's successes as a poet or as a dramatic author were at the time , there can be no doubt b * ut that a considerable part of these successes was due to the grateful devotion of so many literary friends .

		In a way her beauty and her personal charms were an obstacle to greater achievements as an author .

		Even if she had wanted to give more time and labor to her writings , her friends , who were so anxious to enjoy her society , would have prevented her from securing the quiet indispensable for creations of lasting fame .

		This is the impression one gets from the revelations made by M. Se ` che ' .

		Besides , her mother had warned her : '' If you want to be taken seriously , give the example yourself ... Be a woman as regards your gowns , and a man as regards grammar . ''

		She tried hard , and Soumet was proud of his pupil 's achieve - ments .

		But Balzac 's fear was not wholly unfounded : '' Be in the execution in turn poetical and ironical ; but have a uniform style , and then you will leave behind you that distressing distance that people are accustomed to find between sexes -LRB- speaking from the literary point of view -RRB- ; for I , for one , do not consider that either
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	or
Madame George Sand	ORGANIZATION	has suc - ceeded in the task . ''

		Lamartine also , the most sincere admirer among all of
Delphine	PERSON	's friends , had soon diag - nosed the case : '' Her verses are what I like least about her .

		However , she has a nice feminine talent ; but the ` feminine ' is terrible in poetry . ''

		What
Delphine	PERSON	did perfectly was the ''
Chronique Parisienne	PERSON	, '' published in her husband 's newspaper under the name of
Vicomte de Launay	ORGANIZATION	, an account of Parisian life under the
July Monarchy	DATE	that compares with
Madame de Se `	ORGANIZATION	vigne `` s account of the seventeenth - century society .

		This , and two short comedies , '' La joie fait peur '' and '' Le chapeau de 1 ` horloger , '' remain her best achievements as a writer .

		She was too intel - ligent not to understand ; to a lady who once compli - mented her on her poetry she answered : `` It should rather be my duty to compliment you , madame ; it is better for us women to inspire poems than to write them ? ''

		But what a woman she was !

		How she knew how to encourage and help the brilliant men of her time , how often she brought back peace when feelings had been hurt , how splendidly she made use of her social position as the wife of de
Girardin	PERSON	to make all those genial people work in harmony for good causes !

		With every one she was different , and yet always the same good cordial woman .

		Her correspondence , to Hugo , to
Balzac	LOCATION	, to
Rachel	PERSON	, for instance , shows admirably that adaptability .

		Of course , all her preferences went to
Lamartine	LOCATION	; and does not that speak in her favor too ?

		She was for him another Elvire , the Elvire of the years of maturity .

		She never concealed her feeling for him , from the day when she wrote that beautiful poem : '' Quel est done le secret de mes vagues alarmes ?

		Est-ce un nouveau malheur qu'il me faut pressentir ?

		D'ou vient qu ` hier mes yeux ont vers tant de lannes En le voyant partir ? ''

		until the day when her will showed that her last thought had been for '' le Dieu . ''

		One does not meet often in this world so good a heart and so vast an intelligence . ''

		Lofty is the tone of the whole book , because lofty was the woman who inspired it .

		There is no more agreeable way of being introduced into the history of French Romanticism than through

		RECENT TENDENCIES IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The changes now rapidly taking place in the Jap - anese language and literature are interesting and suggestive .

		The writer of the '' Monthly Summary of Japanese Current Literature '' in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' of
Yokohama	LOCATION	has recently called attention to one significant phase in the evolution of the Japanese language .

		He calls the present '' a talking age '' in
Japan	LOCATION	, and shows how this is aiding what is known as the gembun-itchi movement , aiming to bring into closer harmony the written and the spoken languages .

		The best way to set this forth is to make several quotations from his article , as follows : '' The extent to which talking has taken the place of writing in
Modern Japan	LOCATION	is quite phenomenal .

		In preparing these Summaries , we are in the habit of looking through a very large number of magazines and other publications , and we find that most of the material furnished by the compilers of magazines consists of the reproduction of speeches or lec - tures delivered , which have been taken down by stenogra - phers , or of talks which interviewers have had with promi - nent men .

		It has to be remembered that writing out articles intended for publication in magazines in this coun - try -LSB-
Japan	LOCATION	-RSB- , owing to the nature of the language , must necessarily occupy much time ; whereas in fifteen or twenty minutes a fluent talker can give a Japanese note-taker or stenographer , as the case may be , sufficient material to make a good long magazine article . '' ''

		There is perhaps no country in the world where so much reliance is placed on the tongue in collecting material for newspapers , magazines , and books as is the case in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		One of the results of this fashion is that high-class Japanese , who in former days were remarkably reticent , have become quite loquacious . '' ''

		Another result of the practice we are discussing is the increasing importance attached to colloquial speech and the decay of interest in stilted classical phraseology .

		Mr.
Natsume Soseki	PERSON	is doing grand work by bringing out novel after novel in which the dialogues given are all written in high-class modern colloquial .

		By reading a book like ` Jfon , ' the latest of his stories , students of the Japanese language can see at once how great are the capabilities of modern colloquial Japanese when manipulated by a past master like
Natsume	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this talking age , if any one desires to study some of the finest specimens of Japanese conversation to be found in modern literature , let him read two or three of the best of
Natsume	ORGANIZATION	's novels . ''

		By an interesting coincidence , the same issue of the weekly edition of the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' contains an article on '' Japanese Translations , '' in which
Baron Suematsu	PERSON	, a fine English scholar , is quoted as saying : '' If a man who is able to read and write Japanese and a European language equally well -LRB- no such man exists , of course -RRB- , were to compare the two languages , he would find that expressing Japanese thought in that European tongue or translating from Japanese into the same is much easier than expressing European thought in Japanese or translating into that tongue .

		This , no doubt , is partly owing to the radical difference of structure between Japanese sentences and those of European tongues ; but it is also partly to be attributed to the fact that our language has not yet reached the high state of development to which European tongues have attained . ''

		In the same article , Mr.
Togawa	PERSON	, who has recently published a translation of some of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays , is quoted as follows : `` I do n't consider that I have succeeded in reproducing the original truly and clearly .

		... Of course , it is possible that in some cases I did not fully comprehend the meaning of the English phrases I was rendering .

		As for
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's ideas , they have never appeared to me to be very abstruse or mystical .

		By me he is not regarded as a profound thinker .

		But he had a chatty way of expressing his thoughts , and the mistake I made in translating him was to try to give his ideas in our ordinary book language .

		This language has had its uses and it may still be profitably employed for a long time ; but J am of opinion that it does not bear comparison with good Japanese colloquial for the conveyance of Western thought to the Japanese mind . '

		1 '' * The writer of the article says that `` Mr.
Togawa	PERSON	is regarded as an expert translator , and hence , on this point , ... his testimony is very valuable '' ; and he quotes another sentence of Mr.
Togawa	PERSON	's to the same purport , i. e. , `` it seems to me that our book style is unsuited for the transmission of modern thought . ''

		He then adds the following : '' We could quote a great many other Japanese writers in support of this opinion .

		To us it appears as if within the next few decades high-class colloquial Japanese will be the only language employed by most newspaper and magazine writers .

		That this language has even to-day reached a very high state of development is abundantly shown in the works of leading Japanese novelists .

		Japanese colloquial , when skilfully used , for purposes of vivid and minute description , for satire and repartee , in suggestiveness and lucidity and general charm is , in our opinion , not surpassed by any spoken tongue in existence . ''

		Still another interesting phase of this linguistic change will appear in connection with oratory .

		Now , it may not be proper to say that oratory is a `` lost art '' in
Japan	LOCATION	; for it never really existed .

		Calligraphy , as developed in connection with the Chinese idiographs , became a `` fine art '' ; but oratory has been compara - tively artless .

		The common style of oratory is rhetori - cal and unimpressive .

		A more fervid style has been developed in the Christian pulpit , and is being developed in political meetings and assemblies .

		Even in the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	the number of real orators is very small .

		The development of oratory has been hindered by the servitude of the Japanese language to classical and conventional modes of expression .

		Under such circumstances , the evolution of a peculiar oratori - cal style has been well-nigh impossible .

		The rules of rhetoric have hampered the full expression of ideas in a way to stir the feelings and move the will .

		Speeches have been too much like the reading of written essays .

		They have appealed to reason more than to feeling .

		The use of colloquial is growing more common in oratory , which thereby becomes more fervid .

		Now , with a still more general popularization and elevation of colloquial , there is a good opportunity for a more vital oratory in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 385 Che A FRIEXD 'S PORTRAIT OF JOHX IJA FARGE .

		*
John La Farge	PERSON	was one of the rare men who make a deep impression upon all who are privileged to know them .

		Over and above the sum of his achievement and his achievment was notable was his personality .

		Though identified with his art so closely that it is im - possible to think of htm apart from it , never - theless in retrospect the man himself seems greater than what he accomplished .

		It was strength and indomitable individuality that lay behind his gentle manner and quiet reserve .

		One could not be long in his presence without feeling this , as well as his sensitiveness to all refining influences .

		The impalpable armor of aloofness which he habitually wore was not a thing put on , as it were , from lack of sympathy with his fellows , but an instinctive protection to his working hours and against the physical strain of uncongenial intercourse : when he chose to lay it aside he showed himself the most delight - ful of companions , alert , thoughtful , and keenly interested in all artistic and intellectual things .

		The story of the life of such a man could be told only by one who knew him well .

		The memoir and study prepared by Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	is fitly described by the author as a portrait drawn '' with grateful loyalty to a master in the things of the mind , '' and is avowedly written in affection .

		It is the outcome of more than twenty years of close friendship '' never even momentarily disturbed by so much as the shadow of a shadow . ''

		In a measure it is the fulfilment of a purpose in which Mr. La Farge shared .

		Some years ago Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	planned a volume in which the criticism he had devoted to his friend 's work should be brought together .

		La Farge received the idea with cordial sym - pathy , and agreed to supply such biographical details as were thought essential . ''

		As time went on , '' we are told , `` he developed an intense interest in the book , coming to regard it as a kind of repository for the recollections and reflections which , in other circumstances , he might have embodied in a book of his own . ''

		These reminiscences , jotted down now and then as they came to his mind , have been incor - porated in the memoir of which they form a considerable part .

		They show , as nothing else could , La Farge 's mental attitude toward his * JOHN LA FAROE .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Hoaghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		work , and they impart also to the biography a certain authoritative sanction .

		Incidentally they relieve the constantly recurrent note of admiration which , though well deserved , might otherwise seem a bit too insistent .

		Of formal biography the book contains very little .

		Beyond the bare statement that La Farge was married in
1860	DATE	to Miss
Margaret Mason Perry	PERSON	, there is no reference to his domestic life , and his children are not mentioned .

		The course of his artistic development is , however , traced in detail , and enough is told about his father 's family , and that of his mother , to indi - cate the influences that surrounded him in his youth and did much to mould his character .

		There are slight but fascinating glimpses of his father , a '' retired soldier , who had brought from his native Charente a certain keen and rationalizing temperament , and had learned in his European battles under
Napoleon	PERSON	, as well as in his bitter experience at
San Domingo	LOCATION	, to deal with life with a kind of imaginative practical - ity '' ; and of the family life centered around the neighborhood of
Washington Square	LOCATION	in that '' Old
New York	LOCATION	, '' to which he clung with deep attachment as long as he lived .

		Not less attractive is the picture of his maternal grand - father , M. Binsse de Saint -
Victor	PERSON	, who had in early life been a wealthy planter in
San Do	LOCATION	- mingo , but being ruined by the revolution , had fled with his wife and children to the
United States	LOCATION	, where he supported himself by teaching and painting .

		Unlike most distinguished artists , La Farge did not discover until he was quite grown up that he wished to be a painter .

		In his youth his sur - roundings were such as to make him look upon his interest in art quite as a matter of course .

		His education , however , began at a very early age .

		This is the story , as told in his own words : '' The influences which I felt as a little boy were those of the paintings and works of art that surrounded me at home .

		Some reached further back than the early Napoleonic period , the beginning of - the nineteenth century .

		There were on the walls a sea-piece by
Vernet	PERSON	; some imitation historical story , that of
Daniel	PERSON	, charming , however , in color , by
Lemoyne	LOCATION	; two great battle scenes , now ascribed to Salvator ; a large paint - ing of
Noah	PERSON	and his sons , ascribed to Sebastiano del Piombo ; some , indeed many , Dutch paintings of various authors and excellence , among them a beautiful
Solomon Ruysdael	PERSON	which I yet see occasionally .

		All this and the very furniture and hangings of the Empire parlor did not belong to the Victorian epoch in which I was growing up . ''

		It so happened that my very first teachings were those of the eighteenth century and my training has covered almost a century and a half . ''

		I was just six years old and I had wished to learn 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, to draw and paint for whatever was to come of it , a mere boy 's wish .

		My father took me to my grandfather , the father of my mother , who had for some time been a painter , especially of miniatures , and not a bad one .

		I never knew exactly how he came by his training ... To him I came to get my first lessons of art , which were sadly prosaic and which would have driven me away if it had not been that my father insisted upon my carrying out anything that I had proposed to do .

		The teaching was as mechanical as it could be , and was rightly based upon the notion that a boy ought to be taught so as to know his trade . ''

		This teaching appears to have been continued until La Farge went to college , where his pro- fessor in English led him to study the literary and historical side of art .

		After college he began the study of law , but to help a French artist he took some lessons in painting from him .

		This revived his interest in art , and led to a visit to
Europe	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	.

		He was then in his twenty-first year , and highly impressionable .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	he was introduced to artistic and lit - erary circles by his cousin
Paul de Saint	PERSON	-
Victor	PERSON	, then a notable figure in the world of letters .

		Largely to please his father , who wished him to learn the practice of painting , he entered the studio of Couture , but being '' impatient to paint according to school ways '' he did not stay more than a couple of weeks .

		Then fol - lowed a tour through
Northern Italy	LOCATION	with his cousin
Paul	PERSON	; visits to
Munich	LOCATION	,
Dresden	LOCATION	, and
Copenhagen	LOCATION	; and , after a little time spent in
Belgium	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, he returned to
America	LOCATION	and to reading law .

		The months spent in
Europe	LOCATION	, however , and especially the stimulating contact with the en - thusiastic adherents of the romantic movement , had given direction to his thoughts , and he soon began to perceive his true vocation .

		Still he did not break away from his legal studies at once .

		He began by taking a room in the Studio Building in Tenth Street , where he occasionally `` tried to paint , '' as he says , `` on a small and amateurish scale . ''

		While debating whether to go back to
Paris	LOCATION	for a course of vigorous training , a meeting with
William M. Hunt	PERSON	, who had been a favorite and brilliant pupil of Couture 's , caused him to enter Hunt 's studio at
Newport	LOCATION	as a pupil .

		La Farge 's account of his work under Hunt 's tutelage is of especial interest .

		Master and pupil were constantly trying experiments , striving to penetrate the secrets of natural phenomena , and to discover the best methods of representing their visual aspects .

		It was a period upon which La Farge always loved to dwell .

		Already the love of knowledge , which Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	denominates his ruling pas - sion , had laid firm hold of him .

		It held him to the end of his life : as long as he was able to work he never tired of trying experiments .

		This mental attitude
Jed	PERSON	, a few years later , to the invention of opaline glass , with which his name is indissolubly associated , and to the splendid glass work of which he was the supreme master .

		Whatever differences of opinion there may be as to his work as a painter , no qualified judge can question the statement that as a designer of windows he has had no rival in modern times .

		As Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	points out , his glass work has something more important than novelty and technical excellence . ''

		It is the character of his glass that counts .

		At the roots of that character was La Farge 's understand - ing of the true office of convention in art .

		Convention has for generations suffered in repute because it has so often been the refuge of the slack intelligence , but to La Farge it was a precious instrument .

		Books and photographs were at his hand and he carried in his brain a kind of anthology of all the decorative styles ; but not if he had tried could he have used them in the wooden , literal way of the unimaginative artist . ''

		The commission given him by his friend Van Brunt to do one of the windows for
Memorial Hall	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was destined to affect the whole course of his life .

		It was while engaged upon it that the discovery of opaline glass was made , and through his close attention to the details of the manufacture of the windows he designed that he had a severe illness from a form of lead poisoning which in
1866	DATE	brought him near to death 's door , and left after-effects from which he never wholly recovered .

		Indeed , his whole life afterward was an almost constant struggle against physical disability , and his work was carried on under circumstances that would not have been possible to one of less courageous spirit .

		There is reason to think that more than anything else it was the quality of his designs for glass work that caused the architect
Richardson	PERSON	to select La Farge to undertake the decoration of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		And as other important commissions resulted from the successful accomplishment of that notable work , it was thus that he came to devote himself to mural decoration and became a recognized leader in that field .

		The praise that Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	gives to La Farge 's glass is none too high .

		His estimate of him as a painter is more open to question .

		To some of those who admire his works it ap - pears that in composition of line they do not always touch the highest note .

		In spite of the clearness of the artist 's vision and his appre - ciation of the merits of the art of the Orient , he was essentially a realist , and as such found it difficult to adopt a treatment of forms in
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 which literal rendering of detail was sacrificed to rhythmic unity .

		Because of this his paintings often lose much of their beauty when repro - duced in black and white , as the illustrations to this volume attest ; and we miss in them the very splendid line quality that characterizes a few of his early drawings , such as his '' Bishop
Hatto	PERSON	, '' his '' Giant , '' and his ''
Wolf Charmer	PERSON	, '' all of which are masterpieces in their way .

		Truly , as Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	says : '' His fame is largely that of a great colorist , who made his mark in monumental mural decorations and in windows of stained glass .

		In both these fields he was wont to illustrate noble objects , and the loftiness of his ideas was also made known through his easel pictures and through his essays and address A on painting . ''

		It is only fair to state that in bestowing a large meed of generous appreciation upon his friend 's work , Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	disclaims any attempt at finality of judgment as to his stand - ing as an artist .

		On the whole , the critical estimates made in the memoir are sound and well considered .

		But of more worth is the ten - der and affectionate presentment of a man who was of no common mould .

		From his own knowl - edge the writer of this review can testify to the accuracy of the '' Study for a Portrait , '' as the opening chapter is styled .

		It is a beautiful picture , which those who knew La Farge can not fail to treasure .

		One passage from it may be quoted for the light it sheds upon a phase of the master 's personality not known to the world at large : '' I have heard some brilliant talkers ,
Whistler	LOCATION	amongst them , but I have never heard one even re - motely comparable to La Farge .

		He knew nothing of the glittering , phrase-making habit of the merely clever man , to whom the condensation of a bit of repartee into an epigram is a triumph . '

		I am not a clever man , ' he once said to me , ' but sometimes I do clever things .

		I think when that happens it is the work of the daemon of
Socrates	LOCATION	. '

		He gave me a droll instance .

		He was dictating to a typewriter who made a mess of the names of some Chinese gods . '

		Like a flash I said to her , '' Miss X. , you have put in here the name of your best man . ''

		She blushed violently and admitted it . '

		He paused . '

		They often do that , ' he added , with one of his understanding smiles .

		There were often , by the way , such flashes of innocent fun as this in his conver - sation , but he held you , of course , on a far higher plane .

		There he practised a serene eloquence , ranging over fields so spacious that in addition to the weighty substance of his talk he stimulated the listener as with a sense of large issues , of brave venturings into seas of thought .

		He had seen the world , he had known a mul - titude of men and things , and this rich experience reacted upon his nature .

		But his complexity was a central possession , it was of the very texture of his soul .

		There went with it , too , a peculiar poise , a strange , self - centered calm .

		His pronounced sympathy for the East was easily understood .

		He liked its attitude of contem - plation .

		His own habit was meditative .

		But where his individuality made a still further claim was in the direc - tion of a tremendous intellectual and spiritual activity . ''

		To sit with him in fervid talk on a thousand things was to feel , presently , that he flung out a myriad invis - ible tentacles of understanding , electric filaments which in an instant identified him with the subject of his thought and made him free of its innermost secrets .

		And what be gathered through these magical processes he brought back and put before you , slowly , with an almost oracular deliberation , but in such living words and with such an artistic balancing of his periods that you saw what he saw , felt what he felt , and waited in positively tense enjoyment for the unfolding of the next mental picture . ''

		It was in such ways as this that
John La Farge	PERSON	revealed himself to his friends ; and to them he was ever , as Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	has happily said , '' a lambent flame of inspiration . ''

		There is nothing surprising , however , in the success of the work .

		We are not accustomed to expect books of striking originality from historians , and when one appears the shock is the more keenly felt .

		The present work is nevertheless much more than a mere novelty , revealing as it does on every page wide and accurate knowledge , mas - terly grasp of an immense subject , the profound reflection of a powerful mind , and courage the confidence of a man who has something more than opinions that are `` well documented .

Europe	LOCATION	, and with the his - tory of science and of scientific method .

		Yet it is no mere classified note-book that he gives us .

		There is no musty smell of old folios here , nor odor of
midnight	TIME	oil .

		Everything has passed through a renovating mind , and comes out fresh and vital .

		It is indeed time , as Lord Redesdale says , '' that
England	LOCATION	should see the book clothed in the native language of its author . ''

		Those if there be any such who still think that virtue and vice are products like sugar and vitriol , and that history is only the manifestation of the mechanism of nature as conceived by science ; or that races count for nothing and that great men are only links large links possibly , but still only links in an unbreakable chain ; that the historian pros - trating himself before something that wants to be known and expanding himself sensitively that nothing may be lost on his thin surface and film is concerned only to ascertain ob - jectively and to record with indifference exactly what happened ; those who think with
Walter Pater	PERSON	that '' all periods , types , schools of taste , are in themselves equal , '' thus judging the his - torical fact by the fact 's existence , or erecting , for purposes of evaluation , some mythically vague standard of '' Progress '' ; those who are wedded to all or any of these prevailing notions will find that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's book has little meaning for them : a collection of wild vagaries , let them not read it !

		`` What is the book ? ''

		asks Lord Kedesdale . ''

		Is it history , a philo - sophical treatise , a metaphysical inquiry ?

		I confess I know not . ''

		Yqu will not find any ready-made pigeon hole into which it can be easily slipped and forgotten .

		It is not one of those books made to be labeled : '' serviceable compendium , '' '' indispensable to the scholar , '' '' adapted to the general reader , '' '' contribution to knowledge . ''

		No , none of these shop - worn phrases is applicable .

		The book seeks to carry conviction , and desires only to be understood .

		Let us , therefore , in order to understand it , drop all our notions of history and place ourselves at the author 's point of view .

		And first of all , painful as it may be , let us forget that there is such a thing as objectivity .

		Ob - jectivity , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	scorns , at least if objectivity means a pale neutrality .

		He has not formed his judgments '' from the
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanic cloud-cockoo-land of a supernatural objectivity . ''

		`` Even an enemy can appreciate honest frankness .

		When it is a question of the dearest possessions of the heart , I prefer , like the Teutons , to rush naked to battle , with the sentiments that God has given me , rather than to march to the field adorned in the artificial armour of a science which proves nothing , or in the toga of an empty rhetoric which reconciles everything . ''

		Note well this last phrase .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	does not wish to reconcile everything .

		History is not made by the passive resistance of dead wills .

		There are real prizes to be won , ideals to be fought for , '' dearest possessions of the heart '' to be cherished . ''

		What is the good of ' objective phrases ' ? ''

		If there is nothing worth fighting for in the present , the past has no human value ; if there is something worth fighting for , the past acquires new meaning and fresh vitality by being seen in perspective .

		History , like life , as Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	would say , has to do with `` will attitudes '' ; and the historian is concerned , not with mechanical adaptations , but with purposes , the conflict of irreconcilable ideals .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	does not stand aside from this conflict and observe with Olympian calm the interplay of forces in order to pre - sent us with the impotent conclusion that what happened was the only thing that could have happened .

		On the contrary , he distinguishes for us the Manichean principles of light and darkness that are at work in history , and bids us manfully enter the struggle which is ever renewed and of which the issue is ever uncertain .

		Now it is clear that one can not treat history in this fashion without some touchstone for estimating the importance of the historical fact ; one must have a real standard of value , a stand - ard that is something more than an algebraic function of the fact 's extension in time and space .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has such a standard .

		The thing that is permanent in history , the thing therefore of highest value , he finds to be culture .

		By culture he means art -LRB- including poetry and music -RRB- and philosophy philosophy in the sense of Weltanschauung , a perception of the problems of life , a kind of theory of life in the most general sense , and therefore em - bracing religion and ethics .

		Culture is quite distinct from civilization , which is a thing of the moment , and from science , which gives us control over nature but explains nothing , being rather only the ever more and more detailed exposition of something Unknowable .

		Now culture is valuable because through it , and particularly through art , which is the quintes - sence of culture , man '' employs the elements , which nature offers him , to create for himself
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 a new world of semblance . ''

		By this creative '' shaping '' man disengages himself , as it were , from nature , ceases to be a part of the mechani - cally ordered universe , and becomes the arbiter of his destiny .

		Only through culture in this high sense does man '' enter into the daylight of life , '' only thus do his actions acquire higher value than the actions of other animals .

		But do not suppose that culture , like know - ledge or precious metals , is something that can be accumulated and stored up and bequeathed to succeeding ages , so that the sum of it at the disposal of humanity is always increasing .

		We are not the '' heirs of all the ages '' in any such fashion as that .

		The culture of the Greeks , for example , is something absolutely inseparable from the Greeks themselves , an intimate per - sonal possession of those who created it , incom - municable and inimitable .

		We can not borrow it or use it : we can of course enjoy it ; it serves as an inspiration , possessing both the stimulus and the restraint of a noble example .

		Like personality , culture is the expression of some - thing essentially individual , in respect to par - ticular ideas or works of art , the creation of the individual genius , and in respect to more complete conceptions of life embodied in a har - moniously developed philosophy , art , and re - ligion , the creation of distinct , individualized ** races '' or nations .

		Culture apart from par - ticular races or nations , a culture of humanity for example , is a pure abstraction and perfectly useless at that , '' as if we could all Egyptians , Chinese ,
Congo Negroes	ORGANIZATION	, Teutons be cast into one pot ; whereas in every sphere of life we see that even our nearest relations Greeks ,
Romans	LOCATION	,
Indians	LOCATION	, Iranians pass through a perfectly individual and peculiar course of de - velopment . ''

		History is to be judged , therefore , by this standard : culture being the highest good , and possible only through the free self-expression of the individual and the individual race , the importance of any period or people depends upon the extent to which this freedom is real - ized and the quality of the culture which it is able to produce .

		If this reminds anyone of Kant , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	will not object ; he has a great admiration for Kant , and compares him with Christ as a supremely great emancipator of the human spirit .

		Now this reckless use of the term '' race '' will irritate many people , and it ought to be said perhaps that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	knows all that has been written about the '' Aryan Myth . ''

		But for the historian the practical fact is that perfectly distinct groups of men with peculiar capacities and ideals have made European his - tory .

		That each of these groups Greeks ,
Romans	LOCATION	, English , French is a mixture of many peoples is quite true ; but in each case the original elements have combined to form a new and stable product , a unified and homoge - nous group .

		For the historian 's purpose , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	contends , these groups may well be called races . ''

		What kind of thing is this orig - inally ' psychologically uniform race ' of which Renan speaks ?

		Probably a near relation of
Haeckel	ORGANIZATION	's human apes . ''

		Whatever it is , it has no importance for the historian , the conclusions of these eminent scholars being , for him , singu - larly irrelevant . ''

		The great scholar Renan sees the English human thoroughbred , so to speak , rising before his eyes : the ages of his - tory are before him .

		What does he deduce therefrom ?

		He says : since the Englishman of to-day is neither the Celt of
Caesar	PERSON	's time , nor the Anglo-Saxon of Hengist , nor the
Dane of Knut	PERSON	, nor the Norman of the Conqueror , but the outcome of a crossing between all four , one can not speak of an English race at all .

		That is to say because the English race , like every other race of which we have any knowledge , has grown historically , because it is something peculiar and absolutely new , therefore it does not exist !

		In truth , nothing beats the logic of the scholar ! ''

		So far as the term has any practical meaning , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	thinks , history reveals a movement from '' racelessness to ever clearer distinctness of race . ''

		It is possible , within the limits of this article , to suggest only in barest outline how the history of
Europe	LOCATION	, or rather '' that past which is still living , '' appears when surveyed from the high vantage point of these general ideas .

		Three things of undying importance were achieved in the period of classical antiquity : the culture of the Greeks , the Roman conception of law and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and the revelation of Christ ; achievements , in the case of the Greeks and the Romans , of distinct races , in the case of
Christ	LOCATION	, of the preeminent individual .

		The Romans , it is true , produced no culture in the highest sense .

		Yet the '' Roman , too , is an artist of mighty creating power an artist in the clear , plastic shaping of the complicated machine of the state . ''

		Greater than the work of either Greek or Roman was the revelation of Christ , the birth of Christ being incomparably the most important event in human history .

		In a single sentence , '' the kingdom of God is within you , '' he revealed once for all the essence of all true religion .

		His teaching is absolutely hostile to 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, historical and materialistic religions , such as that of the Jews , and to religions in which salvation is based upon a prescribed system of good works , such as that of Roman Catholicism .

		It is hostile to them because it asserts , while they deny , the inestimable worth of the individual : '' His out - ward lot does not correspond to his inner worth ; and thus it is that life becomes tragic , and only by tragedy does history receive a purely human purport . ''

		The supreme significance of the work of the Greeks and Romans , and of Christ , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	sums up thus : '' In art and philo - sophy man becomes conscious of himself , in contrast to nature , as an intellectual being ; in marriage and law he becomes conscious of himself as a social being , in
Christ	LOCATION	as a moral being . ''

		Thus by the beginning of the Christian era man had already '' entered into the daylight of life . ''

		But now come evil days .

		The Romans , gaining the whole world , lost their own soul .

		`` The spirit of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' as
Jhering	PERSON	says , `` is an acid '' : and unfortunately so , for no race or nation was able to resist the corrosive action of that dissolvent , and the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	world sank back into that abomination of abomina - tions , a '' Chaos of Peoples . ''

		Fit only for slavery , nothing worthy could be expected of that raceless horde . ''

		Mongrels held the whip hand , '' and constructed , out of the decadent Roman conception of Ca3sarism which replaced the true Roman ideal of the state , and the his - torical and materialistic religion of the Jews which was grafted on to the religion of
Christ	LOCATION	, and the systematizing scholastic principle inherent in
Aristotle	LOCATION	, that ingenious instru - ment of bondage , the neo-Roman-ecclesiastical -
Imperium	LOCATION	.

		Inspired by the doctrines credo ut intelligam and quod principi placuit leges vigorem habet ^ it was and could not but be the most irreconcilable enemy of all individualism in thought and conduct .

		This , then , is the tragedy of European history , '' that the in - herited culture of antiquity ... was not transmitted to us by a definite people but by a nationless mixture without physiognomy ... by the raceless chaos of the decaying Roman empire .

		Our whole intellectual development is still under the curse of this unfortunate inter - mediary stage ; it is this that supplies weapons to the anti-national , anti-racial powers even in the nineteenth century . ''

		And what saved us from this degrading bondage ?

		Why , the entry of the Teutons into western
Europe	LOCATION	.

		From that day to this our history becomes , `` in a certain sense , '' `` a struggle between
Teuton	PERSON	and non-Teuton , be - tween Germanic sentiment and anti-Germanic disposition , a struggle which is waged partly externally , philosophy against philosophy , partly internally , in the breast of the
Teuton	LOCATION	himself . ''

		In the so-called Middle Ages -LRB- Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has done away with the Middle Ages and the Renaissance , the most misleading conceptions imaginable -RRB- the struggle took the form of a conflict between the principles of nationalism and universal empire .

		The Reformation , pri - marily a political movement , freed the nations from Roman control , and since then the suc - cessful assertion of Teutonic individuality and nationality in science , industry , politics , relig - ion , art , the rise of a new world and a new culture , the Teutonic , is the cardinal fact of western history .

		The French Revolution was not the beginning of a new era , but the begin - ning of the end of Roman domination , although even in the nineteenth century anti-Teutonic forces , such as socialism and the neo-scholastic movement , are still operative .

		The force with which the author presents his argument , the wealth of information , the keen insight , the persuasive conviction which he brings to its support , must be taken for granted : the bare skeleton which we offer here gives no - hint of what is really most vital in the book .

		I scarcely feel justified , therefore , in offering any criticism .

		Yet to press the facts into his formula , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	is seemingly forced to depart somewhat from his own theory of race .

		He tells us , indeed , that he uses the term Teutonic der Germane in a very broad sense , including under it Celts and Slavs . ''

		We Teutons , '' who have kept the faith and fought the good fight against the Chaos of Peo - ples , become frequently wonderfully attenuated , often dissolving , in fact , into the thin air of an abstract conception .

		The struggle between
Teuton	PERSON	and non-Teuton is almost identical with the opposition between the ideal of the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	and the ideal of freedom : who - ever opposes
Rome	LOCATION	is a
Teuton	LOCATION	, whoever sup - ports it is a non-Teuton ; so that
Dante	PERSON	is a
Teuton	LOCATION	, and
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		is sometimes one , as in
1682	DATE	, and sometimes not , as in
1685	DATE	.

		And when Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	publishes his book on the nineteenth century as he gives us reason to hope that he will we may expect to see the Italians emerge from the Chaos of Peoples under the leadership of that splendid
Teuton	LOCATION	,
Camillo di Cavour	ORGANIZATION	.

		Certainly the opposition between liberty and authority , between nation - alism and universalism , between nominalism and realism , is a formula which simplifies and
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 391 illuminates much of European history during the last thousand years .

		Probably no other single formula is equally useful .

		But when we substitute
Teuton	PERSON	for liberty , nationalism , and nominalism , Chaos of Peoples for authority , universalism , and realism , the terms must be understood so elastically that they have scarcely any meaning at all .

		We seem , therefore , to be confronted with a dilemma : the
Teuton	PERSON	race , by the author 's own definition of race , becomes either an abstraction or else a new Chaos of Peoples .

		However , it is not necessary to think with Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	that we Teutons are the people and that wisdom will die with us , in order to find his book of value .

		It is of great value , among historical works , likely to rank with the most significant of the nineteenth century .

		Its high value does not reside in the most general theories , the universal formulas , along which the main argument travels , but rather in the suggestive and penetrating things said by the way .

		One despairs of conveying any adequate idea of the intellectual mastery of many diverse subjects which the book reveals , or of the profound reflection by which the author has avoided the taint of erudition without ceas - ing to be learned , or the penetrating insight and the keen analysis , the brilliant originality , the trenchant humor , which give the work its distinction and its fascination .

		It should not be one of the books that are , as
Emile Faguet	PERSON	says of the
Encyclopedia	ORGANIZATION	, more celebrated than known .

		It should be read .

		But it should be read with an open mind .

		If the reader can drop for the moment any notions of history , science , religion , art or politics that he may have formed , he will assuredly find it , as Lord Redesdale has found it , `` a simple delight fulfilling the highest function of which a teacher is capable , that of awakening thought and driving it into new channels .

		passed through more than fifteen large editions , '' writes Mr.
Winter	PERSON	in his new preface , at the same time making a slight bibliographical mis - take in ascribing the date
1892	DATE	to the first American issue of the little classic , which really appeared in the Christmas holiday season of
1890	DATE	.

		* In reshaping his material , the author has withdrawn the sketches of Scottish travel and replaced them with several papers on En - glish themes , first published in '' Old Shrines and Ivy '' -LRB- now long out of print -RRB- , and has added other sketches not before collected .

		A great deal of re-writing and correcting has also been done , so that the new '' Gray Days and Gold '' has comparatively little of the old about it excepting the sunshine of the author 's manner and the freshness of his view of the hoary and the historic .

		Into the new book , '' Over the Border , '' have gone chapters of the old that pictured scenes north of the
Cheviot Hills	ORGANIZATION	, and also others subsequently written and taking the reader into the
Highlands	LOCATION	and to storm-bound lona .

		While in the two preceding volumes of this set the evident purpose was to interweave a thread of Shakespearean interest , in the third or Scottish volume it is , appropriately enough , the author of '' Waverley '' who is made to supply the warp of association for Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's woof of narrative and description .

		Turning to one of the distinctly Shake - spearean chapters of the '' Gray Days , '' a chap - ter entitled '' Rambles in
Arden	LOCATION	, '' we have not long to hunt before hitting upon a bit of gold of the author 's thought and fancy .

		A ramble to
Wootton	LOCATION	, six miles from
Stratford	LOCATION	, moves him to the following reflections : `` The actual life of all places , when you come to know it well , proves to be , for the most part , conven - tional , commonplace , and petty .

		Human beings , with here and there an exception , are dull , each , in that respect , resembling the other , and each needlessly laborious to increase the resemblance .

		In this regard all parts of the world are alike , and therefore the happiest traveller is he who keeps mostly alone , and uses his eyes , and communes with his thoughts .

		The actual life of Wootton is , doubtless , much like that of other hamlets , a bickering tenor of church squabbles , village gossip , and discontented grumbling , diversified with feeding , drinking , cricket , golf , lawn tennis , matri - mony , birth , and death .

		But as I looked around upon the group of nestling cottages , the broad meadows , green and cool in the shadow of densely mantled trees , and the ancient church , gray and faded with antiquity .

		slowly crumbling amid the everlasting vitality of Na - ture , I felt that here , perhaps , might be discovered a permanent haven of refuge from the incessant platitude and triviality of ordinary experience and the empty strife and din of the world . ''

		Of course another visitor to the places in Mr. 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Winter	ORGANIZATION	's itinerary might easily find the peo - ple , individually and collectively , vastly more interesting than the historic scenes and noble buildings which have kindled the writer 's en - thusiasm .

		Few have the faculty of seeing all that there is to see and enjoy in a tour of
England	LOCATION	, or of any other country .

		Confining ourselves , therefore , to what most appeals to our present conductor , let us take a look at the renovated
Shakespeare Church	ORGANIZATION	, of which , in a chapter not found in the earlier editions of his work , the author takes occasion to say : `` Now that so many old things have been made new , the devotees of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may be asked what it is of which they think they have reason to complain .

		Their answer is ready .

		They wanted to have the church repaired ; they did not want to have it rebuilt .

		The
Shakespeare Church	ORGANIZATION	is a national monument .

		More than that , it is a literary shrine for all the world .

		There was an indescribable poetic charm about the old edifice , which had been bestowed upon it not by art , but by time .

		That charm should have been left untouched .

		Nothing should ever have been done to impair it .

		The building had acquired character .

		It had become venerable with age , storied with associa - tion , and picturesque with quaintness ... Above all , it had enshrined , for nearly three hundred years , the ashes of the greatest poet that ever lived .

		All that was asked was that it should be left alone .

		To repair it in certain particulars became a necessity , but to alter it was to do an irreparable harm .

		That harm has been done ; and it is that which the Shakespeare en - thusiast resents and deplores . ''

		Then follow the author 's expressions of '' amazement and sorrow '' as he surveys the '' modern improvements , '' and his description of the more striking of these changes , which are more or less familiar to all who have visited
Stratford	LOCATION	and its church since
1892	DATE	.

		In another newly-added chapter , on
Tenny	PERSON	- son , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	gives eloquent utterance to his admiration for the poet , without trying , appar - ently , to string him on to the Shakespearean thread of the book ; but that matters not .

		The secret of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's greatness reveals itself to him somewhat as follows : '' The transcendent attributes of power that
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's poems disclose are heart and imagination .

		Their vitality of feeling , never shown in discord or tumult , but always present , like the central heat of the sun , is colossal , and , looking back on the current of his years and the incessant fertility of his achievement , it is not less than marvellous that such intense emotion should have kept itself alive in him for so long a time .

		Al - most to the end his voice was a clarion and his pen was fire .

		In his poem of <
Locksley Hall Sixty Years After	ORGANIZATION	' there is the same strain of noble , impassioned feeling , loftier , grander , more predominant and more
august	DATE	, if possible , that burns in the `
Locksley Hall	PERSON	' of his vigorous , splendid youth .

		He did not need to go out of himself for inspiration .

		The flame leaped from within .

		The altar was never darkened and never cold .

		Every influence that the experience and environment of his life could liberate became tremulous with sensi - bility and eloquent with meaning , the moment it touched his mind .

		It was as if the wandering breeze derived warmth , fragrance , and deathless melody from only sweeping the strings of the harp that had been placed to receive its caress . ''

		As a companion piece to this we select from the second of the two volumes under review a passage from Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's glowing tribute to the genius of Scott : '' If ever there was a man who lived to be and not to seem , that man was
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		He made no pretensions .

		He claimed nothing , but he simply and earnestly earned all .

		His means were the oldest and the best , self-respect , hard work , and fidelity to duty .

		The development of his nature was slow , but it was thorough and it was salutary .

		He was not hampered by precocity and he was not spoiled by conceit .

		He acted according to himself , honoring his individuality and obeying the inward monitor of his genius .

		But , combined with the delicate instinct of a gentleman , he had the wise insight , foresight , and patience of a phil - osopher , and therefore he respected the individuality of others , the established facts of life , and the settled conventions of society .

		His mind was neither embit - tered by revolt nor sickened by dehision .

		A very readable chapter of '' Over the Border '' is devoted to a sojourn , lengthened by stress of weather from a few hours to five days , in the island of lona , which is described as three miles long by one and a half wide at its widest , and as supporting a population of about two hundred , who maintain a church and a school , and , in the school building , a library of nearly five hundred volumes , to which Mr.
Winter	PERSON	has added another hundred .

		In further description of this happy land we read : '' The inhabitants are generally religious and are orderly , courteous , and gentle .

		No physician dwells in the place and no resident of it is ever sick .

		Death may come by drowning or by other accident , but , as a rule , the people live until they are worn out , and so expire , naturally , from extreme age .

		The Gaelic lang - guage , although it is dying away in the
Highlands	LOCATION	, is still spoken in lona .

		The minister , preaching on alter - nate
Sundays	DATE	at lona and at
Bunessan	LOCATION	, in Mull , speaks in English first , and then repeats his discourse in Gaelic , or be reverses that order , and for both sermons he has an audience .

		It was my good fortune to hear his dis - course in company with about fifty other persons , seated on wooden benches in a whitewashed room , and I have not heard a preacher more devout , earnest , sincere , and simple ... The Presbyterian house of worship was built in
1830	DATE	, and it is a primitive sort of structure , now much dilapidated ; but in every attribute that should appertain to the character of a clergyman its minister would do honor to the finest church in the kingdom . ''

		Not only in this journey to the
Hebrides	LOCATION	, but also in a visit to
Lichfield	PERSON	-LRB- described in the other volume -RRB- does the author cross the track of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, to whom he pays appropriate tribute , to the advantage and entertainment of

		There is occa - sional appropriate use of poetic quotation , ac - cording to Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's pleasant custom , but the group of original poems appended to the earlier edition of '' Gray Days and Gold '' is not found in this latest issue , possibly because these poems have in the meantime been ac - corded a more fitting place in the author 's complete poetical works .

		The abundant views and portraits in the two volumes combine with the large and clear typography and beautiful binding to make the books as satisfying in appearance as they are excellent in literary quality .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE XEEIXLESS MAKIXG OF ; LAWS .

		A few years ago , when Judge
Alton B. Parker	PERSON	, in the midst of so much anti-trust agitation and legislation , declared that very little trust legislation was needed and that the corporations could be controlled by the enforcement of the common law by state judiciary , he was practi - cally laughed out of court .

		After reading Pro- fessor
Stimson	PERSON	's treatise on '' Popular Law - Making , '' one may still not agree with Judge
Parker	PERSON	, but one will at least see that there is something to be said on his side of the contro - versy .

		The author certainly shows that ills popu - larly supposed to be modern are hoary with age , and that the laws intended to check these evils are but re-statements of acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	passed centuries ago , or re-statements of the common law .

		For example , he shows that '' all contracts in unreasonable restraint of trade were always unlawful in
England	LOCATION	and are so therefore by our common law . ''

		The first use of the expres - sion '' restraint of trade '' occurs in
1436	DATE	, when companies were forbidden to charge prices for their wares `` for their own profit and to the common hurt of the people . ''

		The only necessity then , thinks Professor
Stimson	PERSON	, for anti-trust legislation by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is merely to extend the principles of the com - mon law to inter-state commerce and to impose proper penalties .

		So far , he thinks , '' we have found nothing new , either in remedy or offense . ''

		Indeed , we are still behind our ancestors ; for they made an exception of reasonable restraint * POPULAR LAW-MAKIXG .

		of trade , but the Sherman act does not .

		In the matter of penalties , we simply fine the Beef Trust the paltry sum of
$ 25,000	MONEY	, though the forestaller of
1352	DATE	must forfeit the surplus over cost to the crown and suffer imprisonment for two years .

		However , it should be added that the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	is at last waking up to the inadequacy of fines and is giving more attention to criminal prosecutions .

		A few examples to illustrate the similarity between ancient and modern legislation will be of interest .

		One of the greatest evils we have had to fight has been the discrimination in rates for transportation ; back in the fourteenth cen - tury a ferryman was punished for charging less for the ferriage of a large drove of sheep than for a smaller number , '' contrary to the common custom of the realm . ''

		To-day we look with a sort of admiring wonder on a Leiter or a
Patton	PERSON	when he attempts to '' corner '' any particular commodity at least we did until very re - cently ; in the middle ages this was called '' forestalling '' or '' regrating , '' and was a great offense , indeed , Bishop
Hatto	PERSON	paid for it with his life .

		Happily , we are getting back to the mediaeval idea , and the demand for legislation against gambling in '' futures '' to '' the com - mon hurt of the people '' is becoming more insistent , especially on the part of the cotton planter in the South and the consumers of wheat bread .

		Certainly it ought to apply to such staple articles of food as beef , pork , and wheat .

		The u
Iowa	LOCATION	idea , '' thought to have been originated by
Senator Cummins	PERSON	, that when a trust gets complete control of any in - dustry its surplus profits should be forfeited to the state , either by means of a franchise tax or by abolishing the tariff on that article , dates back to a fourteenth-century statute which declared that all who bought up all the foreign product of any article must forfeit all the profits to the state .

		If to the
Oklahoma	LOCATION	law requiring hotels to furnish sheets nine feet long , we add the statute of
1495	DATE	regulating abuses in stuffing feather beds , perhaps legislation on that subject will be complete .

		In this striking way Professor
Stimson	PERSON	has brought before the reader the similarity be - tween the evils and the legislation of the past and present .

		But even where not enlivened in this way , the book is no mere enumeration of dry facts .

		It sets forth in a readable style the early laws relating to labor , such as fixing wages , compulsory labor , trades unions , etc. , and the laws against combinations in restraint of trade and against trusts .

		Far more atten - 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, tion is given to modern , especially American , legislation .

		Here we have , in very concise and usable form , the main legislation on property rights , rates and prices , monopolies , corpora - tions , and the whole problem of labor .

		Nor does the author merely summarize the laws ; he also enlivens them with discriminating com - ment and criticism .

		The
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	case exercised a beneficent influence in its day in strengthen - ing nationalism ; but it also had a baneful influence in strengthening vested interests .

		Mainly because of the former , perhaps , it has exercised a strange sort of fascination over our ` udges , so that they have been unwilling to reverse it by name , though they have rendered a number of decisions not only inconsistent with it , but diametrically opposed to it .

		For example ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	granted a perpetual franchise to a corporation to make beer -LRB- 1827 -RRB- , and later passed a law that no corporation should make beer ; likewise ,
Minnesota	LOCATION	granted a perpetual franchise to a railroad to fix its own fares , and then took away the right , and the later laws were upheld in both cases .

		In this way , under the police power , of which the states can not divest themselves , we are making waste paper of the
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	decision ,
Fletcher vs. Peck	PERSON	, and other cases which pur - ported to be based on that clause of the Con - stitution which forbids any state to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract .

		Also , if a citizen of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	who marries his cousin in
Delaware	LOCATION	and then returns to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	finds his marriage void and him - self guilty of a criminal offense , it looks as if we were tearing to tatters that clause which says that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts , records , and judi - cial proceedings of the several states .

		Some of the author 's conclusions will hardly be accepted by many .

		Most people probably will not go so far as he in assuming that the common law is adequate to the ills of to-day , considering the tremendous economic and social changes which have taken place since it was fixed , unless we are to allow our judges to go on making common law .

		Strangely enough , he would reject the
Sherman	PERSON	anti-trust law because it '' dispenses with a jury and throws unnecessarily upon the court a distant high court of appeals the burden of determining a complicated and voluminous mass of fact . ''

		Surely a court , even a distant court of appeals , is more competent to do this than an ordinary jury '' of the vicinage . ''

		While this book is very readable , some of the English to which it introduces us must be the king 's , for the writer can not believe that it is Taf t 's - ^ - that is , American .

		If he should venture to say '' certain definite named trades , '' surely he would not perpetrate '' the very most skilful , '' or write '' while the
Buffalo	LOCATION	case at most only a geographical one . ''

		CURIOSITIES OF DRESS IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* A study of the costumes of past ages is of more than ordinary interest to a large number of people , including artists , actors , and students of history and literature ; and probably in no other country can this study be pursued with more satisfactory results than in
England	LOCATION	, where there has never been a distinctive national cos - tume adopted and maintained , where fashions have undergone many changes , and in the fif - teenth and sixteenth centuries reached the high - est pitch of extravagance as regards sleeves , farthingales , collars , shoes , and head-dress .

		Hitherto among the numerous writers upon the subject , Mr.
F. W. Fairholt	PERSON	has been regarded as the greatest authority , and his work on '' Costume in
England	LOCATION	'' is still cited by whoever enters the field of his studies .

		The authors of the two volumes before us have adopted distinct modes of treatment of appar - ently the same subject , namely , the changing fashions of dress to which the people of
England	LOCATION	of the various classes were from time to time subjected from the earliest historic period down to the nineteenth century ; and the success to which each has attained in presenting a history of costumes suggests that the history of dress is not an exact science and the field is still open for students to develop other phases of a very broad subject .

		THE DIAL 395 of life of the wearer , and not his ordinary every-day dress .

		So , while not neglecting the special formal and professional dress of the period of which he writes , but wishing to be more accurate in his description of the dress of the people in their less self-conscious hours , he relies more upon contemporary illuminations and paintings which depict the people when not on dress-parade and while pursuing their ordin - ary avocations .

		He finds documentary evidence of what people wore , in ancient wills and in - ventories , which not only give the names of articles of dress now obsolete , but describe them and tell of what materials they were made .

		He is fortunate also in many cases to find in museums actual costumes , preserved from re - mote times , upon which he can bestow a careful study .

		So , after presenting in three chapters the data available regarding the dress of the prehistoric inhabitants of the island , and show - ing something of the development of clothing , and the influence of the Roman , Anglo-Saxon , and
Norman	PERSON	occupation of the country upon the dress of the people , he classifies the later dress of the English by centuries , from the twelfth to the eighteenth inclusive , and devotes a chap - ter to each century .

		Such a classification is purely arbitrary and conventional , and fails to account for the influences operating from time to time to change the fashion of clothing , both for men and women , to a remarkable degree ; yet it seems to serve his convenience , his pur - pose apparently being to describe accurately the dress worn at a certain period without at - tempting to give the reason for its taking that form at that particular time .

		His remaining chapters are devoted to a consideration of Mediaeval and later garments ; Military ,
Eccle	PERSON	- siastical , Monastic , Academic , and Legal cos - tume ; Coronation and Parliamentary robes , and the robes of the orders of Chivalry , etc. .

		, the matter for these chapters being arranged in encyclopaedic form and generally in alphabetical order .

		Mrs.
Ashdown	PERSON	's point of view is that of an expert adviser in the various great pageants which have taken place in
England	LOCATION	of late years .

		It is the spectacular value of the costumes of the past which attracts her attention , and she pays great respect to the memorial brasses , regarding them as furnishing more authentic information of the dress of the people than all other sources put together .

		Her classification of fashions is by the reigning sovereigns , which seems rational , for a change of sovereign un - doubtedly resulted in changes in the fashions of dress ; and she attempts a classification of the costume of ladies based upon the style of head-dress , without , however , giving a very plausible reason therefor .

		With exceeding patience , she describes in order the changes of fashion - which took place in each succeeding reign in the attire of both men and women .

		Ecclesiastical costume she treats in a separate division of her book , confining her comments to that of the
Saxon	PERSON	and Angevin periods , end - ing with the latter part of the thirteenth cen - tury when the various articles of ecclesiastical dress are supposed to have been fully developed .

		A glossary of less than five pages at the end of the text explains the nature of the materials used for clothing in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, some of the names of which have become obsolete .

		Both books include under the term `` cos - tume '' everything resorted to for the adornment of the person rings , bracelets , chains , jewelry , and even the dressing of the hair and the trim - ming of the beard ; and both give due attention to garments for purposes of official , profes - sional , or ecclesiastical distinction .

		It is curious to note , however , that while both writers refer more or less explicitly to the sumptuary laws of the fourteenth , fifteenth , and sixteenth centuries , which prohibited handicraftsmen and yeomen from wearing clothes of greater value than '' 40 shillings the whole cloth , '' and restricting the '' use of cloth of gold or purple colour '' and purple silk to the
King	PERSON	and his immediate family , they scarcely mention the act passed in
1679	DATE	requiring the burial of the dead in woollen , intended to lessen `` the importation of linen from beyond the seas , and for the encour - agement of the woollen and paper manufac - tures of the Kingdom , '' which must have had a marked effect upon the costume of the people .

		The value of these volumes is greatly en - hanced by their illustrations .

		These are princi - pally sketches , drawings , and photographs from tombs and brasses , from miniatures in illuminated manuscripts , and from historical paintings and portraits ; to which are added , in Mrs.
Ashdown	PERSON	's book , colored plates photo - graphed from '' examples '' worn by models .

		Altogether , there are about seven hundred illus - trations ; and these , with the descriptive text , glossaries , and other aids , provide the reader with the means of forming mental pictures of the men and women mentioned by English writers from the time of Chaucer down , and of appre - ciating the ridiculous extravagancies to which the fashions of dress at times carried the English people .

		396 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Old English Musi ?

		-LCB- s now evidently turning from musical creation to reflection , from produc - instruments .

		t j on to ana ly 8 is .

		While the era of creation is not over , it seems clear that the method of the masters is beginning to be subjected to criti - cal study , and the historical evolution of music is entering upon the scientific phase of its understand - ing and exposition .

		So the study of the origin and development of musical instruments has assumed new proportions and significance .

		The great na - tions have produced orchestras individualized and differentiated ; the instruments have not been the same ; the effects have been varied .

		It has been an achievement of comparatively recent times to establish an orchestra that is inclusive and dominant .

		In Mr.
Francis W. Galpin	PERSON	's '' Old English Instru - ments of Music '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- we have a treatment of the subject in every way adequate and at the same time interesting .

		The author has given us an important chapter in the evolution of the modern orchestra ; he has put under contribution sculpture , architecture , painting , as well as the printed sources of information ; he has delved in old libraries and conned difficult manuscripts ; he has examined ancient scores requiring translation into the modern notation ; he has visited the museums , with their collections of crude and tentative instruments .

		The result is decidedly noteworthy .

		Mr.
Galpin	PERSON	says : '' The musical development of the human race has been divided by some writers into three stages .

		In the first our forefathers delighted themselves with the rhythmic beat of the drum , in the second they made merry with the cheerful strains of the pipe , in the third they began to appreciate the subtle refinements of the stringed instrument . ''

		In the execution of his theme Mr.
Galpin	PERSON	follows the reverse order .

		He treats first of the old English stringed instruments , rote , crowd , rebec , mandore , virginal ; then he discusses the wind instruments , recorders , shawms , sack - buts , organs positive and portative ; next the percus - sion instruments , primitive and least important , tabers , nakers , cymbals , chimes ; finally the con - sort , the way in which these instruments were brought together , making an orchestra so specialized that it may be denominated an English orchestra .

		The story is carried to the middle of the eighteenth century , when the early and narrowly distinctive features of the consort developed into the splendid resources of mature music , the orchestra to whose highest achievements we are listening now .

		The subject is elaborated with a wealth of illuminating material and references to other lands and times , an intimate acquaintance with the literature of the changing instruments , that imply the devotion of many years .

		The publishers have fully seconded the work of the author , and enhanced each topic with admirable and curious illustrations .

		The book is further enriched with a copious and valuable bibliography .

		A tribute to From childhood 's happy hour to the our greatest present time , Mr.
Archibald Hen	PERSON	- humorist .

		derson has been an eager reader of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, to whom he now pays worthy tribute in a very readable study of his life and work , entitled simply , `` Mark Twain '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		`` My personal association with Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	, '' he relates in his preface , '' comparatively brief though it was an ocean voyage , meetings here and there , a brief stay as a guest in his home gave me at last the justification for paying the debt which , with the years , had grown greater and more insistently obligatory .

		I felt both relief and pleasure when he authorized me to pay that debt by writing an interpretation of his life and work . ''

		He groups his matter under four headings , `` The Man , '' `` The Humorist , '' `` The World-Famed Genius , '' and `` Philosopher , Moralist , Sociologist . ''

		In the first of these sections he carries the biographical outline to the point where Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has taken it up in `` My
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' and in all of them he draws skilfully both on his personal memories of the humorist and on a variety of less direct but not necessarily less authentic sources of information .

		Naturally the tenor of his pages is prevailingly panegyric , and few readers will not delight to go all the way with him in his praise of one whom he links with
Walt Whitman	PERSON	as distinctly and su - premely American in his contribution to universal literature .

		But he need not in the same breath have ascribed only '' derivative genius '' to
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	.

		From Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's memories of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, which contribute no little to the charm of his books , the following may here be quoted : ``
Samuel Langhorne Clemens	PERSON	impressed me as the most complete and human individual I have ever known .

		He was not a great thinker ; his views were not ' advanced . '

		The glory of his temperament was its splendid sanity , balance , and normality .

		The homeliest virtues of life were his the republican virtue of simplicity ; the domestic virtue of personal purity and passionately simple regard for the sanctity of the marriage bond ; the civic virtue of public honesty ; the business virtue of .

		stainless private honor .


Mark Twain	PERSON	was one of the supreme literary geniuses of his time .

		But he was something more than this .

		He was not simply a great genius : he was a great man . ''

		Oc - casional strange words or usages arrest the attention in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's pages , as '' inveigh '' in the sense of '' inveigle '' ; and intransigeance , with un - accountable accent ; and '' comedic '' ; and '' remi - niscential , '' with its archaic and superfluous final syllable .

		Excellent portraits of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, in - cluding several in colors , are supplied by Mr.
Alvin Langdon Coburn	PERSON	, and a fifteen-page bibliography is appended .

		THE DIAI , 397 confessions , these are the elements out of which Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	moulds his dainty trifles , plainly the diversions of his active mind , as they are meant , later , for the diversion of sympathetic readers .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	travels , sketches French cathedrals or English woodlands , communes with follow-tourists and his own soul , wonders , with sober cheerfulness , about the deeper meanings of life , and constructs allegories to satirize some of its follies .

		Having , in other years , trifled entertainingly '' On Nothing '' and '' On Everything , '' he now resourcefully puts forth a vol - ume ki On Something '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		Its table of con - tents is , as always with Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, inviting : '' A Plea for the Simple Drama , '' '' On Unknown People , '' '' The Monkey Question : An Appeal to Common Sense , '' '' On Bridges , '' '' The Way to Fairyland , '' `` The Tree of Knowledge , '' these are titles that tempt to a further consideration of the small volume whose dainty size and gay cover give it an appropriately festal spring-tide air .

		Here are no Chestertonian paradoxes , no double-edged Shavian humors , none of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's shifting dis - satisfactions with things as they are .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	finds the world on the whole pretty good ; to him the things you can not understand are not causes for complaint but objects of interest ; the things you do not like furnish agreeable contrasts to those you do .

		For instance , a lying guide-book in a hotel at
Palma	LOCATION	leads Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	to the planning of a delectable guide-book by himself , wherein shall be recorded valuable truths about hotels where the landlords are nice , about the difficulties of negotiating harbors in small craft , the joy of climbing ordinary moun - tains , and '' how to make men pleasant to you ac - cording to their climate and country . ''

		In compar - ing the delights of historical study with those of travel , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	notes that both attract by `` the element of discovery and surprise , notably in little details . ''

		We suspect that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	might accept the same formula as summarizing his pleasure in life , and consequently as the keynote to his liter - ary expression .

		Those who prefer the well-beaten tracks , the large effects , and the grand manner , will not care for Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	.

		But leisurely collectors of the small oddities , the obscure finenesses , and the little-considered savours and qualities of life will welcome '' On Something , '' and will even respectfully suggest the pleasant possibility of another year 's sheaf of sketches '' On Something More . ''

Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	emerges from the new field covered by the latter volume -LRB- Appleton -RRB- with his reputation as a careful observer and impartial critic still unimpaired .

		Not everyone who travels the broad highway around the world can write a book en route .

		Fortunately there are few who set themselves such a task .

		And yet the observations and impressions of one of our foremost students of history and politics are bound to be of interest and value to those who would study so many-sided a subject as the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Profes - sor
Hart	PERSON	spent the greater part of a year during
1908-9	DATE	on a world tour from east to west .

		At the time he contributed a series of special articles to the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' and the present volume reproduces these articles with certain editorial changes .

		`` Beginning with the
American Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, to which six chapters are devoted , the narrative includes notes on
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	, Straits Settlements ,
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The chap - ters on
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	show that Professor
Hart	PERSON	had exceptional opportunities for investigation , and that he availed himself of them , a day in a court in
Shanghai	LOCATION	, for , example , affords the material for a most interesting chapter .

		Valuable also are the chapters on Japanese politics and Chinese adminis - tration .

		Throughout this discussion the author 's attitude is notably fair and generous .

		`` The ad - vantages of peace and a respectful treatment and recognition of the greatness of
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, are national assets which should be carefully con - served by American statesmen . ''

		In the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines Professor
Hart	PERSON	was impressed with the great improvements of the past ten years and with the admirable administration which the amateur colonizers have established there .

		`` Not a
State	ORGANIZATION	in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	has such good articulation between the central authority and the local , such safeguards against robbery of the treasury and also against the crime of putting weak and incompetent men into power .

		Probably no
State	ORGANIZATION	in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	has brought about such changes in the order and prosperity of the community in a single period of ten years . '' ''

		Certainly it is a genuinely altruistic attempt to carry Western civilization where it is sorely needed . ''

		Chapters on '' The Pax Britannica , '' '' The Paradise of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' The Delusions of
Egypt	LOCATION	'' conclude a volume which is always good reading and which presents a considerable body of useful information .

		Some of the statements , how - ever , are not altogether trustworthy , the editing having failed to remove a number of minor errors .

		Ramble , in Frankly pleading guilty to the charge and about the of '' rambling along with the irrespon - landofbookt .

Adrian Hoffman Joline	PERSON	dis - courses wittily , and with abundance of illustrative anecdote , on a pleasing variety of more or less bookish or learned topics in his volume of '' Edge - hill Essays '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- .

		Eight papers , beginning with a delightfully aimless saunter `` About the Bookshelves , '' continuing with talks about auto - graphs and their collectors , about
Mark Akenside	PERSON	and
Francis Jeffrey	PERSON	, and ending with a disquisition on manners and another on the American college of to-day , make up this welcome successor to Mr.
Joline	PERSON	's previously published volumes in the same general class of literature .

		He modestly hesitates to style himself an essayist , since , as
Henley	ORGANIZATION	has declared , '' essayists , like poets , are born and not made . ''

		Nevertheless he here proves himself , more 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, convincingly than ever before , an essayist of the most pleasantly recreative sort .

		That he believes in both work and recreation , appears from the follow - ing , chosen at random as agreeably representative of his style : '' All work and no play makes
Jack	PERSON	a dull boy , we know ; but all play and no work makes
Jack	PERSON	a very stupid and silly boy , and
Jill	PERSON	comes tumbling after . ''

		The longest chapter in the book is that on
Jeffrey	PERSON	, which is reinforced with frequent and ample quotation and displays no little research .

		Most characteristic of the author 's felicitous style are such shorter essays as the opening and closing ones , and warmly to be commended is his defense of the good old-fashioned college education of the time when Plancus was consul and science and the voca - tional courses had not become rampant . ''

		No one can justly be called a scholar , '' asserts Mr.
Joline	PERSON	, '' who has no knowledge whatever of Greek or Latin . ''

		As is only natural in the unstudied pages of so rapid a writer , slight slips of the pen are not in - frequent , as ''
George Chesterton	PERSON	'' when
Gilbert	PERSON	is undoubtedly meant , meo judice '' and '' millinium . ''

		One is amused by the rambling essayist 's incidental allusion to his '' abhorrence of all discursiveness . ''

		A more wittily and agreeably discursive author we have seldom had the happiness to encounter .

		Excursion * to Dream books vaI 7 from the penny the world dreadful type to the doctor 's disserta - of dreams .

		tion .

		The public has a considerable interest in knowing what dreams are , and the in - dividual has a particular interest in inquiring what his dreams mean .

		Dreams are like stories : the ones we ourselves tell are the best , and those of others strangely dull .

		The personal interest distorts the interpretation of dreams ; and yet all expeditions to the world of dreams must be personally conducted .

		To satisfy the popular tourist 's interests , and yet do justice to the scientific explorations , requires the combined services , in one , of a guide , philosopher , and friend , the sympathy of the last being especially necessary in the nebulous law of dreams .

		Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	's `` The World of Dreams '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- answers these purposes rather better than any similar volume yet issued .

		The analysis of dreams proceeds psychologically , is presented freshly and with due appreciation of recent contri - butions , and the conclusions are judiciously stated .

		The style is popular , the coordination good , the illus - trations apt , the freedom from misleading sugges - tions commendable .

		The most widely discussed of recent dream theories is that bearing the name of Dr.
Freud	PERSON	.

		He holds that dreams are saturated or flavored with motive , albeit frequently composed of emotions suppressed and content disguised .

		Dreams are not trivial , because the seemingly trivial is significant , and may be ominous .

		Dreams reveal , and reveal the subconscious ; the under-world debris of rejected material becomes the corner stone of the dream temple .

		The abnormal evidence for the view is rather striking , the normal less so .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	judges both fairly .

		Dreams offer no single formula of exposition ; they are of many minds .

		It takes a series of chapters to set forth the elements , the emotions , the logic , the sensations , the symbol - ism , the memory , the motives of dreams .

		The most comprehensive principle is the oneness , amid diversity and contrast , of the dreaming and the waking thinker .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's book is not a system - atic account of the psychology of dreams , and still less of the dream-processes .

		It is a judicious selec - tion of excursions to the world of dreams , well suited to guide and reward the reader 's interest .

		It is not too much to say that in Zune . ''

		The War Maker '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , which is offered as '' the true story of Captain
George B. Boynton	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Horace Smith	PERSON	presents as extraordinary and thrilling a narrative of filibustering and military and naval adventure of various sorts as can be found in recent literature .

		Taken down from the lips of
Boynton	LOCATION	himself , shortly before his peaceful death in
New York	LOCATION	last
January	DATE	, the story is told in the first person with all the jaunty arrogance , the unblushing complac - ency in more than questionable exploits , the exulta - tion in dare-deviltry , that distinguish his forty years of violence and bloodshed and hair-breadth escape from death in many forms . ''

		Snicker-snack '' goes his '' vorpal blade '' through all sorts of formidable foes , and he ever comes '' galumphing back '' with the joyousness of him who slew the Jabberwock .

		Many of his deeds have long since become matters of history , and it is also known that the name he has made famous round the world is an assumed one .

		Who he really was , beyond the fact that he was the son of a wealthy
New York	LOCATION	surgeon , and was born in
1842	DATE	, remains still to be discovered .

		His story contains love and romance as well as blockade-running , pirate-chasing , slave-dealing , revolution-fomenting , and many other kinds of des - perate adventure .

		He is said to be the original of Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's '' Soldier of Fortune , '' and from him Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	got the framework of his novel , '' The Beautiful White Devil . ''

		This latter personage appears in Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's book as the leading character in a chapter of unusual interest .

		Emphatically , '' The War Maker '' is a book for lovers of adventure to read .

		Whoever attempts to bring within ^ e compass of one volume a satis - factory exposition of the influence that women have exerted upon poets is a bold , not to say a rash , man .

		But when Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	in his '' Feminine Influence on the Poets '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- gives space to a chapter on '' Women as Poets , '' and considers such topics as the '' Inspiration of Poetry , '' `` Women , Nature , and Poetry , '' and the like , besides devoting five chapters to women as mothers , friends , mistresses , and patronesses in their influence upon poets , then he is sinking into dilettanteism .

		It is manifestly impossible to con - sider within a single volume even the chief poets
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 399 in this respect .

		Very few of them did not feel in one way or another the influence of women , and merely to point out that fact with a few not strik - ingly original comments does not add much to our comprehension of what feminine influence means .

		It was one thing to the poet of the court of love , another to the Elizabethan sonnetteer and the
Caroline	PERSON	lyrist , still another -LRB- if not almost negli - gible -RRB- to the neo-classicist , and something quite different to the romanticist .

		It would be interest - ing and not without profit to analyze these various influences , as shown in the works of the leading poets of their periods .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	merely hints at the differences , as when he points out the char - acteristic flavor of Spenser 's '' Epithalamium , '' but he does not treat the subject as much more than a personal matter between the poet and his friend or mistress , or whatever she was to him .

		The work does not come to a head or give any unified impres - sion of what this influence has meant in the de - velopment of poetry .

		We hear much of the eternal
Mary Fitton	PERSON	, of
Cowper	PERSON	's mother , of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's
Harriet	PERSON	and her successors in his idealized affec - tion , of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's
Dorothy	PERSON	, and of
Byron	PERSON	's polyglot rout ; but with all these the biographies have made us familiar to the point of weariness .

		What we should like to have , and what Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has by no means given us , is a comprehensive treat - ment of what feminine influence has meant in the making of poetry or in the marring of it .

		In his study entitled '' Sixtine Rome '' -LRB- ^ er
& Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
J. A. F. Orbaan	PERSON	writes about the papal city , not in the days of Sixtus IV. , as many laymen would expect , but of
Sixtus V.	PERSON	, who was at the head of the Church for five years , beginning with
1585	DATE	.

		Although he was an old man at his succession , his restless energy made tremendous changes in
Rome	LOCATION	during his brief incumbency , and the modern visitor to the city encounters his work at every turn .

		Un - fortunately , his constructive zeal was not tempered by any wise concern for the monuments of antiquity , and he often found himself building with one hand and tearing down with the other .

		But he was in - cessantly active , and he did '' change the face of
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		To his activity , and to various topics aris - ing more or less naturally , Dr.
Orbaan	PERSON	devotes nearly three hundred pages , grouping them under the captions : '' Porta Furba '' -LRB- the aqueducts and fountains -RRB- , `` The Sixtine Chapel in
Santa Maria Maggiore	LOCATION	, '' '' The Vatican Library , '' ''
Domenico Fontana	PERSON	'' -LRB- describing the career of this versatile architect , with a detailed account of the famous set - ting up of the obelisk in the square of St.
Peter	PERSON	's -RRB- , and '' The Destruction of the Septizonium . ''

		The author is genuinely interested in his subject , and has worked over his evidence with patient enthusiasm .

		But it is not easy to say that he has manifested a just sense of proportion .

		Furthermore , much of the material presented is such as would be of significance only to readers who are specially interested in the period , whereas the presentation obviously keeps the general reader in mind ; so that the volume incurs the danger of not being technical enough for the close student or popular enough for the many .

		The illustrations and typography are excellent .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
W. P. Jervis	PERSON	, author of '' The Encyclopedia of Ceramics '' and other works on the potter 's art , has arranged in book form a series of interesting papers on pottery-making and its history , first printed serially , under the general title '' A Pottery Primer . ''

		The book is issued by the

		It is as good value for the money as is often to be had .

		A study in German romanticism having
Karl Lebrecht Immermann	PERSON	for its central figure is the work of Dr.

F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	called '' The Common Sense Collector '' -LRB-
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It appeals not to those persons who collect for the sake of owning a collection , but to those who collect for the sake of beautifying their own homes .

		Many of these latter will not have a great deal of money to spend , and therefore must try to get full value for every penny .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's volume tells them '' How to Begin , '' '' How to Buy , '' discusses the matter of '' Odd Lots , '' and offers some `` Common Sense Cautions . ''

		Fifty-one illustrations are included of articles owned or rooms furnished by the author , based on the policy out - lined in the book .

		In commemoration of the Bible tercentenary , the

		The work is printed on
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper .

		It must not be for - gotten that the books of the Apocrypha were included in this original edition .

		At the same time , Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	has edited a companion work entitled '' Records of the 400 THE DIAL -LSB-

Jebb	PERSON	, and is marked by a few borrowings from Shakespearean phraseology .

		We have at the same time a translation of the '' -LRB-
Edipus Rex	PERSON	, '' by the hand of Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, pub - lished at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translator has dealt somewhat more literally with his Sophocles than with his Euripides , but we do not notice that he has become less felicitous as a writer of English poetry .

		A third classical translation comes to us from the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and gives us the epigrams of Martial , trans - lated by Mr.
Paul Nixon	PERSON	.

		This little volume is called '' A Roman Wit , '' a title for which Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	gives satisfactory account , being no little of a wit himself .

		The latest number in the series of pamphlets on '' Modern American Library Economy as illustrated by the
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, Free Public Library '' is devoted to '' The Business Branch , '' and is prepared by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	and Miss
Sarah B. Ball	PERSON	, the latter being the librarian in charge of the branch .

		`` As far as we know , '' writes Mr.
Dana	PERSON	, '' this is the first attempt to meet the needs of business men by placing a branch of a public library in the center of a city and supplying it with books and other material useful to those engaged in trade , manufacture , transportation , insurance , finance , and the like . ''

		The recent rapid growth of special librar - ies and the awakening of interest in their activities make especially timely the appearance of this pioneer work on the subject .

		It covers seventy-three pages and shows the same care in text and illustrations as do its pre - decessors in the series .

		-LRB-

Newark	LOCATION	,
N.J.	LOCATION	-RRB-
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	died nearly half a century ago , and it is difficult to adjust our minds to the fact that the friend of Shelley outlived the poet so long .

		But we supposed at least that the whole of
Peacock	LOCATION	's work was in our hands , only now learning that the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	is the custodian of a large amount of unpublished matter , from which three plays , hitherto unknown , have been rescued .

		Dr.
A. B. Young	PERSON	,
Peacock	PERSON	's biographer , is the one to whom we are indebted for `` The Plays of
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	, '' now published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		In one sense , the discovery is not surprising , considering
Peacock	PERSON	's well - known predilection for things of the stage .

		The plays are entitled '' The Dilettanti , '' '' The Circle of Loda '' -LRB- in verse -RRB- , and `` The Three Doctors . ''

		They are not positively dated , but they are approximately a hundred years old .

		All Peacockians -LRB- and they are many -RRB- will be delighted with this trouvaille , so unexpected as well so welcome .

		NOTES .

		In the new novel , ''
Marjorie	PERSON	, '' upon which he is now at work , Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	is said to be turning his attention to the problems of household economy .

		An interesting booklet dealing with the life and writings of Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons for gratuitous circulation .

		Mr.
Ridgwell Cullum	PERSON	's The Trail of the Axe , '' a story of the lumber camps of
Western Canada	LOCATION	, will be published immediately by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's novel , The Street of To-day , '' which is attracting marked attention from the English reviewers , will appear in this country with the
Dutton	PERSON	imprint .

		`` Replanning Small Cities : Six Typical Studies , '' by Mr.
John Nolen	PERSON	, Fellow of the
American Society of Landscape Architects	ORGANIZATION	, is announced by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		The seventh volume of the `` Cambridge History of English Literature , '' dealing specifically with '' The
Caroline Age	PERSON	, '' will be published by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	within a few weeks . ''

		Our Country and its People , '' a new geographical reader by Professor
Will S. Monroe	PERSON	and Miss
Anna Buckbee	PERSON	, is announced for publication this month by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Journal of a Recluse , '' an anonymous volume which has attracted considerable attention during the two years since its publication , turns out to be not a translation from the French , as was generally supposed but the work of an American woman .

		A series of lectures that will give rise to an interest - ing volume are those to be delivered at the Sorbonne by Professor
W. H. Schofield	PERSON	, according to the custom now established by which a
Harvard Professor	ORGANIZATION	annually gives a course of lectures in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Schofield	PERSON	intends to treat of the idea of a gentleman in the course of English literature , and he will illustrate his theme mainly by reference to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Malory	LOCATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		A posthumous book by the late
William James	PERSON	, entitled `` Some Problems in Philosophy : A Beginning of an Introduction to Philosophy , '' is to be issued im - mediately by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This house also announces '' The Comic Spirit in
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Joseph Warren Beach	PERSON	; and '' Half a Man : The Status of the Negro in
New York	LOCATION	, '' by
Mary White Ovington	PERSON	, with a '' foreword '' by Dr.
Franz Boas	PERSON	.

		Mr.
C. R. L. Fletcher	PERSON	and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	have written a new school history of
England	LOCATION	from the earliest times to
1911	DATE	.

		The prose narrative is the work of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	contributes twenty-three new poems , specially written to illustrate periods and episodes in the tale .

		Pictures in color and black-and-white will be provided by Mr.
Henry Ford	PERSON	.

		The volume is to be published shortly by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be of interest to all admirers of
Thackeray	PERSON	to learn of the discovery by Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	of two unfinished
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		by her father , One , entitled '' The Knights of Borsellen , '' is part of a mediaeval romance , accompanied by the author 's own drawings ; while the other MS. , '' Cockney Travels , '' describes tours in the west of
England	LOCATION	by coach and rail , in about
1842	DATE	.

		This
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 new material , which will have its first American pub - lication in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' will subsequently be included in the ' Centenary Biographical Edition '' of
Thackeray	PERSON	's works .

		The first ten volumes in Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	's '' Home Uni - versity Library of Modern Knowledge , '' recently an - nounced in these columns , will be the following : `` The French Revolution , '' by
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	; `` The Irish Nationality , '' by Mrs.
J. R. Green	PERSON	; `` Shakespeare , '' by
John Masefield	PERSON	; `` A History of War and Peace , '' by
G. H. Ferris	PERSON	; `` The Socialist Movement , '' by
J. Ramsay MacDonald	PERSON	; `` The Stock Exchange , '' by
F. W. Hirst	PERSON	; `` Modern Geography , '' by
Marion Newbegin	PERSON	; `` Polar Exploration , '' by
W. S. Bruce	PERSON	; `` Parliament , '' by Sir
Courtenay P. Ilbert	PERSON	; and `` The Evolution of Plants , '' by
D. H. Scott	PERSON	.

		Similar groups of ten vol - umes will appear in
June	DATE	,
September	DATE	, and
November	DATE	of this year , and quarterly thereafter until at least one hundred volumes have been issued .

		Professor
William T. Brewster	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, is the American editor of the series .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	announces for issue this month `` The
1911	DATE	Bible , '' containing the Author - ized Version of
1611	DATE	, with the text carefully corrected and amended by American scholars .

		It was felt that in preparing an edition commemorative of the
Tercen	PERSON	- tenary of the Authorized Version , occasion might fitly be found for a careful scrutiny of the text with a view of correcting , in the light of the best modern research , such passages as are recognized by scholars as in any measure misleading , or needlessly obscure .

		This scrutiny was committed to a committee of thirty-four eminent Hebrew and Greek scholars , representing all of the great evangelical bodies , and many prominent universities and schools of divinity .

		The result of their labors is , therefore , neither a new translation nor a re - vision , but a scholarly and carefully corrected text of the historic English Bible , the time-honored Authorized Version .

		The '' Autobiographical Memoirs of Richard Wag - ner , '' to be published in this country by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will appear in two volumes , comprising the great composer 's reminiscences from
1813	DATE	to
1864	DATE	, based on diaries and notes kept uninterruptedly after
1835	DATE	.

		The way in which this remarkable autobiography came to be written and kept secret for forty years is a matter of more than usual interest .

		Between the years
1868	DATE	and
1873	DATE	Wagner compiled his memoirs from diaries and other memoranda which he had kept for thirty-five years .

		As these memoirs were extremely frank and discussed not only the affairs of the author , but the affairs and characteristics of prominent people of the time who were well known to the writer ,
Wagner	PERSON	took the utmost precautions to keep his work a secret .

		As it was impossible at that time to secure duplicate copies by means of a typewriter , the book was set up by French compositors who did not understand German .

		Twelve copies were printed and the type was then dis - tributed .

		Of these twelve copies , eight were entrusted to
Frau Cosima Wagner	PERSON	and four copies were distributed among the author 's nearest and dearest friends .

		The greatest care was exercised in the event of the death of any of these five people that the closely guarded memoirs should be turned over to one of the survivors .

		In this way , the secret was kept so closely that although
Wagner	PERSON	died twenty-eight years ago , very few people , even in
Germany	LOCATION	, have known that his autobiography was in existence .

		It is the only complete edition of

May 16	DATE	, Good Mediums versus Best Mediums VERY periodical of standing is , in one sense , a good book medium , because its readers are to some extent buyers of books .

		DUT the advertiser 's problem is not so much to find good mediums , it is to find the best mediums .

		In other words , the question with him should be : '' In what way can I spend , to the best possible advantage , the very limited amount of money at my disposal for advertising purposes ? ''

		COR the book publisher the answer to this question must be : '' In those mediums which , in proportion to their cost , reach the largest number of actual book-buyers . ''

		And the best of such mediums , for the publisher of serious books , must be the one which holds the foremost place in authority and reputa - tion , and which exercises the strongest direct influence upon its readers .

		IN quality of circulation , in standing , in influence , THE DIAL holds first place among American book mediums .

		and Why HTHIRTY years of continuous publi - cation under the same management speak for THE DIAL 'S stability and success .

		It is preeminently a book journal , published solely in the inter - ests of the book class , the literary and cultivated class , the class that buy books .

		It is issued from the second largest city in the country , the centre of the immense book-consuming region of the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		T ^ HE DIAL is more generally con - sulted and depended upon by librarians in making up orders for books than any other American critical journal ; it circulates more widely among retail booksellers than any other journal of its class ; it is the accustomed literary guide and aid of thousands of private book-buyers , covering every section of the country .

		` T'HESE facts make THE DIAL indis - putably the foremost medium for high-grade advertising , the one indispensable medium for the publisher of worthy books .

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works ever printed and published in his native town , and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart from any other existing or future edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Format Editorial Features Press	ORGANIZATION	Opinions The set comprises ten royal octavo volumes .

		One thousand numbered sets , on English hand - made paper , have been printed , of which two hundred and fifty are for

		BRIEFER MENTION 450 NOTES 451 TOPICS IN
JUNE	DATE	PERIODICALS 451 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 452 THE APPROACHES TO LITERATURE .

		Literature is a coy maiden , not to be won by assertiveness or by violence .

		She well knows how to discriminate between her true and her pretended lovers , and can tell by instinct the difference between the one who woos her for her own sweet self and the one whose motives are interested .

		She bestows her favors with a sort of divine graciousness , and often upon outwardly unpromising aspirants , while turning an indifferent ear to suitors who have all the worldly advantages to offer .

		She will repel the advances of self-conscious and '' important '' persons , and go more than half way to meet and encourage the devotion of her shrinking worshippers .

		She will even seek these out , and win them for her declared following to their own surprise .

		And those whom her election singles out learn to taste of delights hitherto unimagined , and find life exalted to a dignity hitherto unconceived .

		Their sympathies are en - larged to the very limits of humanity ; they enter into communion with the life of the race ; they know in fullest measure the joy that art alone can give , and receive the key to the prison-house in which everyone is born , and which seeks to keep its inmates from enlargement by the heavy doors of convention and the stout walls of prejudice .

		When once the bolt is shot that has held them captive , they enter into their rightful inheritance of the open air and the liberal sunlight .

		Abandoning this concatenation of metaphors , let us state as a plain fact , needing neither de - monstration nor adornment , that literature is one of the chief solaces vouchsafed to man , and that he who is debarred from its ministry misses the best part of life .

		Surely its approaches should be made easy ; and yet , such is human perversity , some of them are so devised as to prove only misleading by-ways , and others are deliberately made difficult by steep artificial declivities , or blocked by thorny obstructions set for that very purpose .

		The path of the collector is one of the misleading by-ways ; another is membership in some society estab - lished for the study of this or that poet : still another is that into which ingenuous youth is lured by the analysts and statisticians who make an impudent pretence of studying litera - ture by laboratory methods , and of explaining 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, it upon scientific principles .

		The bunkers and the hedges that discourage the approach to lit - erature are the objects chiefly in view in the scholastic landscape .

		They are planned by the pedagogical expert with the skill of one who lays out a golf-course , or with the magic of the wizard who hides the sleeping beauty in her enchanted castle .

		We have frequently paid our respects to these methods and these obstruc - tions as they exist in our most favored educa - tional schemes , and expect to pay them many times more ; what we would emphasize just now are the abstract propositions that literature is itself , not something else , and that its pursuit , by which we mean appreciation rather than performance , is not a task , but a joy .

		To put the matter in a nutshell , literature is to be read , not to be puzzled over and dissected .

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has recently been discussing the approaches to literature , and offers the following suggestions : '' We can confine our attention , if we please , to a chosen few of the greatest writers , the men of an impregnable supremacy .

		We can neglect the minor writings even of these masters to centre our affections on their acknowledged masterpieces .

		We may turn aside from the authors individually , however mighty they may be , and from their several works , however impressive , to consider the successive movements which one after the other have changed the stream of litera - ture , turning it into new channels and sweeping along almost every man of letters , powerless to withstand the current .

		We may perhaps prefer to abandon the biographical aspects of literature to investigate its bio - logical aspects , and to study out the slow .

		differentiation of the several literary species , history from the oration , for example , and the drama from the lyric .

		Or , finally , we may find interest in tracing the growth of those critical theories about literary art which have helped and which have hindered the free expansion of the author 's genius at one time or at another . ''

		This is good counsel , but not , after all , for the many .

		It smells too much of the lamp to be the best advice for readers who are not endowed with specialized literary aptitudes .

		Those who ponder it , or such writings as
Euskin	ORGANIZATION	's `` King 's Treasuries '' and Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' The Choice of Books , '' may get from their effort a certain stimulus , but such counsels of perfection are more often productive of despair than of acceptance as working rules .

		We must , after all , reckon the course of study , the systematic scheme , the reasoned procedure , as hindrances rather than helps to the acquisition of literary taste and understanding .

		And a special note of warning is needed for those who think that they may properly approach literature by the way of literary history and criticism .

		These provide the pattern without the material for the fabric , but if the fabric be skilfully woven piecemeal perhaps , and put together bit by bit , like the sections of a puzzle-picture the pattern will disclose itself in due time , and it may prove to be fairer than any that could have been designed in advance .

		For the average human soul , the casual approaches to literature are probably the best , and even the wisest of guidance may fail in fitting itself to the individual need .

		Some guid - ance there is that is helpful , but in the propor - tion that its intent is concealed .

		The coaxing methods of the modern librarian are inspired by a deeper wisdom than the categorical impera - tives of the schoolmaster .

		Taste is built up by a slow process of refinement , rising by imper - ceptible degrees to higher levels ; no genuine literary liking deserves to be held up to scorn , but should rather be taken as the sign of in - finite possibilities of development .

		It may be from so humble a beginning as ihefeuilleton of a sensational news-sheet that the man who learns to love literature shall measure his ascent .

		Or it may be from some random suggestion that the kindling spark has come , or from readings for entertainment in the home circle , or from informal conversations with one 's fellows , and preferably not with superior persons .

		Best of all agencies for the fostering of the literary spirit is the old family library , with its oppor - tunities for browsing , of which the child is made free from the time he learns to read .

		There need be little fear of contamination from this sort of license , for normal children have an amazing faculty for assimilating what is really nourishing , and for ignoring matters which their elders would find it embarrassing to have to explain .

		Why is it that children real children and those of larger growth that we find in the ranks of the mechanic , the ploughman , and the sailor so often find delight in Shake - speare and the
Bible	LOCATION	?

		One of the reasons , at least , is that they cheerfully skip what they fail to understand , and do not have their wits tangled up by any erudite apparatus of anno - tation and explanation .

		But get them into school , and apply to them these worrying im - plements of erudition , and see how quickly the glow will fade , and what good haters of liter - ture they will become .

		Borrowing once more from Professor Mat - thews , we would emphasize the fact that litera - ture is not austere but friendly , not remote but intimate . ''

		It is not for holidays only and occasions of state ; it is for everyday use .

		THE DIAL 427 only , but for all sorts and conditions of men .

		It pro- vides the simple ballad and the casual folk-tale that live bv word of mouth , generation after generation , on the lonely hillside ; and it proffers also the soul-searching tragedy which grips the masses in the densely crowded city .

		It has its message for everyone , old and young , rich and poor , educated and ignorant ; and it is supreme only as it succeeds in widening its invitation to include us all .

		At one time it brings words of cheer to the weak and the downhearted ; and at another it stirs the strong like the blare of the bugle .

		It has as many aspects as the public has many minds .

		It is sometimes to be re - covered only by diligent scholarship out of the dust of the ages , and it is sometimes to be discovered amid the fleeting words lavishly poured out in the books of the hour , in the magazines , and even in the daily journals . ''

		That of which such words may in simple truth be said must be among the choicest treasures of mankind .

		It behooves all of us who have found the way into the precincts of literature to help as many of our fellows as we may to share its joys , and above all to see to it that its approaches be not jealously guarded from the stranger .

		If we have found obstacles set in our own path , we must take care that they shall no longer exist to impede those who are to come after us .

		Like the quality of mercy , literature ''
Blesseth	PERSON	him that gives and him that takes , '' and its possession makes us the richer when we help others to become also its possessors .

		SOME FRENCH SINGERS OF TEE OPEN-AIR .

		Summer is icumen in , Lhnde sing cuccu !

		Ever since the thirteenth-century poet wrote his '' Cuckoo Song '' and long before him , too poets have hymned the seasons : singing the beauty of woods and fields in every weather , and the joys of the open road ; declaring the pleasures of life among the flowers , in the shade of one 's own fig - tree .

		Sometimes a rather remote picturesqueness has been all that appealeH .

		Sometimes there has been a largely factitious painting of the pastoral life : and thus conventionalism has fastened upon this kind of verse .

		With
Burns	PERSON	, who guided the plough as well as chanted it -LRB- though I suspect he found his way to a maiden 's heart straighter than he drove the furrow -RRB- , a new life stirred in nature - poetry .

		Burns exalted man for the manhood 's sake , and showed how even the laborer not the make-believe haymaker , but he who sweats at his work might heave a sigh and lightly turn to thoughts of love as he drank ale at eventide .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's verse , that looms so impressive in romantic poetry , smells to heaven , not so much of the soil it grew in , as of one Cumberland man 's didactics .

		Tennyson well enough conceived the poetry of the countryside , but his pictures in this genre -LRB- like his historical pieces -RRB- are almost too perfectly `` composed . ''

		This is studio-work , and the notes taken afield have lost in the working - over .

		True ,
Tennyson	PERSON	can be photographic as in his '' Northern Farmer . ''

		The trick is to be plein - airiste and lyricist too ; when is this poet both ?

		To be a plein-airiste of verse , and worthy of the name , it is not enough to have an exquisite appre - ciation of natural detail .

		More is required than a knack of painting eyes . ''

		Darker than darkest pansies , and that hair More black than ashbuds in the front of
March	DATE	. ''

		The open-air painters pique themselves on rendering nature on the spot ;
Monet	ORGANIZATION	's pictures are executed on successive days , perhaps , but under the same atmospheric conditions : Sorolla 's are generally put through at a single sitting .

		This is true impres - sionism .

		Yet we do not demand as much of our nature-poets as these nature-painters have demanded of themselves .

		What we do ask is an effect of spontaneity ; and the making-believe that the verses made themselves conditioned by one moment 's joy or pain .

		We would know nothing of the poet 's retouchings ; an edition of his works in which variant readings are given as in the recent
Eversley Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is abhorrent to us in some moods .

		We hug a precious illusion .

		We want no chips from the workshop .

		The century that gave
England William Barnes	PERSON	, who wrote that `` increasing communication '' and the popularization of board-schools has substi - tuted '' book English '' for provincial dialects , and who for his own part used the patois of Dor - setshire -LRB- `` not only a separate offspring from the Anglo-Saxon tongue , but purer and more regular than the dialect which is chosen for the national dialect '' -RRB- , gave
France	LOCATION	an even greater provincial poet in Fre ` de ` ric
Mistral	PERSON	.

		Only last year the poet celebrated his eightieth birthday ; two years ago occurred the half-centenary of his '' Mireio '' the master-work that
Lamartine	PERSON	dared to compare with the Homeric epics .

		* I have no wish to attempt here the reviewing of a poem that has inspired so much of praise and of controversy ; a poem prob - ably best known to Americans through the libretto of
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's half-forgotten opera .

		It is enough that Mistral succeeded in giving us a great poem , besides giving a wonderful impetus to the study of the troubadours ' tongue , and to its use as a poetic medium .

June 1	DATE	, tral wrought for the illiterate folk of his own country ; he could say in all sincerity , '' Je ne chante que pour les patres et les gens des mas . ''

		Yet he was executing , the while , the work of an in - dubitable poet , whose limitations were self-imposed .

		It is our misfortune that we have , in English , no adequate rendering of his verses .

		We can , all the same , judge in some degree of the vigor and whole - someness and poetic temper of his work , whether we read it stumblingly in the native Provencal , in the French prose translation made by Mistral him - self , or in the English version contributed a good many years ago by Miss
Harriet Preston	PERSON	.

		Some - thing of the movement and the southern magic of its natural poetry survives the roughest handling .

		The people of
Provence	LOCATION	are right in erecting a statue to Mistral in his own lifetime ; right in deem - ing him one of the great company of French Im - mortals never enthroned among the Forty .

		A spicy proverb which , enjoys a more restricted circulation in this the age of the press agent would have it that '' a good wine needs no bush . ''

		Mistral is a palm - less poet so far as the Academy is concerned ; he does not join Academies , but he has founded them .

		His laurels are home-grown , but he has his statue ! ''

		Sing hey !

		sing ho !

		As golden bees , blown from afar , Glean rosemary-honey , So swarm these trees With maids not bees , Like the air , sunny !

		So beautiful the silk-worms are In their third sleeping , Sing merrily , ye mulberry maids , Prosper your reaping ! ''

		in .

		Mistral 's '' Mireio '' was published an even fifty years ago : it is not thirty-five years since
M. Jean Aicard	PERSON	published his Poems of
Provence	LOCATION	, in the language of his greater Fatherland .

		* Aicard too is a Provencal , and loyal to his province , ''
Vieille Gaule	PERSON	a 1 ` esprit attique au coeur romain , Souviens-t-en : la
Provence	LOCATION	est 1 ` antique chemin Par ou la race hellene et latine a ta race Apporta ses tre ` sors de lumiere et de grace , '' but he dedicated his poems , not to
Provence	LOCATION	, not to the gent di mas , but to all
France	LOCATION	.

		Let us appre - ciate the importance of such a dedication .

		Here is a regionalist who seeks , not to resuscitate a stricken language , but to conserve something of its local tang ; a poet using , too , the most sophisticated of all the tongues , ancient or modern .

		His poems are equally popular and Provengal in accent : yet they are indubitably French verse of a high order .

		Rather than praise the achievement , in our own poor words , let us listen to the poet speaking for himself . ''

		When our peasants express themselves in French , '' he has written , '' they translate the figures , the movement , even the turn , of words , and , if one may say so , the flair of the Provencal patois .

		I have tried to speak , in verse , a French that in the manner of their prose might let one divine the genius of the local idiom ; happy if some of our provincial - isms , debris of the dialect in dissolution , should seem worthy of enriching the French tongue . ''

		* When the young poet of that time , the
Academi	PERSON	- cian of to-day , was publishing his poems of the South-land , full of the singing of locusts and the murmur of the river Rhone , Brunetiere , in an essay on `` Poetes contemporains : la Poe ` sie intime , '' was discussing the work of
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, who had just written '' La Vie Inquiete , '' and Francois Coppe'e Coppe'e , whose seat in the
Academy Aicard	ORGANIZATION	now holds , and
Bourget	PERSON	, his '' dear colleague . ''


Brune	PERSON	- tiere lacked enthusiasm for CoppeVs '' Humbles , '' and its verses about the tout petit epicier de Mon - trouge : '' It was a retail grocer of Montrouge , And his dark shop , with shutters painted red . ''

		What a pity that , when he wrote his article upon contemporary poets ,
Brunetiere	PERSON	had not yet read
Aieard	ORGANIZATION	's poems of
Provence	LOCATION	, with a very different inspiration : although he , likewise , celebrated '' Les Humbles ! ''

		Had Brunetiere studied
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	's work , there would be little need of anyone else attempting to evaluate it .

		But what comes near to reconciling us to this critical omission is the tribute of Sully -
Prudhomme	PERSON	; who was something better than critic : '' Tu nous as rapport ^ de ton pays natal Ce qui nous manque ici , 1 ` air , le jour et la flamme ; Ton poeme re ` chauffe et colore notre ame Comme un re ` flet brulant d'azur oriental . ''

		Aicard 's work reminds us of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's observation that the Orient commences at
Marseilles	LOCATION	.

Academy	ORGANIZATION	has elected
M. Aicard	ORGANIZATION	to its membership .

		Essentially lyric in his verse , hardly less lyric in his novels , some of which have been lately trans - lated into English , !

		there is no temptation for us to compare this younger singer with Homer , as
Lamar	PERSON	- tine compared Mistral .

		And yet one may fairly compare Mistral the Felibre and Aicard , equally Provencal , perhaps , but more affected by his school - ing and his long periods of residence at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		M. Aicard is content to render the beauty and mysti - cism of
Provence	LOCATION	in the French tongue .

		If
Mistral	ORGANIZATION	's Mireio is daintiness itself , and the lovemaking of Mireio and
Vincent	PERSON	is , essentially , as full of poetry as that of
Meredith	PERSON	's
Richard	PERSON	and Lucy , besides being raised upon the wings of verse ,
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	, too , has given us heroines of grace and captivation .

		THE DIAL 429 the lyrics and eclogues of the
Dorset	LOCATION	poet .

		One may turn one of the French couplets into English doggerel in this wise : Man 's made for the soil ; and mind it well !

		The happiest man 's Jacques bonhomme .

		Notwithstanding its undertone of melancholy , there is throughout
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	's work unfailing joy in the face of nature .

		The Rousselian spirit of his novel '' L'Ame d'un Enfant '' does not find unique expres - sion in his revolt against the repression and dis - cipline of the lycees ; it is more happily expressed in his faith in this same
Jacques	PERSON	, and in his appre - ciation of all the beaut -RCB- - of outer nature .

		At school he was less attracted by the alphabet than by the tragicomedy of fly and spider .

		As poet he chants the Spanish broom and immortelle ; Aries and the
Alyscamps	PERSON	, `` pleins d' e `` clats de rire '' ; the gleaners of
Camargue	ORGANIZATION	, and the Branding -LRB- la Ferrade -RRB- ; the '' Vignes dn
Languedoc	LOCATION	, oliviers des Alpines . ''


Maurice Barres	PERSON	of '' Les De `` racine * s '' pleads no more eloquently the ties of the home - province : '' J'ai la , dans ma
Provence	LOCATION	, ou les lauriers sont beaux , Mon foyer , mon arpent dn sol de la patrie , Et je sens & ce nom ma pensee attendrie , Car 1 ;\ j' ai des amis et 1 ;\ j' ai des tornbeaux . ''

		What matter if the poet lives , for the greater part of each year , among the mists and rains of
Paris	LOCATION	?

		Provence is still near enough to his spirit , '' I ?

		m there , though by my fire I do recline , Relaxed , glued to my chair , watching the sparks ; Green woods blue sea the Southern Sky : all mine ! ''

		It is a wild kind of justice that one renders
M. Aicard	PERSON	in Englishing a few lines here , a few there , in this rough fashion .

		One should quote in the French at least one of the sonnets -LRB- '' Les Cigales '' -RRB- , and verses like those occurring in the piece called , '' Returned by Sea . ''

		`` Voyage urs !

		voyageurs !

		explorez la nature ; Tentez au bout des mers la pensee ou I ` amour : Tout depart vous promet nne heureuse aventure , Et ce bonheur fuyant n'est que dans le retonr ! ''

		D vous attend sous 1 ` arbre , au senil de votre porte , Ou vous avez , enfant , joue 1 , sonri , pleur4 ; Sur la plage ou chanta votre jeunesse morte , Au pays ou I ` aiieul paisible est intend . ''

		One would remember , too , '' Les Meyes , '' and that exquisite little poem , '' La Fleurette , '' '' La grappe belle et mure et virginale encore , Que baisent settlement la rose * et I ` anrore ... '' But it is impossible to quote more here .

		We can only very remotely suggest the nature of the subjects ; we must let the treatment of those subjects and sentiments so exquisite and so classical in feeling speak for itself .

		Sincerity is breathed in every line to which
M. Aicard	ORGANIZATION	has signed his name .

		It may be said of the rather recently elected
Acade	PERSON	- mician , as it was said of the
Dorset	LOCATION	poet beyond the Channel , that his verses '' seldom exhibit a striking thought , or perhaps even a very original expression . ''

		The fact remains that
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	is the poet of
Provence	LOCATION	who has done most to give his province a place in modern French literature .

		He is , too , the poet of children and of mothers ; the last , as
M. Calvet	PERSON	has written in his sympathetic study , '' of the great idealistic poets . ''

		* And
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	himself has written that the ideal is not ce qui n'est pas -LRB- in Maupassant 's phrase -RRB- , but the truth of tomorrow : `` le vrai de demain . ''

		* V .

		If names of English and French writers poets j of Dorsetshire and troubadours of Twentieth - century
Provence	LOCATION	are mingled in this
summer	DATE	causerie pell-mell , I offer no apologies .

		They are all of them open-air poets nor is that all .

		I have | associated them carelessly , but not without motive .

		I try to match
Barnes	PERSON	's loyalty to Dorsetshire with
Mistral	ORGANIZATION	's intensive patriotism ; I almost wish that |
Aicard	ORGANIZATION	's work may suggest analogies which are not to be strained , however with
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most of all have I hoped that the reader might be led into making certain admissions regarding the possibilities of French lyricism .

		It is a truism that English taste has been nar - rowly insular whenever it has not been servilely Gallophile .

		In the eighteenth century Gray might sigh for an eternity of romances by
Marivaux	ORGANIZATION	and
Cre	ORGANIZATION	`` billon , / rk , `` On a Sofa , '' but
Wesley	PERSON	's utter scorn for the '' Henriade , '' and even for ''
Telem	LOCATION	- achus , '' or Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's aspersions upon Jean -
Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	, were sentiments far more char - acteristically national .

		The French have ever set up the appreciation of
Racine	LOCATION	as the touchstone of poetic taste ; yet what a mess English writers have always made of it in venturing to discuss
Racine !	LOCATION

		They have conceded , not tasted , the intellectual and rhetorical qualities of his tragic poetry ; they have , in general , wholly missed the psychology of woman that is
Racine	LOCATION	's , his mastery of passional values .

		We are , nous autres Anglais , singularly grudging and inept in our criticism of French verse .

		We do not , however , invariably understand all we com - mentate ; and all too seldom do we enjoy what we do partially understand .

		It is a truism , I have said , that English taste has been narrowly insular when - ever it has not been Gallomaniacal , but must the same be said of American taste ?

		I for my own part have at least expressed my vigorous dissent from any judgment denying to French verse warmth , the love of nature , or an appreciation of the `` little people 's '' ways of life and humbler joys .

		I conceive that it is time for us Anglo-Saxons to abandon one of our pet preju - dices : our prejudice against French poetry , that we condemn unheard .

		Poe had a
Baudelaire	LOCATION	; Words - worth engaged Sainte-Beuve -LRB- though the poet-critic never went far in his renderings of the Lakists -RRB- ; even

		This would not greatly matter if we did not , apparently , base our judgments of French verse either upon our miserable translations or upon our own private mis-readings of the texts .

		We do not even know many of the humbler but well-loved poets whose work expresses the sanity of life that is no less French than those more showy character - istics that we imagine French .

		* It is not with French verse as a whole that we are occupied to-day , however : only with some of the French poets who are , like some of the English poets , singers of the out-of-doors .

		The odds have never favored poets of peasantry .

		If , like
Robert Bloomfield	PERSON	or
George Crabbe	PERSON	, they are strict liter - alists , they are told , number one , that he attains nothing higher than '' truthfulness of description '' ; number two , that he writes charming tales , but long ones .

		Renan has said that men have no right to paint a dung-heap unless roses grow out of that rich accumulatipn .

		If poets take warning , if they profit by
Renan	ORGANIZATION	's dictum and gather rosebuds while they may -LRB- and where -RRB- , then they are told that their '' grand air '' belongs to the capital , not to the country-side .

		Ik Marvel complained of the
Watelet	PERSON	- effects attained by the French ruralists .

		Such a criticism applies to eighteenth-century Delille , but not to the poets named in this essay .

		Some new accusation must be brought against these Proven - aux ; these singers of the langue d'oc ; these Aicards and Mistrals .

		Let me confess that , as a country-lover , and a lover of their own country , I can draw up but one bill against them .

		And though that is serious enough , it is not , I suspect , unanswerable .

		I would complain only that they have kept me indoors over - long , reading their verses , when I might have been out in their fields and woodlands , walking under their glowing skies and sunning on their beaches .

T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, as he was then styled in the registers of the clergy .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	re - calls his friend 's early and long-continued connec - tion , as contributor , with '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' for which he wrote more or less frequently during half a century or longer .

		His military service , though interrupted by illness , u added to his equip - ment for an all-round literary life , the part which he chiefly and excellently filled .

		Few Americans have written on more themes , with a better preparation , or a more comprehensive , exact -LRB- and exacting -RRB- method . ''

		THE GRIND AND THE GENIUS ought to be united in the same person if there is any truth in the defini - tion of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains .

		But men generally like to believe that the genius , whether poet or painter or inventor , is born and not made by any amount of drudgery or self - discipline .

		A ray of light , feeble enough , perhaps , seems to be thrown on the question by an investiga - tion conducted by the ''
Cornell Era	ORGANIZATION	, '' which shows that out of one hundred and seventy
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	alumni of success and prominence , one hundred and one were known as grinds in their college days , while sixty-nine were of the gayer , more socially promi - nent , or athletically eminent sort .

		It is significant that sixty-seven of the one hundred and one have achieved success as educators .

		Perhaps there is nothing that the thorough grind takes to so natu - rally , after he has ground his way to a summa cum laude diploma , as the perpetuation of his kind .

		Only thirteen authors and ten journalists are noted among the distinguished hundred and one , and so there is little in these results to weaken our conviction that creative literary artists are not producible at will by any sort of educational training .

		By a happy coin - cidence , President
Schurman	PERSON	has just issued a state - ment of the comparative scholarship of fraternity men and non-fraternity men as ascertained by an examination of the records of students dropped by
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	at mid-year because of inferior scholarship .

		The non-fraternity men , who in general may be reckoned the grinds , lost only one and
one-tenth per cent	MONEY	of their whole number in this weeding-out of the unfit , while the society men lost three and eight - tenths per cent .

		On the whole it seems wiser and
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		SOME SPECIMENS OF GRAVE-YARD POETRY that meet the eyes of visitors to the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- cemetery immortalized in
J. G. Holland	PERSON	's historical novel , '' The Bay Path , '' tempt one to indulge in a little quotation .

		The present cemetery , it is true , can not boast the antiquity of the old one desecrated by the invasion of the railway ; but to it were removed in
1848	DATE	the mortal remains and the head - stones that had occupied the ancient bury ing-ground .

		A diligent hand has transcribed the more curious of the epitaphs , among which a few may interest our readers .

		The following is noteworthy as being found , with occasional variations , in other cemeteries besides that at
Springfield	LOCATION	, where it was inscribed in
1785	DATE	on the head-stone of one
Joseph Ashley	PERSON	.

		With a slight change it occurs again in the same cemetery . ''

		Reader , behold as you pass by .

		As you are now , so once was I : As I am now , so you must be .

		Prepare for deth and follow me . ''

		To more than one irreverent reader of this inscrip - tion must have come the impulse to reply : '' To follow you I 've no intent Until I know which way you went . ''

		Here is a couplet , simple and touching , though defective in rhyme unless we are to conclude that the pronunciation of
1782	DATE	made the defect non - existent to the Springfielders of that day : * '
Persia	LOCATION	alas is gone And left her friends to moan . ''

		On the stone of
Mary Pynchon	PERSON	, who died in
1657	DATE	, may be read the following quaint though limping lines : '' She yt lyes here was while shee stood A very glory of womanhood .

		Even here was sowne most pretious dust Which surely shall rise with the just . ''

		To the lover of elegiac verse what printed book of poetry can compare with an ancient burying-ground ?

		Pathos and humor , so notably akin , meet and blend there , if anywhere , however unintentional the humor , and however heartrending the grief of the elegiac poet himself .

		THE GREATEST LIBRARY EVENT in library history , measured by material standards , was the opening in
New York	LOCATION	, last week , of the splendid building that has cost more than
ten million dollars	MONEY	, that contains literary and art treasures worth several millions more , and that occupies a site valued at about twenty millions .

		Full reports of the dedicatory exercises of
May 23	DATE	have appeared in the local press , and more or less abbreviated accounts have found their way into many other journals through - out the land .

		On the day following the dedication the library opened its doors to the reading public , and its one million and more volumes became avail - able for use after five months spent in transferring them from the
Astor	LOCATION	and Lenox buildings .

		That the moving did not take more time must be attri - buted to the admirable system whereby each book 's destined location was accurately determined in advance .

		The transfer of the vast library had , of course , '' to be mentally accomplished before its material execution began , and the skill and judg - ment shown in the arrangement of so many volumes with reference to their probable frequency of de - mand may well stir one 's admiration .

		From the first embryonic outline of the new building , drawn years ago by Dr. Billings on a postal card , there has developed the present magnificent structure , the most elaborately and carefully planned , and ex - pected to prove the most satisfactory , as it is the most modern , library building in the world .

		THE CHARM OF OXFORD fades not with age , but notably increases .

		Something of the atmosphere of the ancient university makes itself pleasantly felt in a descriptive and reminiscent article , `` The Flavor of Life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, '' in the
June	DATE	'' Century Magazine , '' from the pen of Mr.
Tertius Van Dyke	PERSON	, a recently graduated Rhodes scholar , we infer .

		Phases of university life and types of character are briefly but effectively presented .

		Here is a familiar scene : '' Every afternoon the streets of Oxford swarm with bareheaded undergraduates in ' shorts ' or ` flannels , ' bicycling to their various college athletic fields .

		Several hours later you will see them returning splashed with mud and eager for a bath and the inevitable cup of tea . ''

		The American student at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	must be churlish indeed , thinks Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	, not to be irresistibly attracted toward his English cousin ; but nevertheless '' disagreeable men are here as well as elsewhere , and of snobbish men more than a fair proportion , '' who have been known to commit the rudeness of gorgonizing the free and independent American with a stony British stare .

		To the graduate of one of our colleges , concludes the writer , ''
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	offers innumerable benefits .

		It is an enlightening and inspiring experience to dwell within tlie walls of this most ancient of all English universities , nor need you return any the less a true American because of your admiration for
England	LOCATION	and the Englishmen . ''

		Mr.
Fred Pegram	PERSON	has well illustrated the article with sundry scenes from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	student life .

		A REFORM IN TRAVELLING-LIBRARY METHODS has been lately either instituted or taken under consid - eration by the more progressive managers of such libraries .

		As long ago , indeed , as
1907	DATE	the
New Jersey Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	changed from the old system of sending out irrevocably fixed groups of books , in orderly rotation , to designated depositaries , regardless of the tastes and desires of the readers .

		Intelligent selection and the invitation of requests from those to whom the books were to go could not but produce gratifying results .

		In
Kansas	LOCATION	, more recently , as set forth in the sixth biennial report 432 -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of the commission for travelling libraries , foreordi - nation absolute has given place to a more flexible scheme in the circulation of these movable collections of literature . ''

		This system , '' says the secretary of the commission , '' involves vastly more labor than the unit or fixed-group plan in use in many states .

		Then , too , under the fixed-group plan , a most desirable selection of books may be placed in every library .

		But ... books selected for general use will not be read as are the books selected by the readers themselves . ''

		Thus it is getting itself pretty well understood that the library , like the Sabbath , was made for man , not man for the library .

		DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE THIRTEENTH CENSUS are outlined in a communication from the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Preliminary bulletins will , as usual , be published ; but these will in some instances vary in character according to the section or State to which they are to go . ''

		The most interesting feature of this scheme , '' we are informed , `` is the plan to com - bine , in one volume for each state , all the bulletins for the
United States	LOCATION	on general topics , and the bulletins of a state in a
State Compendium	ORGANIZATION	.

		By far the greater number of inquirers as to census figures have heretofore found practically all the information they desired in the Abstract of the census .

		The proposed plan will give them this in - formation in the
State Compendium	ORGANIZATION	, together with special information regarding the state and county , or city , in which they live .

		The
State Compendium	ORGANIZATION	might therefore be described as a state edition of the Census Abstract ... The final reports will be issued in smaller editions than heretofore , and , being mainly for general reference purposes , preference will be given to their distribution to libraries and institutions of learning . ''

		The new plan seems likely to achieve certain desirable ends in the way of economy and brevity and adaptation to local or special requirements , in a manner not hitherto at - tempted by our ponderous decennial census report .

		THE HEAD-LINER 'S ART is of comparatively re - cent development .

		A hundred years ago , or even fifty , no one thought of trying to pack the gist of a newspaper article , and still less of a book , into three or four attention-compelling words .

		A book 's title could meander all the way down the title-page , in varied assortments of type , and news headings had a leisurely , go-as-you-please appearance that would never be allowed in this day and generation .

		Now the head-line must be so skilfully wrought as not to fail of a startling or an astonishing or a puzzling or a terrifying effect . ''

		Glad Rags for Masculinity '' would have been an inconceivable heading , half a century ago , for a newspaper report of a movement in favor of a more variegated male costume than that sanctioned by convention .

		Yet that very head-line confronts one to-day in a sober and reputable
Boston	LOCATION	journal .

		At the same time we cull from one of
Baltimore	LOCATION	's most authoritative daily papers the following : `` Now It 's Jagless Beer . ''

		This is to introduce an account of a de - alcoholized malt liquor , a lager that cheers but not inebriates .

		Another issue of the same excellent journal combines pithy brevity with faultless rhyme in its heading for the sad story of an unsuccessful traveling salesman of
St. Louis	LOCATION	who hanged himself in order that his wife and children might receive the insurance on his life . ''

		Took Life to Aid Wife '' neatly sums up the whole melancholy occur - rence .

		But it is in base-ball headings that the head-line artist surpasses himself . ''

		Bisons Take Another '' informs the initiated that the
Buffalo	LOCATION	team has scored a fresh victory ; and '' Orioles Fly North '' is not an ornithological announcement , but apprises the sporting world that the
Baltimore	LOCATION	nine is on tour in a cooler clime .

		The successful head - liner of to-day must be able to say more , and to say it more vehemently , in three words than his eigh - teenth-century predecessor could in three hundred .

		A FORTHCOMING MEMOIR OF COLONEL HlGGIN - SON , for publication in the Proceedings of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	will have for its competent author Professor
Edward Channing	PERSON	, who was united to the late poet , historian , and essayist by ties both of affinity and of literary collaboration .


Higginson	PERSON	's first wife was
Mary Channing	PERSON	, sister of the poet
Ellery Channing	PERSON	; and it was with this Professor
Channing	PERSON	of a later gen - eration that he prepared his recent textbook of Eng - lish history for American readers .

		This collabora - tion was significant and characteristic .


Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, founder in his vigorous old age , with Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, of the
Boston Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, was never too old to fraternize with youth .

		Hence the fitness of this selection of so comparatively young a man as Professor Channing to pay tribute to his memory in the records of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nor will it , we hope and believe , be a mere formal eulogy that , in the course of time , is to come from his experienced pen .

		... BOOK THIEVES BEFORE THE CHILDREN 'S COURT in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	have apparently been brought to a sense of their wrong-doing in disregarding the function of the charging desk at the public library .

		The superintendent of the juvenile department at the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	writes , in the current report of that well-administered institution : u A few examples will , it is believed , clear the air in a way to deter children who , rather from the spirit of adventure than from coveting the books for them - selves , form the habit of stealing and of thinking lightly of the wrong .

		We feel it an obligation upon us as a public institution thus to help train the chil - dren in civic righteousness , even though the actual book loss may not cripple our work . ''

		The open - shelf problem might , in the course of a generation ,
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 433 lose something of its perplexity if every public library were to adopt some means whereby its juvenile patrons should become well-grounded in civic righteousness before passing into the larger liberties of the adult department .

		THE GKOWTH OF THE POE MEMORIAL FUND for the erection of a monument to that author in
Baltimore	LOCATION	has been of a gratifying , even if not a startling , nature during the past twelve months .

		From a published statement of the
Edgar Allan Poe Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	, we learn that various schools , clubs , and dramatic associations , in and around
Baltimore	LOCATION	, have raised and sent in , since
May , 1910	DATE	, the creditable sum of five hundred and
twenty-seven dollars	MONEY	.

		Possibly some of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's admirers outside of
Maryland	LOCATION	may feel prompted , on reading this note , to contribute toward the commemoration of a too little recognized genius .

		His recent admission to the Hall of Fame , though tardy , encourages one to hope that , after all , he will in time come into full possession of his own .

		The treasurer of the
Poe Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
George C. Morrison	PERSON	, of the
Baltimore Trust Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE HIGGINSON ROOM IN THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC LIBRARY will be visited with keener inter - est and by more persons at this time than ever before .

		In that room are gathered letters and manuscripts from the pens of such celebrities as
Washington	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	PERSON	, many of them the gift of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	to the library of his native town .

		The card-catalogue , however , contains a more eloquent testimonial to the deceased author than any room or museum honored with his name .

		This mute memorial confronts the opener of the `` H '' drawer , in the thumbed and frayed and soiled condition of the cards bearing the titles of
Higginson	PERSON	's writings ; and the books themselves are said to be no less thumbed and worn and dog-eared than the cards , with the addition of frequent marginal comments of an emphatically commendatory character .

		Surely , far more gratifying than to be able to leave foot - prints on the shifting sands of time is it to cause the thumb-prints of others to be left on one 's own per - manent additions to th `` e literature of one 's country .

		THE RESIGNATION OF
AMHERST	LOCATION	's LIBRARIAN , accepted with reluctance by the
Amherst	LOCATION	trustees , comes as a surprise and causes deep regret to all who have enjoyed , are now enjoying , or hoped to enjoy , the benefit of his ready and invaluable assist - ance in literary research at the important post he has held for twenty-three years .

		Born at
Burling	ORGANIZATION	- ton ,
Vermont	LOCATION	, in
1844	DATE	, Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	served his country in the Civil War before adopting the peace - ful profession of librarianship .

		He was associated with Dr.
William F. Poole	PERSON	in charge of the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	for five years , an association afterward continued in the indispensable periodical Index known by the elder editor 's name .

		Three librarian - ships in
Connecticut	LOCATION	towns preceded Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's call to the important position at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	from which he now retires .

		His son and assistant , Mr.
Robert S. Fletcher	PERSON	,
Amherst	LOCATION
' 97	DATE	, will be his successor .

		FOR LIGHT SUMMER READING , or summer light reading , if you prefer , nothing seems to be making such a hit -LRB- if one may judge by the persistent advertisements -RRB- as the new ''
Encyclopaedia Britan	LOCATION	- nica , '' printed on that marvellously thin and at the same time opaque and tough
India	LOCATION	paper , with flexible leather binding and quantities of illustra - tions .

		The popular magazines are hopelessly out - distanced by these attractive , handy , back-bendable , less-than-one-inch-thick volumes . ''

		The only book I am taking with me on a three months ' vacation is the Eleventh Edition of The Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' is a specimen commendatory letter '' from a physician and author '' to the publishers .

		Whether for light
summer	DATE	or heavy winter reading , or for medium-weight
spring	DATE	and fall literature , one could easily make a worse choice than the new '' Britannica . ''

		A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING FOR THE GRAY HERBARIUM at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is now assured by the gift of twenty-five thousand dollars from an anonymous benefactor .

		The structure will be fire-proof and otherwise adapted to the proper housing of what is accounted the best collection of botanical literature in the country .

		Indicative of the prominence of botany among the natural sciences is the size of this collection , about twenty thousand volumes .

		Thus are the signs multiplying in the library world , that the warning of the
Albany	LOCATION	fire has not gone unheeded .

		What was
New York	LOCATION	's loss , in the damage done to its
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, is proving to be others ' gain , in a general awakening to the risks involved in the inadequate housing of valuable libraries THE LIBRARIANS ' CONFERENCE AT
PASADENA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB- ''

		Not the biggest but the best , '' expresses the verdict of the American librarians on the
Pasadena	LOCATION	meeting of their Association .

		It was not only in the work accom - plished and the practical benefits gained , but also in the keen enjoyment of the occasion , and in the fine spirit of mutual helpfulness and cordial cooperation that pre - vailed , that the conference was felt to be distinctive and memorable among the thirty-three annual meetings of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perfect weather continued through - out the conference week , and the charm of
Pasadena	LOCATION	at its best was felt and appreciated by all .

		The enter - tainments that were provided for visitors , including 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, agreeable social affairs , automobile rides through orange-groves and neighboring foot-hills , a trip by special train to
Riverside	LOCATION	, an ocean voyage to
Catalina Island	LOCATION	, and trolley trips along the ocean beaches , were new experiences to many and were heartily en - joyed .

		The attractive and well-equipped ``
Maryland	LOCATION	'' hotel , with its cheerful interior and spacious and secluded grounds , made admirable headquarters for the
Associ	LOCATION	- ation and pleasant homes for many of the members ; and the pretty
Shakespeare Club-house	PERSON	, a short distance away , afforded an adequate and cheerful auditorium which was usually well filled with eager listeners to addresses and discussions . ''

		Books for all the people '' is the key-note to what was probably the most absorbing subject before the Convention , certainly the one of greatest interest to the general public .

		This comparatively new institution might be described as a sort of library extension ser - vice , whereby library privileges , usually limited to the inhabitants of cities and towns where libraries are situ - ated , are to be extended to the people everywhere , in the small village , the remote hamlet , the farm , even the mining-camp .

		It is a sort of `` Rural Free De - livery '' of books , making them a vital factor in our educational system , and bringing the public library and the public school into closer relations and more useful service .

		Wherever free schools exist , facilities are to be provided for the free use of the books of the public libraries .

		The conception is a fine one ; and while it has been developing for years , and has been carried into successful execution in some regions , it has received its greatest impetus at this Convention , where results already known and practical means proposed were fully and profitably discussed .

		The preferred plan for the work seems to be the establishing of a system of free county libraries , a system which has been made the sub - ject of extensive experiment and study in
California	LOCATION	, where a new and , on the whole , excellent '' County Free Library Law '' was enacted and went into effect only a few months ago .

		This act gives boards of county supervisors `` power to establish and maintain , within their respective counties , county free libraries , '' and prescribes the manner in which they shall be sustained and administered .

		An important feature of the new system is that it brings all the county libraries into correlation with the
State	ORGANIZATION	library , and makes the re - sources of the latter available to all the people of
the State	ORGANIZATION	, many of whom are now without library advan - tages of any kind .

		Next to the topic just considered , the one that seemed to call out the liveliest interest was the rela - tion of the public library to the municipal civil service , and incidentally the necessity of '' keeping the public library out of politics '' a matter on which the head librarians feel somewhat keenly , and in which some of them have had some rather trying experiences .

		An instructive paper on ''
Municipal Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	as affect - ing libraries '' was read by Mr.
J. T. Jennings	PERSON	, of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and was followed by a spirited discussion which left no doubt of the belief of most of the librarians that municipal civil service hampers rather than helps a library .

		So long as a librarian is made responsible for the management of his library , he , it was urged , should be allowed to judge of the efficiency and value of his library staff .

		Such seemed to be the general consensus of opinion at the meeting , although there were a few dissenting voices .

		None , however , were heard as to the desirability of keeping library ad - ministration free from the taint of political influences .

		The proceedings of this meeting give one a vivid conception of the extraordinary range of activities and interests in a librarian 's life .

		The topics covered a wide ground from such techical matters as the quali - ties of printing papers and the strength of leather fibres used in bindings , to the details of library methods of accounting , problems of library architecture , methods of selecting books for library use , matters of library administration and economy , and the means of pro- moting the library 's usefulness to the community and making it more intimately related to the public educational system .

		The discussion of these and many other matters of practical concern to all library workers , and the free interchange of views and experiences , could hardly fail to be of much benefit to all .

		These gatherings have become a great national clearing - house for ideas and knowledge coming from the bright - est minds and ripest experience in the library profession .

		Besides the two leading topics already noted , many important subjects were treated in carefully considered papers and addresses , among them being the address of President
Wyer	PERSON	on `` What the Community Owes to the Library '' ; that on `` Library Censorship of Books , '' by Mr.
Willard H. Wright	PERSON	; '' Exploitation of the Public Library , '' by Mr.
A. E. Jbostwick	PERSON	; on '' Problems of Book - Selection for Libraries , '' by the editor of THE DIAL ; on '' Children 's Rooms in Libraries , '' by Mr.
H. E. Legler	PERSON	; on '' Library Extension , '' by Mr.
M. S Dudgeon	PERSON	,
Miss Harriet G. Eddy	PERSON	, and others ; on `` The Desirability of Closer Relations between the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and the Pub - lic Schools , '' by Mr.
A. H. Chamberlain	PERSON	; on `` Materials and Methods in Book-binding , '' by Mr.
Cedric Chivers	PERSON	; and on `` The Use and Meaning of Books , '' by Dr.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler	PERSON	and Dr.
J. A. B. Scherer	PERSON	.

		There were also innumerable special sections and meet - ings at which papers were read and discussed , and important business was transacted .

		The closing day of the meeting -LRB-
May 24	DATE	-RRB- was given up to what was called a ''
California	LOCATION	programme , '' with addresses by Governor
Johnson	PERSON	, Mr.
Lincoln Stef	PERSON	- fens , and Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	.

		Some of these addresses , it may be said , showed a somewhat tactless misconception of the occasion and its needs .

		The Gov - ernor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, who so recently signed the act pro- viding for county library systems in
California	LOCATION	, missed his chance of saying some appropriate words on a mat - ter so important and interesting to librarians , and gave them instead an energetic but inopportune political harangue ; while another speaker is reported to have said , `` If you want good government , do n't let the women vote '' a singular exhortation to be addressed to an audience composed largely of women , most of them self-supporting workers in libraries , and some of them entrusted with the management of large libraries and numerous employees , some of whom are men who vote .

		If the Convention had any answer to this rather ill-timed example of infelicitous expression , it had already been given in the election of a woman Mrs.
H. L. Elmendorf	PERSON	to the
Presidency of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		This event , and the development of the '' library extension movement '' that seems likely to result from the impetus given it at this meeting , would alone be sufficient to make the
Pasadena	LOCATION	Con - ference a memorable one .

		LOWELL AND THE RUSSIAN MISSION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		When the letters of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, edited by
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, were published in
1894	DATE	, I was much surprised to note that though letters telling of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's refusal '' to run for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' in
1876	DATE	, and of his appointment by President
Hayes	PERSON	to
Madrid	LOCATION	in
1877	DATE	, were printed , there were none to show that his political importance had had an earlier recognition , and that in
1874	DATE	he had been offered the Russian Mission by President
Grant	PERSON	, and had refused it .

		I wrote Mr.
Norton	PERSON	asking the reason for this omission , and stating that I had in my possession a note from Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	on the subject .

		Of this note , and of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's answer to me , I send you photographic copies , so that there may be no mistake in their publication .

		Elmwood , 24th NoVr ,
1874	DATE	.

		Dear Mr.
James	PERSON	, That was the reason , though I should as soon think of going to
Ursa Major	ORGANIZATION	as to him of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		But the place had just been offered me & I was bound in courtesy to ask a few days for consideration during which I could call myself an excellency .

		But my country is not to lose me at present .

		Very truly yours
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	.

		Shady Hill ,

April , 1894	DATE	.

		My dear Mr.
James	PERSON	, I thank you for your kind letter in regard to the offer of the Russian mission to Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	.

		I was aware of the fact , but I am glad to add your statement to the other material respecting Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's life already in my hands .

		I am , Sincerely yours ,
C. E. Norton	PERSON	.

		After the receipt of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's note I had no further communication with him .

		As long as he lived I hoped he would make unnecessary any reference on my part to this matter .

		I knew that after the publica - tion of the
Lowell Letters	ORGANIZATION	he denied having had the missing and much-looked - for Spanish letters ; but these he afterwards found , as he said , and proposed to have them published in a separate volume .

		He refused per - mission to an eminent Spanish gentleman for the print - ing of letters from Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	to the gentleman 's mother , who was a close friend of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's and one to whom he felt strong obligation .

		These letters , I am told , may soon be published , and , I hope , the Spanish letters also .

		ANGLO-AMERICAN COPYRIGHT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your department of '' Casual Comment , '' on page 339 of your issue of
May 1	DATE	, you speak of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American copyright agreement as if it were an equal benefit to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Authors and others in this country who are interested in the ques - tion of copyright regard the agreement as extremely unjust to British authors , printers , and publishers , who can only obtain copyright by having a book printed and published in the
United States	LOCATION	, while American authors can obtain copyright here without any such restriction .

		I , for one among many here , am very sorry that
Great Britain	LOCATION	ever entered into so inequitable an agreement , and am in favor of its being put an end to .

		If the
United States	LOCATION	will not enter into a just arrangement , let us abolish all copyright relations with them , and re - turn to the old days of literary piracy in both countries .

		American authors have so increased in numbers of late years , and are now so much read here , that they would be sure to cry out , and the result might well be that a just agreement would be entered into between the two countries .

		-LSB- We have re-read our editorial paragraph re - ferred to , but fail to find therein anything to justify the statement in our correspondent 's opening sen - tence .

		As a matter of fact , THE DIAL has at all times protested against the vicious manufacturing clause and other restrictions in our copyright laws which give this country its present unenviable posi - tion in the matter of international copyright .

		Only a short time ago , in commenting on the pending English copyright bill , we said : '' The proposed English law would apply to citizens or residents of the kingdom or empire , and to citizens of states in copyright relations with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It would be for the Crown to ascertain whether this country , under its statute of
1909	DATE	, is granting such copy - right protection to British subjects as to entitle it to claim the protection of the proposed law for its own citizens .

		Not unnaturally or unjustly would our manufacturing requirements and other petty restrictions be considered as barring us from the copyright privileges extended to other nations .

		Deplorable and humiliating is it that this country , because of its absurd copyright laws , should be the only civilized nation excluded from the benefits to accrue from the deliberations , now in progress , of the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	in its attempts to harmonize and systematize the copyright requirements of the literary world . ''

		I do not know that it adds anything to your rescue of the poem , '' A Hundred Years to Come , '' for its true author ; but I have in hand proof that it appeared in the ''

		436 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, tto THE NEW STEVENSON LETTERS .

		* The position of
Stevenson	PERSON	the writer has been determined by the public , if not by the critics .

		His work has been properly assigned to its place among the lesser classics .

		The posi - tion of
Stevenson	PERSON	the man is more ambiguous .

		As
Henley	PERSON	feared , his rich and glowing per - sonality has been sunk -LRB- by the public -RRB- in the Moral Optimist .

		Everywhere one finds broad - sides , calendars , and post-cards bearing quota - tions from his smiling philosophy , as Hood called it before
Stevenson	PERSON	was born , and the selection is nine times out of ten from his more platitudinous and less characteristic utterances .

		The '' canary bird , '' as he called himself when in this humor , pipes in a thousand American homes .

		The advertisement of the business boomer is clinched by a
Stevenson	PERSON	quotation ; and it is impossible to be comfortably depressed in most houses because of the
Vailima	LOCATION	placards on the walls .

		No wonder that
Henley	PERSON	com - plained that they were trying to make a saint of his ''
Lewis	PERSON	. ''

		Nevertheless , there is a kind of false truth and a working through error to appreciation in this moral cult of R.L.S. His best books are perfect ; yet for each in its kind there is a greater . ''

		Treasure Island '' is not '' The Three Musketeers . ''

		The essays may be better than
Benson	PERSON	, yet they are not so good as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		The travels will not bear the touchstone of '' A Sentimental Journey . ''

		But his personality was unique .

		Our snappers-up of moral sentiments seem to be feeling for this personality , even if they feel but a part of it .

		Perhaps they are on the trail of what will be his greatest fame .

		Here lies the value of the letters .

		In one conclusion all intimates of
Stevenson	PERSON	agree : his talk was incomparable .

		`` That far-glancing , variously colored , intensely romantic and fla - grantly humorous expression of life the talk of R.L.S. , '' says
Henley	PERSON	, who knew .

		And again , `` As he was primarily a talker , his printed works , like those of others after his kind , are but a sop for posterity . ''

		But talk , as
Stevenson	PERSON	says in his essay on '' Talk and Talkers , '' is preeminently an expression of personality .

		In his talk , his personality , so all agree , sprang to light , revelled , was greater and more various * THE LETTERS OF
ROBERT Louis STEVENSON	PERSON	.

		Edited by
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	.

		A new edition , rearranged in four vol - umes , with one hundred and fifty new letters .

		than itself .

		And it is in his letters only that his talk survives .

		They are faint and pale , no doubt , when compared with the living voice ; but , though
Henley	PERSON	, who knew the man , may sneer at them , and at us , they are more than a sop for posterity .

		In them , indeed ,
Stevenson	PERSON	is revealed with astonishing lucidity .

		A dis - cerning reader will see him fingering his exquis - itely sensitive spirit like a cello ; will recognize that intense self-consciousness which his critics called vanity , and thanks to it will find full and vivid records of the impressions made upon a remarkable mind by a multi-colored life .

		He will discover both
Stevenson	PERSON	's
Stevenson	PERSON	, and the real
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The Moral Optimist will be absorbed in a broader and richer personality , and the R.L.S. of contemporary estimate will give place to a figure of inexhaustible charm .

		All of this is true of the old collections of
Stevenson	PERSON	letters ; but it is much truer of the new edition now published , wherein the two groups of letters hitherto published separately are brought together into one group chronolo - gically arranged , with one hundred and fifty entirely new letters distributed through the four volumes .

		The new letters are for the most part early ones .

		There are delightful draughts from the correspondence with Mrs.
Sitwell	PERSON	-LRB- now Mrs.
Colvin	PERSON	-RRB- , in which the boy pours out his fresh impressions before her .

		He tries desperately to get the right words for the flight of
Mediterranean	LOCATION	gulls ; he rhapsodizes upon an imagination of his own death ; he fails in his attempts to express himself and is hurt by the bad style ; he offends a servant and describes the complicated moods which hinder his apology ; he opens up his heart to her : '' However ^ thank God it is life I want , and nothing posthumous , and for two good emo - tions I would sacrifice a thousand years of fame . ''

		He eases himself of the misery which came from unhappy religious differences with his father : '' I lay in bed this morning awake , for I was tired and cold and in no hurry to rise , and heard my father go out for the papers ; and then I lay and wished , O if he would only whistle when he comes in again !

		But of course he did not .

		I have stopped that pipe . ''

		One gets a better idea than ever before of
Stevenson	PERSON	's artistic growth from these letters to Mrs.
Sitwell	PERSON	; they emphasize the deep sensi - bility , and the infinite search for expressiveness , which together made him famous .

		There are new views into the moral core of the man ; best of all , perhaps , in the letters upon purity to
Trevor Haddon	PERSON	.

		There are the

		THE DIAL 437 critic 's obiter dicta : `` Beware of realism ; it is the devil ; 't is one of the means of art , and now they make it the end ! ''

		`` Bow your head over technique .

		Think of technique when you rise and when you go to bed .

		Forget purposes in the meanwhile ... Then when you have any - thing to say , the language will be apt and copi - ous . ''

		Best of all are more personal glimpses of the boy and the man .

		He is in
Menton	LOCATION	, in
1874	DATE	: '' We have all been getting photo - graphed ... Madame Zassetsky arranged me for mine , and then said to the photographer : ' C'est mon fils .

		II vient d'avoir dix-neuf ans .

		II est tout fier de sa moustache .

		I bowed in return and handled the flap of my cloak after the most princely fashion I could command . ''

1874	DATE	, the verger shows them the cathedral : '' ' Ah , ' says he , ` You 're very fond of music . '

		I said I was . '

		Yes , I could tell that by your head , ' he answered . '

		There 's a deal in that head . '

		... I said it might be so , but I found it hard , at least , to get it out .

		Then my father cut in brutally , said anyway I had no ear , and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the foundations of his creed that , I hear , he got my father aside afterwards and said he was sure there was something in my face , and wanted to know what it was , if not music . ''

		He writes to
Colvin	PERSON	, introducing his cousin : `` You know me now .

		Well ,
Bob	PERSON	is just such another mutton , only somewhat farther wan - dered . ''

		When he is in a hot corner he takes to an exciting story for solace : '' I stick my head into a story-book , as the ostrich with her bush ; let fate and fortune meantime belabor my posteriors at their will . ''

		From
Honolulu	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	he acknowledges his debts : '' Is it possi - ble I have wounded you in some way ?

		... If so , do n't write , and you can pitch into me when we meet .

		I am , admittedly , as mild as
London	LOCATION	Stout now ; and the Old Man Virulent much a creature of the past .

		My dear
Colvin	PERSON	, I owe you and
Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	, the two older men who took the trouble , and knew how to make a friend of me , everything that I have or am : if I have behaved ill , just hold on and give me a chance , you shall have the slanging of me and I bet I shall prefer it to this silence . ''

		There are not many new epistles in the cor - respondence written from the South Seas in the last years of his life , and these few , like the familiar
Vailima	LOCATION	letters which they supplement , are not of
Stevenson	PERSON	's best .

		A letter from Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	, now for the first time printed , suggests a reason for this .

		Louis had taken it `` into his Scotch
Stevenson	PERSON	head '' to be prac - tical , to get the facts about the islanders .

		He refused to be personal and impressionistic .

		The result is that his books upon South Sea life are but doubtful successes , and his wife 's description of his friend ,
Ori	PERSON	, the bronze chief - tain with the wreath of golden yellow leaves , is more vivid than anything of
Stevenson	PERSON	's own , and makes one weep to think of the letters which he might have written and did not .

		But if the last of these letters are disappoint - ing , both in old materials and in new , we will not complain .


R. L. S.	PERSON	did not materially change ; abundant glimpses show that he did not .

		He saved his imagination for his fiction , and wrote of his actions to his friends .

		Nevertheless , even in this latter , fact-crammed correspondence , the impression of his personality is remarkably com - plete .

		Indeed , after reading through this new edition , one is ready to answer the conventional statement , `` Letter - writing is a lost art , '' with an emphatic , '' Nonsense , it is only a changed one ! ''

		The formal letter , easy yet perfect , construct - ed like an essay , delivered like a set speech , is seemingly extinct .

		It was a beautiful thing as
Walpole	LOCATION	and
Cowper	PERSON	wrote it , but it has gone its way along with true Georgian architecture , the formal garden , and the periodical essay .

		These
Stevenson	PERSON	letters are of a different breed .

		They vividly strike off the flux and reflux of the writer 's thoughts .

		They record his moods .

		The style changes as he changes .

		`` Poor Fer - rier , it bust me horrid , '' he writes as the death of his friend jumps into his mind in the midst of the business of his correspondence .

		Whole letters in his earlier years are nothing but attempts to put his sensations into words .

		They are impressionistic of talk ; they are a kind of impressionism , and in this way typical perhaps of the best letters of this age .

		This , indeed , is what makes them so charming and so notable , for it is by means of successful impressionism that
Stevenson	PERSON	's personality is alive for us in these pages .

		To me it is the most interesting personality of the period ; to many it will be the one best worth knowing ; certainly , thanks to this collection , it is the one best expressed .

		Thanks to it also , we , too , like his friends , may come to feel that
R. L. S.	PERSON	is more wonderful than his books .

June 1	DATE	, NATURE 'S OPEX SHOP .

		* People as far gone in commercialism as we are can scarcely escape thinking in connection with nature at this time of year the thought expressed by the phrase '' open shop . ''

		It is the greatest of
Spring	DATE	enterprises which is being undertaken in fields and woods , that of preparing beauty and refreshment enough for masses of humanity the world over during all the out-door time of year ; and the unrestricted and whole-hearted openness with which that work is being done can not escape the most casual on-looker .

		Everyone and everything that can help is allowed to enter freely into the work .

		The blossoming trees and shrubs take charge of the displays , the leaves unroll their fabrics from every conceivable daintiness of packing , the grass and wood-flowers spread the rarest of carpets , and the clouds send down their showers to cleanse and fructify .

		In the chorus which inspires the laborers and lightens their task the thrush is choir-master , and all the other birds lend their voices , with no thought of boycotting the frogs if they should chance to join in .

		There is no over-work in this great cooperative enterprise , and no time-keeper but the sun ; no bells ring except those of the blue - bells , and no whistles sound except those of the cardinal and the oriole ; no badges are re - quired and no wages expected , but each worker is the happier the more co-workers he has .

		You yourself may join the brotherhood for the mere choosing , even if you can do nothing but appreciate the work of the others .

		But '' Hate , the shadow of a grain , You are lost in Westennain . ''

		Though we must each take the work and the pleasure of this resurrection of the earth 's beauty in our own way , and get much or little from it as we can , few of us hesitate to listen to those who have had more experience than we .

		Nature books bore some people , but prob - ably the stupidest of such books never altogether bored a real nature-lover .

		lover 's shelf this
Spring	DATE	, each of them from an expert , and each in a field of its own .

		The same intense love of out-door beauty which makes us all remember Mrs.
Gene Stratton	PERSON	-
Porter	PERSON	's best-known story , '' Freckles , '' is shown in her new book , '' Music of the Wild , '' a large volume with an ampler range of subject than the title would suggest .

		To the author 's open mind the '' music '' of owl and hawk and bat belong to the '' Chorus of the Forest '' as well as that of chewink or grosbeak , and her delicate ear catches also the fairy sayings of moth and flower .

		Her judgment is not warped , because she knows which song is sweetest ; but she insists that each angel have his due whether he be black or white .

		So crow and cricket , hop-toad and katy-did , have their meed of praise .

		The book is sumptuously illustrated , and those of us who are still children enough to like good pictures will take pleasure in the photographs , '' taken at home , '' of nestlings in all stages of gawkiness , and grown-ups both bird and plant in all phases of beautiful maturity .

		The place of animals in nature 's free house of growth has always been eloquently championed by Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, and he now adds to his list of books about animals a collection of new stories , under the title '' Neighbors Un - known . ''

		All of these neighbors the black bear , the caribou , the killer-whale , the lynx are known to us in appearance and outward characteristics , but not in the intimacy of life and death with which Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	knows them .

		The truth that strikes him most forcibly is that the hunter becomes the hunted .

		The small dragon-fly is caught by the large , the large is swallowed by the heron , and the heron falls a prey to the mink ; the puffin catches the fish , but the skua catches the puffin .

		Man stands at the apex of this pyramid of destruction , felling the grizzly which has captured a seal , and the whale which has left a bloody path in the sea .

		But man is not always victor , for a moment 's drowsiness in his night-watch makes him a victim to the wolf-pack ; nor are the stories all tragedies , for the crazy loon has wit enough to escape from the hand of the fowler , and the mother panther gets her cubs back from his thievery and escapes unhurt .

		Most of the stories are too cruel for children , but '' How a Cat Played
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and the '' Tunnel Runners '' the story of a marsh-mouse are excellent for young readers .

		The drawings by Mr.
Paul Bransom	PERSON	are full of life , and characterize faithfully the animals portrayed .

		In `` East and West , '' Mr.
Stanton Davis	PERSON	1911 . -RSB-

		THE
DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, 439
Kirkham	PERSON	has covered the extremes of the
United States	LOCATION	, which he calls '' the most beautiful play - ground in the world , '' and some of the middle region .

		From
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, '' where the ghost of the ice still haunts the lonely Dogtown Com - mons , and the imaginative mind will not fail to conjure up the ancient glacier , '' he passes through the wilderness of the northern woods , paddles down the Adirondack lakes , and stops to live a time among the trees of the
Catskills	LOCATION	, whose companionableness no one knows '' until he has lived among them and heard them day after day sighing in the rain , whispering in the breeze , and singing in the wind , until he ac - customs himself to look through their dim isles and out of their oriel windows . ''

		From the '' pre - eminently pastoral '' cultivation of western
New York	LOCATION	he crosses to
Southern California	LOCATION	, where '' like a garment the chaparral covers the tree - less spurs and peaks of the
Santa Inez	LOCATION	, tall and luxuriant and almost impenetrable without a machete or axe . ''

		There are excellent des - criptions of the Cactus Belt , the Desert , and
Arizona Gardens	ORGANIZATION	, and a unique chapter on `` Good Families '' the heath which includes the blueberry of
New England	LOCATION	pastures and the manzanita of the Sierras , the mints which are represented in the W est by the sages , the coni - fers , the violets , the lilies , and many other fami - lies of blood and breeding which spread their branches across our broad land .

		Although Mr.
Kirkham	PERSON	says he '' greatly prefers to confine himself to the familiar aspects of the woods , the familiar and well-beloved birds and flowers , '' and '' does not expect to say anything new , '' he has often an original way of presenting his material , and his observation is full and trust - worthy .

		There are attractive illustrations from photographs .

		Of Mr.
Dallas	PERSON	Lore Sharp 's '' The Face of the Fields '' it is not necessary to say more than that it is made up of essays which we have already enjoyed in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' and appro - priated with gratitude to the writer for the enlargement of our daily thinking .

		No one who read them in the magazine has forgotten '' Turtle Eggs for Agassiz , '' '' The Scarcity of Skunks , '' the `` Commuter 's Thanksgiving , '' or '' The Clam Farm . ''

		To enrich the joyful humor of these bits of real life is the literary acumen of the essay on Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, and the quiet , cheerful philosophy of '' The Face of the Fields '' and `` The Edge of Night . ''

		Every nature-lover will rejoice to have these possessions bound together in a book .

Greenland	LOCATION	's icy mountains to

		Several obvious causes contribute '' to the increasing number and variety and excellence of latter-day journals of sight-seeing and health-hunting .

		Railway facilities are yearly ex - tending into more and more remote quarters of the globe ; automobiles and the roads that they need and promote are likewise multiplying ; the call of the wild , the love of the simple life of mounain or seashore , are elements to be reckoned with as never before ; and the wealth and leisure required for extensive travel exist in greater abundance than at any preceding period in the world 's history .

		Beginning our wanderings with the far North , we find in Mr.
George Borup	PERSON	's lively narrative , `` A Tenderfoot with
Peary	PERSON	, '' more rollicking fun and youthful high spirits , together with a most admirable pluck and stout-heartedness , than in any previous book of polar exploration it has been our fortune to read .

		440 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, skill of an
Eskimo	LOCATION	, in a way that commanded the admiration of the whole party and would have made his father 's eyes glisten could he have seen . ''

		Eighty-five degrees and twenty-three minutes was the young man 's farthest north , though he longed to push on with the Commander and plant the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	colors at the tip-top of the earth .

		But that was not in the plan , and he reluctantly turned back .

		We gather , not from his own words , that his sledging record , toward the Pole and on lateral exploring trips , greatly exceeded that of any other member of the party , and he also proved himself a mighty hunter .

		Let us quote a few lines at random to illustrate his breezy and not too severely classic style , and also to show the spirit in which he took the inevitable mishaps and hardships of the great adventure .

		`` Slightly to the westward the lead closed .

		Seegloo manned a pick and went ahead to pick the trail while I took his team and promptly proceeded to drop down a ledge with the sledge , turning a somersault and landing on the inevitable ice spear .

		It knocked the wind out of me very neatly , and incidentally , I thought , broke a rib .

		While lying on the ice making night radiant in an attempt to get my breathing gear in working order I was greatly amused by the huskies gathering around with prophecies of my early death and assurances that the devils were right on their job .

		But what made me sorer still was inability to express my opinion of them , my speaking feature not working . ''

		Miss
Gertrude Lowthian Bell	PERSON	's `` Amurath to Amurath '' is a variously learned and descriptive account of a leisurely caravan journey down the Euphrates and up the
Tigris	LOCATION	, pursued with eyes open to everything of historic or prehistoric inter - est , and with an exceeding fondness for the careful study of antiquities , ruins , architectural features , and in fact of all things and persons oriental , ancient or modern .

		It is a good-sized volume , and copiously illustrated , that conducts the reader from
Aleppo	LOCATION	to
Babylon	LOCATION	, and thence northwestward by way of
Baghdad	LOCATION	,
Mosul	LOCATION	, and Diyarbekr , to
Konia	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	Minor some thirteen or fourteen hundred miles in all .

		A dedicatory letter to
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	opens the book , and a good map of the regions traversed brings it to a close .

		A typical passage , showing what sort of objects and what kind of prob - lems most interested the writer is the following : '' The scheme of the Assyrian temple has now been established by examples ranging over a period of four hun - dred years , and it is conclusively proved that it differed in a remarkable degree from the Babylonian temple plan , and was related to the plan adopted by
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
Babylonia	LOCATION	the chambers are all laid broadways in respect of the entrance ; that is to say , the door is placed in the centre of one of the long sides , so that he who enters has only a nar - row area in front of him , and must look to right and left if he would appreciate the size of the hall .

		At
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and in
Assyria	LOCATION	the main sanctuary ran lengthways , an immense artistic advance , inasmuch as the broadways-lying hall was at best a clumsy contrivance which could never have given the sense of space and ` dignity conveyed by the other .

		To the genius of what builders are we to attribute this masterly comprehension of spatial effect ? ''

		.

		h '' Tr , ` j. | JflI Those intrepid mountaineers , Dr. and M ^ rs ^ Wil - liam
Hunter Workman	PERSON	, known for their , explora - tions among the higher
Himalayas	LOCATION	, had thought to end their labors in those regions with their
Nun Kun	PERSON	expedition of five years ago .

		But , as they express it , '' we had breathed the atmosphere of that great mountain-world , had drunk of the swirling waters of its glaciers , and feasted our eyes on the incomparable beauty and majesty of its towering peaks , and , as time passed on , its charms asserted their power anew and called to us with irresistible , siren strains to return yet once again to those regions , the grandeur of which satisfies so fully the sense of the beautiful and sublime . ''

		Accordingly the month of
May , 1908	DATE	, saw them again setting forth to scale the dizzy heights ; and in '' The Call of the Snowy Hispar '' we have , in unusually hand - some form , the record of their latest achievements in Himalaya-climbing .

		Nineteen years ago , as we learn at the outset , '' Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	made a rapid ascent of the Hispar glacier , and sketched the salient points of its main stream with the plane table , but did not visit its branches . ''

		A careful examination of both the main glacier and its tribu - taries , with the ascent of neighboring peaks and a detailed survey of the whole basin , was the end pro- posed by Dr. and Mrs.
Workman	PERSON	; and the measure of their success is now set forth , with many strik - ing illustrations from their camera .

		Some related matters of interest to readers of the book are ap - pended , contributed by Dr.
Cesare Calciati	PERSON	and Dr.
Mathias Koncza	PERSON	.

		Objects and scenes of unusual interest abound , and few readers can fail to envy the author and at the same time to thank him for sharing with the public so many of his memorable experiences .

		Toward the end of his book , whose many and excellent views from photographs form one of its most attractive features , Mr.
Bingham	PERSON	significantly re - marks : '' When we look at South Americans at close range we may dislike some of their manners and customs , but not any more so than European critics disliked ours half a century ago .

		And not any more so , be it remembered , than the South Americans dislike ours at the present day . ''

		J THE DIAL Miss
Mary Barton	PERSON	, an Englishwoman , writes in her '' Impressions of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' an inviting book glow - ingly illustrated in polychromatic hues hy the accomplished writer herself .

		That her pictures from that land of tropical delights should be in the vividest of colors does not astonish us , though some of her purples and blues do seem to surpass any - thing that nature herself could achieve .

		But it may be that nature shares the people 's passion for startling effects of this sort .

		Apropos of this gen - eral subject , we read in
Miss Barton	LOCATION	's book : '' I regret to say there is a horrible bluish-pink of a most unpleasant brilliancy which is distinctly a favourite for skirts , but as a rule the petticoats are sober in tone or light and colourless .

		Too often they are long and trail , regardless of what they trail through or what dust they kick up ; for there is dust everywhere , thick , thick dust on all the country roads , through all the village streets , and even in the woods where vegetation has not conquered it . ''

		Under the pseudonym `` Mark Sale , '' a quietly - observant , level-headed woman , with a wholesome sense of the things that really count , has written a little book , '' A Paradise in
Portugal	LOCATION	, '' that will please every lover of good literature .

		A `` philo - sopher , '' as he is called in the book , and his wife , the writer herself , found themselves one day reduced to something like poverty , as far as mere money was concerned , but rich in the real things of life , in ideals and cultivated tastes , and love of the beautiful , and in the gifts of mind and heart , with a combined store of talents that ensured them against starvation ; and taking these intangible but very actual possessions with them , they sought out a beautiful retreat in
Portugal	LOCATION	where they lived well and enjoyed themselves on ten shillings a week .

		Surely a happier discovery of the '' one way out '' has never been made and that in spite of the fact that the '' philosopher '' had inherited '' a measure of ' unhealth ' and insomnia '' besides acquiring poverty in later life .

		But , says the author cheerfully , '' We were content in each other 's society ; our daily needs were of the simplest ; and for occupation , The Philosopher painted , while I wrote humble little stories .

		So it came about that we tramped this grand old world , viewing its wonders , and sunning ourselves under its brightest , bluest skies , with a yearly income upon which most people would have been stagnating in genteel poverty in some dull suburb or lifeless village of the dear , but grey , homeland .

		Higinbotham 's handy volume wherein he has told how to see , in twenty-one days , the most notable sights of the British Isles . ''

		Three `` Weeks in the British Isles '' is the book 's sufficient title , and it forms a companion to the same writer 's '' Three Weeks in
Holland	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	'' ; and there will be other later , we infer .

		The pictures from the author 's own camera are many and good , and every chapter abounds in facts and incidents likely either to amuse or to instruct , or to do both . ''

		It is the fashion to smile , '' observes the author in his preface , '' at the idea of seeing anything in a for - eign country in a shorter time than three months .

		This has constructed a barrier across the road to broader culture and accomplishment of many a person .

		As a matter of fact , more can be seen abroad in three weeks than can be seen at home in an entire
summer	DATE	.

		Distances are shorter between noteworthy objects .

		The unusual grips the attention at every turn . ''

		The hurried vacation traveller could do much worse than to put Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	's com - pact little volume into his satchel before starting for
England	LOCATION	.

		On the twenty-fifth anniversity of his `` Tramp Trip , '' described in a book that enthralled many a now sedate senior in his vigorous and adventurous youth , Mr.
Lee Meriwether	PERSON	was moved to make the experiment of an automobile journey over the same enchanted ground , and he has related the incidents of this second and more pretentious enter - prise in '' Seeing Europe by Automobile . ''

		It was a five-thousand-mile jaunt , through
France	LOCATION	,
Switzer	PERSON	- land ,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, with an excursion into
Andorra	LOCATION	,
Corfu	LOCATION	,
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, and
Montenegro	LOCATION	, and it cost considerably more that
fifty cents	MONEY	a day , which was the average outlay on the previous journey .

		Details of expense , routes , distances , etc. , are given for the benefit of prospective tourists , and the whole story is told with the same secure and satisying grip on the realities of foreign travel that marks the author 's earlier books of the same class .

		The author 's wife doubles the joys and halves the annoyances of this second European excursion .

		Their petroleum-propelled vehicle was aptly named the ' Get-There . ''

		Illustrations from photographs abound , and a map shows the route followed .

		Again the ''
Sunbeam	ORGANIZATION	, '' made famous by the pen of the late Lady Brassey , appears in literature , this time introduced .

		by one of her latest passengers , Mr.
Horace G. Hutchinson	PERSON	, who , in `` A Saga of the
Sunbeam	ORGANIZATION	, ' '' tells all about the gallant yacht 's re - cent trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	voyage from
Dover	LOCATION	to
Montreal	LOCATION	and return .

		A pause at
Reykjavik	LOCATION	, in
Iceland	LOCATION	, on the westward trip pleasantly diversified the pro- gramme , and
Tadousac	PERSON	and the Saguenay offered much of unusual interest for the voyagers after their arrival in Canadian waters .

		A half-dozen congenial souls , including
Lord Brassey	PERSON	, formed the party .

		Now sailing , now steaming the little vessel covered more than seven thousand miles .

		`` And this is the boat , be it noted , '' concludes the chronicle , '' that was built in
1874	DATE	, that has been constantly in commission ever since , that has been seen in ports of every country on the globe , and that has never feared the biggest seas .

		Perhaps as fine a parting word as can be said for both of them is that she is worthy of her admiral and owner , and for him that he is worthy of the little ship that he still loves to sail in every sea . ''

		A portrait of
Lord Brassey	ORGANIZATION	faces the title-page , and other illustrations and a map are supplied .

		Two motives have actuated Mr.
George Renwick	PERSON	in writing his book entitled ''
Finland	LOCATION	To-day . ''

		First , he has sought to furnish a full and faithful 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, description of that scenically beautiful country , '' the land of a thousand lakes , '' so that the intend - ing visitor may intelligently map his route before - hand ; and , secondly , he has '' tried to do what has not been done in English before to present not only a descriptive account of the land , but to cover the entire ground of the brave little nation 's activ - ities .

		In literature , music , painting , architecture , in politics and social progress ,
Finland	LOCATION	has done great things and will do still greater . ''

		In its scope and in its execution Mr.
Renwick	PERSON	's well-written and well-illustrated book is the best descriptive work on
Finland	LOCATION	that has yet been published in En S lish -

		* To arouse the self-satisfied from their complac - ency , to pierce the armor of the optimist , to stir the sluggish springs of sympathy , and to de-senti - mentalize life by painting its grim realities , seem to have been the essential aims of Mr.
John Gals	PERSON	- worthy in the remarkable series of novels , plays , and sketches which he has given us during the past few years , and which have made him among living English writers one of those most to be reckoned with .

		Sharp observation and unsparing analysis have been his instruments , while his message has been driven home by the agencies of caustic satire and a style at once refined and severe .

		He has scorned all cheap emotional devices , and has kept his own personality aloof from his presentation of life , thereby gaining the power which such restraint alone can confer .

		He will lay bare to us in the most matter-of-fact way the most intolerable condi - tions and the most subtle hypocrisies , making us feel , without a hint of special pleading , that the responsibility is with us , and that it is for us to do something .

		Few writers have his skill to set the conscience vibrating , and to strip the verities of existence from their trappings .

		Sometimes his thought , so pitiful at heart , seems almost pitiless in expression , so careful is he to exclude sentiment from what he has to say .

		incur his condemnation .

		We think that `` The Patrician , '' which is the fifth of his novels of English society , shows the mellowing which is what Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	has hitherto most needed , and is in consequence the best of them all .

		The indignation glowing beneath his mask of restraint is no less hot than before , but he has learned to make more allow - ances , and better to understand how character is warped by influences beyond its control .

		We doubt if he could have written five years ago as sympa - thetically of the British aristocracy as he now writes in the character of Courtier , who is more distinctly than any other figure in `` The Patrician '' to be taken as the author 's spokesman . ''

		He felt a very genuine pity for these people who seemed to lead an existence as it were smothered under their own social importance .

		It was not their fault .

		He recognized that they did their best .

		They were good specimens of their kind ; neither soft nor luxurious , as things went in a degenerate and ex - travagant age ; they evidently tried to be simple and this seemed to him to heighten the pathos of their situation .

		Fate had been too much for them .

		What human spirit could emerge untrammelled from that great encompassing host of material ad - vantage ? ''

		This is the tragedy of the novel for it is a tragedy that the noblest spirits , nurtured in such an environment and weighted with such a burden of social tradition , can not escape its deaden - ing consequences .

		It looks for a time as if they might , both the man and the woman with whom the interest is chiefly concerned , but heredity and social pressure prove too much for them , and their efforts to become free individuals slacken and die as their destinies are worked out .

		The tragedy is most poignant in the case of the young woman , who contracts a loveless marriage in her own class , when she might have had a true companion of her spirit .

		In the case of her brother , the '' patrician '' of the title , our sympathies are not quite so clear , for what seems to him the only path to happiness is by way of an illicit love , and his act of renuncia - tion raises him to a higher moral plane .

		He is a rising statesman , and his problem is not unlike that of the statesman in '' The New Machiavelli , '' but instead of weakly yielding and counting the world well lost , he conquers his own passion , and devotes his life to the public .

		We could wish that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	had not complicated the issue with this illicit element , and had given us a situation in which the lines were clearly drawn between the claims of legitimate love , on the one hand , and the claims of caste , on the other .

		This would have offered a real problem , with a fair balance between the clashing interests , such as we actually have in the case of the sister and her stifled romance .

		To get away from personal considerations , it is refresh - ing to find that the author , who would probably consent to being classified with the democrats , is so far unbiassed by the catchwords of that cult that he can do justice to the aristocratic position , for if we take the term '' aristocracy '' in its root-sense it
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 443 stands for a principle which a far-seeing democracy must recognize , and which is , we believe , in only apparent opposition to the true democratic doctrine .

		`` See the figure of that policeman !

		Running through all the good behaviour of this crowd , however safe and free it looks , there is , there always must be , a central force holding it together .

		Where does that central force come from ?

		From the crowd itself , you say .

		I answer : No .

		Look back at the origin of human States .

		From the begin - nings of things , the best man has been the unconscious medium of authority , of the controlling principle , of the divine force ; he felt that power within him physical , at first he used it to take the lead , he has held the lead ever since , he must always hold it .

		All your processes of election , your so-called democratic apparatus , are only a blind to the enquiring , a sop to the hungry , a salve to the pride of the rebellious .

		They are merely surface machinery , they can - not prevent the best man from coming to the top ; for the best man stands nearest to the Deity , and is the first to receive the waves that come from him . ''

		These words are given to Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's k ' patri - cian , '' and the author will probably admit that they contain a world of truth .

		Returning to the more technical matters of literary art , we must find space for a word of praise for the extraordinary skill in characterization displayed throughout this novel , for the deft manner in which even trifling incidents are given significance relative to the main action , and for the compact and pregnant style , never strained beyond the limits of good taste , and equal to every demand made upon it .

		The novel is in so many ways remarkable that a review many times as long as ours would be required to do it adequate justice .

		Just a group of people in an ancient English town most of them connected as officials or pen - sioners with two charitable foundations for decayed gentlemen and Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has all that he needs to steal away our cares , and transport us to the artist 's realm of delight .

		He tells no story worth mentioning , and does not need to , for the psychology of these old gentlemen offers a more than satisfactory substitute for any narrative .

		Chief of them in charm of personality is the Brother Copas whose name gives a title to the book .

		He is a big - hearted man , quaintly humorous and ironic , a scholar of parts , and an assiduous angler .

		He it is who composes quarrels among the brethren , leads in their protest against too much ritualism , befriends the child who is transplanted from overseas to live among them , and ferrets out the malicious traducer of the child 's good name .

		He it is also who supplies most of the scholarship needed for the pageant in which the story culminates , and in which the glories of the ancient town are made into spectacular object - lessons .

		The author once more puts his rich and delightful antiquarianism at his readers ' service , embroidering the tale with many a quaint bit of old - time lore .

		We are particularly indebted to him for the translation which Brother Copas is assumed to make of the `` Pervigilium Veneris , '' which is as happy a reproduction of that classic of the deca - dence as we have ever seen .

		The child Corona we shall not attempt to describe , beyond saying that she is a real child , and that he misses much who fails to make her acquaintance .

		And it must not be for - gotten that it is the child 's unconscious influence that sweetens the lives of the rather quarrelsome pension - ers , brings out their better natures , and unites them in the common bond of interest in her welfare .

		We always expect entertainment from a novel by Mr. and Mrs.
Castle	PERSON	, and the expectation is amply fulfilled in - the case of `` Panther 's Cub , '' a story of cosmopolitan life and romantic interest .

		The '' panther '' is an operatic actor of dubious ante - cedents and violent temper , who is in training for `` Salome , '' and is richly endowed with the physical and emotional characteristics needed for the representation of that spectacular creature .

		Her contortions and her screams of frenzied rage are perhaps a little overdone , but they make her a very vivid and startling creature .

		The '' Cub '' is her daughter , kept in a pensionnat until her debut is long past due , treated as a child when she is finally brought to her mother 's side , and really a child in her innocence of the world .

		One
Lord Desmond	PERSON	, a Byronic diplomat , is marked for her prey by the panther , who is so confident of her own seductive charms that she never imagines , until we reach the enlightening climax , that it is the daughter he loves , and that the mother inspires him only with loathing .

		When the discovery is made , she tears numerous passions to tatters , writhes on the furniture , and screams herself into nervous exhaustion .

		Mean - while the girl has eloped with
Lord Desmond	PERSON	, who is so overwhelmed by the revelation of her virginal innocence that he abandons his wicked designs , and contracts with her a hurried but perfectly good marriage at
Dover	LOCATION	.

		These are the leading figures and chief happenings of the story , but we must not forget the astute Jewish impresario , whose discovery the panther is , and who needs all his suavity and tact to keep her within bounds .

		He even offers to marry the cub , to clear the mother 's field of her one dangerous rival .

		These are all striking character - izations , but there is possibly a finer art displayed in the portrayal of the members of Lord Desmond 's family , who are horror-stricken at the thought of his contemplated mesalliance , and do their best to avert the calamity .

		Sir
Joseph Smith	PERSON	in particular , smug and pompous , a connection by marriage , is a source of much satisfaction whenever he makes an appearance .

		Finally , there is the mysterious German musician
Fritz	PERSON	, repetitor for the mother and pro- tector of the child , who comes in at the end as the deus ex machind , and turns out to be at once hus - band and father .

		The book will thus be seen to have a great variety of interest combined with strong theatrical effect ; its atmosphere is in the main successfully romantic , although there are delicious touches of realism .

		The sentiment gets a little cloying toward the end , and Lord Desmond in his new character of reformed rake is not exactly con - vincing , but much may be forgiven of a book that is the product of such fertility of imagination and such buoyancy of spirit .

		After the Castles , the
Williamsons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The guide - book fiction with which Mr. and Mrs.
Williamson	PERSON	444 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, have so liberally provided us of late years receives an accession in '' The Golden Silence . ''

		The title has no particular significance , referring , we should judge , to the mystery of the Arab character and the instinctive secrecy of the oriental when the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean seeks to invade his privacy .

		For the scene of this story after a brief
London	LOCATION	prologue is
Algiers	LOCATION	, whither the hero repairs for rest after cer - tain strenuous experiences at home .

		He has figured in a lawsuit brought against his brother by a beau - tiful Canadian adventuress , and , upon her defeat , has proposed to her in a moment of impulsive sym - pathy .

		Their marriage is not to take place for some weeks , and this respite permits the holiday which provides the occasion for the real story , and has rather momentous consequences .

		For upon the journey he encounters another fair American en - gaged upon an Algerian quest , and we soon realize that she is to be the real heroine .

		She is in search of an older sister who had yielded some ten years earlier to the pleadings of an Arab a spahi in the French service and had gone to
Algiers	LOCATION	as his bride .

		Nothing has been heard from her for a long time , and she seems to have plunged irrevocably into '' the golden silence . ''

		The story of the track - ing and discovery of the lost one fills most of the book , and has to be picked out as a thread from the tangle of description and trifling conversation with which the pages are chiefly filled .

		It is a thin story , only mildly entertaining , written from considerable knowledge of the externals of Algerian life , but displaying little penetrative power .

		In the end , matters are patched up with the adventuress , who accepts a financial solatium , and leaves the hero in possession of the new lady-love whose adventures he has shared for some eventful weeks . ''

		The things that happen have a great deal to do with it '' meaning a human life .

		These are all but the last words of the fine novel which Mrs.
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	has given us as a successor to ``
Nathan Burke	PERSON	. ''

		We are almost tempted to call `` The Legacy '' a sequel to the earlier work , because General
Burke	PERSON	's name is frequently mentioned , although he does not appear upon the scene , and because we get a sense of continuity from the fact that we are brought into the same
Ohio	LOCATION	environ - ment , and enter into the lives of people of the same general sort .

		It is the new generation , viewed by the writer with the old penetration , and dealt with after the same leisurely fashion .

		The heroine , whose life is traced from childhood , through mar - riage and widowhood , and into the haven of a sub - stantial but most unromantic second marriage , is a
Breen	PERSON	.

		This , we are given to understand , means much from the viewpoint of caste prejudice , although the members of the family who are described for us , and who include representations of four genera - tions , are for the most part pretty poor specimens of individual humanity .

		The heroine is about the best of them all , but even she comes perilously near to becoming a victim of the racial weakness which has brought her family to decay .

		It is accident rather than any inward
spring	DATE	of character that saves her for respectability , and her words which we have quoted express her own realization of this fact .

		All of these
Breens	PERSON	are interesting , although many of them are disreputable , because they are pictured for us by a hand that spares neither foible nor folly , yet has an unfailing sympathy of touch .

		We feel throughout that the writer is giving us a transcript from real life , and her treatment makes most of the conventions of romantic fiction seem like cheap devices .

		Few recent novels are deserv - ing of as high praise as may fairly be accorded to this one , and we may safely allow that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has already won for herself an honorable place in American literature .

		A pretty romance of the days of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, a work which moves easily in its historical milieu , yet is not overburdened with antiquarian lore , is given us in `` The Imprudence of Prue , '' by Miss
Sophie Fisher	PERSON	.

		The heroine 's imprudence follows upon an encounter with a fascinating highwayman , who stops her coach upon the heath , and , finding nothing else of which to rob her , steals a kiss .

		As her memory dwells upon the episode , resentment softens into a different sort of feeling , and she continues to be imprudent .

		Being an impecunious widow and a desperate coquette , she is embarrassed by debt , and , learning that the highwayman of her chance encounter is a prisoner in
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, and to be hanged in a few days , she conceives the happy thought of asking that he bestow his name upon her , that she may , as his wife -LRB- and soon thereafter his widow ! -RRB-

		, snap her fingers at her creditors .

		A secret ceremony follows , with consequences un - foreseen .

		For the man , fired by her loveliness finds life once more precious , and secures his release by a shrewd bargain with the authorities .

		The woman , discovering that her heart has unin - tentionally been given with her hand , comes to her husband 's rescue when he is again in difficulties , and finally takes flight with him to
France	LOCATION	, leaving behind her a retinue of disappointed aspirants .

		Since the highwayman turns out to be a nobleman and a Jacobite , the match is not so bad an affair after all .

		This story is told with much sprightli - ness , and its constructive skill is rather out of the common .

		Pastor
Gustav Frenssen	PERSON	is one of the two or three living German novelists who count the most , and a new work from his hand is a literary event .

		While we can not say that ''
Klaus Hinrich Baas	PERSON	'' is as successful an achievement as `` J6rn
Uhl	PERSON	, '' or even as ''
Hilligenlei	PERSON	, '' we can nevertheless accord it high praise as a serious portrayal of modern life the life of that corner of
Germany	LOCATION	fronting the
North Sea	LOCATION	, which the author knows so well .

		It is a new departure for
Herr Frenssen	PERSON	in the respect that it is concerned with the commercial life of a , great city rather than with the life of the peasantry upon its native moor , and in this substitution of Ham - burg for Holstein we become conscious of a lack of the intimate and deeply sympathetic knowledge dis -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 445 played when the author bids us view with his eyes the flat and wind-swept spaces of the open country and the serious and sombre lives of their agricul - tural population .

		Nevertheless , we have all this for a background , for
Klaus Hinrich	PERSON	is of peasant stock , and we first come to know him in his natural surroundings .

		Even later , when he is gaming his business experience in the
Malayan East	LOCATION	, and when in the city on the
Elbe	LOCATION	he is applying his shrewd and sharpened wits to the problem of rehabilitating an old merchant firm which has been brought by slackness to the verge of ruin , we are all the time reminded of the soil from which he has sprung , and of the primitive character which no amount of sophistication can wholly conceal .

		His life story is conscientiously and minutely related , from earliest childhood to maturity , breaking off rather abruptly when he has reached middle life , but leaving us with the sense that his character is completely shaped , and that a further prolongation of his biog - raphy would have no further psychological interest , however interesting it might seem in incident and circumstance .

		He has rubbed against the world in many of its rough places , and he has made his way by native determination and force of character .

		His growth from visionary child to practical man of affairs is consistently worked out , and his career is replete with interesting experiences .

		He is a very human figure , making mistakes and paying for them , as men must always do ; in his relations with womankind , his life is too gross to be pleasing , but the discomfort with which we read of his amorous adventures arises less from our feeling about his weakness as an individual than from our disgust with the way in which the author takes such things for granted as a part of the life of the nor - mal man .

		Immorality is an ugly and pervasive fact in modern life , but its calm acceptance without a sign of indignation is not to be condoned in a writer whose aim is presumably idealistic .

		Too much of recent German literature is marred by just this sort of callousness .

		If it were not for the defect thus noted , ''
Klaus Hinrich	PERSON	Baas '' might be ranked as a worthy successor of
Freytag	ORGANIZATION	's '' Soil und Haben , '' of which one can not help thinking as its legitimate prototype .

		The literary testament of Antonio Fogazzaro the novel ' Leila '' which was published only a few weeks before the author 's death is now available in an English translation .

		We can not commend the translation , but it will serve .

		The work itself , while inferior to the best that
Fogazzaro	PERSON	has given us , has a spiritual elevation that goes far to com - pensate for its loose construction and diffuse style .

		If it does not tell a story of compelling interest , it does remind us on every page that the writer was one of the noblest souls of his time .

		The ship of his faith was securely anchored , despite the billows that tossed it this way and that .

		The note of sub - mission to authority is clearly sounded , but with it the note of determination to go as far as authority will permit in the direction of modernism .

		The two ideals are in such essential opposition of rela - tion that to readers not brought up within the shadow of the church there must be some suggestion of weakness of will in a writer who struggles to reconcile them , and it takes a considerable effort to accord him the fullest sympathy . ''

		Leila '' is directly connected with '' II Santo '' by the fact that
Alberti	PERSON	, the young hero of the new novel , is a disciple of
Piero Maironi	PERSON	, and is devoted to the gospel of enlightenment for which '' the saint '' had laid down his life .

		The heroine , whose name with - out any reason becomes '' Lelia '' in this translation , is a high-spirited and passionate girl who long defends her maiden citadel only to surrender it the more completely in the end .

		She loves
Alberti	PERSON	, but she is led by malicious tongues to think him a fortune-hunter and herself the victim of a carefully - laid plot .

		She is also disturbed about her faith , not having won her way to the serene heights occupied by her lover .

		She is the adopted daughter of Signer Marcello , to whose son she had been betrothed .

		Upon the son 's death , the father had rescued her from her disreputable parents , making her a member of his household and his heiress .

		Upon
Alberti	PERSON	, who had been his son 's dearest friend ,
Signor Marcello	PERSON	now lavishes his affections , and it becomes his dearest desire that Leila shall become
Alberti	PERSON	's wife .

		A saintly old woman who is an old friend of the family , and a lovable old priest , are the agencies by which the girl 's eyes are opened and her pride overcome .

		All these people are so oppressively good that the intrusion of
Leila	LOCATION	's father provides a welcome relief , and a similar function is fulfilled by the two wicked priests who serve as a foil to the simple-hearted
Don Aurelio	PERSON	.

		The story has little substance , and is much more a tract than a novel .

		As far as its action is concerned , and even its psychology , a full three - fourths of the writing might well be spared .

		With a bold and lavish , yet artistic , hand Mr.
Chase	PERSON	sketches the account of three extended trips into the Sierras that form the towering ramparts about the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	or Gorge , as he would have us more sci - entifically designate this unique chasm cut deep into the western flank of the great range of mountains between
California	LOCATION	and
Nevada	LOCATION	.

		The book is not a dry scientific account of the geology and natural history of the central
Sierra Nevada	ORGANIZATION	range , but rather the rhapsody of a lover of woods and trails , of camp-fires and '' mulligans , '' of pines and sequoias , 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of mountain meadows , granite ledges , and snow - fields .

		It is not a guide-book , and the accompany - ing map is of indifferent value in comparison with others readily available such as those of the
United States Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , on the other hand , an entrancing introduction for the nov - ice who seeks in cold print some living idea of the beauty and charms of the much-visited floor of the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	, and of its towering walls and tum - bling water-falls ; or for the prospective mountaineer who would essay the trails about the rim of the chasm , and explore the canyons of the
Hetch Hetchy	ORGANIZATION	,

		Indeed , even the veteran of many Sierran summers will find his memory of many a familiar trail or outlook quick - ened by these pages .

		His heart will leap within him in response to the author 's enthusiastic de - scription of familiar experiences and well-known and fondly-remembered scenes , and he will forth - with plan a new campaign for the coming

		The book is rich in allusion to the forest trees and flowers of the high mountains , and the writer is both observant and skilful in his portrayal of these charms of Sierran travel .

		He barely escapes , how - ever , falling into the too-prevalent error of over - estimating the age of the big trees . ''

		Fifty years for every year of human life '' is perhaps too liberal an estimate for even the Nestor of the Wawona grove of sequoias .

		The author very justly con - demns the inane habit of attaching names of eminent or would-be eminent men or of aspiring towns to the great trees .

		Our system of national parks and great forest reserves has done much to preserve this magnificant playground for the Amer - ican people , and Mr.
Chase	PERSON	has performed a gen - uine service in so skilfully extending the invitation to all who read to come and play in these mountain fastnesses .

		Practical Eight years ago , Mrs.
Helena Ruther	PERSON	- yardening furd
Ely	PERSON	put some of her gardening for women .

		experiences into a book which she called '' A Woman 's Hardy Garden . ''

		So eagerly was it received , that
two years later	DATE	, `` Another Hardy Garden Book '' was issued in answer to the appeal for help in the care of shrubs , which are the necessary associates of the herbaceous plants of which Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	had told so much in her first vol - ume .

		To these two books , more than to any others written by American gardeners , we owe the present widespread interest in permanent gardening , and the demand for the many beautiful periodicals which are turning us as a people from the crudities of bedding-out plants , and the fleeting charms of annuals , to the sober trustworthiness of the hardy plants .

		Now , after a long silence , in which her experience has widened and deepened , Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	offers us a beautiful and helpful guide-book to `` The Practical Flower Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is less of repetition in these pages than one would have thought possible , considering that , after all , the same good green things must be spoken of , and that '' since Adam delved and Eve span '' no new way of confiding a root to the guardianship of Mother Earth has been discovered .

		With an enthusiasm which use has not made dull , Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	gives careful directions for the preparation and re - newal of soils , for the making of lawns , and for the building of terraces .

		In a chapter which it would be well to have printed at public expense and dis - tributed far and wide as a hostage to the fortunes of the Republic , she explains the methods of rearing trees from seeds .

		In suggesting plans for color arrangement , she follows Miss
Gertrude Jekyll	PERSON	, a writer whom it would indeed be impossible to surpass in taste , in knowledge , or in charm .

		Per - haps the most interesting pages of Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	's new book are those in which she describes the experi - ment made by one of her friends , who , on a many - acred plot , has chosen to bring together the flora of his own state , and who has gathered into his '' Con - necticut garden '' only native plants .

		The idea is , happily , not new ; but Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	's sympathetic descriptions , aided by the many illustrative plates , furnish fresh hope that a type of garden alike suited to the owner of a great estate and to the mistress of a village back-yard may find many followers .

		To repeat the names of beautiful and available material for such planting , would be to reprint the index to Gray 's '' Manual '' ; while to possess them requires only a basket or two , a spade , a trowel which one need not be over-nice in using , a horse which does not mind long waits by the roadside , a wagon , and above all the seeing eye and the loving heart without which there is no true garden .

		No better way of teaching patriotism could be imagined than the planting of parks and school-yards with the trees and shrubs of their vicinage .

		He sought game when muzzle-lpading rifles made it still adventurous to do so ; he rode and tramped from end to end of a country whose geography was still vague .

		An irresistible love of the wilderness seems to have been his impelling motive ; but a curious genius for the comprehension of animal psychology accounted for his success , and two generations later would probably have made a '' camera hunter '' of him .

		He killed animals for meat ; he killed grizzlies because of the peril which , in the days of single-shot rifles , accompanied the attempt .

		But the capture of wild game was his purpose , and it is this that makes his book so inter - esting .

		He seems to have been the only man who has tamed the grizzly . ''

		Lady

Ben Franklin	PERSON	, '' taken as a tiny cub in one of the most exciting ex - ploits of the book , became his particular friend , saved his life in conflict with another grizzly , and came back to civilization with a horde of other animals which '' the old hunter '' exhibited in his declining years .

		The author of this volume , Mr.
Theodore H. Hittell	PERSON	, saw these animals , and rode upon ''
Ben Franklin	PERSON	's '' back .

		In
San Francisco	LOCATION	, in
1857-9	DATE	, he took down from dictation the narra - tive of

		It is a curious narrative , and almost un - believably adventurous .

		However , Mr.
Hittell	PERSON	believes it to be true ; Mr.
William H. Wright	PERSON	, the author of a recent book entitled '' The Grizzly Bear , '' not only believes it , but ascribes to the chance reading of these remarkable stories his own career as a '' camera-hunter , '' in which he has veri - fied many of the statements of the earlier book .

		Furthermore , the scientific manuals on the grizzly bear are in substantial accord with the old hunter 's observations , indeed , they quote him as a source .

		So here is a hunter 's book for boys and - men with a scientific and historical value as great , though by no means so intense , as its interest .

		To be envied is the reader who for the first time follows the capture of the giant ''
Samson	PERSON	, '' or in that thrilling next-to-the-last chapter breathlessly awaits the issue of a vain attempt to take the mysterious and mag - nificent jaguar ... Plain living and high thinking at lofty altitudes , with considerable hard bodily labor to give things a keen relish , are evidently what Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	chooses for his summer-vacation programme ; and he writes inspiringly and alwajs entertainingly of his hot-weather occupations and recreations in `` The Cabin '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , illustrating the book with pictures from his own camera .

		High up in the
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	range , the exact location undesignated , he and the companion of his joys and wholesome hard - ships build them a rude but weather-proof abode , being aided therein by a competent master of many trades , and there they luxuriate in the bliss of silvan solitude and the grandeurs of nature .

		Yet they do have occasional visitors , among whom ''
California	LOCATION	Summering in the Sierras .

		John '' deserves foremost mention , and his shrewd philosophy merits more ample quotation than would here be in place . ''

		Trouble is , '' remarks this sage , `` when a man starts out to do a thing , he just nat ` rally sees it all done before his eyes , and he strains himself day in and out till it is done ... A man do n't want to give a cuss whether a thing gets done or not , but just whether he keeps workin ' along at it .

		If he does that , it 's bound to get done , and without worryin ' him .

		And he ai n't so plumb feverish all the time . ''

		Not unnaturally , Mr.
White	PERSON	likes the mountain folk , few and far between though they are , or since they are . ''

		They live a life that depends more than the common on its individual resource ; and at the same time the better class of them possess a remarkably high standard of taste and education .

		Books , and good ones , are abundant .

		In addition are certain qualities of hospitality , the breadth of view incidental to the meeting of many types on a plane of equality and independence in the manner of thinking . ''

		One gets from the book a good idea of the courage and grit of the forest rangers , and also of the glaring inadequacy of the support rendered by the national government to these guardians of our silvan wealth .

		But the situ - ation is now somewhat less deplorable than it once was .

		`` The Cabin '' -LRB- to sum up -RRB- pictures , in the form of personal experience , the same hearty and wholesome and pulse-quickening mountain life that has already been portrayed , under the guise of fiction , in '' The Rules of the Game , '' by the same author .

		A b ok of ^ anv revision of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's small Engiith catalogue of biblia a-biblia , books country houtet .

		wn ich are no books , place should be found for what may be called the '' every-man - his-own-architect '' publications , those pretentious portfolios of second-hand photographs and plans , chosen in most cases without the slightest architec - tural taste or judgment , accompanied by a thin sauce of perfunctory or misleading text .

		With this class of books Mr.
Lawrence Weaver	PERSON	's '' Small Country Houses of To-day '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- has nothing in common .

		Unerring good taste in choice of examples , sound practical knowledge , acute aesthetic perceptions , and a literary skill sel - dom to be found in architectural writing , charac - terize this imposing quarto .

		Forty - six houses , designed by various English architects of estab - lished reputation , and representing a wide range of architectural treatment and adaptation to natural situations , are illustrated and described .

		The chief qualities of each house are explained and empha - sized , and its relations , historic and social , with the houses of past days are noted .

		Definite details as to cost , wherever these were obtainable , also find place .

		A separate chapter discusses the problems connected with the repair and enlargement of old houses , this being followed by detailed accounts of six houses so treated .

		The editor notes that , after a century of struggling with vicious architectural in - 448 THE DIAL fluences , chiefly the lack of tradition , there may now be discerned a tendency toward a truce in the battle of the styles and a revival in form and spirit of the old basic traditions .

		But much yet remains to be done chiefly in the way of familiarizing the pub - lic with correct architectural theory and practice . ''

		Building needs , in fact , to be brought back into the normal current of intelligent thought , instead of being relegated to the limbo of technical mysteries . ''

		This end would be quickly accomplished if all our architectural writers were possessed of Mr.
Weaver	PERSON	's skill in enlivening and vivifying , as well as illuminating , their subject .

		Some two hundred and fifty photographs depict the most interesting features , outside and in , of each house described , and measured floor plans also are given .

		As in all the English '' Country Life '' publications -LRB- of which this is one -RRB- , the photographs are remarkably well reproduced and printed .

		Finally , it should be said that although this book is thoroughly English in its origin and treatment , it will on that account be found but little less serviceable and interesting to the American reader .

		Anything more conventional than '' The Ideal Italian Tour '' described by Mr.
Henry James Forman	PERSON	, it would be difficult to imagine .

		The writer lands at
Naples	LOCATION	, proceeds to '' do '' successively the cities of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Siena	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Milan	LOCATION	,
Genoa	LOCATION	, and the Lakes , all in precisely the regular order and the regular way of all tourists .

		After appar - ently not a long stay abroad , he has gone home , gathered before him on his desk his Baedekers , maps , and local guidebooks , and proceeded to write about
Italy	LOCATION	in a manner that reminds one of the eighteenth century poet who was said to have writ - ten about Epping Forest '' with his back to the win - dow and never having seen the forest . ''

		Those charming and highly characteristic towns that even the hastiest tourist seldom omits
Assisi	LOCATION	,
Perugia	LOCATION	,
Orvieto	LOCATION	,
Spezia	LOCATION	, are not so much as mentioned ; Italian life and temperament , where it remains un - touched by commercial relations with strangers , receives almost no attention .

		Moreover , the illus - trations are so small in size , so poorly selected , and so hackneyed from use in the cheapest series of post-cards , that they add nothing in the way of charm .

		For example , why should there be a picture of
San Francesco	LOCATION	at
Assisi	LOCATION	, since
Assisi	LOCATION	itself is not mentioned in the text ; and , if a picture of it had to be used , why select one from its least attractive point of view ?

		But obvious and superfluous as the book seems to those who really know and love
Italy	LOCATION	, perhaps there may be some who will like to carry it with them on their journey to read at night about what they have seen during the day .

		At least , the author says that Tie felt the need of such a book on his first Italian journey , and that there - fore he has written it , to '' point to the salient and indispensable . ''

		It is undeniable that he has gathered together a considerable amount of useful information about certain parts of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But to call his tour the '' ideal '' one is far from justified .

		In typography , paper , and binding , the publishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have provided a setting worthy of a better text .

		A
summer	DATE	in '' Vacation days !

		Oh , the lure of a sportsman 's them , the delight of their anticipa - paradise .

		tion , the joys of their realization , and the sweet sanctity of their memory ! ''

		Thus exclaims , in fondly retrospective mood , Mr.
Kirkland B. Alexander	PERSON	, recalling the pleasures of a
summer	DATE	outing on the trout streams of Lake Su - perior . ''

		The Log of the North Shore Club '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- is the diverting record of this fishing excur - sion in a comparatively unfrequented region , where the unsophisticated trout rise to the illusive fly with an avidity most gratifying to the person whipping those virgin waters . ''

		Three trout on three flies are not infrequent in these far-away streams , '' writes the author .

		The prowess with rod and reel of the six vacationers , the accomplishments and the sayings of their guides , the astonishing feat performed by old
Michael	PERSON	of making a water - tight birch bark pot and boiling a trout therein , the breathless shooting of dangerous rapids , and the trials and tribulations of the arduous portage these and much else besides go to pack the pages of Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's little book brimful of good reading .

		Vivacity and humor mark his style , as a specimen of which we quote from an amusing account of the maiden attempt of a '' Business Man '' at trout - fishing : '' He explained afterward that he thought it might be the safe and courteous course to permit the trout to swallow the fly right down to the tail , if he cared to , and then deftly pull the trout inside - out , thus saving much irksome culinary labor . ''

		Good pictures from photographs plentifully illus - trate the book .

		It is a capital fishing yarn , and just the thing to read before planning a vacation in the wilderness .

		Those who know Professor L. H .

		An eloquent , advocate of
Bailey	PERSON	only through his numerous country life .

		technical books on farming and gardening and kindred subjects will do well to read his latest volume , '' The Country Life Movement '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and , in conjunction with it , the new and revised edition of his '' Outlook to Nature . ''

		Few of us have heretofore associated Professor
Bailey	PERSON	's writings with any qualities of sentiment , except such as play a very subordinate part in his instructive works .

		But his two latest volumes give us a new opinion of the man .

		We see him here as a genuine lover of nature , and catch fleeting glimpses of the poet , of whose existence we had not dreamed .

		His ideas of nature-writing are thus suggested : `` The real objection to much of nature-writing is the fact that it is unrepresentative of nature .

		It exploits the exceptional , and therefore does not give the reader a truthful picture of common and average conditions .

		Good nature-writing is that which por - trays the commonplace so truthfully and so clearly
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 The ttorv of the foretts of
England	LOCATION	.

		that the reader forthwith goes out to see for himself .

		Some day we shall care less for the marvellous beasts of a far-off country than for the mice and squirrels and birds of our own fields , and for the cattle on our hills . ''

		It is upon this conception that Professor
Bailey	PERSON	has based these two very delightful books .

		He treats of the common things of life , and invests them with a charm that makes what he writes as entertaining as a romance to those who feel the impulses that turn us nature-ward .

		He sees things as they are , and he is able to make his readers see them also .

		He believes in the '' back - to-nature '' idea , and finds in it a corrective for many of the false notions that affect society to-day .

		The devout spirit in which Mr.
Houghton Townley	PERSON	views the maj - esty of the tall ancestral trees scat - tered o'er the pleasant land of
England	LOCATION	is indicated by the opening words of his '' English Woodlands and Their Story '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- . ''

		He who stands beneath the mammoth Beeches of Burnham , '' he declares , '' and feels that man , the pigmy parasite of an insignificant planet , is still the grandest work of God , must either be an egoist , bankrupt of humility and insensible to the imposing majesty of trees , or a person unimpressed by the bewildering , mind-staggering idea of Time . ''

		If bigness and age are marks of superiority in the scheme of things , man is indeed but a poor creature compared with a millennial beech or oak of
England	LOCATION	's splendid forests .

		Without arguing the point , we are content to enter into the spirit of Mr.
Townley	PERSON	's handsome book in praise of his country 's woodlands .

		In grouping his matter , he devotes , first of all , five chapters to the
Burnham Beeches	LOCATION	, then two to
Sherwood Forest	ORGANIZATION	, three to the New Forest , three to
Epping	LOCATION	and the
Forest of Essex	ORGANIZATION	, two to the Forest of Dean , one to
Windsor Forest	ORGANIZATION	, one to
Savernake	PERSON	and a few other forests , and a concluding chapter to woodland photog - raphy .

		Story , legend , and description are pleasantly intermingled in his pages , and an even hundred of excellent camera illustrations please the eye and emphasize the written words of the author .

		Views of fabulously old trees and also of some astonish - ingly grotesque malformations of aged trunks and branches form a feature of the book .

		The tree - lover who does not delight in Mr.
Townley	PERSON	's volume must be difficult to please .

		How to live in the country .

		The name of
E. P. Powell	PERSON	stands for very much the same thing to those who are interested in the country home and its development that the name of
John Burroughs	PERSON	does to those who are interested in nature .

		In his latest volume , '' How to Live in the Country '' -LRB- Outing Co. -RRB- , the pleasures of country life are depicted from the standpoint of long per - sonal experience .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	knows his subject thoroughly , and in treating it he blends the senti - mental and the practical in a manner that makes his book very agreeable reading .

		Some of his advice is so extremely prosaic that it would be difficult to swallow without the sugar coating of sentiment .

		But that makes it palatable , and when the taste of the coating is gone it is not a difficult matter to assimilate the advice he gives about many unro - mantic and practical things that have to do with country life .

		So attractive are many of his chap - ters that they beguile us into becoming converts to his theories , almost against our better judgment .

		He does this by interesting us in his philosophizing , and then , when he has us under the spell of his wise and witty sayings he springs upon us the subject that he has had in mind all the while ; and we are sure to get some good out of it , even if we do not make a practical application of his advice .

		It is a good thing to know how the matters of which he treats can be done , even if we do not see fit to undertake the doing of them ourselves .

		The book is one to pick up and read at odd moments one to open anywhere and become interested in at once .

		The city man or woman who has a love and a long - ing for nature will find Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's volume almost as good as a visit to the country , for the winds of the hills and the meadows and the pastures blow through it and freshen every page .

		A guide to Intelligent summer visitors to
Cali	LOCATION	- thepinetreet fornia may their number still in - of
California	LOCATION	.

		crease will find Mr.
J. Smeaton Chase	PERSON	's '' Cone-bearing Trees of the
California Mountains	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- a most convenient and use - ful little book .

		It is intended to introduce the amateur tree-lover to some of the noblest trees in the world .

		Concise and non-technical descriptions of the various species are given , these descriptions having especial reference to the bark , the leaves , and the cones .

		There is a full-page plate , made from a photograph , showing each tree as it stands in its native surroundings , and a drawing in line shows the details of leaf and fruit .

		While the half-tone plates are not brilliant , they yet portray the habit of the tree ; and the sketches in line are always helpful and generally accurate .

		It is to be regretted that the volume is not larger ; we should prefer a longer list of these fascinating forms .

		Surely trees at lower altitudes in
California	LOCATION	are quite as certain to arouse the interest of the enthu - siastic traveller ; and we hope that , in some future revision of his little book , Mr.
Chase	PERSON	will double the number of species dealt with , including all those named in the introduction to the present book , but not described in the text following .

		The volume is of pocket size , and bound ir .

		flexible covers .

		A VOLUME of Recollections by Senator
Shelby M. Cullom	PERSON	is announced for
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	publication by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will cover a period of seventy - five years , beginning with the author 's boyhood in
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	, his experience as a young lawyer , his first entrance into politics , and covering his political life of over half a century .

		The volume will be illustrated .

		The Poetical Works of
Thomas Moore	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
A. D. Godley	PERSON	, and
Gary 's Dante	PERSON	, with the
Flaxman	PERSON	drawings , are two new volumes in the scholarly and inexpensive Oxford editions of the poets , published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Professor
Henry F. Osborn	PERSON	's address of last Septem - ber on '' Huxley and Education '' is now published as a booklet by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is a compendium of good advice to young students , based upon the soundest of principles .

		Baedeker 's '' Eastern Alps '' is now , in its twelfth English -LRB- thirty-fourth German -RRB- edition , a bigger book than the ''
Switzerland	LOCATION	, '' which illustrates rather strik - ingly the way in which tourists have been enlarging the area of their operations during recent years .

		Like all the other guide-books of this series it is imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		A volume of '' Narratives of
Early Carolina	LOCATION	,
1650	DATE	-
1708	DATE	, '' edited by Mr.
Alexander S. Salley	PERSON	, Jr. , for the ''
Original Narratives of Early American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' has been published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It will be noted that the earliest narratives given considerably antedate the actual grant of the
Carolinas	LOCATION	by
Charles II	PERSON	.

		We note that
Defoe	PERSON	's brief for the dissenters , entitled '' Party Tyranny , '' and published in
1705	DATE	, is included among the contents , which are otherwise from the pens of actual observers .

		A highly interesting collection of '' English Melodies from the 13th to the
18th Century	DATE	, '' numbering one hundred in all , has been made , and edited with an in - troduction and historical notes , by Mr.
Vincent Jack	PERSON	- son . ''

		Sumer is icumen in '' appropriately opens the collection , and '' God Save the King '' as appropriately closes it .

		Byrd ,
Campion	PERSON	,
Lawes	PERSON	,
Purcell	PERSON	,
Dibdin	PERSON	, and
Arne	PERSON	are represented by several numbers each , which will give some indication of the richness of the volume .

		It is a beautifully printed work , and is published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some eight hundred pages of verse , a moderate fraction of which proves to be poetry , is offered in the two volumes of Miss
Nellie Urner Wallington	PERSON	's '' Amer - can History by American Poets '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The col - lection runs the whole chronological gamut , from the mound builders to the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and may be rec - ommended for collateral reading by students of our history in its more prosaic forms of narration .

		Un - fortunately , such a work as this must devote an undue share of its contents to poems about fighting , and this emphasizes an aspect of history which should be kept as far as possible in the background .

		These volumes are supplied with historical notes , which most readers will need for many of the pieces .

		Awakened interest in natural history , and particularly in the life of animals of the wild , has called forth a varied assortment of books of general and of semi - technical nature in this field .

		Mr.
Ernest Protheroe	PERSON	's `` New Illustrated Natural History of the World '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- embodies all the non-technical information about animal life -LRB- exclusive of man 's -RRB- that the average person is looking for .

		The arrangement is according to zoological classification , with short descriptions of the characteristics of each species , its life history , geographical distribution , mode of life , etc. ; and bring - ing out , whenever space permits , the points of resem - blance and of difference between it and other species of the same class , order , or family .

		The text is elucidated with nearly three hundred photographic illustrations , made directly from life .

		There are also twenty-four full-page plates in color . ''

		Three Lays of Marie de
France	LOCATION	'' are retold in English verse by Mr.
Frederick Bliss Luquiens	PERSON	.

		The octosyllabic measures of the original have become blank verse in the translation , a change natural enough when we remember how closely we associate the '' matiere de Bretagne '' with the Tennysonian idyls . ''

		Sir Launfal , '' '' The Maiden of the Ash , '' and '' The Lovers Twain '' are the three poems which , with introduction and bibliog - raphy , make up the contents of this acceptable little volume .

		The book is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In '' How to Visit the Great Picture Galleries '' by
Esther Singleton	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , the tourist is taken through twenty-one of the principal European galleries , and his attention called to the most notable pictures in each .

		And , inasmuch as the average tourist often will be puzzled to understand the reasons for the selection of these special canvases rather than others that seem to him equally good , brief citations concerning them are given from art-historians and critics of authority .

		There are ninety-six full-page half-tone illustrations , and good indexes both to paintings and painters .

		Considering that the book contains less than five hundred pages , probably the work it undertakes to do could hardly be done better than it has been done here .

		An elementary manual , designed to give to lovers of nature simple and concise descriptions of our best - known trees , and one that has served its purpose for a decade or more , is Mr.
F. Schuyler Matthews	PERSON	's `` Familiar Trees and their Leaves '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		A new edition , with revisions embodying recent changes in botanical nomenclature and classification , and with some supple - mentary material , brings the work up to date .

		To the nearly two hundred detail drawings of leaf-forms by the author have now been added twenty studies illus - trating the new species in the supplement ; and new full - page colored sketches -LRB- a dozen in all -RRB- of growing trees , each showing some particular tree in its natural habitat , enhance the attractiveness and value of the volume .

		As a daughter of the late
Richard A. Proctor	PERSON	, it is but natural that the author of '' Half Hours with the Summer Stars '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- should be an enthusiastic student of the heavens .

		Naturally , also , she has had many opportunities for observing the stars not avail - able to the ordinary amateur .

		Among such advantages were two visits , of a month or two each , to the
Yerkes Observatory	ORGANIZATION	, with the use of the smaller telescopes and an occasional glimpse through the mighty forty-inch refractor .

		The direct result of these visits was a series of popular articles on the stars contributed last
August	DATE	to the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' and now republished -LRB- with - out change or revision -RRB- in book form .

		In thirty-four informal chapters ,
Miss Proctor	PERSON	gives the most inter - esting known facts about the chief splendors of the sky , with something of their mythology and folk-lore , and including also brief discussions of such subjects as '' The Moon and the Weather , '' '' Did Life First Come to the
Earth	LOCATION	in a Meteor ? ''

		etc. .

		In their original form , as newspaper artices , these chapters must have turned many people for the first time to the endlessly fascinating recreation of star-gazing ; and their present more permanent issue should still further promote that most desirable end .

		Postpaid
$ 1.45	MONEY	.

		We call the attention of those people who long for '' a really good novel '' to
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' THE PATRICIAN . ''

		Now discriminating readers often wait for the recommendation of persons of assured taste and judgment before reading a new book .

		But why can not reviews of assured taste and judgment stand in the place of these persons ?

		We ask you to note these comments on '' THE PATRICIAN , '' and to reflect on the quality of the reviews that make them . ''

		The novel is in so many ways remarkable , that a review many times as long as oars would be required to do it adequate justice . ''

		The Dial .

		`` It is a distinguished book , by reason of its style and because of the exactness and perfection with which the portraits of the characters are worked in upon the brain until the reader is confident that not merely would he know them if he met them in the street , but would recognise them by their voices in another room . ' '

		The
London	LOCATION	Academy . ''

		The book of the season is undoubtedly
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's ' THE PA TRICIAN . '

		``
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A novel of dignity and power .

		If it were not for a certain slackening apparent in the later chapters , we should incline to call it a great novel . ''

		The
New York Nation	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A literary production in which profundity of thought is formulated in artistic expression . ''


Philadelphia	LOCATION	Ledger . ''

		In ' Lady Casterly , ' Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	has painted a portrait of wonderful vitality . ''

		The Outlook .

		`` Innumerable passages in the story sway by an emotional beauty conveyed through the charm of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's well - chosen words . ''


Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Every character in the story is a person who can be seen and understood . ''

		`` Notable for its intellectual vigor and its imaginative insight into feminine character . ''


London Athenaeum	LOCATION	.

		Nobody 's taste is infallible .

		All these reviews err sometimes .

		But do they err any more in their estimate of a book than individuals do ?

		Is it likely all should err at the same time and in the same direction ?

		Is it not far more likely that `` THE PATRICIAN '' has in considerable measure , qualities which demand its recognition by those novel readers who care for such qualities as have made Hardy and
Meredith	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	immortal ?

		483 ' THE
AMHERST	LOCATION	IDEA .

		It is not a new idea , for it is one that has been persistently advocated by many of the wisest of our educational leaders , and one that has been consistently upheld by THE DIAL , both in and out of season , during our more than thirty years ; but since it has recently been urged in a particularly forcible way by
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, it may be allowed , tempo - rarily at least , to parade under the name of that respected institution of learning .

		It is essentially the Christian idea that the life is more than meat and the body more than raiment , and it has for a corollary the principle that education becomes faithless to its sacred trust when it dismisses the idea as Utopian or impracticable , or even when it makes unworthy concessions to the materialistic spirit of our modern age .

		Believing , as we do , that most of our educational experimentation of the past thirty years has been either futile or mischiev - ous , and its prevailing tendencies fundamentally wrong , believing that instead of advancing along the highway we have strayed into the bog and become almost hopelessly mired therein , we are glad of the opportunity offered by the pamphlet just issued from
Amherst	LOCATION	to emphasize once more our convictions , and to illustrate them by a few apposite quotations .

		It is to certain members of the
Amherst	LOCATION	class that was graduated in
1885	DATE	that we owe the text for our present discussion .

		That class , upon the occasion of its twenty-fifth reunion a year ago , appointed a committee `` to present to the trustees the question whether , at a time when education is so largely assuming a techni - cal character , and when in the universities the work of teaching is to so considerable an extent performed without personal contact and influ - ences between teacher and student , it is not at once the opportunity and the duty of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	to take a distinctive public position as a representative of that individual training and general culture which was once the purpose of all American colleges . ''

		The report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was made some months ago , and occasioned a certain amount of discussion in the public press ; it is now reprinted , in the pamphlet before us , together with a selection of eighteen brief articles which comment upon 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, it in a favorable spirit .

		The whole constitutes a sound and weighty document which deserves to be widely read and carefully studied .

		Pri - marily , it embodies the opinion of a group of educated men , belonging to a single college , and averaging nearly fifty years of age an age when sober counsel rules the mind and festina lente seems a better guide than all the watchwords of radicalism and restive revolt .

		In a secondary sense , it crystallizes the judg - ment of the pedagogically wise , wherever they may be found , and whatever may have been the paths whereby they have come to the reali - zation of what things most matter in the edu - cational sphere .

		A few quotations from the report will serve to indicate the spirit by which it is animated . ''

		The popular appraisal of education is commercial , measuring the value of a training by the income it returns , and if every man stand for himself alone , this appraisal may be right .

		It is in the relation of the individual to the .

		community , however , that this view of educational training first breaks down .

		Amherst has never taught that every man stands for himself alone , nor that the value of education is in its purchasable gratifications .

		There is a training which should be undergone for the sake of learning and for the benefit of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The college which thus sets its face against the commercial ideal would aim to give its students '' a training in civics , in the history of govern - ment , in the development and significance of institutions , in the meaning of civilization , in brief , a training for public leadership , not a personal equipment for a trade . '' ''

		Institutions and governments have a history , and the best statesmanship is that which meets the future with lessons derived from a profound understanding of what has gone before us .

		Technical education , which , so far as government is concerned , for the most part teaches devices but not principles , which seems to assert that successful business fits for successful statesman - ship , proceeds upon the assumption that retrospect is not wise and that in any difficulty we should consider not how we got there but how we can get out , as if , said
Edmund Burke	PERSON	, we should ' consult our invention and reject our experience . '

		Here , indeed , is to be found one of the causes of the increasing excitability of American politics .

		Invention is the parent of
Utopias	LOCATION	, socialism , radicalism of all kinds .

		Experience is the parent of improvement , progress , conservatism . ''

		This is an admirable statement , and its caution against reckless experimentation , whether in the art of education or the art of government , is the caution most needed at the present day .

		When one has grasped the paradoxical truth that progress and conservatism go together , that they are only different aspects of the same thing , he has made himself reasonably safe from in - fection by the insidious and superficial pleas of over-zealous reformers .

		The practical conclusions of the
Amherst	LOCATION	report take the shape of these five propositions : 1 .

		That the instruction given at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	be a modified classical course as the meaning of that term has been described ; 2 .

		That the degree of Bachelor of Science be abol - ished ; 3 .

		That the
College	ORGANIZATION	adopt the deliberate policy to devote all its means to the indefinite increase of teachers ' salaries ; 4 .

		That the number of students attending the College be limited ; 5 .

		That entrance be permitted only by competitive examination .

		Accompanying the third of these propositions is a special investigation of the cost of living for members of the faculty .

		The budgets of about forty men are analyzed , with the aston - ishing result that in almost every case there is an excess of expenditure over salary , the average excess being upward of
six hundred dollars	MONEY	.

		That is , '' almost without exception , the mem - bers of the
Amherst	LOCATION	faculty can live with a fair degree of comfort only as they derive income from sources other than salary . ''

		Is it not about time that this condition , which is found in most of our colleges , and which forces scholars to adopt the predatory methods of Pullman car porters and waiters in restaurants , should be remedied in the only manner which can comport with the dignity of the teaching profession ?

		If this discussion affected the interests of
Amherst	LOCATION	alone , we would hardly be justified in thus enlarging upon it .

		Our approval of the ideals set forth , and our good wishes for the endeavor , would meet all the demands of the particular case .

		But the questions raised affect many other institutions , and one good example may give the impetus to a nation-wide move - ment of reaction against the materialistic tendencies of both the higher and the lower education .

		The whole problem of the small college is involved , and it is one of the biggest problems we are called upon to deal with .

		We are minded of an even smaller college than
Amherst	LOCATION	, a college numbering less than two hundred students at any one time , which has held fast to the old educational faith , and whose aims have recently been set forth in the follow - ing picturesque terms : ''
Hamilton	PERSON	persistently develops as strictly a College building to and not away from her past , undeflected by that loose pedagogical sciolism which pretends a clas - sical course without Greek , or an alleged college course with no ancient and but one modern language .

		She regards the present aversion from Greek and the dawn -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 463 ing hostilities even to
Latin	LOCATION	, as rank philistinism .

		Just now the colleges are noisily challenged by those who fail to distinguish their distinctive underlying idea , and who stridently demand their surrender to an alleged preparation distended with all sorts of miscellaneous and quasi-informational subjects .

		Not for this super - ficial and sleazy scheme does this College desert her well-tested convictions as to what is basic and formative in education ; but stands by the sterner values and is content to be known by her fruits .

		She hears but does not heed the clamor of those who impeach the thorough - ness which she exacts , avoids the half-baked applicant who is searching for soft courses , and urges that an education is something more than a mere degree .


Hamilton	PERSON	asserts the right to offer quality , and she wants only those who want that .

		She abides staunchly by the classical precepts , and would far rather be known as a clean and resolute old-fashioned College , than as an educational cafe '' or a country club . ''

		The college that is determined , despite all dis - couragement , to uphold such ideals as these , is the salt of our educational world .

		It can not offer the '' bargains '' of the '' department - store '' university , nor its elaborate equipment , nor its imposing faculty roll .

		It can provide neither the professional training needed by the specialist , nor the opportunities required by the investigator who seeks to enlarge the bounds of knowledge .

		But it can do for the average boy who belongs in college at all something which the big institution signally fails to do .

		It can mould his character as well as his mind ; it can make him realize that there is a hierarchy of values in education ; it can endow him with broad culture upon a carefully-considered plan ; it can enforce upon him the lesson that human service is more desirable than worldly success ; and it can fit him for honorable leadership in the world of men while at the same time it is enriching his individual life with those intel - lectual resources which are the sole unfailing stay against misfortune and adversity .

		We sometimes think that the future of civilization is in the hands of the smaller rather than of the larger educational institutions , much as the future of mediaeval
Europe	LOCATION	was in the hands of its sturdy communes and chartered towns rather than in those of the overshadowing monarchies which seemed to symbolize its authority and its power .

		If men are ever again to live in '' a world moralized by principle , steadied and cleared of many an evil thing by true and catholic reflection and just feeling , '' they will owe their enfranchisement in large measure to precisely the type of education which all the colleges used to offer , and which is to-day offered mainly by those lesser institutions that seem , to the superficial observer , to have been outstripped in the educational race .

		THE PLACE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE COMMUNITY .

		There was a strong dominant note in the recent
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	convention at Pasa - dena that could not fail to impress itself upon the general observer , possibly even more sharply than on the more active participants in the meeting .

		Many currents of professional interest meet and mingle and cross in any assembly of workers from a field at once so varied and so specialized as the library field has become to-day ; but in reviewing the
Pasadena	LOCATION	meeting it is evident that the interest centred upon a single broad phase of modern library activity the analysis and presentation of the Place of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in the Community : a presentation dealing not with technical details of library organization and administration , but with the broader side of the library 's relation to state and municipal government , the support and privileges it should receive , and the recognition it deserves as a far-reaching agency of public education .

		In Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	's presidential address , on '' What the Com - munity owes the Library , '' the central thought of the convention was set forth in concise statements of the right of the public library to fair financial support , to carefully chosen and effective trustees , and to clearer recognition of its influence and its needs .

		Interesting and significant in the further development of this theme was the address of Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	on `` The Exploitation of the Public Library , '' showing how the increasing importance of the library in the com - munity carries with it a danger that its influence may be deflected into commercial channels or used to give publicity to personal enterprises unconnected with legitimate library activity .

		A discussion of the relations between libraries and municipalities carried forward the treatment of the central theme .

		The effect of the commission plan of city government , the influence of branch libraries within their specific districts , the conditions of city civil service as bearing upon library efficiency , were the sub-topics ; and in their discussion it was evident that the place of the public library in the scheme of city government has not yet been defined with precision .

		Perhaps the greatest general inter - est attached to the discussion of civil-service restric - tions upon library administration .

		Certainly this subject was a most vital one in its relation to public library efficiency on the
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		The point at issue was the need of a system of civil service regulating appointment and control of the library staff , maintained and controlled by the library itself , as against the inclusion of the library in a general city civil-service system applying indiscriminately to employees in all city departments , which practically removes all administrative control from the hands of the library authorities .

		The excellent address of Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	, of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and the resultant discussions based on the experience of the leading libraries of the country , 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, were of the greatest value in making clear the basic facts that libraries must be dissociated from all political influences and that library service must be regarded as a specialized calling in the field of public education .

		Turning from the municipality to the state , another session was given to the remarkable exten - sion of library privileges to all sections of the community , now being carried on through state commissions , county libraries , and kindred agencies .

		The latest departure in this field is that undertaken by the
State of California	LOCATION	in the establishment of a carefully planned and coordinated county library system .

		This is in some respects the most signifi - cant piece of library legislation yet adopted , and the course of its development will be followed with inter - est by all concerned in educational affairs .

		It is planned to reach not only isolated hamlets and small settlements with good collections of books '' branches '' of a county library organization , with headquarters at the county seat , but through this medium to bring books direct to individual homes far removed from public library facilities .

		What
California	LOCATION	has now undertaken is already familiar in other states , though in somewhat different guise .

		In
Wisconsin	LOCATION	the small public library has achieved perhaps its highest efficiency , through the fostering care of the state 's
Free Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here the travelling library was made the basis of develop - ment these small collections being sent out to all parts of the state , to remote settlements , cross-roads stores , or even to single farmhouses , for community use .

		Such travelling library stations gave impulse to public library organization in many of these small communities , and the libraries thus established were through the services of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	organ - ized on proper technical methods , while at the same time through the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	workers the commun - ities themselves have been led to recognize the library 's importance and its right to fair financial support .

		Under the
California	LOCATION	plan the county libraries will be in no way dependent upon or con - trolled by the community they serve ; but will be independent agencies of the general county system , focussing in the central county library .

		It will be seen that these two states thus represent two differ - ent principles of library development , and a com - parison of results after a few years ' experience can not fail to be interesting and valuable .

		One notable advantage to the
California	LOCATION	system is the much larger income it makes available for library extension , through the county taxation provided for ; another is that under effective county organization general development must be more rapid than through individual effort under supervision ; it is also evident that the
California	LOCATION	system will mean a raising of the standard of public librarianship throughout the state , an improvement in library salaries , and the consequent placing of library ser - vice upon a higher professional level .

		An extremely useful analysis of the basis upon which library extension work has been developed in different sections was given by Mr.
Dudgeon	PERSON	, of the Wis - consin
Free Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, pointing out dif - ferences of method that are inherent in the choice of different administrative units , such as township , county , and state .

		Miss
Harriet G. Eddy	PERSON	, of the
California State Library	ORGANIZATION	, spoke for the
California	LOCATION	plan ;
Miss Isom	PERSON	, of the
Portland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, described county library extension in
Oregon	LOCATION	, where most interesting results are following upon the efforts of the
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the
Portland	LOCATION	library authorities to bring good books to the people outside of the larger cities and towns .

		The pioneer work of the
Brumbach County Library of Van Wert	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, one of the first county libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	, was reviewed ; and an interesting glimpse was given of the unique extension methods developed by the
Washington	LOCATION	County Free Library of
Hagerstown	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, where a '' book wagon '' makes its regular rounds through the sparsely settled primitive country regions , its precious freight eagerly awaited by the dwellers in the isolated farm - houses and mountain cabins .

		In logical pendant to this varied and enlightening review of ways and means by which books are being made a part of the daily current of American life , was the vigorous and well-ordered statement of '' The basis of support for public library work , '' given by Mr.
Hopper	PERSON	, of the
Tacoma Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, which , while dealing speci - fically with the fiscal details of library support methods of effective preparation and presentation of budgets , principles regulating increase of appro - priations , etc. was at the same time an excellent presentation of the development of the public library into one of the great educational departments of municipal and state government .

		The efficiency of the library as an educational factor was further emphasized in a well-considered paper by Mr.
Arthur H. Chamberlain	PERSON	of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, who urged the advantages of closer relations and cooperation between the two great national associations of teachers and librarians .

		While this summary is necessarily both brief and selective , still it is believed that it fairly indicates the dominant note of the latest conference of Ameri - can librarians the main channel along which thought and speech were directed and in which after-influence is most likely to be realized .

		That such after-influence will be of special value to the library development of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, there is every reason to believe .

		The growth of public libraries within the
last decade	DATE	has been notable through all this region ; but there is not yet the full response from the community that is necessary to bring library service to its highest efficiency .

		The clear and certain tones in which at this meeting the basic principles of modern library development were set forth must prove both stimulating and in - forming .

		The removal of the library from political influences , the improvement of librarianship in qualifications and in material reward , the power of books for education and for recreation in every walk of life , and the duty laid upon state and city
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 465 to make the library valuable and available to every citizen when these essentials are more clearly understood the place of the library in the commu - nity will be less vital a subject for argument and exposition .


HELEN E. HAIXES	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE MRS.
STOWE	PERSON	CENTENNIAL falls at a season so rich in centennial or semi-centennial memories as to incur the risk of being inadequately observed .

		Yet the hundredth birthday -LRB-
June 14	DATE	-RRB- of the writer of one of the most notable and most popular books ever published , and of many others of equal or even greater excellence , was widely celebrated .

		At
Fisk University	ORGANIZATION	.


Nashville	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's memory was suitably honored in the com - mencement address delivered by her son , the Rev.
Charles Edward Stowe	PERSON	: and the women 's clubs , especially in the
East	LOCATION	, were not remiss in paying tribute to one of the noblest of their sex .

		Most noteworthy of all souvenirs of the occasion is the centennial volume published by the
Houghton Mitfiin Company	ORGANIZATION	and reviewed elsewhere in this issue of THE DIAL , `` The Life of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, '' by her son above mentioned and her grand - son
Lyman Beecher Stowe	PERSON	. ''

		It is different from the conventional life and letters , '' explains the latter ; '' it is , in fact , constructed on the plan of a novel , in which she is the heroine . ''

		Twenty-two years have passed since the '' Life and Letters '' compiled by the son was published in Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's lifetime .

		She has now been dead fifteen years , and the world is ready for another and more nearly complete account of her remarkable life .

		THE GENIAL SIB
WILLIAM S. GILBERT	PERSON	, dear to us in childhood for his '' Bab Ballads '' -LRB- which , in - deed , have been perhaps more appreciatively read and enjoyed in our riper years -RRB- and still more se - curely enshrined in our hearts by reason of his in - comparable librettos to
Sullivan	PERSON	's delightful operas , has died in fulness of years and of honors .

		Four years ago he was knighted by an appreciative sovereign , and so far as it is possible for fame and fortune to minister to the happiness of a gifted writer , he must have had little to ask for in this respect during the latter part of his life .

		As government clerk , barrister , militia captain , journalist , story-writer , dramatist , poet -LRB- even if not of the sublimest strain -RRB- , librettist , and ever-delightful raconteur and conversationalist , he had lived a full life , and , we imagine , enjoyed it to the full .

		In rendering him our tribute of grati - tude for pleasure afforded by the products of his mirthful genius , we accord him a place among the immortals by the side of Hood and
Calverley	PERSON	and
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	and
Edward Lear	PERSON	.

		A singular coin - cidence in connection with his death was the bril - liantly successful revival of `` Pinafore '' at the Casino Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	on the very day that was his last on earth .

		THE RIVER WYE QUEST , so laboriously and per - severingly pursued by Dr.
Orville Owen	PERSON	, ought to yield fruits of some sort , for one can not well exca - vate extensively in historic soil without chancing upon divers relics of greater or less antiquity .

		But that the bed of a stream which modern hydraulic engineers can not easily control even for a few hours should have been excavated by
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	and made the hiding place of important records , with no trace of the wonderful achievement either in contempo - rary writings or in his own diaries , letters , or note - books , passes belief .

		Dr.
Appleton Morgan	PERSON	, author of `` The Shakespearean Myth '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , is reported as expressing his entire disbelief in Dr.
Owen	PERSON	's theory , and at the same time as calling attention to the antiquity and persistence of the doubt concern - ing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's authorship .

		A century and a quarter ago
Malone	PERSON	made researches that threw a shade of uncertainty over this authorship .

		The curious are referred to Sir
James Prior	PERSON	's '' Life of
Edmund Malone	PERSON	. ''

		Even in this country , the ques - tion of who wrote the plays dates back earlier than
Delia Bacon	PERSON	and her first Baconian article of
1856	DATE	.

		In the original form in which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's lecture on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was delivered in
1835	DATE	occurs a notable passage , ending thus : '' I can not marry this man to his verse .

		Other admirable men have lived in some sort of keeping with their thought ... but this man in wide contrast ... Shakespeare is a voice merely who this singer was we know not . ''

		This query it may have been that started Miss
Delia Bacon	PERSON	on her mad quest , and it may be this query likewise that is ultimately responsible for the recent attempt to prove that the plays were written , not by Shakespeare himself , but by another man of the same name , perhaps his cousin .

		As large streams from little fountains flow , so strauge books from chance suggestions grow .

		THE ADVANTAGE OF A HIGHLY INFLECTED LAN - GUAGE , one must acknowledge as he turns now and then with wearinesss from the facile fluency and exuberance of some modern writer in English or French or Italian , is that it not only can but must say so much in a few words , and that what it says is commonly free from ambiguity .

		Contrast the style of
Browning	PERSON	with that of
Lucretius	PERSON	, for example , the former often tortuous as well as prolix , the latter plain , direct , forcible , and com - pressing his theory of the universe into six books or cantos of moderate length .

		The quoting of tags of Latin is often censured as savoring of pedantry or affectation ; but there is pleasure in a well-turned Latin phrase , and the user of it may well be par - doned for wishing to communicate the pleasure to others .

		The classic Roman writers , belonging as they did to a race given rather to deeds than to words , knew the value of brevity , of compression , of restraint .


Emerson	PERSON	, one of the world 's models for simplicity and directness , was once asked by a friend , '' What do you consider the supreme quality of a fine literary style '' ?

		Pausing for a moment and 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, gazing intently into the fire before which he and his interlocutor were sitting , he turned to the speaker , and , looking him full in the face , said : '' Suppression . ''

		This reminds one of
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	's laudation of '' animated restraint '' as the essence of good literary style .

		By chance , we have just come upon the following in the pages of an eminent writer who abhors Latin : '' It is due to the fact of long-continued and calamitous errors and excesses in this part of our nature to which the dumb instinct of the race that always says one thing while meaning another , but is always inerrant when rightly interpreted , has reacted by developing the sense of shame .

		This awful example -LRB- and it by no means stands in lonely isolation -RRB- of what a sentence should not be occurs on page 459 of Vol - ume I. of Dr.
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	's recent '' Educational Problems , '' and taken in connection with its author 's professed disapproval of classical studies , is illumi - nating ... A NOTABLE INSTANCE OF HOPE DEFERRED Was the weary waiting of Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	for suc - cess to crown the effort he had put forth in '' The Broad Highway . ''

		But the desire came , after seven years , and has doubtless proved a tree of life to the promising young author .

		By a curious accident , the day of fruition seems to have been needlessly and wantonly postponed by that divinity which is supposed to shape our ends .

		.

		Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	, having come to
America	LOCATION	with his wares , was supporting himself and wife by painting scenes for a
New York	LOCATION	theatre until he should succeed in marketing his novel , when an actor friend offered to take it with him to
Boston	LOCATION	and try to prevail on an ac - quaintance there , a publisher , to bring it out .

		Then followed a long wait , weeks lengthening into months as they have a way of doing on such occasions , and still no report from that
Boston	LOCATION	publisher .

		At last the actor 's engagements , or leisure , brought him around to
New York	LOCATION	again , and Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	hunted him up in the hope of hearing some news of his literary venture .

		He was not unnaturally vexed to learn that his friend had forgotten the matter entirely , had not so much as visited the publishing house in question , and had kept the precious manu - script in the bottom of one of his trunks all that time .

		But the sequel is the significant part of the whole .

		When , a little later , the rather discouraged young author returned to
England	LOCATION	, a publisher was finally found for his book in
London	LOCATION	, and the American rights were secured by the very house to which the forgetful actor friend had intended to submit the manuscript some months before .

		CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE
A. L. A.	PERSON	AND THE
N. E. A.	PERSON	-LRB- the initials standing , of course , for our well-known associations of librarians and educators , respectively -RRB- is urged by
Miss Ahern	PERSON	, chairman of a committee appointed by the former body a year -LRB- or more -RRB- ago to consider the matter .

		In this season of annual conventions of both teachers and library workers , the suggestions submitted by Miss
Ahern	PERSON	's committee are timely .

		She first calls at - tention to the fortunate abandonment , on the part of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, of its one - time purpose to discontinue its library department ; and she then recommends , first , a closer relation - ship between the governing powers of the two great organizations , in order that the aims and methods of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	may be better understood by the
N. E. A.	PERSON	; secondly , '' that a definite place on the annual program of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	be provided for a discussion of the problems that are common to schools and libraries , particularly as a source of helpfulness to the constantly growing class of school librarians '' ; and , thirdly , that college and university librarians be brought to a more definite conception of the nature and importance of their work and of the place occupied by their libraries among the other departments of their respective institutions .

		To the latter end ,
Miss Ahern	PERSON	suggests an enlarge - ment of her committee so as to cover the whole country , each member reporting progress in his or her district as to library instruction to teachers or students of colleges and schools , with a view to ascertaining needs and recommending measures for their relief .

		... THE SIZE OF A LIBRARY 'S GOVERNING BODY should be small , for prompt and effective adminis - tration .

		The presence of several ex officio mem - bers on the board of trustees , and of six or eight more who care for the position simply as a stepping stone to more important -LRB- and lucrative -RRB- political office , is not conducive to a vigorous and intelligent management of public library business .

		The cur - rent Report of the
Iowa Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	contains a wise recommendation : '' Section 728 regarding trustees of public libraries should be amended without disturbing the working of the law by reducing the number of trustees from nine to seven or five . ''

		And further : '' A clause should be inserted in the same section regarding inactive or delinquent trustees .

		Provision should be made declaring vacancies in the
Board	ORGANIZATION	in case members absent themselves habitually from meetings of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	while in the city and in good health . ''

		Truant trustees are causing more and more dissat - isfaction in other quarters besides
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		As to the best number for a working body of library directors , we note that
Boston	LOCATION	, with a longer expe - rience to profit by than any other of our cities , elects five trustees to serve five years each , one vacancy being created and filled every year ; and there are no ex qfficio members .

		On the other hand ,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, with a library activity not enough greater to warrant the difference , has a board of twenty-two members surely an unwieldy body , and involving the constant difficulty , if not im - possibility , of securing full attendance at regular meetings .

		A board of public library trustees can certainly be reduced considerably below twenty-two
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 467 members without becoming an oligarchy .

		Indeed , with a large board the danger is that an autocracy will be established by some one dominant and ener - getic member , or a clique of members .

		THE FIRST NATIONAL LIBRARY CONVENTION IN
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	was held in
San Francisco	LOCATION	in
1891	DATE	, with an attendance numbering eighty-three .

		The second , just held at
Pasadena	LOCATION	, had an attendance stated at 570 , of which number not less than 300 were
Calif	LOCATION	ornians .

		These figures are significant in illustrating the remarkable growth of library activity ' in
California	LOCATION	.

		They mean that virtually the entire body of library workers in a state notable for its ; recent library development has for the first time come into touch with the spirit and fellowship of the national association , has drawn directly upon its influence , and has realized more clearly the strength of common effort in a common cause .

		In its turn , the national association has benefitted and broadened by the transfusion of new interests that must result , ; not only in the form of increased membership , but \ in bringing more closely together work and workers j from both edges of the continent .

		THE PUBLISHING RECORD OF THE
A. L. A.	PERSON	shows I praiseworthy and disinterested activity extending < over almost a quarter-century and productive of a I long list of valuable printed aids to the library work - ' er .

		The current report of Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, chairman of the
A. L. A. Publishing Board	ORGANIZATION	, is by this time in the hands of all who attended the
Pasadena	LOCATION	conference , and of many others .

		The gift from Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, nine years ago , of one hundred thousand dollars as an endowment fund for the prosecution of such bibliographical undertakings as the Publish - ing
Board	ORGANIZATION	might approve , has made possible the ``
A. L. A. Booklist	PERSON	, '' to which its annual proceeds are largely devoted , and other publications .

		From the sales of these works there is also derived a regular income , which for the last ten months , as the Report shows , amounted to nearly five thousand dollars .

		All this goes to illustrate , in a striking way , how the publishing enterprises of the
Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion have increased since Mr.
Poole	PERSON	, Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, and others , thirty years ago , made arrangements for a new edition of u
Poole	PERSON	's Index '' with the countenance and encouragement of their associates ' in library work .

		THE HOPEFULNESS OF PRIZE-STORY WRITERS has seldom had a better illustration than that cited by '' The Bookman '' in an account of a contest that evoked fifteen thousand manuscripts .

		Two days after the announcement of this short-story contest there was sent in a tale that left nothing to be de - sired in point of brevity , being boiled down to two hundred and forty-eight words .

		But it was ignor - antly written in pencil on brown paper , and with it came this peremptory order : '' Send the
$ 7000	MONEY	by registered male , as need it to rase morgage . ''

		This , : however , is hardly more astonishing than the letters j frequently received by magazine and newspaper editors , offering to supply poetry or fiction , or both , to the full capacity of the publication in question , and dictating terms of no shrinkingly modest nature .

		The appalling excess of zeal over knowledge in this world of ours could not reveal itself more strikingly than in these confidently expectant letters from the illiterate possessors of a genius that is only await - ing the opportunity of a suitable outlet in order to flood the land with masterpieces .

		No pent-up
Utica	LOCATION	ever contracted the powers of a
Cato	LOCATION	as does the lack of sufficiently liberal editorial overtures restrain the capacities of these might-be poets and novelists .

		* THE LATE
F. W. H. MYERS	PERSON	, poet , essayist , biog - rapher , psychical-researcher , and dreamer , whose life of
Wordsworth	PERSON	in the '' English Men of Letters '' series has introduced so many of us to the appre - ciative study of that poet , has been dead now ten years , and still no biography of the man has ap - peared .

		His widow 's preface to '' Fragments of Prose and Poetry '' from her husband 's writings led us to hope for a volume of his letters , with per - haps some account of his too-short life ; but it may be that the intimate and personal character of these letters has caused the indefinite postponement of any such undertaking .

		Meanwhile one hails with satisfaction Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	's reminiscences of
Myers	ORGANIZATION	in the current ''
Cornhill Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, '' from which we here snatch the following few lines as affording a glimpse of the ever-reserved , ever-court - eous poet and idealist : `` It was characteristic of him that , when I once sent him a book of my own , he acknowledged it at once with great warmth , but said that , though he had read it .

		he would express no opinion upon it .

		He added that he had once lost a friendship through expressing a perfectly candid opinion of a book , and that he had made a rule never to express an opinion again . '' ''

		MY IDEALED JOHN BULLESSES '' is the caption under which
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, Japanese artist and astute observer of Western manners , is writing down his opinions of English women for the benefit of readers of `` The English Review . ''

		He has arrived , in the latest instalment , at the Suffrage question , which appears to his unprejudiced mind no question at all .

		Indeed , the Englishman 's opposition to votes for women leads Markino to a polite wonder about the sincerity of the vaunted Western '' respect-ness '' towards women .

		The Japanese boy has found more kindness and sym - pathy , higher ambitions , and more intellect among English women than English men .

		`` The
John Bullesses	PERSON	have very romantic appearance just like butterflies , '' he explains . ''

		They are the good sub - jects for novels , poetries , and pictures .

		But their innerside is very much matter-of-fact . ''

		As for the
John Bullesses	PERSON	who do n't want to vote because they '' do n't want to be any kind of an officer , ''
Markino	PERSON	reassures them gallantly thus : '' Why 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, should you have to be an officer because you have the right to vote ?

		Rest assured !

		If you turn your head aside and hide your charmingly sweet face with your big-plumed hat , nobody will pull you up to the officer 's seat . ''

		Spirited little sketches of suffragette
John Bullesses	PERSON	add piquancy to the artist 's verbal impressions .

		We shall hope to have them all in a book before long .

		A FRUITFUL SUBJECT FOB A PRIZE DISSERTA - TION , open for treatment at the hands of any mem - ber of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, has been announced .

		It is this : ''
Can Harvard	ORGANIZATION	do better service to the country by reducing the price of education , by adopting the German system of compensating pro- fessors , by favoring the leadership of the intellec - tual student rather than of the athletic or convivial student , or by any other change ? ''

		The last clause surely gives the competing essayist all the latitude he need ask for .

		In connection with the German system of compensating professors , something might be said for or against the German system of uni - versity administration in general , in its striking contrast with our own method .

		And inasmuch as the American university , or any university , for that matter , never is but always to be blessed with a perfect system of management and a faultless cur - riculum , the opportunity here offered to university - reformers at
Cambridge	LOCATION	is a large one .

		The award of the prizes -LRB-

Undergraduate Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		BULLS AND BEARS ON THE LITERARY EXCHANGE may some day -LRB- though we are not longing for its advent -RRB- become as conspicuously active as those of the stock exchange .

Shakespeare Exploration Syndicate	ORGANIZATION	, whose min - ing expert reported having struck a new reef of code first editions .

		These last ran up hurriedly on the rumor that Mr.
Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	was getting together a complete collection of the bard 's works regardless of expense , and any refuse having any resemblance to an old copy was worked off on out - siders at enhanced figures . ''

Chepstow	LOCATION	that Dr.

		HOW ONE MAN `` TOOK '' LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The editorial in your issue of
June 1	DATE	, on `` The Approaches to Literature , '' pictures a well-recognized condition to many who are vitally interested in the matter .

		People who have not had the advantages of a higher education possibly no higher than the gram - mar school often have a tendency to be frightened at the word `` literature '' ; nevertheless , they are just as likely to find enjoyment and profit in literature as a Doctor of Letters .

		Here is a typical example .

		In the
Washington	LOCATION	office of a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper is employed a man of middle age who in his boyhood refused to finish even the common graded school-work .

		He became a messenger boy for the
Western Union Telegraph Company	ORGANIZATION	, and later a telegraph operator , which position he has filled ever since .

		Without any - one to guide him he is single , and lives alone in a boarding-house he has cultivated a well-defined taste for the best writings .

		What money he has remaining from living expenses he spends for books .

		His room is stocked with good editions of writers of standard fiction .

		For more solid reading he takes to history , and apparently can not find enough to quench his thirst .

		This man has not only read purely for pleasure , but he finds so much enjoyment in his books that he reads them again and again , until he has become a very good critic .

		His ideas of style and literary values are based upon reasoning as solid as that of any literary profes - sor .

		This ability is unsophisticated and original , and for that reason he proves the more interesting to the few friends to whom he chooses to make his attain - ments known .

		Literature has furnished him his chief source of pleasure in life , and also has helped him in a very practical and peculiar way .

		He had the misfor - tune to inherit a thirst for alcoholic drink .

		He indulges only at long intervals , but these indulgences may extend over a period of weeks .

		This weakness has not gained for him any more friends , but the horror of it stares him in the face every day , causing him to retire the more into himself .

		He confessed to me one day that the only comfort he can get at the times this spectre is hovering over him is from his books .

		He will lock himself up in his rooms for days at a time , while his nervous system is recovering its tone , and read assidu - ously in order to forget '' the outside world . ''

		This shows how one man approached literature , and what he got out of it in his own way .

		THE DIAL 469 tto 44 UNCLE TOM 'S CABIX '' AXI > ITS A ^ '' ^ noR .

		* The centenary volume on Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, by her son and her grandson , announces itself as '' The story of a real character ; telling not so much what she did , as what she was , and how she became what she was . ''

		It is somewhat of a disappointment to find it an unsystematic anecdotal biography , made up largely of ma - terial already used in '' The Life of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	'' published by her son in
1889	DATE	.

		Even five of the eight illustrations did duty in the earlier volume .

		Of the material not in the biography of
1889	DATE	, a great part comes from Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	's `` Life . ''

		The interest that attaches to the centenary warranted a new book on Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, even if there were few or no new facts to present ; but it might have been better if the authors had undertaken and frankly announced a condensation of Mr.
C. E. Stowe	PERSON	's rather unwieldy biography .

		The pres - ent volume will seem a little incoherent to one who does not know the story of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's life , and will be a wearisome repetition to the reader who has gained that knowledge from the ordinary sources .

		This latest attempt , like earlier biographies of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, portrays fairly well a woman who might have written kk The Minister 's Wooing '' or '' Old town Folks , '' but it fails somehow to picture the possible author of `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		It would be idle to speculate whether fifteen volumes of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's collected works would now be in print if it were not for the sixteenth ; especially idle , perhaps , since there is little likelihood that without the success of this one volume many of the others would have been written .

		The fact is , however , that Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	lives , and appar - ently will live even more in the future , as the author of one book .

		When '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' first appeared it was believed to be a campaign document which would not survive the circumstances that called it forth .

		A little later its popularity was explained as due to its historical impor - tance .

		The dramatization was taken still less seriously .

		Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	wrote in his '' Literary History of
America	LOCATION	'' : '' To this day dramatized versions of it are said to *

		be popular in this country . ''

		If the current story is true , the week in which his book appeared saw the bill-boards nearest
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	yard covered with announcements of the despised play .

		A year or two later a traveller whose attention had been quickened by this ` incident saw similar posters opposite the Martyrs ' Monument at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and found , on his first stroll in
Rome	LOCATION	, the familiar faces of Uncle
Tom	PERSON	and Little Eva looking down at him from a bill-board near the Colisseum .

		Surely , the Englishman and the Italian who in the twentieth century attend performances of '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' do not do so on account of any interest in American social history .

		The play is of course the most intense melo - drama , and the tale on which it is founded is melodramatic .

		But melodramas ordinarily come and go , and the melodrama that holds its own in divers parts of the world for sixty years can hardly be ignored in the literary history of the country that produced it .

		It is always perplexing to find that a work which runs contrary to the recognized princi - ples of art is the one which the world will not willingly let die .

		The critic easily dissects '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' into nothingness .

		The plot is ill-proportioned and formless ; the diction and style are not above reproach ; the humor and the pathos are in a rather cheap conventional manner .

		But the man who says all this knows that he is speaking of one of the very few books which almost all of his auditors , of all intellec - tual and social conditions , have read , and read with pleasure .

		The secret of this popularity is not easy to analyze .

		The story shows genuine - ness and intensity of moral enthusiasm , it abounds in what the journalist calls '' human interest '' ; but this is true of many books which excel in proportion and style , and which , nevertheless , last but a brief day .

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	herself has , in the judgment of most critics , written at least two novels of greater artistic excellence .

		It would be rash to say that the book belongs with the few works in which genius shows its greatness by disregarding all rules , but the persistency of its appeal at least makes one long for an explanation .

		Conflicting anecdotes , published both before and after Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's death , purport to tell how the book was written , but none of them explains it .

		It seems to have come into being in the same way that one of the characters it portrays accounted for her own existence .

		And so , doubtless , it did grow out of the author 's deeper life .

		For this reason it might be well 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, if we could really know '' what she was , and how she became what she was . ''

		This infor - mation is not , however , likely to come from a family biography .

		Both the recent volume and the earlier life by Mr.
C. E. Stowe	PERSON	are admir - able in their frankness .

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's life was remarkably free from anything of which those nearest to her might be ashamed ; but there were , as in any life , some things that were to be regretted .

		Those matters which a false fam - ily sensitiveness might have tried to suppress the Lady Byron episode , for example have been touched by Mr.
Stowe	PERSON	with a delicate - openness that makes his books in this respect a model .

		Still , a satisfactory analysis of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's character will be made , if at all , only by a student working without entanglement or prejudice .

		What was the secret of that lack of social and personal distinction , so strange in a member of a family intellectually so distin - guished ?

		What should we infer regarding her emotional nature from the story of her strange courtship ?

		What was the real influence on her life of her marriage with Professor
Stowe	PERSON	?

		What were the real causes that led a daughter of the Beechers into the Episcopalian com - munion ?

		What impressions did she make on the Southern people , of all colors , and condi - tions , with whom she lived so soon after the war ?

		or on those Englishwomen of rank whom she was wont to address as '' Mrs. '' and correct herself , apologetically , to '' Lady '' ?

		From the answers to these , and a score of other questions which the story of her life suggests , it might be possible to construct a picture of her character that would adequately explain her greatest work .

		Such an investigation might , however , lead only to the profitless discussion of trivial gossip in which biographical studies sometimes result .

		There are some works which it is well to take and enjoy without subjecting them or their authors to the analysis of academic re - search .

		Perhaps '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' is one of these .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charlton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		thors are strongly of the opinion that woman has a serious grievance , in the removal of which humanity in general is vitally interested .

		The remedy proposed is also nearly the same sub - stantially that of giving the sexes equal rights and duties in all the affairs of life . ''

		Woman and Labor , '' by
Olive Schreiner	PERSON	, was written under unusual circumstances , while the author was held a prisoner during the Boer War in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		It represents a small part of a much larger book , which had been in preparation for many years , but was destroyed when the author 's house in
Johannesburg	LOCATION	was looted during the progress of the war .

		We can never adequately judge of our loss from this outrageous piece of vandalism , but so far as it is possible to form an opinion from the fragment now published , it is heavy .

		Written under difficulties and without works of reference , the book is naturally not rich in statistical informa - tion , nor perhaps always minutely accurate as to matters of fact , as shown for instance in the account of '' winged ticks `` on p. 76 .

		Broadly speaking , however , the argument is adequately presented and well supported ; so well and so clearly , that we can not bring ourselves to wish it different in any important particular .

		It is indeed possible that the work as it is will have more influence on the public mind than the larger and more elaborate volume could have had .

		It is pointed out that in past ages both man and woman were fully and actively employed .

		While man engaged in the chase , in battle , or other strenuous pursuits , woman cultivated the soil and cared for the children .

		Each had plenty of interesting work , full of incident and exercising faculties of mind and body .

		There were of course variations and exceptions , but in general , it is maintained , this was true .

		Mod - ern civilization and science have robbed man of many of his old fields of activity , but while doing so , they have opened before him many other avenues , so that his life to-day is perhaps richer than ever before .

		`` The brain of one consumptive German chemist , who in his laboratory compounds a new explosive , has more effect upon the wars of the modern peoples than ten thousand soldierly legs and arms ; and the man who invents one new labor-saving machine may , through the cerebration of a few days , have performed the labor it would otherwise have taken hundreds of thousands of his lusty fellows decades to accomplish . ''

		-LRB- P. 36 . -RRB-

		In spite of this , however : '' Never before in the history of the earth has the man 's field of remunerative toil been so wide , so inter - esting , so complex , and in its results so all-important to society ; never before has the male sex , taken as a whole , been so fully and strenuously employed . ''

		-LRB- P. 44 . -RRB-

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 471 All this will be generally admitted ; but what of woman ?

		Man has taken from her much of the work which used to be specially her own ; science and commerce have rendered a large part unnecessary , so that she is in danger of being reduced , more or less , to a condition of '' sex-parasitism . ''

		`` Our spinning-wheels are all broken : in a thousand huge buildings steam-driven looms , guided by a few hundred thousands of hands -LRB- often those of men -RRB- , pro- duce the clothing of half the world ; and we dare no longer say , proudly , as of old , that we and we alone clothe our peoples ... The army of rosy milkmaids has passed away for ever , to give place to the cream - separator and the , largely , male-and-machinery-mani - pulated butter pat .

		In every direction the ancient saw , that it was exclusively the woman 's sphere to prepare viands of her household , has become , in proportion as civilization has perfected itself , an antiquated lie . ''

		The case is not parallel to that of man , because for women although new opportunities have come to some extent on the whole the tendency is toward dependence on masculine labor , and reduction to few and comparatively uninterest - ing activities .

		In combating this , the modern woman is not proposing anything radically new , but is merely trying to regain her former position of equality as a producer and factor in civilization generally .

		She is not trying to widen the gap between the sexes , but , on the contrary , to bring them together in common pursuits and common aims . ''

		We have called the woman 's movement of our age an endeavor on the part of women among modern civilized races to find new fields of labor as the old slip from them , as an attempt to escape from parasitism and an inactive dependence upon sex function alone ; but , viewed from another side , the woman 's movement might not less justly be called a part of a great move - ment of the sexes towards each other , a movement towards common occupations , common interests , com - mon ideals , and an emotional tenderness and sympathy between the sexes more deeply founded and more in - destructible than any the world has yet seen . ''

		On opening Mrs. Oilman 's book , '' The Man - made World , '' the following paragraph was the first to catch my eye : '' ' Tell me the secret of married happiness , ' says the blooming bride-to-be to the sweet-faced grandmother .

		And that placid dame replies with unexpected fervor , Feed the brute ! ' ''

		-LRB- P. 67 . -RRB-

		A little further search revealed the following : '' The female is the race-type the man the variant .

		The female , as a race-type , having the female processes besides , best performs the race processes .

		The male , however , has with great difficulty developed them , always heavily handicapped by bis maleness ; being in origin essentially a creature of sex , and so dominated almost exclusively by sex impulses . ''

		-LRB- P. 238 . -RRB-

		It is in a way unfair to pick out these ex - treme statements and present them away from their context .

		Much that is reasonable and wise could be selected for citation , yet the animus suggested by the excerpts pervades the whole book .

		Much may be forgiven to noble wrath at undeniably outrageous evils ; but , after all , it is '' necessary , for the sake of the cause itself , to use good judgment .

		The man-made world , as Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	sees it , is full of failures , due in the main to the dominance of masculine instincts .

		An '' andro - centric culture , '' centering about man , fails because man is not really a '' normal '' human being , but is a creature set apart to perform cer - tain functions directly or indirectly connected with sex .

		He is essentially an outsider , like the drone in a bee-hive .

		Woman , on the other hand , represents the '' normal . ''

		A civilization centering about her would be self-contained , reasonable , successful .

		The predatory and de - structive tendencies would hardly be in evi - dence ; so the worst evils of to-day , due to war and competition , would be eliminated .

		For the essence of all this , as is explained in the preface , we are indebted to Professor
Lester Ward	PERSON	.

		It is impossible to deny that there is something in it , especially as applied to the present one-sided condition of affairs .

		It is also necessary to say that many passages in the book appear not to demand a '' gynaecoeentric culture '' in place of what we have , but rather an equality of the sexes .

		To debate the whole question would require another book ; but so far as the reviewer may be entitled to an opinion , it is that of the two works reviewed the first is infinitely superior in both judgment and feeling , while the second , though seeming to him to fail seriously in these respects , is nevertheless worth reading and will deserve and have a place in the history of thought along with the au - thor 's many other writings .

		As a matter of sociology , it seems to me probable that the intellectual dominance of man -LRB- probably not so complete as we are wont to assume ! -RRB-

		has what may be called a functional significance .

		Man , as the male sex , has needed great abilities of mind and body for use during brief periods of his life .

		In some of the lower animals , the male actually '' burns out '' and dies , while the female lives long after to perform her necessary functions .

		Civilization really began when it was discovered that masculine powers were not merely masculine , but could be utilized for general social purposes .

		It was , in a way , the utilization of what had been a waste product .

		OLIVER
GOLDSMITH NEWLY EXPLAINED	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The principal lives of
Goldsmith	PERSON	have hitherto been either carefully '' documented '' biographies like those by Sir
James Prior	PERSON	in
1837	DATE	and by
John Forster	PERSON	in
1848	DATE	, or sym - pathetic attempts at appreciation like those by
Washington	LOCATION	Irving in
1844	DATE	and Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	in
1888	DATE	.

		All of these writers have been puzzled by the strange mixture of facts and traits and comments furnished in the bills and account-books of tailors and booksellers , and the more or less random records of
Glover	PERSON	,
Cooke	PERSON	,
Miss Burney	LOCATION	,
Tom Davies	PERSON	, Bishop
Percy	PERSON	, and of various people as reported by
Boswell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, in his '' delight - ful study '' -LRB- as Mr.
Moore	PERSON	rightly calls it -RRB- , is properly discriminating ; for he says explicitly that '' the f estimony of witnesses such as
John	PERSON	- son and
Reynolds	PERSON	, or even as
Glover	PERSON	and
Cooke	PERSON	, is of far greater import than that of
Walpole	LOCATION	, or
Boswell	PERSON	, or
Hawkins	PERSON	-LSB- one of
Samuel John	PERSON	- son 's biographers -RSB- , who scarcely ever speak of him without an accent of disdain or patronage / ' Nevertheless , Mr.
Frankfort Moore	PERSON	, well known as an industrious and fertile writer of comedies and novels -LRB- for example , '' The Jessamy Bride '' -RRB- , himself an Irishman , has now taken up the cudgels in
Goldsmith	LOCATION	's defense , and has directed his attention chiefly against this '' accent of disdain or patronage . ''

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	undertakes to do two things : to disprove the credibility of
Boswell	PERSON	and others , and , as a necessary consequence , to explain
Goldsmith	PERSON	, who , just because he was an Irish - man , was inevitably and eternally misunderstood by the Englishmen and
Scotchmen	PERSON	among whom he lived in
London	LOCATION	, and by whom chiefly his doings have been reported to us .

		In both these undertakings he seems to have abund - antly succeeded .

		In his thirty-page Introduction , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	denies Bos well 's credibility and sincerity , and accuses him of malice and wilful inaccuracy .

		He supports his attack by citing
Miss Burney	PERSON	, by examining the cases of
Barretti	LOCATION	and of Gar - rick -LRB- both of whom
Boswell	PERSON	hated -RRB- , by quoting * THE LIFE OF
OLIVER GOLDSMITH	PERSON	.

F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	, illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Walpole	LOCATION	's denunciation of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, and by reference to `` well-known '' facts about the
Boswell	PERSON	family 's attitude toward the '' Life of
Johnson	PERSON	. ''

		He further charges that
Boswell	PERSON	, like some others of
Johnson	PERSON	's circle , was tem - peramentally unable to understand
Goldsmith	PERSON	; and to make this point clear , he enters into a detailed exposition of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's characteris - tically Irish training and ways .

		Of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's training , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	remarks , at the end of Chapter I , on the
Ireland	LOCATION	of
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	: '' An implicit trust in
Providence	LOCATION	makes the most improvident of people ; but when a man occupies the position of a local providence , his condition becomes hopeless , owing to the onerous character of the obli - gations imposed upon him by the role .

		There can be little doubt that this was the part which his father was encouraged to play ; and he played it to the entire sat - isfaction of the neighborhood .

		That was very well so far as it went ; but such a position as he occupied should only be a life one ; an attempt to establish a dynasty on such a basis is certain to end in disaster .

		The father of the Goldsmiths believed in the hereditary principle in this connection ; he taught his children the unworldly doctrine that it is more blessed to give than to receive , and the result was to unfit them for worldly success .

		One of the most prominent characteristics of the world is worldliness , but
Charles Goldsmith	PERSON	led his children to believe exactly the opposite ; and the result was that one of them lived miserably as a genius and another starved as a carpenter .

		There was not a member of the family that did not ` go under . '

		The worldliness of the world was too much for them , seeing that they had been taught from their infancy that unworldliness is the most important of virtues .

		The others were all probably as truly loved within their circle , which was bounded by the tiny town of Elphin in the north and the obscure village of Ballymahon in the south , as
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	was by his circle , which even in his own day was bounded only by the circumference of the globe ; but all became equally submerged by the stress and strain of life in a world that was made for the worldly . ''

		The one particular , however , in which Gold - smith was sure to be misunderstood by most Englishmen , and -LRB- Mr.
Moore	PERSON	implies -RRB- by all
Scotchmen	PERSON	, was his unwise but persistent use of various forms of Irish humor ; and the worst of it was that the people who misunderstood him thought him a fool .

		Among these forms of humor was the bull .

		Cooke called Gold - smith a fool , because '' If you gave him change for a bad shilling and you gave him the shilling back , he would say , ' What 's the matter with the shilling ?

		It 's as good a shilling as ever was fto/vi . ' ''

		On this Mr.
Moore	PERSON	comments : '' Of course the people who came to understand this form of his native humor found him extremely amusing and looked upon him as a delightful companion ; but the majority of these people were not of the recording sort : they did not keep diaries , nor did they write biographies .

		But let not
Boswell	PERSON	tell us that Gold -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE 473 smith , if he was the ignorant , foolish , pushing , easily irritated conversationaj blunderer that he tries to make him out to be , would have become the beloved friend of people known to fashion as well as of people known to fame . ''

		Another form of humor is a subtly ironical comment , delivered with a perfectly straight face .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	instances the lines in '' Re - taliation , '' which Cumberland took as compli - mentary , and concludes : '' We will only beg of a reader of
Boswell	PERSON	to con - sider if it might not be possible that a Scotsman , who of all people in the world had the least faculty for ap - preciating this form of expression , became mystified by the adroitness of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's employment of it ; and if it was not rather more than possible that this Irishman , whose humor appears in almost every line that ever came from his pen , thoroughly enjoying the mystifica - tion of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, almost touched the border-line of ex - travagance in his utterances when the silly Scotsman was within hearing . ''

		Still another variety of humor especially practiced by Irishmen is affected stupidity and willingness to be the subject of a jest both matters , we may be fairly certain , totally in - comprehensible to
James Boswell	PERSON	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, of
Auchinleck	PERSON	.


Boswell	PERSON	was like
John Shard	PERSON	in Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's '' What Every Woman Knows '' ; he could not understand how a surgical opera - tion would enable a man to see a joke .

		Con - sequently , men like
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Garrick	PERSON	must have taken great and constant delight in saying and doing , in BoswelTs presence , per - fectly absurd things with the gravest possible manner .

		If
Boswell	PERSON	had some faint suspicion that these men were making fun of him , his dis - like of them , which was presumably inspired in the first place by his jealousy of their inti - macy with
Johnson	PERSON	, finds considerable justifica - tion .

		If , however ,
Boswell	PERSON	took them seriously , his entire misunderstanding is an adequate explanation of his disapproval , for in that case
Boswell	PERSON	could see in
Johnson	PERSON	's liking for them only another instance of that great man 's extraordinary philanthrophy .

		With these facts made clear , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	proceeds to take up the various incidents which have been supposed to show
Goldsmith	PERSON	in an unfavorable light , for instance , in reporting the scene where
Goldsmith	PERSON	affected to be en - raged because the French officers had eyes only for the Misses
Horneck	PERSON	, and paid no attention to
Goldsmith	PERSON	in plain view at another window , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	reminds vis that the ladies themselves surely understood the humor of the situation , and that no Irishman could fail to see how much fun
Goldsmith	PERSON	was having .

		Similarly , he shows the humor of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's affecting to disparage
Burke	PERSON	's eloquence , with his apparent discomfiture when put to the test ; and he declares that '' as for the story of the puppets , all that we can say is that if there is no humor in a man 's affirming that he is quite as adroit as a stuffed figure controlled by wires , there is nothing humorous in the world . ''

		In the light of such details as these , we can better understand the scene when , upon Gold - smith 's assenting to
Chamier	ORGANIZATION	's suggestion that by the last word of the line '' Remote , un - friended , melancholy , slow , ''
Goldsmith	PERSON	meant '' tardiness of locomotion , '' Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	inter - rupted with '' No , sir ... You mean that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude . ''

		Surely
Goldsmith	PERSON	's eyes must have twinkled as he answered meekly , '' Ah !

		that was what I meant ! ''

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has succeeded admirably in prov - ing the unreliability of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's testimony , and in explaining practically all of the contradictory evidence which has clouded our understanding of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		Hereafter there should be no excuse for looking upon Gold - smith as an inspired fool , a genius , to be sure , and lovable , but hardly more than a grown-up child , and therefore exciting our wonder rather than the respect we give most of his friends .

		In short , when we find a man who could take his own misadventure as the core of his own comedy , who could write un - failingly delicious humor , who could dedicate a poem or answer an angry and malicious opponent with perfect taste and tone , or who could write satire of such a rare combination of cleverness and kindliness , with all Pope 's wit but not a trace of his malice , as
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	did all these things , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	simply can not believe that he could be a vain and envious fool .

		And we heartily agree with him .

		Aside from Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's two main conten - tions , however , his work seems distinctly unsat - isfactory .

		His efforts to present the facts of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's life are neither so clear nor so carefully '' documented '' as Mr.
Austin Dob	PERSON	- son 's , which perhaps is only saying that Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	is a more skilful literary historian .

		In the first place , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's happy knack of interpreting a scene or an incident becomes , when he is dealing with mere rumors , a too facile habit of lively conjecture .

		For example , in Chapter IV. , `` Qualifying for a Degree , '' he discusses
Goldsmith	PERSON	's bullying by
Theaker Wilder	PERSON	`` a name which so aptly suggested his disposition that it might have been invented 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, for him by
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	himself '' and one of its effects : his writing street-ballads and listening to their rendition and the comments on them .

		All these Mr.
Moore	PERSON	makes the most of , with much ingenuity , which , though very pleasant , must still remain conjecture .

		Again , of a possible but entirely imaginary account which
Goldsmith	PERSON	might conceivably have wished to write about his wanderings and for which , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	assumes , the '' Enquiry '' was a sub - stitute he says that '' We have no doubt that he approached the booksellers with a proposal for a volume embodying his experiences , and that it was rejected on the spot . ''

		Indeed , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's too frequent use of '' we may be sure '' or '' doubtless '' is often irritating .

		Along with this tendency to visualize a scene vividly , and then to accept the product as fact , goes a Swinburnian intemperance in the use of superlatives .

		For example , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	says that '' his ' Vicar of
Wakefield	PERSON	' was the best novel , his ' Deserted Village ' the best poem , and ' She Stoops to Conquer ' the best comedy , of his generation . ' '

		Such statemen ts show a gen - erous enthusiasm , but hardly seem judicial when one thinks of ''
Tom Jones	PERSON	'' and ''
Tristram Shandy	PERSON	, '' of Gray 's `` Elegy , '' and of `` The Rivals '' and the '' School for Scandal '' ; and the assertion of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's excellence in terms which imply the inferiority of other very good things is , to say the least , unnecessary .

		Another example is Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's comment on ''
Edwin	PERSON	and Angelina , '' which has never been rated high by the critics , and which in popu - larity has surely not even rivalled Gray 's '' Elegy , '' and yet he says : '' We believe that more of its stanzas than of any other poem can be repeated by people in
England	LOCATION	to-day . ''

		Among numerous other obiter dicta inspired by zeal for
Goldsmith	PERSON	's reputation is a refer - ence to ''
Pamela	PERSON	and a large number of equally anaemic stories of genteel life , '' and the remark that '' It took Gray three years to give an air of laborious perfection to his ' Elegy . '

		It took
Goldsmith	PERSON	eight to impart an air of spontaneity to ` The Traveller . ' ''

		In truth , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	seems often inclined to proclaim an '' Irish invasion '' of which somehow or other the Eng - lish have been exasperatingly unconscious .

		Sometimes , also , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	betrays as who of us would not ?

		an inadequate knowledge of eighteenth century literary history .

		He seems to imply , for example , that
Garrick	PERSON	's scheming against the `` Goodnatured Man '' showed special ill feeling toward
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		It seems , rather , to be characteristic of
Garrick	PERSON	; it certainly was of a piece with his treatment of Dodsley 's ''
Cleone	PERSON	, '' and not unlike his rejection of Home 's ''
Douglas	PERSON	. ''

		Again , apropos of the charge that
Goldsmith	PERSON	was vain , he notes the number of instances in which
Goldsmith	PERSON	's books appeared without the author 's name on the title-page .

		But anonymous publication , even where the authorship was an open secret , was rather common then : Young 's `` Night Thoughts '' had no author 's name , even on the eighth edition ; a fifth edition of
Johnson	PERSON	's ``
London	LOCATION	'' did not , or a third of his `` Ras - selas , '' or a third of
Burke	PERSON	's '' Account of the European Settlements in
America	LOCATION	, '' or a third of his '' PhiJosophical Inquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful '' ; or the fifth of the '' Sermons of Mr.
Yorick	PERSON	'' ; or the ninth of Gray 's `` Elegy . ''


Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Akenside	LOCATION	,
Mason	PERSON	, and others , put their names to only a second or a third edition of their various publications ; so that it is just as reasonable to suppose that
Goldsmith	PERSON	was following a common practice as that he was shrinking from publicity .

		In the case of the '' Vicar , '' Mr.
Moore	PERSON	seems misled by its later popularity . ''

		It can scarcely be doubted , '' he says -LRB- page 266 -RRB- , `` that the Newberys after the lapse of a year or two came to the con - clusion that they had got the book cheap . ''

		Although the publishers issued three editions in
1766	DATE	, the fourth did not appear until
1770	DATE	; and , according to the account-books of
Collins	PERSON	, one of the partners , '' started with a loss . ''

		As Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	tells us , before the thousand copies of this edition were sold , and the fifth appeared in
1774	DATE	,
Collins	PERSON	sold his third share for five guineas .

		The inferences are unmistakable : the publishers did not profit at
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's expense , as Mr.
Moore	PERSON	assumes , and editions of the '' Vicar '' did not begin to multiply until after
Goldsmith	PERSON	's death .

		Another distracting feature of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's book is the unfailing gusto with which he plies his shillelagh on nearly every head in sight
Johnson	PERSON	,
Garrick	PERSON	, the publishers , stage managers old and new , historians , Englishmen and Scotch - men .

		Sir
Joshua	PERSON	and the Misses
Horneck	PERSON	are almost the only ones who escape .

		The author 's strictures are occasionally in bad taste , as , for example , his sneer at
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's delay in getting out his edition of Shakespeare -LRB- page 273 -RRB- ; more often they are needless digressions .

		Indeed Mr.
Moore	PERSON	fairly lays himself open to criticism by his abounding fulness of utterance ; his book would have been better if it had been a hun - dred pages shorter .

		THE DIAL 475 TRAFFICS AXD DISCOVERIES OF A CHTSA COLLECTOR .

		* Popular interest in old china and its collec - tion is amply attested by the recent publication , in two well printed and beautifully illustrated volumes , of Lady
Charlotte Schreiber	PERSON	's Jour - nals , written during the years of her ceramic enthusiasm .

		Lady
Charlotte	LOCATION	was a pioneer collector , with pioneer opportunities that make the china enthusiast of to-day sigh with envy .

		Her specialty was English pottery and porce - lain and Battersea enamels ; and the collection she gave to the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	stands as a monument to her untiring industry and perseverance , her profound knowledge , and her good taste .

		Lady
Charlotte	LOCATION	's Journals are no mere dry-as-dust catalogues of dealers ' names , dates , prices , and other routine details of the chase .

		She took up china-collecting as the chief diver - sion of her later life , bringing to it the same buoyant energy and enthusiasm with which , in girlhood , she had mastered half a dozen lan - guages , and , after her first marriage , studied Welsh , translated the '' Mabinogion , '' learned double-entry book-keeping , and incidentally brought up a family of ten children .

		Her second husband ,
Charles Schreiber	PERSON	, appears to have shared all her artistic interests .

		Together they travelled through
Europe	LOCATION	in search of china , bric-a-brac , and , in later years , of fan - leaves and playing cards , hunting out `` curios - ity shops '' in every town they visited , consid - ering values , driving bargains , and leaving behind them an ever-increasing circle of friendly tradesmen , to whom they might look for help on succeeding visits .

		Perhaps the pleasantest quality of the Journals is the sense they give of the
Schreibers	PERSON	' rare and perfect comradeship , seemingly devoid of the smallest frictions or antagonisms .

		An amusing trait of the journalist is the pride she takes in not being `` done '' by the antique-dealers .

		If a vase or a plate is too dear , the
Schreibers	PERSON	will not buy it , no matter how badly they want it to fill a gap in one of their cabinets .

		It was this attitude , the only one for the self-respecting collector , rich or poor , quite as much as the then state of the antique trade , that made it possible to get * LADY

		together a collection like the
South Kensington	LOCATION	one for a surprisingly moderate outlay .

		Lady
Charlotte	LOCATION	was wonderfully even-tem - pered .

		The most preposterous prices seldom excite her to more than a mere statement of the fact ; and the most treasured '' find '' makes , in the quiet tenor of the diary , only '' a happy and successful day . ''

		Nevertheless she is a person of decided preferences , and in nothing more than in antique-dealers .

		Early in the chase she writes of `` an officious , med - dling , tiresome old man named della
Rovere	PERSON	, who keeps a shop with very little , in it . ''

		Oc - casionally she buys from some poor little dealer '' more from charity than anything else . ''

		Open-air markets always amuse and delight her .

		She generously attributes dealers ' mis - takes to ignorance , but the rare occasions on which she and her husband let themselves be duped cut her pride to the quick .

		However , these misadventures are too few to mar the pleasure of their frequent journeys abroad , punctuated by hunts in
London	LOCATION	then as now the paradise of the curio-hunter , and stays at her country home at
Canford	ORGANIZATION	, or visits her children , several of whom shared her fondness for collecting .

		Besides the English porcelains at
South Kensington	LOCATION	,
Lady Schreiber	PERSON	left a quantity of miscellaneous china , most of which is now in the possession of three of her children .

		All these collections have been freely drawn upon to illustrate the Journals , the result being a series of very beautiful plates in color and half-tone , most of them showing groups of specimens of one ware .

		The Journals make no effort to assist in identification of specimens , and the plates likewise will be found of greater interest to connoisseurs than to amateurs in china-hunting .

		Lady
Schreiber	PERSON	's hunts were of course not confined to mere shopping .

		Her visits to museums and private collections and her meet - ings with continental experts are interestingly related ; and there are graphic descriptions of many of the places she visited .

		The Turkish trip was undertaken principally to visit a daughter , whose husband was Ambassador at
Constanti	LOCATION	- nople ; and there were many unique and de - lightful experiences to record during the month spent there , besides a few notable purchases of Oriental wares .

		Altogether ,
Lady Schreiber	PERSON	's Journals are a vital argument in behalf of a fad .

		When the active interests of her life were waning a little , the merry , tireless hunt for glass and china and fans kept her and 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, her husband busy and happy and pleasantly excited .

		In her Journals , as in her generous gifts to the nation , she has left behind her a valuable legacy the record of a gallant spirit , well aware that most curiosity shops are '' not good for very much , '' but finding life , none the less , '' a very pleasant chase . ''

		ACTON ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		* It is striking evidence of the esteem in which
Lord Acton	PERSON	has been held by his literary friends that , although he never would consent to under - take any considerable piece of historical writing , they have collected and published since his death four volumes of his lectures and essays .

		They reckoned on the interest which the larger read - ing public would feel in the work of one whose broad knowledge and stimulating ideas were always the admiration of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	group of scholars and of the many men with whom he came in contact beyond the confines of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He enjoyed the reputation of being one of the best read men in
England	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		His learning was regarded as ample and exact .

		The lectures in the present volume , like most of those previously published , were delivered in
Cambridge	LOCATION	while he was Regius Professor of
Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the years 1895-1899 the French Revolution was one of the special subjects set for the
Historical Tripos	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subject must have been in a peculiar sense congenial , for .

		through his family he was con - nected with some interesting consequences of the Revolution .

		His name ,
Dalberg	PERSON	-
Acton	LOCATION	, recalls two widely separated fields of revolution - ary activity the Rhine country and
Naples	LOCATION	.

		He was great-grand-nephew of Karl von Dal - berg , the last archchancellor of the
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		His grandfather was the
General Acton	ORGANIZATION	who was minister of the Neapolitan Bourbons at the time when they entered into conflict with the first French republic .

		There is nothing in these lectures , however , which suggests that he inherited the antipathies of General
Acton	PERSON	or shared the dreams of the prince-bishop who played so conspicuous a part in
Napoleonic Germany	LOCATION	.

		directed toward its political side .

		Among the causes , he discusses only the growth of opinion .

		The economic side , which now so engages the attention of investigators , he leaves almost untouched .

		In describing the legislation of
August 4	DATE	, for example , he does not explain in any detail the plan of making an end of feudal burdens , nor does he mention the laws of
March	DATE	and
May , 1790	DATE	, which were designed to give effect to the plan .

		For the sanie reason little is said of the assignats or of the maximum laws .

		Since
Lord Acton	PERSON	's lectures move over the familiar path of the political history of the Revolution the reader will look mainly for his estimate of the great figures of the political stage -
Mirabeau	LOCATION	,
Danton	PERSON	,
Robespierre	LOCATION	, the
King	PERSON	, the Queen .

		His interpretation of Dan - ton 's career is disappointing .

		He holds
Danton	PERSON	responsible for the massacres of
September	DATE	, on the strength of a remark to
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	, then the Due de
Chartres	LOCATION	serving on the staff of Dumouriez .

		He also affirms , without proof , that
Danton	PERSON	sent out orders to the departments to imitate the example of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The descrip - tion of Mirabeau is more satisfactory .

		The final judgment is one of condemnation , because
Mirabeau	PERSON	's ultimate policy was not only '' one vast intrigue , '' but also because it was futile . ''

		There was at no time a prospect of success , '' says
Lord Acton	PERSON	, `` for he never had the king and the queen for one moment with him . ''

		Lord Acton deems Sieyes '' the most per - fect representative of the Revolution . ''

		He explains that `` in sustained power of consistent thinking Sieyes resembles
Bentham	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	, '' that '' though many modern writers on politics exceed him in genius and eloquence , none equal him in invention and resource , '' and that '' in the history of political doctrine , where almost every chapter has yet to be written , none will be more valuable than the one that will show what is permanent and progressive in the ideas that he originated . ''

		Such views have at least the merit of novelty .

		At the same time ,
Lord Acton	PERSON	does not regard Sieyes as a high-minded man , or a good writer or speaker .

		The most noteworthy quality of these lectures is their style , their style of thought as well as of expression .

		The spoken word must have been even more effective .

		Lord Acton pos - sessed the art of summarizing a situation in an epigram which lingers in the mind because of its happy exactness .

		The wholesome vigor of his moral judgments results in his distributing condemnations in a manner altogether uncon -

		Apropos of the murder of
Foulon	PERSON	and

		He finds it characteristic of modern monarchy , and proceeds to name several mon - archs , including the English Elizabeth ,
James	PERSON	, and
William	LOCATION	.

		He adds that the historians '' have praise and hero-worship for nearly every one of these anointed culprits .

		The strong man with the dagger is followed by the weaker man with the sponge .

		First , the criminal who slays ; then the sophist who defends the slayer . ''

		At the close of the twenty-two lectures there is an appendix of thirty pages giving
Lord Acton	PERSON	's opinions of the principal writers on the Revolution , from
Droz	PERSON	to
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is far from being a dry bibliographical list .

		A page or two of comment is devoted to each author , and the results of
Lord Acton	PERSON	's reading and of his wide European acquaintance are more apparent here than in some other parts of the volume .

		BRIEFS ox 3f EW BOOKS .

		Gleaning * from
Archibald Little	PERSON	, whose death was fiftv years recorded some
two years ago	DATE	, had long been recognized as an authority on western
China	LOCATION	.

		For fifty years a merchant in that country , his life had not been spent in the treaty ports , but rather in the little-known interior , especially along the upper reaches of the Yangtse .

		His book entitled '' Through the Yangtse Gorges '' remains the best account of travel in that region , while '' The Far East '' testifies to his scholarly ability .

		It was a distinct service , therefore , for his widow , herself known as the author of '' The Land of the Blue Gown , '' to bring together , under the title of '' Gleanings from Fifty Years in
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a number of his miscellaneous writ - ings .

		Many of these appeared originally in local periodicals , and some in the reviews of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; others have never before been pub - lished .

		The twenty-two papers are grouped under headings as follows : Trade and Politics , Travel , Drama and Legend , Religion and Philosophy .

		Those on trade and politics are of value not only because of Mr.
Little	PERSON	's long experience but because of his exceptionally fair attitude toward the Chinese , an attitude quite different from that of the average trader in the
East	LOCATION	.

		In the travel section , some ex - periences along the Yangtse are vividly described , and there is a cbarming account of a yachting trip through the Chusan archipelago .

		Of the dramatic sections , two are translations , while one is an orig - inal playlet written after the Chinese manner .

		The first translation is that of a two-hundred-year-old comedy known as '' Borrowing Boots . ''

		To those who are unfamiliar with the Chinese drama this will be a revelation in its delightful humor , its withering satire , and its striking delineation of cer - tain Chinese characteristics .

		But most interesting at this time are the two hitherto unpublished chap - ters on '' Missionaries in
China	LOCATION	'' and '' Confucian - ism . ''

		These were written toward the end of the author 's life , and represent his final judgment on these much-discussed matters .

		The missionary problem is treated from a distinctly pro-Chinese point of view .

		Recognizing the good accomplished , the writer can not overlook the political and other evils .

		The chapter is a frank indictment of the wrongs inflicted upon
China	LOCATION	by European govern - ments , merchants , and others .

		The final opinion of this merchant and scholar must be of value : '' I may sum up by saying that in my experience with all classes of Chinese and in all parts of
China	LOCATION	: in business , in pleasure , in travel , in war and in peace : with rebel leaders and their rabble armies , with Imperialist generals and their ill-disciplined troops : with literary pedants : with shrewd bankers , clever merchants , hardy sailors and boatmen and illiterate coolies : steadily comparing our two civili - zations , ever modifying foregone conclusions and never reaching the comfort of absolute conviction : my conclusion is , that the average Chinaman is more forbearing , more tolerant , and in his social relations as much , if not more , Christian than the average Westerner . ''

		Some bit , of life WIth no apology for assuming that and reflection * sundry personal reminiscences and certain private opinions and peculiar tastes may seem as interesting and as important to others as to himself , Mr.
Charles Macomb Flandrau	PERSON	writes frankly and freely in the first person singular in a series of short and unusually entertaining sketches and essays that originally appeared in `` The
Bellman	PERSON	, '' and are now collected to form a book entitled `` Prejudices '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		The style is agreeably suggestive of Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's genially intimate and self-revealing manner , the author making it clear that he has profited by one of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's pieces of advice to young writers to give expression to what seems most personal and peculiar , since that is what will be read with fullest sympathy by the greatest number of readers A few lines appropriate to the season , we quote from Mr.
Flandrau	PERSON	's chapter on `` Holidays . ''

		He confesses in regard to the
Fourth of July	DATE	: `` It now has become for me a day of genuine misery , unless I am happy enough to spend it where it is not ` observed . '

		In addition to loathing the noise be - cause I ca n't help it , I more and more every year hate it because I am increasingly depressed by the knowledge of all the so easily preventable mutila - tions with which it is associated ; I hate it because of the pain I have known it to inflict upon the sick and dying ... While trying to reassure an old dog who had crawled under a bed and collapsed THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, with a nervous chill , while trying to calm the uncon - trollable terror of a steady , sensible , intelligent horse , I have often fervently wished that there had been no Revolution and that we had remained a British colony . ''

		One chapter -LRB- `` Wanderlust '' -RRB- takes the form of a pathetic little story , excellently told , whether the incident be real or only imagined .

		Another is devoted to a discussion , in dialogue form , of ``
Ann Veronica	PERSON	. ''

		Admirable , too , are the author 's observations on servants and his in - dignation against those masters and mistresses who treat them as creatures having no share in our com - mon humanity .

		In short , the book is replete with good things , and should be read from cover to cover .

		An
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Mr ' Geor g e W -
Smalley	PERSON	, for many American years
London	LOCATION	correspondent of the joumaii , t. New Yo rk `` Tribune , '' and later representative of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' in
America	LOCATION	, has recently been publishing , in the former paper , his reminiscences of men and events .

		These sketches have now been put into book form , and ap - pear under the title , '' Anglo-American Memories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author follows no order , either of time or incident , and as a result each sketch stands as a disconnected recollection .

		Nevertheless , the book is very entertaining reading , for Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	has a vivid pen , which gives , at least , the impres - sion made upon a contemporary by such men as
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	,
Dana	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, Garrison , Sum - ner , and a score of others of the period just before the Civil War .

		During the war itself , and even to the most recent time , the author has had a journ - alistic position , enabling him to observe at close range the political leaders , both of the
United States	LOCATION	and of
England	LOCATION	.

		As a youth , enthusiastic for the cause of free speech , Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	was an ardent defender of
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	.

		He considers the later glorification of Garrison ill-founded . ''

		I can not recall , '' he writes , '' one single effort of any - thing that could be thought oratory .

		He was a tiresome speaker ... He had a message to de - liver , and he delivered it as a gramophone delivers its messages ... His face was both angry and weak .

		His attitude on the platform was half apologetic and half passionate . ''

		This is interest - ing , if not of itself convincing , testimony .

		Convinc - ing the book is not , in any connection , for the author has apparently made no effort to compare his own impressions with the statements or judgments of historians , and in the matter of names and dates , his memory sometimes plays him false .

		Thus , in lauding the great abilities of
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, our Minister to
England	LOCATION	during the Civil War , he writes : ''
Adams	PERSON	's greater service consisted in a just menace of war to
England	LOCATION	if she let loose the Alexandra ... , '' and concludes that the British Ministry `` gave way only because Mr.
Adams	PERSON	had put the alternative of war before them . ''

		It was not the
Alexandra	PERSON	that was in question , but the so-called ``
Laird Rams	PERSON	, '' and the American his - torian ,
Rhodes	LOCATION	, has proved with apparent conclu - siveness that the British determination to stop the '' Rams '' was reached some days previous to
Adams	PERSON	's ultimatum , and that
England	LOCATION	in no sense yielded to a threat .

		But Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	would dis - claim , it is to be presumed , exact historical ac - curacy ; and , certainly , in suggestiveness and in attractive characterization , based on personal im - pressions , his work has value and much of interest .


Spain	LOCATION	's most Ei S ht Spanish cathedrals Sala - noteworthv manca -LRB- older and younger -RRB- ,
Burgos	PERSON	, cathedrals .

		Avila ,
Leon	PERSON	,
Toledo	LOCATION	,
Segovia	LOCATION	,
Seville	LOCATION	, and
Granada	LOCATION	are described and interpreted in one of those sumptuous volumes which are less , and much more , than a guide-book Mr.
John A. Gade	PERSON	's '' Cathedrals of
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , a practising architect of
New York City	LOCATION	, has recently returned from a close and enthusiastic study of Spanish churches ; and with the glow still warming his heart , he has written the story of certain cathedrals which are most typical of the blended glories of Romanesque , Gothic , and
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		The historic charm of
Salamanca	LOCATION	, and the curious fact that its smaller and older cathedral was left as a sort of buttress to this gigantic new one begun by
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	and
Isabella	PERSON	, have naturally given it the first place in Mr.
Gade	PERSON	's book . ''

		Grand '' and '' grandiloquent '' are his appropriate adjectives for these two products of different ages .

		As an architect , the author can not accept without a murmur the Renaissance lantern raised on the Gothic crown of the new cathedral , though he admits that the two styles have been blended with a harmony hardly to be expected .

		The noble Cock-tower
Torre del Gallo	PERSON	of the older cathedral is judiciously praised ; and he does not fail to remind us that '' it furnished the inspir - ation for our noblest American Romanesque temple
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Better known to Americans are Burgos , so often the first Spanish cathedral visited , and
Seville	LOCATION	, with its immensity , its exterior clashings of style , its interior nobility , and its Giralda tower also an inspiration for
America	LOCATION	.

		Avila , from whose gates little
St. Teresa	LOCATION	'' toddled forth '' to save the world ;
Granada	LOCATION	, whose cathedral had to await the expulsion of the Moors and so came in as Gothic was dying out ;
Leon	PERSON	's majestic Gothic , and
Toledo	LOCATION	's impressive silences all are finely felt and charmingly described by a sensitive soul with an unusual gift of expression .

		The book is richly illustrated with half-tones , and in the main is carefully printed although on page 13 `` western '' seems inadvertently to have usurped the place of '' eastern '' in speaking of the apses of
Salamanca	LOCATION	.

		The business-like directness and ce - lerity with which cases at law are , as a rule , tried in
England	LOCATION	must have surprised many Americans who have had occasion to look into the matter .

		The Court of Chancery seems not yet to have developed any amazing rapid - ity in its procedure , but otherwise there is truth in Lights and shadows of
London	LOCATION	courts .

		THE DIAL 479 Mr.
Thomas Learning	PERSON	's statement in the preface to his instructive and readable volume , '' A Philadel - phia Lawyer in the
London	LOCATION	Courts '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- : '' The trials , both civil and criminal , will reveal the complete triumph of common sense , and the Englishman will appear at his best in his court , for there he leads the world .

		The hearty good humor , alacrity and crispness of the proceedings , the ab - sence of declamation but the avoidance of monotony by the proper distribution of emphasis , all combine to delight the practised observer . ''

		Mr.
Learning	PERSON	's book is the elaboration of an address before the
Bar Association of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, an address that was so well received that he subsequently devoted a number of holiday
London	LOCATION	visits to the amplifi - cation of his remarks .

		His chapters deal with first impressions , the making of English lawyers and their several kinds of duties , lawyers ' fees , the dis - cipline whereby correct standards are maintained , the various sorts of courts , a recent important mur - der trial , extra-metropolitan law practice , and some other general matters .

		Among the few points of superiority of our own methods over those of English courts is the appointment of counsel for an undefended prisoner .

		In the course of his interesting account of the trial and conviction of
Madar Lai Dhingra	PERSON	, the young student who mur - dered Sir
William Hutt Curzon Wyllie	PERSON	and Dr.
Cowas Lalcaca	PERSON	.

		the author remarks that `` to an American observer it seemed odd and scarcely a fair practice for a man to be tried for his life unrepresented by counsel learned in the law ... To excuse the omission on the ground of the obvious guilt and callousness of the prisoner , is not a sat - isfactory solution , because it would involve pre - judging the issue to be tried . ''

		One is reminded of the odium incurred in some quarters by the legally appointed defender of the assassin of Presi - dent
McKinley	PERSON	, and of his convincing defense of his acceptance of the appointment .

		As Mr.
Learning	PERSON	says , our invariable method in such cases '' guards against the possibility of terrible mistakes . ''

		The illustrations , six in number , are photographic repro - ductions of sketches in oil from the brush of the author himself .

		A pleasant chronicle of events and personages important in the dramatic history of
America	LOCATION	is Mr.
Daniel Frohman	PERSON	's `` Memories of a Manager '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		For five and twenty years Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	has been one of the best known theatrical managers of this country , and his establishment and conduct of the famous old Lyceum Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	would alone make him a figure to recall with kindli - ness by the many who have enjoyed his ministra - tions in that now historic playhouse .

		The first part of his book is devoted to reminiscences of the Lyceum venture ; he chats of plays and players , tells many piquant anecdotes of
Sothern	LOCATION	,
Gillette	ORGANIZATION	,
Mansfield	LOCATION	, and others , in the days when they were young and aspiring ; and he describes the early Some good theatrical small-talk .

		struggles which led to the establishment of an organization which , everything considered , was a stock company of as equal excellence and sound ideals as any in the records of our stage .

		It is amusing to hear how
Mansfield	PERSON	secured '' Candida '' from Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, put it into rehearsal , and then angrily gave the play up , not finding it suited to his needs .

		When Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	saw Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	, and referred to the fact ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	in jocund mood declared that the English company which played it drew a good house the opening night but played to nearly empty benches the remaining nights .

		He told them to send him royalties for the first night only ; but , said he , they persisted in sending the money for each evening 's performance . ''

		They ca n't afford it ! ''

		was the unique dramatist 's remark .

		The second part of the volume deals critically , though in brief , with the technique of drama ; and here Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	has some sensible things to say about the composition of plays , why they fail , and how the work differs to-day from that of the past .

		He declares that a drama is '' a transcript of life either as it exists or in its ideal form as life ought to be , '' a definition which few will feel like disputing .

		Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	's chatty record is enlivened with numerous portraits and scenes from familiar dramas .

		Lovers of the theatre will wish to keep the book for reference after the immediate pleasure of its perusal is over .

		In its - unostentatious way , it is a worthy addition to our theatrical annals .

		Samuel Butter ^ ne r
$ *	MONEY	i ssue f tne works of
Samuel andPtvchie Butler	PERSON	, now being carried forward Evolution .

		ty Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	, brings with it a rather striking illustration of the vicissitudes of opinion in the realm of science rivalling the re - putedly more capricious fluctuations of aesthetic preference in the field of literature .

		The re-issue becomes in due measure a vindication ; for the trend of opinion in the mooted field of heredity , though unchanging in its aversion to the controversial and carping judgments of a brilliant critic of
Darwin	PERSON	and Darwinism , has swung back to a recognition of the pertinence of his views , and the soundness of principles misleadingly and at times fancifully elaborated .

		`` Life and Habit '' written in
1877	DATE	, and '' Unconscious Memory '' written in
1880	DATE	, are introduced by Mr.
R. A. Streatfeild	PERSON	and Professor
Hartog	PERSON	respectively , the critical survey of the latter setting forth the significance of
Butler	PERSON	's views in the light of recent biological advance .

		The question of the inadequacy of the hypothesis of natural selection , and the suggestion of a psychic factor in the transmission process , form the two foci about which the somewhat irregular orbit of
Butler	PERSON	's works are described .

		Whatever the true meaning and value of the hypothesis of an organic or unconscious memory , the ideas of
Butler	PERSON	are more than suggestive ; they are decidedly stimulating , and to a creditable extent form a permanent con - tribution to the body of significant positions .

		The 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, volumes bear surprisingly well the test of a reap - pearance after a revolutionary progress of thought .

		The ideas are clothed in an older fashion ; but the spirit of their design is at once modern and inter - esting .

		The situation is but superficially parallel to the remarkable constructive work of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet the one incident recalls the other .

		Students of biology and of psychology will welcome these admir - ably prepared and executed volumes .

		They will be read selectively and retrospectively , yet with an appreciation of the vital force to shape opinion and to enter into the balance of judgment , that gives longevity to the productions of able minds .

		`` A rational scheme of connection * such as 8hould be at the .

		back of every attempt to make choice of the best books '' is the aim of Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's latest volume .

		`` World-Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is its title , the subject being considered '' not in the sense of the sum total of particular literatures , but as a unity , the literary field seen from the point of view of the English-speaking peoples . ''

		In accordance with this scheme , the author groups the great books under the '' Five Literary Bibles '' : to wit , the Scriptures , Homer and the Greek Tragedians ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	, and the
Faust	LOCATION	- Dramas .

		An introductory chapter , which is cer - tainly too erudite for the class of readers for which the book is intended , sets forth historically '' The Literary Pedigree of the English-Speaking Peo - ples , '' and a sixth division discusses the master - pieces of collateral literatures , Omar and
Ossian	PERSON	,
Sigurd	PERSON	and the
Kalevala	LOCATION	.

		The essay and the lyric receive separate treatment , and a discussion of '' Strategetic Points '' serves as an annex into which are thrust Plato and
Lucretius	PERSON	,
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, The Romance of the Rose , Reynard the Fox , and Every - man ,
Malory	PERSON	and
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Froissart	PERSON	and

Bacon	PERSON	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Racine	LOCATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	,
Rabelais	LOCATION	, Balzac and Hugo ,
Byron	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Comparisons are odious , and the list is perhaps as good as most previous ones .

		The book will have its value for our Reading Clubs and Chautauquas , although many will contest its statement that
Morris	PERSON	's '' Sigurd the Volsung '' '' represents perhaps the highest point to which the epic poetry of the world has attained . ''

Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the first extensive treatise of the sort put forth by an American jurist , so far as we know , and containing the largest number of illus - trative examples , from a great variety of sources , that it has been our fortune to meet with .

		A chapter on `` The Importance of the Last Will and
Testa	PERSON	- ment '' precedes the variously amusing or instructive examples that are grouped under such heads as '' Ancient Wills , '' '' Wills in Fiction and Poetry , '' . ''

		Curious Wills , '' '' Testamentary and Kindred Miscellany , '' '' Wills of Famous Foreigners , '' and '' Wills of Famous Americans . ''

		The wills of
Virgil	LOCATION	,
Augustus	PERSON	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Isaak Walton	PERSON	,
Paul Revere	PERSON	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	, and in - numerable other persons of note are given either in substance or in full detail .

		Among the freakish specimens of will-making is mentioned , together with many others ,
Valentine Tapley	ORGANIZATION	's testamentary disposal of his beard , which had grown to the un - precedented length of twelve feet six inches .


Tapley	PERSON	, who was a
Missourian of Pike County	ORGANIZATION	, died a little more than a year ago , and his history is a curious one .

		Another and more famous Missourian ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, appears in Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's pages , his will being quoted in part , immediately following that of
Henry Clay	ORGANIZATION	and preceding that of
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		A full index is appended to this interesting collection of wills .

		Few books with a more genuine human appeal have been given to the world by bench or bar than this from the pen of the Lecturer on Wills in the
St. Louis University Institute of Law	ORGANIZATION	.

		tures of Dr .


Frederick Taber Cooper	PERSON	, now published under the caption , '' The Craftsman - ship of Writing '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The title phrase is to be taken broadly ; the book contains no chapter on the theory of the Short-story , nor does it profess to teach the novel in nine lessons .

		Poeta nascitur and Dr.
Cooper	PERSON	follows the usual practice in de - voting the initial chapter of his book to the neces - sity of inborn talent and its definition .

		One might criticize the value of his rather indefinite tests of vocation , but after all no literary aspirant is likely to be deterred in this way , nor indeed by anything short of a long series of rejected
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chapters on '' Self-Criticism '' and '' The Author 's Purpose '' bring us to the practical half of the volume , which takes up successively , apd with rather more origi - nality than one would expect in such hackneyed themes , `` The Technique of Form , '' `` The Gospel of Infinite Pains , '' `` The Question of Cleverness , '' '' Style , '' and '' The Technique of Translation '' with its value as a literary apprenticeship .

		The attitude of the author is professional rather than academic , and his numerous quotations for which an index is provided are interspersed with bits of his own literary experiences .

		Altogether the little volume is full of genial counsel ; and if the literally-minded reader finds it disappointing , he must remember his experience with previous works of this sort .

		Only Mr.
Hiram Maxim	PERSON	has succeeded in reducing the art of literature to the practical simplicity of the Rule of Three !

Migs Ellen Chase	PERSON	has gathered together , in three large volumes , a store of interest - ing information about political and social conditions in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	during the ten years before the battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	.

		The title is too comprehensive , for the author confines her attention almost ex - clusively to the developments in one
New England	LOCATION	state .

		The first volume traces the development of public opinion from the Stamp Act to
1774	DATE	; the second brings the account up to the fight on Lexing - ton Green ; and the third is devoted entirely to this first American conflict and the events immediately following .

		The author has made a fine historical scrap-book , drawing her material from practically all available manuscript and printed sources , con - temporary memoirs , diaries , broadsides , pamphlets , letters , and newspapers ; and has made her nar - rative serve principally as a connective .

		The docu - ments quoted or condensed represent both sides of the controversy , not only in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	but in
England	LOCATION	.

		The numerous illustrations are good , many being reproductions of contemporary prints and portraits .

		While the work can not properly be termed a history of the events described , it will nevertheless be worth much to the scholar as well as to the general reader for the sidelights it throws on the disturbed conditions of the time .

		The author aims to offer such in - struction as will enable the farmer to employ thorough - going business methods in all his operations .

		Sugges - tions for organization and cooperation among farmers are also given , and questions having to do with raising the standard of living on the farm are tentatively touched upon .

		A book of printed forms and model financial statements accompanies the text .

		It is a little late being thirty years after the orig - inal publication in its final form for the '' Ferdinand Lassalle '' of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	to appear in English , but it is now given us by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the form of publication which they have previously given to the author 's '' Main Currents '' and other works .

		It is probably the most interesting book about Lassalle ever written -LRB- excepting '' The Tragic Comedians '' -RRB- , and even at
this late day	TIME	, when
Lassalle	PERSON	's socialism seems very old-fashioned , and the great year of revolution belongs almost to ancient history , its accuracy , its sym - pathy , and its critical penetration make it well worth reading .

		Only works in English and Latin are included , as the neces - sary expert assistance for a more complete list was un - obtainable .

		Fiction and juvenile literature come at the end of the topical classification , and an alphabetical author index , exclusive of fiction , is added .

		A list of '' Publications of the Library now in Print , '' but not necessarily from Catholic pens , closes the book , which is admirably executed and makes a substantial octavo pamphlet of 243 pages , serviceably bound in stiff paper .

		Between these two there are sixteen others , by such authorities as Pro- fessors
Jackson	PERSON	,
Hirth	PERSON	, Page ,
Thomas	PERSON	, and
Trent	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lectures were prepared for the general public , but they make no unworthy concessions , and stand upon a high academic plane .

		NOTES .

		Mr.
H. C. Merwin	PERSON	has recently completed a life of
Bret Harte	PERSON	, and the work will be issued next
Autumn	DATE	by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
M. A. DeWolfe Howe	PERSON	is engaged upon a life of Bishop
Hare	PERSON	, apostle to the
Sioux	LOCATION	, which will be issued in the
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	by the
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Empresses of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, and a new
Life of Vasari	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Robert W. Garden	PERSON	,
A. R. I. B. A.	PERSON	, are announced for immediate publication by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	has revised and brought down to date her well-known book on
Boston	LOCATION	literary and social life entitled ''
Boston	LOCATION	Days , '' and the new edition has just been published in handsomely illustrated form by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Toward the end of the present month , the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish a new novel by Mr.
Morley Roberts	PERSON	, an English writer better known in
England	LOCATION	than in this country . ''

		Thorpe 's Way '' is a satire on middle-class social conventionalities and a jolly love story , of a style to invite comparison with Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		It is interesting to note that German readers are beginning to realize the genius of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Some of his novels have lately been translated into German , three booklets on him were published last year , and Dr.
Ernest Dick	PERSON	has just brought out a study of the Englishman , which is to be taken , he says , for a mere forerunner of an exhaustive critical work .

		He declares that Meredith '' is richer than all the others of his treasures there is no end '' ; and he adds , `` In times to come he will be spoken of in one breath with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and Tolstoy . ''

		The '' Kilmarnock '' Burns '' Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect , '' published in
1786	DATE	has been re - printed in type-facsimile at the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, and is about to be added to the ''
Oxford Library of Prose	ORGANIZATION	and Poetry . ''

		In this library other early editions of poems have been similarly revived , including the work of Gray ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and others .

		It is reported that Madame
Marguerite Audoux	PERSON	, the author of '' Marie-Claire , '' is engaged upon a long novel , which will give a picture of the lives of shop - girls and factory-girls in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		She has also in hand a shorter work called '' La Valserine . ''

		The scene is laid in the
Department of Jura	ORGANIZATION	, and the book deals with smuggling on the eastern frontier .

		The Putnams will soon publish a valuable contribu - tion to the history of the Mexican War in the collected letters of
Robert Anderson	PERSON	, then Captain 3rd Artillery ,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, written to his wife and family with almost daily regularity during the months of advance against the enemy .

		The book will bear the title '' An Artillery Officer in the Mexican War , '' and will contain a pre - fatory word by the author 's daughter ,
Eba Anderson Lawtou	ORGANIZATION	.

		The forthcoming ''
Swanston	PERSON	'' edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	's works , to which we referred in our last issue , will con - contain a considerable amount of hitherto unpublished material .

		There will be a general introduction by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; and all of the letters , as recently pub - lished in four volumes by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, will be included .

		Unlike the previous limited editions of
Stevenson	PERSON	, the ''
Swanston	PERSON	'' set is to be published at a very moderate price .

		`` The Book of Buried Treasure '' is the title of a volume by Mr.
Ralph D. Paine	PERSON	, which will be published at an early date .

		It gives an account of treasure lost or buried by pirates and others in the Spanish Main and other parts of the
New World	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Paine	PERSON	also describes some of the attempts made to recover treasure , the most successful being that of Sir
William Phipps	PERSON	, who raised
$ 15,000,000	MONEY	in gold and silver ingots from a pirate craft in the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		One of the most interesting and welcome announce - ments that have come to us this year is that of an exhaustive biography of
John Ruskin	PERSON	, to be written by his friend and editor , Mr.
E. T. Cook	PERSON	.

		For several years past Mr.
Cook	PERSON	has been going over all the avail - able material relating to
Ruskin	PERSON	, in connection with his editorship of the splendid Library Edition of the com - plete works , issued by Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	; and no one is so well qualified as he to prepare the definitive life of
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		We understand that the forthcoming work will be published in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The wide-spread and continually increasing popular interest in fine prints offers ample justification for such a publication as '' The Print-Collector 's Quarterly , '' the second number of which has just come to us from
Messrs. Frederick Keppel & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the well-known print dealers of
New York	LOCATION	.

		This
July	DATE	issue is largely de - voted to wood-engraving , containing articles on this subject by the two foremost American wood-engravers , Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Wolf	PERSON	.

		The work of these two men is discussed in an essay by Mrs.
Elisa	PERSON	- beth
Luther Gary	PERSON	; and there are also contributions
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 483 on `` The Printing of Wood - Engravings '' by Mr.
Theodore L. De Vinne	PERSON	, and `` The Advantages of Wood-Engraving for Magazine Illustration '' by Mr.
W. A. Bradley	PERSON	.

		All these articles are accompanied by numerous illustrations .

		The Autobiography of
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	, prepared during the last months of his life , will doubtless consti - tute one of the most interesting of next
Autumn	DATE	's pub - lications .

		Some of the chapters will appear serially in one of the popular magazines , and later the entire work will be issued in book form by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		In this connection we note the announcement of ''
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	A Man of the People , '' by Mr.
Carl Lorenz	PERSON	, to be published shortly by
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among forthcoming historical works of importance we note that Messrs. Constable of
London	LOCATION	are bringing out the long-promised work on the '' Royal Daughters of
England	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
H. Murray Lane	PERSON	, His Majesty 's
Chester Herald	ORGANIZATION	of Arms , the fruit of his labors for more than half a century .

		The unique opportunities the author has enjoyed of access not only to the great European libraries , but to a large number of private records hitherto unexplored , will doubtless contribute to make his two large quarto volumes a most valuable personal history of the royal and illustrious families of
Europe	LOCATION	, covering a period of nearly ten centuries .

		There has been a complete reorganization of the management of the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, and the former administrative heads are no longer connected with the company .

		Mr.
Lane	PERSON	has just sailed for
England	LOCATION	after having spent a month in this country looking after the affairs of the company affecting a reorganization .

		Mr.
Walter A. Johnson	PERSON	, formerly Manager of `` The International Studio , '' has been chosen to the Vice Presidency and Managing Director - ship of the company , and Mr.
J. Jefferson Jones	PERSON	, formerly with
J. B. Lippincott	PERSON	Company of
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , is to be the chief managing editor for the company .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's '' Ave !

		Salve !

		Vale ! ''

		is now complete , and we may expect its publication next
Autumn	DATE	.

		It is said that many of the leading Irishmen both in politics and literature Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, Mr.
George Russell	PERSON	,
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, Sir
Horace Plunkett	PERSON	, Dr.
Sigerson	PERSON	, Mr.
William O'Brien	PERSON	, Mr.
Tim Healy	PERSON	, and others figure in the volume .

		They appear without any attempt at disguise , though many of the incidents in which they play a part are imaginary .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is also collaborating with Mr.
S. L. Robinson	PERSON	in a dramatic version of his best-known novel , `` Esther Waters . ''

		The second group of ten volumes in Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	's ''
Home University Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' to be ready in
July	DATE	, will be made up of the following volumes : `` The Science of Wealth , '' by
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	; '' Health and Dis - ease , '' by
W. Leslie Mackenzie	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	; `` Introduction to Mathematics , '' by
A. X. Whitehead	PERSON	, D.Sc. ; `` The Animal World , '' by
F. W. Gamble	PERSON	, D.Sc. ; `` Evolu - tion , '' by
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, and
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	; '' Liberalism , '' by
L. T. Hobhouse	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	; '' The Opening Up of
Africa	LOCATION	, '' by
H. H. Johnston	PERSON	, D. Sc .

		; '' Medieval
Europe	LOCATION	, '' by
H. W. C. Davis	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	; '' Crime and Insanity , '' by
C. A. Mercier	PERSON	,
F. R.C. S.	PERSON	; `` Moham - medanism , '' by
D. S. Margoliouth	PERSON	,
M.A. Alexander H. R. Fraser	PERSON	, librarian of the
Cornell Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity College of Law , died
last month after eighteen years	DATE	of expert and devoted service at his post .

		His knowledge of the bibliography of the law was extraord - inary , and he had succeeded in building up the library under his charge from sixteen thousand to forty-two thou - sand volumes , making it second only to
Harvard	LOCATION	among the law-school libraries of the country .

		He seems to have had a passion for complete collections of all exist - ing editions of the standard law works , and was like a sleuth hound in the fatal certainty with which he would at last run down the object of his pursuit .

		But his in - terests were not confined to his specialty he was a wide and appreciative reader , and , in his intercourse with young men , stimulative of what was best in them as stu - dents , readers , and thinkers .

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town .

		It is the only complete edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works ever printed and published in his native town , and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart from any other existing or future edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		BROWNE 'S BOOKSTORE , 203
Michigan Blvd.	LOCATION	,
CHICAGO	LOCATION	THE DIAL UNQUESTIONABLY THE GREATEST BOOK IN YEARS MY LIFE * THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF
RICHARD WAGNER	PERSON	Written by one of the most striking personalities of modern times ; kept secret , for urgent reasons , during the twenty-eight years since the author 's death ; this great work is now to be published in
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	, and many other countries .

		THINK OF IT !


Wagner	PERSON	wrote this autobiography from memoranda that he had kept for thirty-five years ; a king transcribed part of it at his dictation ; some eminent literary critics who have seen the manuscript say that this is one of the most remarkable books of recent times , and will stand among the world 's most famous autobiographies .

		The way in which this remarkable autpbiography came to be written and kept secret for forty years is a matter of more than usual interes ^ .

		Between the years
1868	DATE	and
1873	DATE	Wagner compiled his memoirs from diaries and other memoranda which he had kept for thirty-five years .

		As these memoirs were extremely frank and discussed not only the affairs of the author , but the affairs and characteristics of prominent people of the time who were well known to the writer ,
Wagner	PERSON	took the utmost precautions to keep his work a secret .

		The book was set up by French compositors who did not understand German ; twelve copies were printed ; and the type was then distributed .

		Of these twelve copies , eight were entrusted to
Frau Cosima Wagner	PERSON	and four copies were distributed among the author 's nearest and dearest friends .

		The greatest care was exercised in the event of the death of any of these five people that the closely guarded memoirs should be turned over to one of the survivors .

		In this way the secret was kept so closely that although
Wagner	PERSON	died twenty -
eight years ago	DATE	, very few people , even in
Germany	LOCATION	, have known his Autobiography was in existence .

		Its publication means the release to the artistic and music-loving public of the civilized world of a book of the most intense interest .
