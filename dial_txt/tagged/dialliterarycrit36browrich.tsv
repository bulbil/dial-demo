		A DISTINGUISHED BOOK OF ESSAYS FIFTH EDITION The Gentle Reader By
SAMUEL McCHORD CROTHERS	PERSON	'' T ^ HE appearance of a new essayist of promise , '' says Life .

		^ `` is distinctly * a matter of congratulation .

		That manner of essay which is the crystallized essence of good soliloquy is far too rare and too little read .

		Dr.
Samuel M. Crothers	PERSON	's volume , The Gentle Reader , contains a dozen such essays .

		They are a tasty compound of humor , good humor , and a whimsical good sense often deeper than it seems . '' ''

		There is a fine flavor of intellectual good breeding about these papers , '' remarks The Outlook ; '' a pervading air of familiarity with the best intellectual society .

		They are full of clear characterization , of keen comment on art and life , of well-poised judgments . ''

		The
Chicago Tribune	ORGANIZATION	considers that '' it is a long time since so happy a wit came along the humdrum highway of new books .

		He tickles the fancy delicately , and fills one with laughter , not boisterous , exhausting laughter , but that percolating sort which indi - cates the
June	DATE	of the spirit . '' ''

		He illustrates , '' says the
New York Evening Post.	ORGANIZATION	, `` a very genial personal philosophy with no little humor . '' ''

		Bright , humorous , thoughtful , and thought-provoking reflections , these delightfully readable essays are not unworthy of a place beside the Auto - crat , '' in The Dial 's opinion . ''

		Through them all , '' remarks the
San Francisco Chronicle	LOCATION	, '' run subtle humor and lenient judgment of human foibles which amuse the reader and leave him in benevolent frame towards the human kind . ''

		The
Chicago Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	thinks that '' for genuine humor , graceful wit , and a style full of subtle allusiveness , there has been nothing published for years like these essays . ''

HERBERT SPENCER	PERSON	.


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	died at his borne in
Brighton	LOCATION	on the eighth of
December	DATE	, at the age of eighty-three -- Goethe 's age and Ten - nyson 's , within a few months .

		He was prob - ably the greatest Englishman to outlive the century wnich he helped to make illustrious ; he was , indeed , one of the greatest of the world 's thinkers , holding for his province a larger area of human thought than any other man of his time .

		His immense command of facts , and his power to deal with them in the philosophical spirit , made his figure more im - posing than that of
Bacon	LOCATION	, almost as imposing as that of Aristotle .

		Writing in our last issue of the Herder centenary , we spoke of the ideas of the great German who died one hundred years before
Spencer	PERSON	as having `` won such general accept - ance , and became so incorporated into the very fibre of our minds , that they seem to us com - monplaces of thought . ''

		We no longer read the writings , because their contents have be - come a part of our consciousness .

		Something similar will be said of Spencer a hundred years from now ; something not altogether dissimilar may be said of him at the present time , for in our day the world of thought moves on apace , and the assimilation of new ideas by the com - mon intelligence of the educated public is a far more rapid process than it was in the age of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even now people do not read
Spencer	PERSON	in a measure proportional to his influ - ence upon them , and as the years go by , his books will become less and less the resort of students , although the ministry of his thought will not be lessened in like degree .

		For it must be admitted that , although he made the philosophy of style the subject of one of his minor studies , his own writings are not marked by the sort of style that makes literature out of prose composition , and have slight power to charm .

		They are imposing by their qualities of closely-marshalled logic and massive force , but they are , for the most part , without the power to attract .

		They attain at times , and particularly when the closing points of some weighty argument are reached , a certain grave dignity that is both impressive and memorable , but their general tenor is uninspiring as to form .

		They are of a kind with the writings of Aristotle rather than of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, of
Kant	PERSON	rather than of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, of
Locke	PERSON	rather than of
Berkeley	LOCATION	.

		The bracketing of
Spencer	PERSON	's name with that of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	is justified by the striking similar - ity that exists between the methods and achieve - ments of the two men .

		Both ranged over a considerable number of subjects , and sought to take the whole , or nearly the whole , of knowl - edge for their province .

		Both made vast collections of facts in various fields of investi - gation , and based their conclusions upon the most thoroughgoing processes of induction .

		6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	> Both , having thus reached their conclusions in legitimate ways , proceeded to use them for the purposes of deductive application .

		Spencer was clearly a philosopher in the Aristotelian sense , but it is doubtful if we may call him a philosopher in the sense of
Berkeley	LOCATION	and
Kant	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		Just
twenty years ago	DATE	, we ventured to suggest in these pages the view that , despite the philosophical temper of his thought ,
Spencer	PERSON	was not the creator of a system of philosophy in the commonly accepted mean - ing of that term , and to that view we must still adhere .

		He attempted a far-reaching synthesis of knowledge , to be sure , but it stops just short of what have always been held to be the essen - tial problems of philosophy , the examination of the grounds of knowledge , and the ultimate reality which underlies this world of appear - ance .

		Spencer frankly eschewed the whole philosophical problem , in the stricter sense , by relegating these matters to the category of the unknowable at the very start , and refusing thereafter to concern himself with them .

		Those opening pages of the `` First Principles '' are so hopelessly inadequate to their theme , and occupy a position so circumscribed by limita - tions resulting from the author 's lack of ac - quaintance with philosophical thought and his unwillingness to march upon its central citadel , that they do not call for serious consideration .

		Having thus balked the whole question of ultimate reality , having deliberately restricted himself to the world of appearances as such ,
Spencer	PERSON	found himself on solid ground , and set himself the gigantic task of reducing to scientific order the phenomena of the physical universe , of the animate denizens of our sphere , and of man himself , in his threefold character as a thinking , social , and moral being .

		This is the scheme of the '' Synthetic Philosophy '' -- first principles , biology , psychology , soci - ology , and ethics -- ten volumes altogether , the product of half a century of unremitting intel - lectual effort , accomplished in the face of des - perate discouragements and seemingly insuper - able obstacles .

		A heroic task , done in the true heroic spirit , and signalizing by its successful issue the triumph of an indomitable purpose over physical frailty and public indifference .

		The dictum that '' nature makes no leaps '' had been floating about in the history of phi - losophy for many centuries , but it was not until the middle of the century just past that it was transformed into a working formula .

		For ages men had held it as a sort of pious opinion , and then -- such being the illogical nature of the species -- had gone on postu - lating the most surprising leaps in the develop - ment of the physical globe , in the succession of its plant and animal forms , and in the his - tory of the political and social institutions of mankind .

		Geological cataclysms , special crea - tions , and inexplicable revolutions in human thought and action had all been taken for granted for lack of insight into the underlying forces of progress , and upon that superficial and insecure basis a large part of the structure of human speculation had been reared .

		It is ^ the imperishable glory of Spencer that he , first of thinking men , scattered all these easy as - sumptions to the winds by the power of syn - thetic vision fortified by unassailable logic .

		His was the mind that first formulated the law of evolution , and asserted its equal validity in the material , intellectual , and moral spheres .

		This magnificent conception took possession of his mind at an early age ; he gave the rest of his life to its working out and its rigorous ^ application to all the major problems of thought -LRB- save only those metaphysical or transcen - dental problems which were deliberately ex - cluded from his purview -RRB- ; and so thoroughly did he accomplish his purpose that the term '' of his thought are now the common possession of all thinking men , and even the unthinking are so constrained by them that , if they read Spencer at all , they are apt to wonder that so much credit should be attached to him for having said things so obvious ; that he should ^ in the minds of any of the younger generation , lie under the reproach of a maker of platitudes , is , to students who view the history of thought in its historical perspective , the highest of all possible tributes to his achievement .

		The extensions of science in our own day are so vast as to prevent any one man from occupying completely more than one narrowly restricted field of knowledge .

		Even half a cen - tury ago , scientific investigation had become so broadened as to make Spencer 's programme one seemingly impossible of execution by a ^ single individual .

		And it is no doubt true that while he was working at the fundamental problems of physics , and biology , and psychol - ogy , there were in each of these fields many scholars of far minuter knowledge , and far wider acquaintance with details .

		Spencer made no first-hand studies of the earth 's crust , he made no naturalist 's voyages round the world in search of material , he organized no labora - tories of psychology .

		He dealt in the obser - vations of other men , and made few of his
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL own .

		But he had an incomparable power of marshalling facts , and of perceiving the unity underlying phenomena that were diverse in appearance , yet in his comprehensive survey clearly related .

		Even in the field of sociology , the science in which his work was most nearly of a pioneer character , and which he may fairly be said to have created , he gathered his facts from the reports of travellers and the books of historians , and classified them in his own study .

		In the domain of ethics alone he was practi - cally on even terms with his fellow-workers , for all the material necessary for a theory of morals are to be found in books , when the teachings of the books are supplemented by the lessons of such ordinary experience as comes to every one of us in the day 's work .

		Was Spencer handicapped by this second - hand relation to most of the facts with which he dealt ?

		Were his perceptions of things blunted because they came to him through the medium of other minds ?

		Did he suffer from being too much of a thinker and too little of an observer and experimentalist ?

		These are questions that once seemed to have a certain point , and are from time to time still raised .

		It used to be asserted by those who would detract from his fame that the spokesmen of biology held him in great repute as a psychol - ogist , and that the spokesmen of psychology thought highly of him as a writer on biology , but that both made reservations in the matter of his authority in their own respective sci - ences .

		This sort of comment , which is no longer heard as frequently as it once was , might easily be counterbalanced by an array of tributes , all the way from
Darwin	LOCATION	to Pro- fessor
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	, paid to Spencer by the most distinguished men of science for his contribu - tions to their own special fields of investiga - tion .

		But all such discussion seems rather futile , in view of the immense dignity which came to invest his closing years , and the almost universal acclaim given to the totality of his work as a thinker .

		Now that he is of those who '' sit with their peers above the talk , '' we may pay due reverence to his memory even if we allow that the very sciences to which he was devoted have advanced beyond the stage which is embodied in his books .

		Whatever the new facts that have been disclosed by the laboratories since the publication of the '' Bi - ology '' and the '' Psychology , '' and whatever new truths may be revealed by future investi - gation , the comprehensive law which was formulated by
Spencer	PERSON	will hold good alike of the thoughts of men and the process of the suns .

		That is a point of view of which mankind has assumed permanent occupation , and with the assumption a great mass of pseudo-scientific speculation has been swept forever into the lumber-room of the past .

		To have fixed this conception in the very fabric of all rational thought is alone sufficient to mark the influence of Spencer as one of the most profound in the history of modern phi - losophy .

		It is a conception that will long con - tinue to bear fruit , particularly in those fields of inquiry that are concerned with man as a social and political being , as a responsible moral agent , and as a creature swayed by re - ligious emotion .

		It is in these fields that his work will continue to have inspiration for the twentieth century , and will help to mould the sociology , the ethics , and the religion of the coming generations .

		The conception of society as an organism , the evolutionary conception of conduct , which at last seems to point the way to a reconciliation between the hedonistic and idealistic views so long in conflict , the sublime eon3eption of an infinite and eternal energy from which all things proceed , compared with which the religious notions of the age of fable are seen in their true character as imaginings of the childhood of the race , -- these are the ideas that the work of
Spencer	PERSON	has implanted in the consciousness of men , and that his suc - ce.ssors -- men of science , philosophical think - ers , and even poets -- will eventually elaborate into systems and shapes of which only the adumbrations are now perceived .

		And as this evolution of thought goes on , illustrating anew his own law of integration combined with dif - ferentiation , the far-reaching grasp of his con - structive intellect will become more and more apparent .

		If we were asked what particular aspect of Spencer 's social doctrine had the most impor - tant bearing upon the present needs of civili - zation we should point to that unremitting in - sistence upon individualism which characterized his work all the way from the '' Social Statics '' of
1850	DATE	to the `` Facts and Comments '' of over half a century later .

		His closing years were greatly disheartened by the ever-increasing ten - dency of our modern societies to depart from this saving doctrine ; and those who know even in outline what the history of civilization has been , and how hard the struggle to free individ - ual initiative from the trammels of tradition and social pressure , may well share in the dis - couragement of the philosopher .

		For it seems THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	^ to many of us that civilization is recklessly throwing away the most precious part of its birthright , and that it is harking backward to the regime of status from which it emerged into vital activity only after ages of stagnation .

		The rising tide of socialism is interfering with con - tract on every hand , and the multiplication of governmental functions is everywhere encroach - ing upon the rights of the individual citizen .

		How clearly Spencer perceived these dangers , and how strenuously he sought to meet them , is evidenced by the writings of his later years , and particularly by the weighty warnings of his essays on '' Man vs. the State . ''

		This part of his teaching is sadly discredited at the present time ; some day it will be discovered that this was the part best worth heeding .

		He prob - ably went too far in his protest against the supplanting of individual by social action , but a tendency to err in that direction would be less ominous to the interests of civilization than the opposite tendency which now offers such a menace to the future . ''

		Back to Kant '' has been of recent years a potent watchword among philosophers ; we look forward to the time when `` Back to Spencer '' will be the cry among men concerned with social and political science , when statesmen and reformers , disillu - sionized by many failures , will cease attempt - ing to make men wise and upright by external pressure , and will realize that the best gov - ernment is the one that confines itself to the restraining of evil impulses and the creating of an environment of equal opportunity for free individual action .

		When that time comes , the name of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	will be held in higher honor than ever before .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A FAMOUS JAPANESE NOVELIST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-


Japan	LOCATION	has recently lost one of its foremost literati in the person of Mr.
Ozaki	PERSON	, better known by his nom-de - plume of '' Koyo Sanjin . ''

		He shares with Professor Tsubouchi the honor of having introduced the modern style of novel-writing in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The older novels were written in ornate classical style , and were very difficult to understand .

		But the modern school of fiction-writers , following European models , make their characters speak in common colloquial . ''

		Koyo '' died of cancer of the stomach at the early age of 37 .

		He had spent three years in youth in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	, but could not graduate , because , '' his mind even then being filled with romautic ideas , '' he could not pass examinations in science !

		But it is stated that '' the unscientific answers that he did write astonished the faculty by their literary skill ! ''

		In addition to his proficiency as a novelist , he was also an adept in the composition of the seventeen - syllable ode known as haikwai .

		On his death-bed he composed the following lines , to which we append com - ments by the editor of the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' : ^ ^ Shinaba aki Ttuyu no hinu ma zo Omoshiroki . ''

		`` This vepselet is an admirable example of Japanese im - pressionist poetry .

		Freely rendered it reads , ' Let me die in autumn before the dew dries ' ; words which recall , though they do not express , the familiar idea of the dew-drop evan - escence of life in Buddhist eyes , and of the shining of night - pearls on the petals of the autumn flower , the morning glory , ' The dew-drop slips ioto the silent sea . ' ''

		Just before
Ozaki	PERSON	's death , he urged a group of hi '' disciples `` to cooperate loyally and strive to rise still higher in their profession . ''

		He also said : `` Had I seven lives to live , I would devote them all to litera - ture . ''

		TOTEM NAMES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Professor
Starr	PERSON	asks , in a review of my '' Social
Ori	PERSON	- gins '' -LRB- The Dial ,
November 1	DATE	-RRB- , `` are ` hide - scrapers ' and * dung-eaters ' really totem-names , used and recog - nized by the -LSB-
Sioux	LOCATION	-RSB- totem-members themselves ? ''

		Of course they are not totem-names ; totem-names do exist among the
Sioux	LOCATION	, but are yielding place , as I remark , to local names , such as '' High Village . ''

		The derisive sobriquets , '' hide-scrapers '' and so on , are no doubt '' recognized '' by the persons thus designated , but Pro- fessor
Starr	PERSON	has better opportunities than I of learning whether they are '' used '' by them .

		Probably not : the Eskimo -LRB- '' eaters of raw meat '' -RRB- speak of themselves as '' Innuit , '' '' the men . ''

		The animal names of village groups in
Europe	LOCATION	are also '' recognized '' by the people designated , and I have heard a person gleefully pro- claim himself a frog .

		But , in the case of genuine totem-names among savages , there is nothing neces - sarily derisive , there may even be compliment , in the animal names , which , like death , '' are not an evil , be - cause they are universal . ''

		My argument is that , in such circumstances , savages have become '' proud of the title , as the Living
Skeleton	PERSON	said ven they showed him . ''

		There is nothing contrary to human nature in this opinion .

		Great parties , as Whig and Tory , have proudly adopted sobriquets of the meanest and most derisive origin ; whereas animal names , in savage so - ciety , contain nothing necessarily derisive , and are notoriously the most common of personal names of in - dividuals .

		My lists of actual group-sobriquets , among the
Sioux	LOCATION	, in
Orkney	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	-LRB- I may add
Crete	LOCATION	and Guernsey -RRB- , are merely illustrative of the tendency to give and use group sobriquets .

		In '' the dark backward and abyss '' of the savage past , -- given savage ideas of the supernatural superiority of animals to man , -- such names , though originally sobriquets ^ might readily , in course of ages , be adopted by the groups to which they were applied .

		If this did occur , the rise of totemistic myths and rites was inevitable .

		Professor
Starr	PERSON	will note that the village sobriquets have a wider range than
England	LOCATION	, including , it seems possible , ancient Palestine ; and perhaps , when once attention is drawn to the subject , such sobriquets will be found to exist in
Europe	LOCATION	generally .

		The point has not , to my knowledge , been examined .

		The Sixties as Seen by
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	.

		* It is no feeling of idle curiosity that in - spires our interest in the accounts of a past time from one who has been acquainted with some of its leading men .

		So says Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	in closing his volume entitled '' Portraits of the Sixties , '' in which he pictures with graphic pen many of the illustrious characters he had the pleasure of knowing personally in that eventful decade .

		The great names we associate with the
England of 1860-70	ORGANIZATION	would make a long cata - logue .

		Two of the greatest of her novelists ,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, died within that period ;
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	were at their best ;
Swinburne	PERSON	was coming into notice ;
Ddnte Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	's poetical career be - gan ;
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Disraeli	PERSON	,
Cobden	PERSON	and Bright were prominent in the political world ; and
Darwin	PERSON	,
Tyndall	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and
Spencer	PERSON	commanded the attention of men of science .

		Events , too , of national and of international importance helped to render that decade a memorable one and to make the portraits of its chief men by so much the more worth pre - serving .

		A matter which at first might seem of small significance , but which is big with meaning to him to whom nothing human is alien , is amus - ingly touched upon by Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	in his introductory chapter . ''

		It is well for the early sixties that they had so mauy splendid claims to hi '' toiical recollection , but it may be said of them that if they had bequeathed no other memory to a curious and contemplative posterity , the reign of crinoline would still have secured for them an abiding-place in the records of human eccentricities .

		I may say without fear of contradiction , that no one who was not living at the time can form any adequate idea of the grotesque fffect produced on the outer aspects of social life by this article of feminine costume .

		... A whole new school of satirical humor was devoted in vain to the ridicule of crinoline .

		The boys in the street sang comic songs to make fun of it , but no street bellowings of contempt could incite the wearers of this most inconvenient and hideous article of dress to con - demn themselves to clinging draperies .

		Crinoline , too , created a new sort of calamity all its own .

		Every day 's papers gave us fresh accounts of what were called crin - oline accidents -- cases , that is to say , in which a woman was seriously burned or burned to death because of some flame of fire or candle catching her distended drapery at some unexpected moment .

		... A woman getting * Portraits of the Sixties .

		into or out of a carriage , an omnibus , or a train , making her way through a crowded room , or entering into the stalls of a theatre was a positive nuisance to all with whom she had to struggle for her passage . ''

		Still stronger terms might have been used to describe the influence of this monstrous fashion .

		Crossing the Channel , we find the church rev - enues of
France	LOCATION	falling off alarmingly because of the fewer chairs that could be let to hoop - skirted women , one such inflated worshipper filling the space formerly occupied by three of her sex .

		As a result , the charge per chair had to be raised .

		The author 's portraits of statesmen and ora - tors are especially good .

		He has a keen relish for able public speaking and debating , and his judgment is so discriminating that he enables the reader to see how each one of a group of great orators is preeminent in his kind .

		For
Cobden	PERSON	and Bright his admiration is enthu - siastic .

		An interesting speculation is indulged in regarding the result that might have followed
Cobden	PERSON	's acceptance of the place he rejected in
Palmerston	LOCATION	's cabinet about the time our civil war broke out .

		With his thorough knowledge of
America	LOCATION	and Americans , with his ardent ad - vocacy of negro freedom , and with the Queen 's sympathies on the side of the North , would he have been able to make head against
Palmer	PERSON	- ston 's pro-Southern policy and thus have averted the
Alabama	LOCATION	troubles ?

		Probably not , says our author ; yet it is not unreasonable to think it might have been .

		The portrait pre - sented of
John Bright	ORGANIZATION	is most attractive .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's admiration of him as an orator , as a statesman , and as a man , is unreserved .

		He held him as superior in oratory to
Gladstone	LOCATION	-- an opinion that once made Bright himself positively angry , so modest was the latter 's estimate of himself , and so hearty his admira - tion for
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	.

		A short passage from the book will place Bright before us in one phase at least of his pleasing personality .

		It also illustrates anew the old truth that humor is akin to love , that the genuine humorist is always a person of kind heart and of large charity to - ward his enemies . ''

		Bright was a master of genuine Saxon humor .

		Some of his unprepared replies to the interruptions of political opponents in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	were marvellous examples of this faculty , and are frequently quoted even now in speeches and in newspaper articles .

		But there was nothing whatever of levity in Bright 's humor , and his most effective satirical touches seemed as if they were intended rather to rouse into better judgment than to wound or offend the man at whom they were directed .

		I think the one defect which Bright could 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, not fully forgive in any man was want of sincerity .

		I have heard him again and again iu private conversation enter into the defence of some extreme political oppo - nent on the ground that the opponent , however mistaken , aggressive , and even unjust , was acting in accordance with his sincere convictions .

		I can remember many instances in which Bright strongly objected to certain criticisms appearing in the newspaper representing his own political creed , on the ground that they were not quite fair and would be likely to give pain . ''

		An incidental mention of the tariff question leads the author to declare that , as no `` subtlety of plausible argument will ever induce
England	LOCATION	to return to what used to be called the principle of divine right in government , '' so there is '' just as little reason to fear that any such argument can prevail upon her to make at this time of day a reactionary experiment in the way of protective tariffs . ''

		Let us hope he may not prove a false prophet .

		The author 's acquaintance with
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Carlyle	PERSON	, and numerous other men of letters , supplies him with a fund of enter - i ; aining reminiscence concerning books and writers .

		It was
Dickens	PERSON	's amazing versatility that most impressed him in contemplating the man , and he sets before us this quality iu a way that will impress even those that thought them - selves already acquainted with the great nov - elist .

		Strikingly in contrast with
Dickens	PERSON	's portrait is that of
Thackeray	PERSON	, of whom also Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	was a cordial admirer .

		In present - ing the physical man
Thackeray	PERSON	, the portrait - painter has somewhat blurred his picture by representing him on one page as having eyes that `` never gave out the penetrating flash-lights which
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	could turn upon those around him , '' and on another as having eyes that '' beamed with a penetrating light even through the spectacles . ''

		The charm of
Thackeray	PERSON	's public readings , or lectures , is thus recalled : ''
Thackeray	PERSON	had , indeed , none of the superbly dra - matic style of delivery which made
Dickens	PERSON	's readings and speeches so impressive .

		His voice was clear and penetrating and his articulation allowed no word to be lost upon his listeners , but he never seemed to be mak - ing any direct appeal to the emotion of the audience .

		No accompaniment of gesture set off his quiet intona - tion , and he seemed , indeed , to be talking rather at than to the crowd which hung upon his every word .

		... I observed on many occasions that the audience seemed to become possessed by a common dread lest anything , even an outburst of premature applause , should interrupt the discourse and cause a word to be lost .

		I noticed this especially in some of the more pathetic passages , as , for instance , in the closing sen - tences of the lecture on George the Third -- that mar - vellous description of the blind , deaf , and insane old king as he wandered through the halls of his palace and bewailed to himself the deplorable conditions of his closing days .

		The most studied dramatic effects of voice and action could not have given to those passages of the lecture a more complete and absorbing command over the feelings of the listening crowd .

		Every one appeared to hold his breath in fear that even a sound of admiration might disturb for an instant the calm flow of that thrilling discourse .

		... I have heard many great orators and lecturers in my time and in various countries , and I never made one of an audience which seemed to hang upon the words of the speaker more absolutely . ''

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's acquaintance with celeb - rities has been of the widest .

		Artists , actors , scholars , philanthropists , travellers -- anyone of marked individuality is a congenial subject for his pen .

		A striking contrast is that of Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	, as depicted before his mar - riage , and the same man after woman 's gentle influence had subdued and refined him .

		Here is
Burton	PERSON	before he had bent his neck to the conjugal yoke : '' He was quick in his movements , rapid in his talk , never wanted for a word or an argument , was impatient of differing opinion , and seemingly could not help mak - ing himself the dictator of any assembly in which he found himself a centre figure .

		His powers of descrip - tion were marvellous ; he could dash off picturesque phrases as easily as another man could utter common - places ; could tell any number of good stories without ever seeming to repeat himself ; could recite a poem or rattle off a song , could flash out jest after jest , some - times with bewildering meanings ; be was always per - fectly good-humored , and he was always indomitably dogmatic .

		If he thought you really worth arguing with on any question which especially concerned him , he would apply himself to the argument with as much earnestness as if some great issue depended on it , and with an air of sublime superiority which seemed to imply that he was keeping up the discussion , not because there could be any doubt as to the right side , but merely out of a kindly resolve to enlighten your ignorance whether you would or not . ''

		The
Burton	PERSON	of later days was '' kindly , consid - erate , patient of other men 's opinions , ready to put the best construction on other men 's mo - tives , unwilling to wound '' ; and this change was wrought by `` the sweet and gentle influ - ence of that woman whose very eyes told the love and devotion which she felt for him , and the tenderness with which she applied herself to bring out all that was best in him . ''

		Most excellent are the accounts of
Thorold Rogers	PERSON	and Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	.

		Our civil war being mentioned in connection with the latter 's hearty espousal of the cause of negro freedom , Mr ,
McCarthy	PERSON	, who was him - self emphatically on the side of the North in the great dispute , refers to the division it caused among his countrymen . ''

		The majority

		THE DIAL 11 of that class which we describe as society , '' he writes , '' took the side of the South , while the best intellects of
England	LOCATION	in politics , litera - ture , and science , and the whole mass of the English working population adhered to and advocated the cause of the North . ''

		Surely , he has here , in a moment of forgetfulness , given the '' best intellects '' more than due credit .

		Gladstone ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Martineau	PERSON	, to name no others , were of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sympathies .

		The list could doubtless be considerably extended .

		The author 's love of music and the drama prompts him to furnish many a pleasing por - trait from the stage .

		In describing that excel - lent comedian ,
Robert Keeley	PERSON	, he commends especially the thoroughly wholesome nature of his fun , and humorously adds : '' The most scru - pulous daughter might have safely taken her mother to enjoy any of
Keeley	PERSON	's performances , and the good lady might have laughed her fill over his looks and his utterances without any dread of a censorious world . ''

		Here , as else - where , the writer 's style is a delight to the reader , being easy , fluent , enlivened with hu - mor and warmed with kindliness , happy in its choice of the right word , and passing from topic to topic in easy transition and sufficiently rapid succession .

		One more quotation must be made to show the author 's command of descriptive epithet .

		Sir
Richard Bethell	PERSON	, afterward
Baron Westbury	PERSON	, made a name for himself in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	as a master of corrosive sarcasm .

		His peculiar style of parliamentary retort is thus described : ''
Bethell	PERSON	's way was to let his eyelids droop as if he were affected by a sudden access of shyness , just as he was about to pour out on some opponent in debate his most yitriolic sarcasm , and to deliver this sarcasm in tones of dulcet gentleness , as if he were paying a deli - cate compliment by which he hoped to endear himself further to its recipient .

		He had a clear , impressive voice , and could speak powerfully whenever he thought fit , but he was sure to adopt the cadences of bewitching blanduess whenever he seized on the chance of making his opponent an object for the ridicule of the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		... When
Bethell	PERSON	, with half-closed eyes , head mod - estly bent , and mild and gentle tones , poured gently out his phrases of vitriolic scorn , the listener felt that a new and cruel charm came in to make the contempt all the more withering to its object and more intensely amusing to the audience . ''

		The pictures that thus vividly appeal to the eye of reason are reinforced with abundant portraits addressed to the eye of sense , the whole making as entertaining a volume as one need ask for on a winter 's evening .

London	LOCATION	on
London	LOCATION	, * In the
summer of 1902	DATE	, Mr.

		What he saw , heard , and did , he has set forth in a volume of over three hundred pages , with numerous illustra - tions .

		The account he gives is a straight - forward one , and there is no reason why it should not be accepted at its face-value , -- the broad facts , indeed , being already too familiar to those who have lived in
London	LOCATION	.

		I had just finished reading the book , and was feeling very kindly toward its enthusiastic young author , when my eye fell on an adver - tisement of it -LRB- `` Science , ''

		... An account of the labor and life of the

		It tingles with all the vitality of his fiction , and is full of such vivid realism as is only possible from a man who knows
London	LOCATION	as Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	knows
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Putting aside the absurdity of comparing the author 's knowledge of
London	LOCATION	with Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's of
New York	LOCATION	, we can not feel otherwise than indignant at the manifest suggestion that the misery of the East End will afford such amuse - ment to those in more fortunate circumstances that its recital is equivalent to '' the best of his fiction . ''

		Sixteen years ago ,
William Morris	PERSON	fulminated against the well-to-do people who amused themselves by ^ ' sentimentalising the sordid lives of the miserable peasants of
Italy	LOCATION	and the starving proletarians of her towns , now that all the picturesqueness has departed from the poor devils of our own country-side , our own slums , '' -- but he did not know that even these last could be made a source of entertainment , given a clever showman .

		I am willing to believe -- indeed , I do be - lieve -- that the advertisement cited does Mr.
London	LOCATION	a great injustice .

		He can hardly be blamed for having produced a readable and interesting book , nor can he be expected to wish it other than a large circulation ; but if he is as sincere and as earnest a reformer as we judge him to be , he will doubtless be disap - pointed as he comes to realize the true character of its reception .

London	LOCATION	's experiences ; but it is worth while to quote his comparison of the English with the Alaskan Indians , since he knows both at first-hand , and the latter are recognized as among the least favored races of mankind . ''

		In
Alaska	LOCATION	, along the banks of the
Yukon River	LOCATION	, near its mouth , live the Innuit folk .

		They are a very primitive people , manifesting but mere glimmering adumbrations of that tremendous artifice , Civilization .

		Their capital amounts possibly to
$ 10	MONEY	per head .

		They hunt and fish for their food with bone-headed spears and arrows .

		They never suffer from lack of shelter .

		Their clothes , largely made from the skins of animals , are warm .

		They always have fuel for their fires , likewise timber for their houses , which they build partly under - ground , and in which they lie snugly during the periods of intense cold .

		In the
summer	DATE	they live in tents , open to every breeze , and cool .

		They are healthy -LSB- when they do not catch some disease of civilization , the author might have said -RSB- , and strong , and happy .

		Their one problem is food .

		They have their times of plenty and times of famine .

		In good times they feast ; in bad times they die of starvation .

		But starvation , as a chronic con - dition , present with a large number of them all the time , is a thing unknown .

		Further , they have no debts . ''

		In the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, on the rim of the
Western Ocean	LOCATION	, live the English folk .

		They are a consummately civilized people .

		Their capital amounts to at least
$ 1600	MONEY	per head .

		They gain their food , not by hunting and fishing , but by toil at colossal artifices .

		For the most part , they suffer from lack of shelter .

		The greater number of them are vilely housed , do not have enough fuel to keep them warm , and are insufBciently clothed .

		A constant number never have any bouses at all , and sleep shelterless under the stars .

		Many are to be found , winter and
summer	DATE	, shivering on the streets in their rags .

		They have good times and bad .

		In good times most of them manage to get enough to eat , in bad times they die of starvation .

		They are dying now , they were dying yesterday and
last year	DATE	, they will die tomorrow and next year , of starvation ; for they , unlike the Innuit , suffer from a chronic condition of starvation .

		There are 40,000,000 of the English folk , and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty , while a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation .

		Further , each babe that is born is born in debt to the $ um of
$ 110	MONEY	.

		This is because of an artifice called the National Debt '' -LRB- pp. 311-313 -RRB- .

		This is strongly put , but perhaps the worst part of it all is left unmentioned .

		The Innuit people are living , I suppose , nearly as well as their nature permits ; but the English are stunted and warped , so that what they become bears no resemblance to what they might have been .

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	discusses the rapid dete - rioration of the breed in the midst of the city , -- so rapid that the urban population would disappear in a few generations , were it not replenished from the rural districts .

		He does not , perhaps , sufficiently distinguish between the inferiority due to birth and that due to environment .

		It is a comforting doctrine to some , that the poor are so because of their natural inferiority .

		It need not be doubted that the two things often go together ; but it has been well shown that the children of the poor , removed to better surroundings , will ex - hibit undreamed of abilities .

		On page 309 of Mr.
London	LOCATION	's book is given proof of this ; for it appears that Dr.
Barnardo	PERSON	has picked up from the streets of
London	LOCATION	and sent abroad 13 340 boys , most of them to
Canada	LOCATION	, and not one in fifty has failed .

		That is to say , that the very breed and race which is complacently said to have dug its own grave in the
East End of Lon	LOCATION	- don is capable of great success , given reason - ably favorable circumstances .

		If it could be shown that the Abyss only swallowed up the worthless , even then we should deserve the utmost condemnation for our inhumanity in the manner of their destruction ; but when it appears that it is a great machine for the cutting-off of the English in the fulness of their strength -- this is `` race suicide '' indeed !

		Mr.
London	PERSON	does not despair of the English .

		As an American , he knows the blood too well to do that .

		But , says he , '' the political ma - chine known as the British Empire is running down . ''

		Just what he understands by this phrase is not wholly apparent .

		If he supposes that the things he describes are the result of any purely `` political '' conditions , the fact of similar things existing in every great civilized country , not excepting the
United States	LOCATION	, should convince him to the contrary .

		How - ever , in many places throughout the book he speaks distinctly and emphatically of the social injustice which is the real cause of the evil , -- and it is only fair to understand his use of the term political in this light , meaning , as the word properly means , the whole management of civilization .

		Whatever meaning the dreadful recital of English conditions may have for
England	LOCATION	, it has precisely the same meaning for
America	LOCATION	.

		Our author 's fair
State of California	LOCATION	has al - ready its
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and with the increase of '' prosperity '' resulting from transpacific commerce the western shores may yet become the scene of worse things than he has known .

		If it is to be otherwise , it must be because the people of the West , wiser in their generation , set themselves to prevent it .

		And it may be that the resistance offered to the extension of white slavery will bring about the freedom of those already in bondage ; for thus does history repeat itself .

		Yet upon second thought we see that this electric '' up to date '' mode of expres - sion covers a cosmic idea of vast magnitude and scientific directness ; and that this rapid sur - vey , this literary railroading toward the goal , presents after all a stately array of facts for the support of the truly Darwinian doctrine that '' man 's destiny must ultimately depend upon his flexibility . ''

		The question is whether this method is not too business-like to be altogether fair , too hasty to be safe .

		The vastness of the problem Mr.
Adams	PERSON	purposes to discuss in the `` New Empire , '' and the apparent waywardness of the hypothesis which he offers as its solution , seem at first sight too disproportionate .

		The problem set forth is the familiar puzzle , familiar from countless histories of civilization , why the seat of the world 's power and of empires has constantly moved from east to west , from south to north , until it has gone half-way around the globe and has lately established itself in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		In explanation of this , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	offers not merely the time-worn lullaby concerning the mysterious successive calls of God to the nations to bear the burden of wealth and civili - zation , or the newer and more substantiated one of the movement of trade , and accordingly of power , from one commercial centre to an - other , as the trade-routes change and competi - tors arise for the precious possession .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's special and pet theory goes further than these , and declares such change in the seat of empire to depend solely on nearness to or possession of an abundant supply of food and other necessaries , and also a sufficient supply of the useful metals for defense or for medium of exchange .

		These means of wealth exhausted , the centre of trade , of communica - tion and centralization , moves on to a more suitable location , lodges with another nation , settles within another sphere of labor .

		To say that this theory is ingenious is very *

		mild praise ; it has the character of true in - sight into the elemental causes of human activity .

		For what can be truer in its simple potency than the statement at the beginning of the book , often repeated but always equally impressive in its directness , that as self-pre - servation is the predominant instinct in man , 80 he must procure food by cunning or by violence ; that demand for food leads to inter - course , to trade , to war ; that intercourse of whatever kind always follows the easiest path , where transportation is cheapest ; in fine , that food and means of defense constitute man 's chief economic necessities upon which the de - velopment of power and civilization depends .

		But with the possession of wealth comes also the possibility of controlling the destiny of other nations , of grasping the world 's trade and dictating to the customer .

		This possibility , however , is based on the power of organization , on centralized energy and prevention of waste .

		Hence the importance , for doing business on a large scale , of combinations of capital and en - slavement of labor , such as the negotiatores of
Rome	LOCATION	and the trusts of to-day .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is modern enough to take into account this ele - ment of competition from the very start .

		Ac - cording to his idea , it was not merely present but omnipresent in the rise to preeminence of ancient Baktra and
Samarkand	LOCATION	no less than to-day , and regulated the world 's commerce in a manner a thousand times more intricate than the casual observer imagines .

		Not upon the sword , but in the last instance upon the power to underbid chance competitors in the world 's market , rests the opportunity of a country to rise to a commanding position and exercise control over other countries , even to the ex - tent of making them its dependencies .

		Hence , as the world is constituted , comes the rise of all world-empires , such as the Babylonian , the Assyrian ,
Grecian	LOCATION	, Roman ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
Greater Russia	LOCATION	.

		This last New Empire of the
United States	LOCATION	is due to economic supremacy rather than to political , to the presence of abundant supply , rapid and cheap exchange of commodities , and , last but not least , to a highly centralized mode of production which can serve all at the smallest expenditure .

		And this is the reason that Mr.
Adams	PERSON	thinks the trusts an economic necessity , without which
America	LOCATION	could not have secured her present commercial supremacy .

		The function of gov - ernment in this formation of imperial power is to ease the process , not to retard nor for any dogmatic reason hinder it .

		Government is 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, nothing but the tool to promote the welfare of the people ; hence if it proves obstructive to commercial enterprise and industrial expansion it may fatally injure the growth of power and thus the material success of the nation , and may itself perish in the struggle .

		Whether President
Roosevelt	PERSON	would be sufficiently con - vinced by this reasoning to abandon as futile his attempt at trust legislation , there is no way of telling ; but Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's '' warning voice '' might well make him hesitate .

		Evidently Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is altogether oblivious of such antiquated religious survivals as the notion of right and wrong in the wholesale destruction of small industries ; nor is the political shibboleth of individuals being free and equal of any account in his view of the onward march of economic conditions .

		He has stated once before that he does not believe in the influence of ideas upon the destiny of na - tions .

		They obey far more an instinct , and instead of being free agents are but subservient atoms in the whirl of energy .

		Hence Mr.
Adams	PERSON	wastes no time upon theological white - washing of the mighty or the cruel deeds of man .

		They were actuated by a force greater than their conscience or their civilization .

		`` Nature '' is the all - encompassing power which stands behind and plays fast and loose with all man 's petty rules , gives him his chance , or withdraws it if he is not ready to seize it .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	sees the evidence of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's in - tentions in the rise and fall of nations and of empires .

		He appears to us a pantheist of the school of Positivists , -- or should we simply call him a disciple of the doctrine of environment after the manner of Demoulins ?

		But however bold in his assertions , and free from the restrictions of moral and religious precepts , there is no need of quarrelling with Mr.
Adams	PERSON	because of his views .

		To have opinions , however startling , about life , or man , or Nature , is an author 's prerogative , and may serve him as a recommendation rather than otherwise .

		The thing one can quarrel with Mr.
Adams	PERSON	about is his method .

		The means which he sets forth more or less emphatically , as preferable for acquiring the true under - standing of history and accordingly of the meaning of man 's destiny , is frankly to aban - don the bewildering and wasteful German mode of ascertaining the truth by the study of detail , and instead to seek only for the large and plain lines of development .

		From these it is the stu - dent 's duty to discover and construe the uni - versal law which governs life and which is the only profitable thing for people to know .

		That this law is in itself an uncommonly hard and dreary thing , that it is constantly the same , and hence wearisome in its monotony , makes no difference .

		The profit of discovery is worth the effort , and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	experiences genuine joy and pride from it .

		When this law is dis - covered , the next thing of importance is to gather the facts which best illustrate the work - ing of the principle , to put them into their proper relation and let them speak for them - selves -- Mr.
Adams	PERSON	in this particular case remaining passive .

		But this passivity which he claims seems to be only a pleasant make - believe ; the very act of generalization which the author advocates as the correct method , and employs all through , seems to us to be eminently his own active way of discovering the particular principle he is after ; whereas the theories pro- mulgated seem decidedly the cause rather than the effect of the manner in which the facts have unfolded themselves to bis mind .

		No one goes to the work of a generalization of this kind without the idea he wishes corro - borated plainly in his mind .

		Hence the reader is almost of necessity forced to accuse the author of artfully trying to pass off as inno - cence what is only feigned indifference .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, indeed , in his preface and elsewhere , makes a great point of the necessity of general - ization as the only means by which logical connection can be found between isolated facts .

		He makes a desperate and even angry attack on research work as being futile because so largely done for its own sake .

		We are nothing loth to see the importance of synthesis brought to the fore in public discussion , after such long and ardent harangues about the unrivalled ad - vantages of analysis .

		But it may be permitted to say that of the two methods discussed by Mr.
Adams	PERSON	generalization is certainly the one which least insures sound training or keen his - torical judgment .

		Only the master of method , the ripened thinker , the thorough scholar , and scarcely even they , can generalize without foist - ing upon the world some half-truth or making their readers victims of their personal bias .

		Of course Mr.
Adams	PERSON	points to the necessity of reasoning on a scientific basis , from cause to effect , along the lines of physical and biological truths already accepted .

		But the habit of apply - ing scientific rules to philosophic facts is still so new , so little has been done to establish even approximately the true connection between the two , that almost any theory may be forwarded , generalization reign supreme , and no criterion
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 be found by which to test the soundness of the conclusions arrived at .

		The data of history , especially of the far past , are too pliant a mate - rial not to fit almost any doctrine .

		The ques - tion is only how to pick one 's examples and cover them with the necessary quantity of plau - sible commentary .

		The public is altogether too fond of generalizations that have the sem - blance of common-sense not to be indulged in the amplest way on every platform and for every purpose .

		In fact , unless extreme care is exercised we shall soon find ourselves in a maze of generalization from which only the axe of patient research -LRB- not for its own sake -RRB- can deliver us .

		Hence at the present juncture Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's passionate demand for general - ization sounds somewhat preposterous .

		Although the author in his book really lives up to his idea , as far as his idiosyncracies per - mit , and gives perhaps the soundest and best balanced treatment of history on a large plan that his method warrants , yet his advice con - cerning future study of history must be taken largely cum grano salis .

		However interesting and suggestive his own work , his method may easily lead to the blatant superficiality which is the horror of the conscientious student .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	himself perceives the danger to which his reasoning may expose both his book and the idea it represents , and he offers both , not as a finished theory , but as a hypothesis for medi - tation by the enlightened and thoughtful .

		But a full-fledged suggestion , when eloquently put , is often more influential in turning men 's thoughts than the accepted theory which is already somewhat brittle and worn .

		The rather uncompromising Positivism of our author is perhaps best shown in the state - ment on page 196 : '' Nature abhors the weak . ''

		To us it seems that Nature has good use for the weak no less than for the strong , and in her minute economy wastes no material , not even the apparently most contemptible .

		Indeed , we are inclined to state , with a well-known econ - omist , that without the weak the strong would not be ; the strong rest on the support of the weak , both are necessary , hence
Nature	ORGANIZATION	employs both .

		And pray what in the merciless order of `` Nature '' constitutes strength but a momentary advantage ?

		If the old scholastic subservience to certain pet phrases -LRB- of scientific color but speculative origin -RRB- could be eliminated from late philosophic literature , there would be more soundness and fewer fads .

		The survival of the fittest is a theorem almost done to death in all popular speculation , but what this mysterious fitness really stands for in the subtle household of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	still remains to be seen .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's book is unquestionably a very courageous and interesting attempt at solving the problem of transmission of energy in the world 's development from one centre of activity to another .

		It is suggestive of much keen obser - vation , incessant study , and logical combination of facts .

		It certainly presents a much more thorough cooperation of philosophic and scien - tific method than commonly prevails .

		But it nevertheless strongly suggests the same old necessity of careful study of detail , in order that if generalization on a large scale is hence - forth to be the order in American liberal education , the facts shall truly support the conclusion , and that synthesis in all its generous breadth shall be upheld in the basic particulars by a stout and reliable analysis .

		For
LiOVers of R. Zt	ORGANIZATION	.

		S. * There are certain of our literary passions -LRB- to borrow Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's phrase -RRB- that have in their composition a curious admixture of jeal - ousy .

		The Borrovians , for example , remain more than content that their author should be without honor in the form of popularizing ar - ticles in the literary journals ; and lovers of the
FitzGerald	PERSON	of the Letters do not welcome the uncountable pocket copies of the '' Rubaijat . ''

		Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	, the compiler of ''
Steven	PERSON	- soniana , '' is not likely , however , to find himself offending any such sentiment , for the most bookish among
Stevenson	PERSON	's admirers have never regretted his appeal to the unliterary reading public .

		Nor need the relevance of the book , which is announced as a '' miscellany of anecdote and criticism , inscribed to the lovers of the man and admirers of the artist
R. L. S.	PERSON	the world over , '' be questioned .

		That element in the Scottish character which complements the traditional reserve was sufficiently strong in
Stevenson	PERSON	to absolve the editor of any such volume from the charge of impertinence .

		We have cause for gratitude in the fact that
Stevenson	PERSON	never approached dangerously near the line crossed by so many of his literary com - patriots , from
Carlyle	PERSON	and the
Laird	PERSON	of
Auch	PERSON	- inleck to Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	and Mr.

		IS THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, mains true that his personality was '' a mar - ketable thing , '' to quote the phrase wrathfully uttered by
W. E. Henley	PERSON	in his memorable out - burst of two years ago ; and no publication which recognizes that aspect of the
Stevenson	PERSON	of literature and life is wholly without excuse for existence .

		The literary and critical merit of the com - pilation is decidedly uneven .

		It could hardly be otherwise ; since , as we are informed , the editor searched for his material in the '' for - gotten pages of English and American period - icals '' -LRB- and newspapers , it should be added -RRB- , as well as in '' books by writers of eminence not entirely concerned with
Stevenson	PERSON	. ''

		To the devout Mussulman , no scrap of paper that bears the sacred name of
Allah	LOCATION	is worthless .

		It was possibly a modified form of this rever - ential spirit which actuated Mr.
Hamraerton	PERSON	in pursuing his researches ; for not a great part of the rescued '' copy '' which makes up the first seven or eight chapters of the book has any value as a contribution to our knowledge of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		A description , by Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	, of
Stevenson	PERSON	as he appeared during his
California	LOCATION	days is worth quoting for the sake of comparison with a different esti - mate lately expressed . ''

		A man of the frailest physique , though most unac - countably tenacious of life ; a man whose pen was in - defatigable , whose brain was never at rest ; who , as far as I am able to judge , looked upon everything from a supremely intellectual point of view .

		... A man un - fleshly to the verge of emaciation , ... whose sympa - thies were literary and artistic ; whose intimacies were born and bred above the ears . ''

		In the recently published '' Faith of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	'' we find Mr.
John Kelraan	PERSON	emphasizing the close relation between the flesh and the spirit indicated in
Stevenson	PERSON	's expres - sion of his personality . ''

		At all times he is a spirit very deeply embodied in flesh , '' he says in a passage which '' The Athenaeum , '' in review - ing the book , praised for its penetration .

		`` In the flesh , as he depicts it , you constantly discern the spirit breaking through ; in the spirit , you seem still aware of the red tinge of flesh . ''

		Pro- fessor
Stoddard	PERSON	knew
Stevenson	PERSON	personally , Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	knows him only through his works ; and we have again the old contrast between the '' rosy-gilled athletico - aesthete '' whom Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	discovered in the
Stevenson	PERSON	of the essays , and the '' rickety and cloistered spectre ,
R. L. S.	PERSON	'' An interesting reminder of an amusingly incongruous episode in
Stevenson	PERSON	's career is the article reprinted from the '' Daily News '' of
London	LOCATION	, and containing extracts from the testimonials given by
Stevenson	PERSON	's friends in
1881	DATE	, at the time of his application for the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	chair of history .

		Sir
Leslie Ste	PERSON	- phen wrote : '' I know of no writer of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's standing of whose future career I entertain greater expectations '' ;
John Ad	PERSON	- dington
Symonds	PERSON	spoke of him as '' having the temperament of an artist who can not ac - quiesce in work that falls below his own stand - ard '' ; Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	described him as '' the most ingenious and refined writer of his genera - tion . ''

		Mr.
Robert Leighton	PERSON	's letter , quoted from `` The Academy '' of
March 3 , 1900	DATE	, recalls the fact that for several years after this incident of his candidature , the recognizable earnings of the most ingenious and refined writer of his generation continued to be chiefly limited to praise .

		Thirty shillings per column of twelve hundred words was the `` higher terms '' demanded
four years later	DATE	by the author of ''
Treasure Island	LOCATION	, '' when the serial publica - tion of '' Kidnapped '' was being arranged for .

		The El Dorado of the American magazine was as yet an undiscovered country , whose frontier had not been reached by the Amateur Emigrant .

		A paragraph in Mr.
Harold Vallings	PERSON	's '' Temple Bar '' essay , describing
Stevenson	PERSON	at
Davos	LOCATION	in
1881	DATE	, shows him in a more familiar light than that of a candidate for professorial duties . ''

		I have a most vivid recollection of a first view of him homeward bound from one of these before - breakfast -LSB- tobogganing -RSB- expeditions .

		He was dragging himself wearily along , towing a toboggan at his heals , his nar - row , hunched-up figure cut clear against the surpassing brilliance of the white Davosian world .

		With that pathetic half-broken figure making so dominant a note in one 's recollections , one marvels indeed at the forti - tude that made possible his later achievements .

		Through the closing weeks of that
winter	DATE	season it was my hap , through sheer good luck , fostered in some measure by a nascent enthusiasm for Art , to foregather pretty fre - quently with the courageous invalid , and only once do I remember his uttering a despondent word .

		* I ca n't work , ' he said to me one day . '

		Yet now that I 've fallen sick , I 've lost all my capacity for idleness . ' ''

		Most can raise the flower love of idleness to - day , but twenty years ago the lament quoted above could have been uttered by no one but the author of the '' Apology for Idlers . ''

		An
Auckland	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, newspaper fur - nishes a report of an interview with
Stevenson	PERSON	on the subject of the best course of study for young men with literary aspirations , in which he said : `` ' If a young man wishes to learn to write English , he should read everything .

Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, -- and , I suppose ,
Addison	PERSON	, though I never read him myself , -- and browse about in all the authors of those two centuries , they will get the finest course of literature there is .

		Those are the two extremes .

		What we have tried to do in this cen - tury is to find a middle-road between the two extremes , mostly and usually by being more slovenly .

		I have only one feather in my cap , and that is , I am not a sloven . ''

		Among contemporary writers ,
Stevenson	PERSON	found Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	best worth recommending to the colonial aspirants after a literary style .

		And the comment upon
Scott	PERSON	is characteristic . ''

		I would have your students read
Scott	PERSON	, -- but I wish you could put down my expression when I say this ; it would save a good deal of explanation .

		He was undoubtedly slovenly .

		He makes me long to box his ears -- God bless him I -- but to a luminous and striking degree he was free from the faults that a great many of us possess . ''

		In the chapter headed `` Miscellanea '' are quoted the dedications to the set of his works presented by

		Best of all is the amiably ironical comment upon his '' Travels with a Donkey '' : '' It blew , it rained , it thawed , it snowed , it thundered , -- Which was the Donkey ?

		I have often wondered . ''

		An article in the same division , on the inter - esting Trevor-Haddon collection of '' Letters to an Artist '' contains an error which the editor was probably not in a position to detect .

		Instead of there being only five copies of the book in existence , as stated in the review quoted , several hundred copies were printed by the American publisher , and the regret that '' only a favored few will ever have an oppor - tunity to read the letters in their entirety '' is consequently unwarranted .

		More than a dozen poems to
Stevenson	PERSON	are grouped in a separate chapter .

		Among the poets represented are Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Hichard Le Gallienne	PERSON	,
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	, Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, and Mr.

		Mr.

Gosse	PERSON	's beautiful dedication to his volume '' In Russet and Silver , '' -- '' To
Tusitala	LOCATION	in
Vailima	LOCATION	, '' -- which called forth the last and the saddest letter
Stevenson	PERSON	ever wrote , is printed at the beginning of the chapter on '' Island Days . ''

		It is a pity , unhappily familiar as we are with the reverse of the medal , that
Henley	PERSON	's exquisite lyric '' To
R. L. S.	PERSON	, '' with the unforgettable closing lines -- '' And we lie in the peace of the Great Release , As once in the grsss together , '' should not have been included among the me - morial poems .

		The editor 's labors in gathering his material for the chapters on ''
Stevenson	PERSON	the Man , '' ''
Stevenson	PERSON	the Artist , '' and ''
R. L. S.	PERSON	and His Contemporaries , '' were better rewarded than in the case of the biographical selections .

		Almost every contemporary writer of note , professional critic or not , is represented in the excerpts from critical articles .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's famous '' Pall Mall Gazette '' essay is quoted at great length .

		The unsigned article from `` Blackwood 's '' -LRB- pp. 252-3 -RRB- , -- from the pen of Professor
Millar	PERSON	, if internal evidence based on resemblance to the
Stevenson	PERSON	chapter in the '' Literary History of
Scotland	LOCATION	'' has any value , -- is the only other example of criticism not entirely sympathetic .

		Even those writers who emphasize their recognition of
Stevenson	PERSON	's limitations , as do Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	, do not maintain an unqualifiedly judicial attitude .

		And some of the novelist-critics , notably Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	and Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	- -- to whom many literary sins should be forgiven for the sake of the phrase '' His heart remembers how '' in the dedication to the '' Stickit Minister , '' -- have touched their highest point of sincerity of ex - pression in the essays called forth by the death of the fellow - worker whom they loved .

		A comparatively unfamiliar piece of serious crit - icism , represented by several extracts , is Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	's fine though somewhat dithy - rambic '' Study of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, '' which was printed , for private circulation , in
1895	DATE	.

		It concludes as follows : '' That
Stevenson	PERSON	could hold up his head and troll his careless ditties to the sun , after that Miserere of the soul , opens the mind like a flower to the possibilities of human regnancy .

		One man has looked hell in the face and stayed undaunted .

		We are the stronger for his pain ; his long conflict helps to make our calm .

		For very shame we dare not skulk nor loiter now ; and whither
Stevenson	PERSON	has gone , there do we , in our poor halting fashion , seek the way . ''

		Few readers , even though they be
Steven	PERSON	- sonians , will close this book without realizing anew the truth of the old charge that
Stevenson	PERSON	has been overpraised .

		Some of his critics have loved him so well that they have judged him ill .

		Yet it is not inevitable that the personal affec - tion which
Stevenson	PERSON	alone of the writers of our day knew how to inspire should result in loss of critical balance .

		It is possible to feel all the charm of his marvellous style , so imitative and yet so unique , and still be incredulous when Dr.Watson says , '' We judge that our master will go to the high table and sit down with
Virgil	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and

		And in the picturesquely erratic wan - derer we may be content to recognize some - thing less than a guide , and yet be blind to none of the beautiful spectacle of his life and death . -RSB-

		The substance is provided by the search for a treas - ure asserted by legend to be hidden beneath the foundations of the

		When the discoverer takes the heroine to see what he has unearthed , the '' lost water '' floods the passages through which they have entered , and threatens both with death from starvation .

		By working almost to the point of exhaustion , the hero breaks open a way of escape , and both lives are saved .

		This problem solved , the social problem must next be grappled with , for the situation has been a horribly compromising one in the eyes of the world , and the reputation of the heroine is sure to be lost if the fact ever becomes known .

		THE DIAL < m collect some new stories for the entertainment of his royal master , who had got tired of the old < ' tales of genii and magicians , of enchantments and spells , devils , dragons , and rocs . ''

		He has learned many strange things during his `` Western sojourn , and is confident that the Arabian potentate will be much impressed by their interest and novelty .

		But he thinks it wise to try them upon someone else as a preliminary , and invites his new acquaintance to play the part of sympathetic listener .

		This is the framework which serves to connect a most surprising series of adventures , recounted from night to night in the Clark Street shop .

		The stories show a fresh - ness of invention and a sense of humor much out of the common , and we could wish that there were many more of them .

		In the end , the emir becomes enamoured of an American maiden whom he has met at
Green Lake	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and in consequence renounces his country , his religion , and his leanings toward polygamy , joins the Presbyterian Church , and becomes united to the object of his affections .

		Through his generosity , young Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	is enabled to marry a young woman of
Englewood	LOCATION	upon whom his heart has long been set , and all ends happily , save for the Arabian potentate who thus loses his chance of being regaled with the choice in - ventions of our author .

		But this loss is our gain , and we can not be expected to have more than a shadowy sort of sympathy for this modern Shahriyar . ''

		When I Was Czar , '' by Mr.
Arthur W. March	PERSON	- mont , is a story and nothing else .

		It is , moreover , a highly sensational story , made up of nihilist plots , and court intrigues , and ambushes , and murders .

		The hero is an American of magnificent '' nerve , '' and the heroine is a wronged Russian princess whose champion and deliverer he becomes .

		Mr.
March	PERSON	- mont has in this case indulged himself in a more extravagant invention than heretofore , and has cast aside all pretence of tolerable diction .

		The book is one that has no conceivable relations with literature , yet we must admit that as a story its interest is fairly absorbing .

		The history of `` Sir
Henry Morgan	PERSON	, Buccaneer '' provides a stirring subject for the latest romance from the Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's prolific pen .

		The story is concerned with the final phase of Mor - gan 's life , when the death of Charles II .

		in
1685	DATE	loses him his governorship of
Jamaica	LOCATION	, and he goes buccaneering again .

		The author has taken great liberties with history , which are perhaps justified by his romantic ends .

		He gives us , for once , a tale that has a Spanish gentleman for its hero , and the change from the long succession of Spanish villains is both welcome and historically just .

		In the char - acter of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, we have a real pirate , a composite study from many documents , about whom there is no glamour save that of resourcefulness and reck - less daring .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's `` Hesper '' tells the story of a young woman , bred to the life of society in the narrow and ignoble sense , and profoundly dissatis - fied with it , yet seeing no way of escape from its deadening influences , until a happy chance sends her to the far West -- to the mountains and the mining-camp .

		The needs of a young brother , in delicate health , bring about this change of scene , and then begins for her a process of regeneration which is destined eventually to vitalize her interests and strengthen her character .

		At first she revolts against the bitter necessity of contact with the rude manners of the frontier , and of association with people whose breezy energy and primitive good temper are not sufficient to atone to her for their lack of what she has hitherto called cultivation .

		Meanwhile , the sickly younger brother -- a genuine and lovable boy , albeit more slangy than was really necessary to make him convincing -- takes to the new life like a duck to water , and the sister finds it impossible either to leave him or to take him home with her .

		The hero is introduced at an early stage in the story , being presented as the foreman of a ranch to begin with , and afterwards as an adventurer in the uncertain game of mining .

		He has upon him the shadow of a mysterious past , and is equipped in the present with most engaging qualities of courage , resolution , and downright manliness .

		As the story nears its climax , it becomes the record of a strike in the mining-camps , and the author holds his scales with judicial balance , recognizing the rights and the wrongs of both parties to the conflict .

		He also suc - ceeds in making the narrative one of breathless ex - citement , without resorting to sensational devices .

		The romantic outcome is what the reader has a right to expect , and he closes the book with the sense of having assisted in a dramatic spectacle , and at the same time of having witnessed a consistent de - velopment of character in the case of the heroine , at least , if not in that of the hero .

		We do not hes - itate to say that '' Hesper '' represents the best work that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has done ; in it he has sloughed off most of his earlier defects of thought and expres - sion ; his asperities have become softened , and his rawness has undergone a transformation into some - thing very like urbanity .

		And all this evolution has been accomplished without any diminution of the earnestness and the energy which first directed attention to him as a writer .

		It is a far cry from '' Main - Travelled Roads '' to the present voliAne , it seems almost too far to be accounted for by a mere matter of fifteen years . ''

		The Web , '' by Mr.
Frederick Trevor Hill	PERSON	, is a novel which takes us into the thick of American business life , the region in which unscrupulous cor - porate interests , legal chicanery , and corrupt poli - tics are inextricably interwoven .

		Such is '' the web '' which we are called upon to disentangle .

		A divorce suit and a murder provide interests of a more pri - vate nature .

		All this material is skilfully combined into a story that moves logically from point to point , and is told most successfully from the constructive point of view .

		It is intensely real , if not exactly inspiring , and the types of character presented are faithful studies from the life .

		Such fiction as this is the inevitable product of such a civilization as 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, we now boast ; it certainly fulfils the purpose of holding the mirror up to nature as it is here and now , and exhibiting the form and pressure of the time in which our lot is cast .

		In '' The Beaten Path '' by Mr.
Richard Lawrence Makin	PERSON	, a new writer whose further acquaintance we shall hope to make , a path of invention is chosen which , if not already '' beaten , '' is by way of becoming so .

		The story is of labor , capital , and politics , of fraudulent company promotion on the one hand , and of the rising tide of socialism on the other .

		Yet we fancy that the intention of the author in selecting bis title was rather to emphasize those private rela - tions between men and women which served fiction for a beaten path long before the political and social issues of the present day came into the foreground of our life .

		Be this as it may , Mr.
Makin	PERSON	has given us a novel of unusual strength and interest , informed by high ideals of public and private morality , yet by no means taking the form of a sermon explicitly formulated .

		As a study of political corruption , the scene of the novel is very fittingly placed in what is probably the most corrupt of the American Com - monwealths .

		The
Leverson Car Works	ORGANIZATION	, about which the story centres , are situated in one of the smaller cities of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and the formation of the '' trust '' of which they are the basis affords a con - venient opportunity for illuminating the methods of modern finance and politics alike .

		All this serious matter is skilfully interwoven with a skein of com - plex personal interests that excite the sympathies to an unusual degree , and lead up to a climax which , if a trifle melodramatic , supplies the arch with a most effective keystone .

		There are half a dozen or more studies of character drawn with singular firmness of hand , and offering types of strongly contrasted interest .

		Altogether , the performance is an exceed - ingly creditable one , and we congratulate the author upon a highly successful first book .

		Another first book is `` The Mills of Man , '' by Mr.
Philip Payne	PERSON	, a brother of Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	, who already has several good books to his credit .

		This work , like the one just mentioned , is steeped in actuality , and presents a picture of present-day politics which is almost brutal in its realism .

		It ■ combines a political struggle for the reelection of a Republican Senator from
Illinois	LOCATION	, as well as for the Slate ticket , with a corrupt scheme for obtaining franchise control over the public utilities of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		All the principal types of politician are represented , -- the city boss , the free silver demagogue , the foxy old-timer , and the wealthy aspirant for public honors .

		The reformer also appears , but only in unworthy caricature , and the mention of his activ - ities always provokes a sneer and leaves a disa - greeable impression .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's political figures are not portraits of existing individuals , but com - posites in which we recognize now one , now another , of the men who have recently played conspicuous parts in the politics of
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		A great deal of the book is jargon -- it could not deal truthfully with its subject were it written in pol - ished English -- but the author is capable at need of a dignified and impressive form of speech , as in the following passage , which illustrates the reflec - tions of a cultivated woman spectator upon a scene in the
State Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		The advocates of free silver have made a strong showing under the lead - ership of the Governor of
Illinois	LOCATION	, in whose figure one may easily recognize some , at least , of the char - acteristics of the late Mr.
Altgeld	PERSON	. ''

		Who were nobler , those men of riches in the cities , with their loose morals , their cynical contempts , their concep - tion of the world as an exchange to make profits in and as a mart to buy sensual luxuries in , or those country lawyers and unpolished yeomen , morally austere , who cherished in this corrupt day the eth - ical ideals of the high Anglo-Saxon race , and who were animated now by a vision of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	enthroned and human brotherhood become an institution ?

		Mrs.
Corlis	PERSON	poignantly suspected in her soul that the dream of these men might be the authentic modern vision of the weal of
Saint Augustine	ORGANIZATION	's
Civitas Dei	LOCATION	, the City of God . ''

		A few such gleams of idealism light up the pages of Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's book here and there , and give heart to the reader well - nigh disheartened by an exhibition of greedy and selfish motives that he must sadly recognize as only too truthful .

		Mr.
Barr	PERSON	's '' Over the Border '' is a straight - forward historical romance of the
Long Parliament	LOCATION	and the Civil War .

		Strafford and
Cromwell	PERSON	are the leading figures , as far as the history is concerned , and the romance is supplied by a daughter of the attainted
Earl	PERSON	and a venturesome Scottish free lance .

		The intrigues of
Charles	PERSON	with his Scottish allies are at the basis of the action , which relates mainly to a mission sent by the latter to the King at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	to obtain legal warrant for their partici - pation in his cause .

		Hero and heroine make the perilous journey in company , and the outcome is what the seasoned novel reader expects .

		Mr.
Barr	PERSON	does not slobber over his work , as is the wont of many writers of this sort of fiction , but gives us a clean-cut and logically-developed narrative , which economically adjusts the means to the ends , and exhibits trained craftmanship at every point .

		Mr.
Albert Lee	PERSON	, in writing `` The Baronet in Corduroy , '' has deserted the romantic times of Spanish rule in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	for the compara - tively prosaic life of
England	LOCATION	at the close of the seventeenth century .

		The
Stuart	PERSON	plot to invade
England	LOCATION	provides a certain element of romance to the narrative , which is otherwise concerned with the debtor 's prison , the gossip of the coffee-houses , and the follies of fashionable society .

		The baronet in corduroy is a reckless and dissipated noble who wastes his substance in gambling and debauchery , yet contrives by superficial qualities of grace and heroism to win the love of a pure-souled country maiden , the heiress to a large fortune .

		The mar - riage , the miseries that follow , and the subsequent release of the heroine from an abhorred union make up the substance of the story , which is of only
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DIAL %	PERCENT	t average qaality , and in no way particularly note - worthy .

		A novel that verges close upon history is pro- vided by Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	in his ''
Hetty Wesley	PERSON	. ''

		The heroine is the wayward sister of
John	PERSON	and
Charles Wesley	PERSON	, and the story of her life , as told largely in the family letters , is profoundly moving .

		As the story progresses , we become in - timately acquainted , not only with the unfortunate
Hetty	PERSON	, but also with all the other members of the remarkable household to which she belonged until driven forth for her sin by a stern parent .

		The author handles his theme with delicate sympathy , and is remarkably successful in imparting vitality to his scenes and characters . ''

		Barbe of
Grand Bayou	LOCATION	, '' by Mr ,
John Oxenham	PERSON	, is a story of the Breton coast .

		A young woman and her morose father live together in a lighthouse .

		The girl has grown up with no other human com - panionship , and promptly falls in love with a youth whom one day she happens to rescue from the boil - ing waters .

		Presently a rival appears , who con - trives to put the favored lover out of the way by hurling him into a cavern .

		Incidentally , the rival falls in himself , breaks most of his bones , and dies a lingering death .

		His victim , on the other hand , survives , lives for some weeks among the stalactites , eats rock-doves and their eggs , has a desperate fight with a devilfish , and finally attracts the attention of his friends by contriving a sort of torch which he thrusts through a cleft in his prison-walls .

		No sooner is he rescued than he is charged with the murder of his rival , who , it will be remembered , had disappeared on the same day with his victim .

		When finally acquitted through evidence unearthed by his friends , and by the aid of a brilliant Parisian advocate , he marries the girl , and the story ends .

		It is a thrilling sort of tale , related with the author 's keen sense of dramatic and picturesque effect , al - ready well-proved by his previous romances .

		The devil-fish episode is a little too obviously imitated from Hugo , but what is the poor novelist to do if all the good situations are debarred him by the fact of their having been used before ?

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	has strayed far from the wonted paths of his invention in the composition of `` Stella Fregelius . ''

		Here we have no fantastic rec - ord of adventures in strange lands , but a story of sim - ple English life , made romance by investment with an air of mysticism .

		The hero is a dreamer whose dreams receive practical embodiment in an invention called the aerophone , which is an application of
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	telegraphy to the telephone .

		Circumstances of a very natural and material sort lead him to marry a practical , domestic , sweet-tempered English girl , a creature of flesh and blood as distinctly as he is a creature of the spirit .

		The heroine proper is a maiden of Norse ancestry whose life he rescues from shipwreck -LRB- in a literal sense -RRB- .

		She is a somewhat uncanny person endowed with something in the nature of second sight .

		Becoming the real com - panion of his life -LRB- although in all purity -RRB- , she is tragically taken from him .

		He broods over her death , and seeks by force of concentrated will to summon her spirit back into his existence .

		In other words , he deliberately cultivates a morbid tendency , and the hallucination for which he yearns is finally vouchsafed him .

		Ideally , this means the accom - plishment of bis desire ; practically , it means that he becomes insane , and dies of an overwrought condition of cerebral excitement .

		The story is developed with considerable skill , but Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	does not know how to join his visions with his facts .

		Realism and Spiritualism stand side by side through - out the work but remain ever incongruous and dis - united .

		Perhaps we can best express our meaning in this criticism by saying that the author needs the peculiar power displayed by
Bulwer	PERSON	in `` Zmoni '' and '' A Strange Story , '' and unfortunately does not possess a whit thereof .

		He attempts what is to a writer of his temperament and matter-of-fact imagination the impossible , and thus fails to produce the desired effect .

		There is a strain of mysticism , mingled with much sensuous and dramatic material , in Mr.
Max Pem	PERSON	- berton 's '' Doctor Xivier . ''

		In one aspect , the writer seems to have emulated so cheap a model as Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's Doctor Nikola ; in another , the pro- totype of his fiction seems to have been the sort of romance which we view in '' The Prisoner of Z-nda '' and its numerous literary progeny .

		The malign purpose of Doctor
Xavier	PERSON	is to gain control of a petty Spanish principality on the Pyrennean border ; be seeks to accomplish this end through the medium of an innocent young woman upon whom he exerts a semi-hypnotic iiifluence , but who in the end escapes from his toils ' and thwarts his villainy .

		The story can not be taken seriously from any literary point of view .

		`` The Masterfolk , '' by Mr.
Haldane Mac Fall	PERSON	, is a depiction of Bohemian life in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	which seems at the start to have the makings of a capital story .

		Until we get half-way into the book , or thereabouts , there is variety of incident and ac - tion , and the unfolding of a pietty plot .

		Then the author seems to lose his grip , the narrative becomes disjointed and chaotic , and we get callow philosophy in the place of dramatic vigor .

		Toward the end , we fairly lose our way in a moi ass of incoherent ravinjjs , and the story vanishes clean out of sight .

		Mr.
MacFall	PERSON	should beware of fine writing ; he has in this instance suffered ignominious defeat for attempting it .

		He should aho cultivate compression , for he is garrulous beyond endurance .

		The title of the novel is a Nietzschian suggestion , we may add by way of explanation .

		We thought that Mr.
Benson	PERSON	had lived down the memory of '' Dodo . ''

		Certainly he has made a strenuous effort to do so , and he showed himself to be made of sterner stuff when he chose the war of Greek independence for the subject of two excep - tionally strong novels .

		But his latent novel , although far from being the mere froth of his first early indiscretion , shows him still beset by the temptation 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, to tarn oat sparkling epigrams , and to make the daily intercoarse of average mortals an exchange of labored repartee .

		It is called '' The Relentless City , '' and the reason thereof is a mystery .

		A part of the story is placed in
New York	LOCATION	, and that metrop - olis is pictured as an insatiate monster which makes exhausting demands upon the vitality of its denizens .

		If this be the explanation , the title is badly forced , but we can suggest no other .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's mental attitude toward things American is curious .

		He seems to have spent a few weeks among us , and to have seen the sort of things that are usually seen by the properly accredited visiting Englishman .

		He writes of society -LRB- in the vulgar sense -RRB- in
New York	LOCATION	and
Newport	LOCATION	, and depicts it as the pursuit of hollow joys by persons of unbounded wealth .

		Of American life , properly speaking , he seems to know absolutely nothing .

		But in dealing with the phases he has seen -LRB- or perhaps only imagined -RRB- , he exhibits a singular striving to be sympathetic , if patronizing , and then undoes all his efforts by indulgence in a kind of caricature more grotesque than was ever imagined by
Dickens	PERSON	.

		His English types bear , of course , some resemblance to life , although even that is marred by the sort of conventional literary glitter with which he feels bound to invest them .

		There is a good deal of writing in the book that is merely slovenly , and there is no constructive art worth speaking of .

		We can not congratulate Mr.
Benson	PERSON	upon his latest performance .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS . ''

		The Ambassadors '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is one of the longest , if not the very longest , novel Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has yet written .

		It is in something of his earlier manner , -- his earlier manner , that is , with all the keenness of analysis his superior age and all the subtlety of treat - ment his advancing art make possible .

		His style is less involved here than in other comparatively recent writings of his , yet it is far too intricate to permit the conscientious reader any of the delights of skipping with the possibility of understanding all that happens after the break .

		The two most engaging characters in the book are those of an elderly man who regards himself as a failure because he is merely the editor of a very minor magazine published through the money of an elderly widow who is interested in him , and of a gentle - woman courier whom he meets in
England	LOCATION	while on his way to
France	LOCATION	to extricate the son of the widow from an entanglement with an altogether enchanting French - woman .

		It will be seen that in such an argument Mr.
James	PERSON	has abundant room for the display of his finest qualities , and `` The Ambassadors '' will no doubt rank with bis more notable achievements .

		Once granting that no such character as Mr.
Alfred Henry Lewis	PERSON	has drawn for the title role in '' The Boss '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- could by any possibility talk or write in the language assigned him -- a shrewd mixture of the Tudor translator and the western cowboy , -- we must recog - nize in the story an interesting and accurate study of a modern human phenomenon , and one of the most artis - tically conceived and executed works of fiction among the number of similar books recently published .

		From a street boy the '' Boss '' becomes the arbiter of the destinies of the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	points out , far too clearly to admit of misunderstanding , that it is only through intimate alliance with the so-called '' best element '' in the community that the boss is per - mitted to thrive as a licensed land-pirate .

		The moral element of the tale , above and beyond the sordidness of the chief character and his associates in crime against the body politic , is to be found in the retribution which follows him through life , inflicted in the bosom of his family as an indirect result of bis iniquity , though never consciously accepted by him as such .

		Another political boss -- in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	this time -- figures in '' The Chasm '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a book written by Messrs.
Reginald Wright Kauffman	PERSON	and
Edward Childs Carpenter	PERSON	.

		Here , again , one has to make allow - ances , for the authors assume that a shrewd Irishman is foolish enough to think that an education begun in private American schools and rounded out at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and by continental travel will fit his only son to take up his political power and carry it from municipal bossism into international statesmanship .

		The failure of the experiment is as complete as it is inevitable ; though this is the engineering feat by which the chasm between the Irish boss and an American girl of mature age and excellent position is finally bridged .

		There is much movement in the story .

		The passing of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	steamboat as the dic - tator of transportation , and the coming into power of the railway , form the theme of '' Tennessee Todd '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , which Mr.
G. W. Ogdeu	PERSON	rightly describes in his sub-title as '' A Novel of the
Great River	LOCATION	. ''

		The potentate of the steamboat trade and the coming rail - way magnate are partners .

		Fair warning is given of the passing of the power of the river boat when the partnership is dissolved , but a losing fight is promptly begun and persisted in with all the eventual ferocity of a fixed idea .

		The son of the railway man and the daughter of the steamboat man fall in love ; and the young , uncontrolled , but essentially womanly young person who gives title to the book adds her mite to the other asperities of the situation to keep its course from running smooth .

		Mr.
Ogdeu	PERSON	records a chapter in na - tional development that is being rapidly forgotten , and does it acceptably and with forcefulness .

		While it is the catching of the masculine affections '' on the rebound '' that gives its name to Miss
Mary Moss	PERSON	's `` A Sequence in Hearts '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and the story is mainly interesting as a study of psychology in love among Philadelphians of the better class , there is a real comprehension of the problems presented by monopoly and labor that has more than ordinary perti - nence at this time , the scene of the conflicting interests being the anthracite fields of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		One of the characters in the book -- and the most engaging of its masculine figures -- is the owner of a mine , and he purposes settling his differences with his men without interference from his fellow-operators .

		The book can be read not only for the interest of its story , but also for the actual information it contains , evidently based as it is on first-hand knowledge .

		Four short stories make up Mrs.
Mary Hallock Foote	PERSON	's volume entitled '' A Touch of Sun , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , and all are done with that exact touch and cleverness which have so long been accredited to this acceptable writer .

		They are tales of life on the
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 Pacific side of the
Great Divide	LOCATION	, and interpret the vari - ance in character which gives
California	LOCATION	and its people so mnch of individuality among the states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of them , the story that lends its name to the volume , is admirably made up of a semi-tropical back - ground before which , in a semi-tropical atmosphere , is enacted a tale of love , with the young man a fine pro- duct of all that is best in the ordered life of New En - gland and the young woman all that is different on the other edge of the continent .

		The second story , ''
Pil	PERSON	- grims to Mecca , '' presents a similar contrast between East and
West	LOCATION	; and the two others , while not variants on the same theme , are filled with keen knowledge and analysis of character .

		From such work as this to Miss
Frances Parker	PERSON	's `` Marjie of the Lower Ranch '' -LRB-
C. M. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- implies the passing from polite and clever comedy to melodrama , pure and simple .

		Marjie is a nice young girl who is manifestly out of place on a western ranch among the mountains .

		Not far from her dwells an out - law , who is still guardian for the grown son of a friend who has gone to his reward .

		There are ensuing mys - teries , and the course of true love is sadly cluttered with many things .

		But it all comes right in the denouement .

		The book is interesting , though sensational .

		Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	's `` That Betty '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- is a pretty little story of a humbly circum - stanced
New England	LOCATION	girl , written with a more direct appeal to other young girls than to the general public .

		It has humor , pathos , self-sacrifice , and the eventual reward in its pages , and is genre work of the better sort , with a moral lesson not too obtrusively dragged into the main current of events .

		Such love as is shown here , like faith , will move mountains , and every diffi - culty of life , present , past , and to come , would disappear before it as the world 's one alcahest .

		The ravings of insanity fill most of the pages of Mr.
Horace Mann	PERSON	's `` ' The World-Destroyer '' -LRB-
Lucas	PERSON	-
Lincoln Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , its protagonist being a rich young man who has conceived himself to be the Emperor of the World .

		In the course of his more public demonstra - tion of his qualifications for the office he is confined in a mad-house , and there his book is supposed to be writ - ten .

		As the lucid intervals are in no way designated , it is impossible for the reader to separate fact from frenzy , and the book is none the less morbid because the young man is desperately in love .

		The charm of such a community -LRB- of course with due allowance for differences of time and country -RRB- as Gray depicted in his '' Elegy '' is in Mrs. .


Margaret Deland	PERSON	's '' Dr.
Lavendar	PERSON	's People '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , a book of char - acter sketches of real literary refinement .

		The kindly old clergyman , rector of the most human of parishes , acts as the deus ex machind for all the adversities which untoward circumstance and mortal frailty can inflict upon his parishioners , -- boys and girls , men and women .

		This interposition of the wise and kindly old man en - ables Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	to spiritualize every one of the six novelettes which make up the volume , and leaves it a book to be admired on every account .

		The old
Indiana	LOCATION	road that ended at
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	gives title to `` On the We-a Trail '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mrs.
Caroline Atwater Brown	PERSON	tells the tale of whites and Indians during the second war of indepen - dence , and tells it with a knowledge of and sympathy for the aborigines which gives it a place by itself .

		Their actual savagery is never minified ; but its causes , so often springing from rivalries among European nations and white Americans , are also detailed , and one is permitted to see that they are quite as human as their lighter skinned brethren .

		Especially well-drawn is the char - acter of the old French priest , while an Indian maiden preserves something of the Pocahontas tradition .

		The romantic atmosphere of the narrative is finely rendered , and the book one of sustained strength .

		Coming down a long generation to a scene geograph - ically proximate , Mr.
Charles Major	PERSON	has written '' A Forest Hearth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in the somewhat saccha - rine manner he has done so much to make his own .

		His people live in
Indiana	LOCATION	in the
third or fourth decade of the last century	DATE	, the real hero of the narrative being an excellent English gentleman , exiled by an unhappy love , who is the keeper of the general store in the little settlement .

		The pretty young girl who grows up under his fostering protection , which shields her against a mother with a hypertrophied sense of justice , is far more sensible than her youthful lover , who allows him - self to be shot at twice from behind by his deadly rival and mortal enemy .

		It is a book which will be read for its profusion of sentiment , and admired by the judicious for its almost forgotten background of semi - rustic life long ago .

		The curious reversal of process which turns a dra - matic work into a romance or a romantic history , the annals of literature pointing all in the other direction , is responsible for Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's '' The Proud Prince '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , a novel based on the play lately written for Mr.
E. H. Sothern	PERSON	.

		The practice of this phase of fictional art seems too slight to permit of results truly literary , and the story remains essentially dramatic .

		This latter effect is heightened by the use of reproduced photographs of the characters in the drama as illustrations for the book , thus emphasizing the dif - ferences between stage conventions and the art of the illustrator , just as the text serves to show the differ - ences between the convention of the play and of the romance .

		The product seems illegitimate in a real sense , much as if sculpture and painting had been com - bined in a single work to produce a given effect , one deriving directly from the other .

		The play was inter - esting , the book is readable yet not artistic .

		The Rev.
Joseph Hocking	PERSON	, like his brother the Rev.
Silas K. Hocking	PERSON	, has a mighty following in
Great Britain	LOCATION	as a writer of pious romance .

		His newest book , `` A Flame of Fire '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , is a story simple enough in both conception and execution .

		Its action takes place in the spacious times of Queen Elizabeth , just previous to the sailing of the
Great Armada	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three men set out from

Philip	LOCATION	himself .

		The corpus upon a wonder-working crucifix performs a miracle to save the English party , and , of course , it all comes right in the end .

		The short stories that make up the contents of Mr.
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	's '' Odd Craft '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are in some - thing of the author 's best manner , though less related to the sea and those who go down into it in ships than any of his former writings .

		He deals with the lower classes with the same inimitable humor that has char - acterized all of his work , his turn of thought and play of light fancy bringing a chuckle with almost every paragraph .

		Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	delights in situations almost picaresque , and the ne'er - do-well with a genius for 24 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The admirable illustra - tions of Mr.

		Miss
Una L. Silberrad	ORGANIZATION	has a touch in fiction per - fectly secure , and her new and strangely-named novel , ''`` Petronilla Herroven '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is additional proof of the fact .

		Her present theme , as in previous books , is unusual , and her characters original .

		A young girl of uncertain parentage and humble cir - cumstances is insulted by a wealthy and influential man who later procures her dismissal by her putative father 's mother .

		Self-contained from childhood ,
Petronilla	LOCATION	goes slowly on to her revenge until her utterly unscrupulous enemy decides upon her murder .

		Here a higher fate interposes , and with security comes love and abundant compensations for earlier unhappiness .

		The book is vividly written , yet with restraint , and is fairly fasci - nating in its developments .

		It leaves , moreover , a faith - ful impression of English village life , touching with fidelity upon several social grades in humbler life . ''

		Wanted -- A W ^ ife , By A. Bachelor '' -LRB-
D. V. Wien & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not exactly fiction , though the teller of the story is something of a hero .

		His desire is for a life - partner who shall be above everything else womanly .

		In nominating his ideal he tramples on the toes of most of the modern prejudices in favor of sexual equality , and contrives to hit at both mankind and womankind , as they flourish to-day , with fine impartiality . ''

		Men who are considered intelligent have not a single original thought , '' he remarks ; `` their conversation reproduces with more or less exactness the contents of their news - papers , and one is startled to see how many people who should know how to think for themselves have lost all initiative in the working of their mental apparatus . ''

		There are pages of this sort of thing ; but the book is dull , and it will be finished with the conclusion that , after all , `` A. Bachelor '' deserves as his reward that English ideal : a stupid wife .

		A cruise in the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	is the motive of Mr.
F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	's '' Shipmates in Sunshine '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which may be described as a book of travel fictionized by the introduction of four or five little romances among the writer 's fellow-passengers .

		There is thus an opportunity to describe the various islands of the
West Indies	LOCATION	where landings were made , with their people and habits and manners as seen in this casual way .

		The book must have been a pleasant one to write , and its equable tale of sunny days and balmy climes is certainly pleasant to read .

		In `` The Strife of the Sea '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
T. Jenkins Hains	PERSON	undertakes to do for the denizens of the sea and its shores what Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	has done for land animals and their human hunters and companions .

		He does it in practically the same manner , also , and seems to find it easy to assign a fairly human psychology to pelicans , penguins , and albatrosses on one side , and to rorquals , loggerhead turtles , sharks , albicore , and the giant rays or devil - fish on the other .

		Most of the stories deal with man - kind as well , but the essential thing is the sea bird , cetacean , or huge fish which he has described .

		As the inhabitants of the waters and their shores are predatory in the extreme , there is slaughter and to spare through - out the book , though lives are saved almost as often as they are lost .

		The book is striking , and in subject matter -- though not in treatment -- is sufficiently orig - inal .

Huxley Memorial Lee	ORGANIZATION	- S7C & .

		t '' ' ^ ^ ' Professor
Karl Pearson	PERSON	lays each stress on the importance of heredity as to discourage belief in the influence of environment and in the efficacy of individual exer - tion toward self-improvement .


Bishop Spalding	PERSON	, in his `` Glimpses of Truth '' -LRB- McCiurg -RRB- , preaches the contrary doctrine , holding that what man '' has produced within himself transcends , directs , and con - trols that which is born in him '' ; and consequently that '' in law , in medicine , and in the ministry , the greatest students , not the greatest talents , reach the summit . ''

		In literature , he adds , education and endless pains take the precedence of rude genius .

		This hopeful view , not only of the certainty of free - will , but of its infinite power of accomplishment , gives its helpful and inspiring character to the whole book .

		Yet the author seems to contradict himself when , emphasizing the vanity of things earthly , he says , * ' Mankind would be much what they are had their heroes never lived . ''

		Surely , he can not mean that the real heroes of progress and reform have left no mark on the race .

		Although he returns again and again to the all-importance of the inner life , of study and meditation , he counsels us to refrain from analyzing our knowledge and our faith .

		But he must admit that to a thoughtful man that is not knowledge which can not stand the test of analysis , and none but a reasoned faith can gain his acceptance .

		Indeed , only seven pages fur - ther on he writes : '' They who think are the only noblemen .

		They are the masters of all they know , have overcome what they understand . ''

		This little book , of about the size of the ''
Imitatio Christi	PERSON	, '' contains frequent reminders of
Thomas k Kempis	PERSON	, who might well have written such a sentence as this : '' If thou art censured , examine thy conscience ; if praised , believe it flattery '' ; or this : `` Thy vir - tues are all the more real the less thou thinkest of them ; but thy vices thou canst not study too assidu - ously . ''

		Now and then occurs an aphorism sug - gestive of Emerson . ''

		Consistency is a virtue of the unprogressive , '' recalls the '' hobgoblin of little minds . ''

		That our philosopher is no mere dreamer is proved by his daily life , as well as by his valued service on the late Anthracite Strike Commission ; and his book is all the better for this .

Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer	PERSON	in his volume en - titled ``
Robert Morris	PERSON	, Patriot and Financier '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The important part that
Morris	PERSON	played in the desperate conditions of our Revolu - tionary struggle is not generally appreciated ; to many his name is not even known .

		In several textbooks the reviewer finds no mention of his name , and in others no mention is made of the great part that he took in the emergencies of
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 the war .

		But one biography of
Morris	PERSON	has been previously written , the small volume by Professor
Sumner	PERSON	, who could not obtain the privilege of using
Morris	PERSON	's papers in the preparation of his book .

		These papers have now been purchased by the government , and Mr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	's book has been written mainly from these and from other materials found in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It is a thorough piece of work , and the story of
Morrid	ORGANIZATION	's life is told in an interesting way , though it is so full of dramatic contrast as well as of historical value that it could not be uninteresting in any hands .

		The publishers have given the work a most appropriate and taste - ful dress ; in paper , binding , illustrations , and index , it is thoroughly satisfactory .

		The life of
Robert Morris	PERSON	is typically American .

		A poor boy of ob - scure parentage , he showed himself apt in business , and became a merchant prince ; called to public life he was ready to accept the greatest responsi - bilities ; he was magnanimous and patriotic , giving himself and his wealth without stint to meet the necessities of the government ; the intimate friend of
Washington	LOCATION	, and entertaining with lavish hospi - tality all the distinguished people of the day , he finally lost all that he had through over-sanguine speculation and the booming of land companies , and spent more than three years in a debtor 's prison , from which he emerged a broken man of sixty-eight , dependent on his family and friends .

		The rare ability and complete devotion that he gave to the financial needs of his country in her darkest days , and his buoyant faith in her glorious future , entitle him to a place among great Americans .

		In an article in these columns , about bX ^ oman ' '' ^ ' ^ ^ ^ J ^ ^ rs ago , the question of `` Wo - man and the Essay '' was discussed , -- with the practical conclusion that we have no women essayists .

		Some of the arguments then used were that the essays of women , while often clever , are too frequently overweighted by voluminous read - ing ; that they are too labored and profound , or too flippant and diffuse ; that they lack personality and distinction of style , and are also lacking in humor and impartiality -- for women are apt to be self - conscious , and are by nature partisan .

		It is pleasant to find an absence of many of the above-mentioned faults , and the presence of qualities most to be desired in the light essay , in Mrs.
Isa Carrington Cabell	PERSON	's volume entitled `` The Thoughtless Thoughts of Carisabel '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Over a range of subjects as wide as from `` The New Man '' to '' How
Belinda	PERSON	Had the
Grippe	PERSON	, '' this woman essayist is always good-natured and always herself .

		There is no un - due self-consciousness or weak sentimentality even when she writes of such subjects as love and mar - riage ; and there is considerable humor and in - sight into human character when the subjects are '' Servants , '' '' Dinner Parties , '' and ''
Conversa	PERSON	- tion . ''

		In short , it is the sort of book which on its arrival in the house finds its fresh-cut leaves turned by each member of the household .

		A second or more critical reading often reveals defects in style and a lack of finish , but there is not a chapter in the collection which does not afford amusement and pay for the reading .

		The point of view -- `` the unfashionable and passS opmion of a survivor of a past age , '' -- applied to most of the modern sub - jects of the day , both fads and fancies , is a charm - ing combination consistently carried out .

		It is refreshing among the multitude thiZ ^ s ! ''

		of books devoted to
Japan	LOCATION	, to open one that has some sense of perspect - ive .

		In most of them the geisha is apt to occupy a place out of all proportions to the body social or politic .

		The author of '' A Handbook of Modern
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , Mr.
Ernest W. Clement	PERSON	, is by no means a novice , either in his knowledge of
Japan	LOCATION	or in the making of literature .

		At
Mito	ORGANIZATION	in the island empire , one of the old seats of feudal glory , knightly culture , and native learning , a decade and a half ago he spent several years not only as American teacher , but as an eager and patient investigator of Japanese history .

		He who knows well the transac - tions of the
Asiatic Society of Japan	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- out of which so many books on '' the sunny isles '' are made in
New York	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	-RRB- knows also Mr.
Clement	PERSON	's scholarship and literary industry .

		This handbook is a thesaurus of information concerning modem
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Fifty years ago , such enterprise would have cost Mr.
Clement	PERSON	imprisonment .

		Now , however , the Japanese government vies with the foreigner in making public all things -- except unbaked delica - cies of diplomacy and contemporaneous military information .

		So , out of his own treasures and the superb annual RSsumi Statistique of the Imperial Cabinet in
Tokio	LOCATION	, Mr.
Clement	PERSON	has given us a double portion .

		We have here a feast served by a chef of long experience ; everything has been proved by tasting , and all the ingredients and flavors known before being spread on the banquet table .

		The gen - eral excellence of the book extends to the proof - reading , and to the index also .

		Clear and abundant illustrations reinforce the text , and the bibliogra - phies at the end of the various chapters are the selection of a scholar at home among the very mixed crowd of books that represent and , for the most part , misrepresent
Japan	LOCATION	.

		In Mr.
Clement	PERSON	's bibliogra - phies , books of this latter class are conspicuous by their absence .

		It would be difficult to name an important theme left unnoticed in this handy volume .

		History , industry , modern politics , manners and customs , the new woman , literature , language , sesthetics , religions , Christian missions , -- all are discussed in a most pleasant and readable manner .

		The appendix is full of interesting items , -- as for instance , we are told that in the Peking campaign , the Japanese , as compared with French , German , Russian , and American soldiers , had the fewest sick and disabled by disease .

		This is the book for the hour when
Russia	LOCATION	looms and
Korea	LOCATION	shrivels , or for the year and decade when -- the map of
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	may be arranged .

		-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Poultney Bigelow	PERSON	con - tinues his story from
1815	DATE	to
1848	DATE	.

		As in the preceding volumes , the method is biographical , and the author 's journalistic training enables him to present , in his separate chapters , vivid pictures of individual characters or of single incidents .

		But the absence of any series of striking events , such as marked the Napoleonic wars , deprives the work of that chronological sequence that is essential in historical narrative .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	recognizes this defect in his work , but urges , in his preface , that any other method would have been '' dull beyond comparison . ''

		This statement is at least debat - able ; aTid certainly the selection of characters and grouping of events might have been such that the whole would not have made the impression of a hopeless jumble .

		As it is , the reader requires a clear outline of the salient facts in German history in order to understand , in many cases , what the author is driving at .

		A more objective treatment would also have been an improvement .

		We have , for example , a series of chapters on
Jahn	PERSON	.

		A single one might have told better every fact given , and have shown better the influence of the patriot 's life , had the atmosphere of personal impression not been attempted .

		Carlyle could flash the person - ality of Frederick the Great upon us in a series of vivid sketches , or
Freytag	PERSON	could group the history of a period about a single figure .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	lacks the genius of the former and the systematic method of the latter .

		Entertaining and pleasant his book doubtless is , but it neither adds to our available knowledge of the subject nor is a work that can , without reservation , be recommended to the general reader .

Fitzgerald Molloy	PERSON	's latest work , and politics in '' The
Sailor King	PERSON	,
William IV.	PERSON	, his the thirties .

		Q ^ urt and his Subjects '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , contains comparatively little about
William	PERSON	himself , and still less about his nautical proclivities .

		But this is well ; for who could endure the infliction of two octavo volumes on the sayings and doings of `` Silly Billy '' ?

		We have , instead , an abundant flow of entertaining but not always edifying chron - icle and gossip concerning the noted people of the time .

		That
Charles Greville	PERSON	's Journal is one of the author 's chief sources of information , will suffi - ciently indicate the character of the narrative .

		Byron 's and
Shelley	PERSON	's and the Honorable Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	's domestic tragedies are again rehearsed at length ;
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's early eccentricities and un - blushing audacities add something of piquancy to a twice-told tale ; and the whole is generously em - bellished with portraits and dignified with wide margins and clear type .

		The author 's way of ex - pressing himself sometimes provokes a smile .

		The ages of his characters are reckoned bv summers .


Browning	PERSON	is spoken of as being in
1836	DATE	a '' youth ■ of barely twenty summers , '' which leaves four sum - mers of his life unaccounted for .

		A fire , even the burning of old letters , is a '' holocaust . ''

		A false assertion of
Byron	PERSON	's is stigmatized as `` mendacious untruthfulness . ''

		No example of veracious untruth - fulness is given .

		Disraeli is '' a mighty important personage . ''

		We are told that
Mary Shelley	PERSON	gave birth to '' a delicate girl baby who survived about ten days , much to its parents ' grief . ''

		More regard for the little points of accuracy and the careful choice of words , even at the cost of a diminished output of his attractive volumes , is respectfully urged upon this popular writer .

		The second volume of ''
Appletons	PERSON	' c/nTrS : '' World Series '' maintains the prom - ise made in the volume on ''
Britain	LOCATION	and the British Seas '' some months ago .

		To Dr.
Joseph Partsch	PERSON	, Professor of Geography in the
University of Breslau	ORGANIZATION	, was assigned the labor of treating
Central Europe	LOCATION	.

		He prepared his work in German , in which language it is yet to appear in his native country .

		To adapt it to the needs of the series of essays descriptive of the great natural regions of the world , appearing under the editor - ship of Mr.
H. J. Mackinder	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, the
Oxford Geographer	ORGANIZATION	, it required not only translation for the benefit of English-speaking readers , but some cur - tailment as well .

		The work of author , translators , editor , and cartographers has been so admirably done that we have a volume replete with informa - tion , not only geographical , but ethnographical , historical , political , and economic , regarding the most important and one of the most populous re - gions in the world , including
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Netherlands	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and the Balkan-Danubian states .

		This region is of perennial interest because of its position and world - ' relation , and has been the scene of events unparal - leled in importance in the world 's history .

		The appearance of the present work is especially timely because of the ethnic conditions which are an im - portant element in the ever-recurring '' Eastern question . ''

		Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	's There are few persons to whom we selections from should be willing to entrust the edit -
Tennyson	PERSON	- 's poems , j ^ g ^ f Xennyson 's poems , but Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	may surely be reckoned among the competent few .

		His choice from '' The Poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' comprised in a neatly-bound volume of moderate size -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , is the first representative selection ever published , all previous abridgements having been confined to some special form of verse .

		The poems are arranged and classified so as to show the growth of the poet 's art from simple melody to the higher forms of poetical expression .

		The one hundred and thirty-six selections are chosen from all the fields of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's poetry except the dramas , which for obvious reasons could not well be repre - sented .

		The shorter pieces are given in their en - tirety , and the text is that of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's latest revision .

		The introduction furnishes a scholarly

		It outlines
Tennyson	PERSON	's life , discusses his place in the literature of the nineteenth century , his use of the sources from which he drew his material , his revision of his work , and the qualities of his poetry ; besides fully explaining Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	's system of classification as followed in this volume .

		The illustrations include two portraits of
Tennyson	PERSON	and two views of his homes .

		The frontispiece is from
Partridge	ORGANIZATION	's head of the poet in marble , which is owned by Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	.

		Such expressions as the '' razor contingent , '' for men , and the ''

		It is reasonable and fair , how - ever , to presume that had Mr.
Norris	PERSON	lived to revise these writings he might have given them the polish which they lack in their present form .

		They are full of wholesome truths and ideals for the young aspirant in literature , and their appeal for something more racial and more vigorous than has yet been produced in American literature is sounded with Mr.
Norris	PERSON	's usual courage and hopefulness .

		`` The Unit Books '' of Mr.
Howard Wilford Bell	PERSON	, which we mentioned a year or more ago in connection with the English inception of the enterprise , have now been transplanted to American soil , and the first issues of the series are at band .

		For thirty or

		One hundred titles are already announced , and suggestions for additional volumes are invited .


Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	's volume on
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, in the series of '' English Men of Letters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a piece of graceful and accomplished literary biography , dealing with its subject in a spirit of full sympathy , yet making no extravagant claims .

		Crabbe 's memoir by his son , some notes by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, a few letters , and the poet 's own manuscript sermons and commonplace books , constitute the material with which Mr.
Ainger	PERSON	has worked .

		Good taste and scholarship characterize the work throughout .

Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	to a place in this series was hardly to be disputed , and , so much being allowed , he could not have hoped for a more judicious biographer . ''

		This extensive anthol - ogy is provided with biographies , critical notes , and other apparatus , including a series of appendices , deal - ing with the Italian Academies , and giving synopses of the most important works in Italian literature .

		The work covers the entire period of Italian literary history , from the origins down to the writers of the present day , and constitutes a small library in itself .

		There is not an English word in the volume from the first page to the last .

		In this age of reprints ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	has not had his due share of attention until recently .

		The neglect m now more than atoned for by the nearly simultaneous appearance of three editions of his works .

		The edition published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in connection with Messrs. Dent of
London	LOCATION	, extends to twelve volumes , and is edited by Mr.
William Macdonald	PERSON	.

		The pictorial feature of this edition is one of its most marked characteristics .

		There are also abundant notes .

		These two editions may be regarded in a sense as rivals ; the third one be - fore us , published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is a mere reprint in a single volume , which is of pocket size , ^ although the use of thin paper extends its dimension * to over eight hundred pages .

		There are two editions , the '' First Folio '' and the '' Pembroke , '' The former we have mentioned on a previous occasion , , and need at present do no more than repeat the state - ment that it gives us a play to a volume , and supplies with each play an amount of critical and '' variorum ' ^ material which is ample for all the ordinary needs of the student .

		The text is absolutely that of

		This edition is coming out slowly , and `` The Comedie of Errors , '' just issued , is the third vol - ume thus far published .

		Meanwhile , the '' Pembroke '' ^ edition comes to us complete in twelve volumes .

		Here also we have the text of

		Each play has an introduction and a running glossary , and each volume has a portrait in photogra - vure , '' Pericles , '' of course , is reprinted from the first quarto of

		It is from the German edition that the present English version , by Mr.
William Leighton	PERSON	and
Miss Eliza Barrett	PERSON	, has been made .

		In printing the volume the publishers have endeavored to preserve something of the mediaeval flavor of the work .

		It is printed on hand-made paper , in '' black letter '' type with rubricated initials , and set in a double-columned page .

		Some forty engravings , redrawn from the old wood cuts which appeared in the original , serve as illustrations .

		The
Massachusetts Civil Service Reform Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	offers , free of all expense , pamphlets on civil service re - form to all high schools , normal schools , and colleges willing to make these pamphlets the subject of a lesson in their civics course .

		The titles of the pamphlets are '' The Merit System -- The Spoils System , '' by Mr.
Edward Cary	PERSON	, and `` The Merit System of Municipali - ties , '' by Mr.
Clinton Rogers Woodruff	PERSON	.

		As the circu - lation of this offer directly to the heads of colleges and schools must of necessity be gradual , the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	auxiliary takes pleasure in announcing to teachers and others interested in the subject that copies of the above pamphlets together with other of its publications may be obtained free on application to the Assistant Secretary , Miss
Marian C. Nichols	PERSON	, 55 Mount Vernon Street ,

P. Lummis	PERSON	, is beyond question or comparison the foremost magazine in the greater half of the ^ ^ ' l-wv ?

		I f
United States	LOCATION	.

		From its foundation nearly ten yeirs ago , its purpose has been something more than to tell in text and picture about the
Paniflc West	LOCATION	, -- its history , legend , romance , the beauty and grandeur of its scenery , its material , intellectual , and spiritual growth , -- though it has done this with truth and care .

		Nor has it even been satisfied to interpret the
Vital Spirit	ORGANIZATION	of the West -- to set forth its significance for this generation and for those to come -- though this too it has done so far as was possible .

		It has undertaken , be - sides , to lead in action , along some lines of much importance to the W ^ ^ stand to the Nation -- to point out the way , and then go first along it .

		Of these movements , organized , led , and spoken for bv OU P WEST , we m ^ y name
The Landmarks Club	ORGANIZATION	, which has done more than all other agencies combined to preserve the wonderful Old Missions ;
The Siquoya League	ORGANIZATION	, which has already accomplished much in the direction of its declared purpose , '' To
Mak	PERSON	' Better Ind-aif -- and RKit ` r-Trmled Ones '' ; and The Constructive Leas : ue , organized to help solve the mighty economic problems of Irrigation , Cooperation , and the like .

		Do not think this has male OUT WEST a '' heavy '' magazine , or dull reading .

		Tothecontrary , it is peculiarly tonic and stimulating ; and lovers of good short stories find several of the best in each number .

		Naturally , we think OUT WEST alone is full value , and to spare , for its subscription price --
$ 2.00	MONEY	a year .

		But we propose to double , at least , our subscription list durmg the present season Therefore we have arrang-id a notable premium offer to attract new subscribers .

		If we can not keep them , once we are acquainted , they are not our kind of subscribers .

		We have made lithotone engravings from hitherto unpublished portraits of sixteen of those living authors whose work counts for the most in
Western	LOCATION	literature .

		-LRB- The list is given below . -RRB-

		An artist 's proof-sheet from each of these , with autograph signature in fac-simile , will be sent , loose for framing , in a beautiful portfolio , to each new subscriber entered before
February 15 , 190-1	DATE	.

		i?he edition will be limited as nearly as possible to cover only this list of new subscribers , to whom it will be sent entirely free of cost .

		The price of any sets sold separately will be
$ 2.00	MONEY	each .

		The tendency of many people at the present day to claim the political rights of free citizens without assuming the corresponding moral obligations the author laments as an evil sign of the times .

		BRIEFER MENTION 53 NOTES 54 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 56 A PERVERTED TRUST .

		We quote the following words from a recent number of '' The Educational Review '' : '' Complaint is heard in
England	LOCATION	from South African educators that whatever may be the merits of the scheme adopted for the award of Rhodes scholarships , that scheme is in flat contradiction to the founder 's will and expressed intention .

		It is claimed that Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	had no wish to establish post-graduate courses at
Oxford	LOCATION	, but rather to bring students from other English-speaking countries under the influence of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	undergradu - ate system . ''

		We believe the stricture to be entirely just , and the case affords a fresh illustration of a tendency that is frequently met with among men who are charged with the responsibility of administrating trust funds devised for edu - cational or other purposes .

		Whether the in - tention of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	in founding his Oxford scholarships was wisely conceived is not now the question ; the intention itself was distinctly formulated , and his trustees have distinctly lent themselves to its perversion .

		While the terms of the will under which the Rhodes scholarships are instituted do not state in absolutely explicit words that the benefici - aries shall be boys just entering college , it is impossible to read the document attentively without perceiving that such was the wish of the testator .

		The colonial schools which are expressly named as having the right to send scholars are preparatory schools in the strict sense , and the entire tenor of the will makes it evident that the writer had schoolboys in mind rather than university students midway in their career .

		In proof of this assertion we need do no more than quote the following words : '' I direct that in the election of a stu - dent to a scholarship regard shall be had to ... his exhibition during school days of moral force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates . ''

		The sort of Oxford student whom
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	had in mind was clearly the English public school boy of seventeen or `` eighteen and not the student having several years of college life behind him , the impressionable youth and not the man of mature ideals .

		As a preliminary to their administration of the Rhodes foundation , the trustees of the will appointed Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	, the president of a
Cana	LOCATION	- dian college , to make a careful study of edu - cational conditions in the colonies and in
America	LOCATION	, and report a detailed plan of pro- cedure .

		This report was duly made , and as a consequence thereof , the trustees have published a '' memorandum '' for American educators , set - ting forth the details of the plan which they have adopted .

		The essential feature of this '' memorandum '' is found in the following sections : '' It has been decided that all scholars shall have reached at least the end of their Sophomore or second year work at some recognized degree-granting univer - sity or college of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Scholars must be unmarried , must be citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, and must be between nineteen and twenty-five years of age . ''

		Under these conditions it is fair to assume 36 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, that the successful candidates will be university graduates , or men not far from graduation , and that their average age will be nearer the maxi - mum than the minimum limit here fixed .

		Thus the purpose of the testator will be completely thwarted , and his estate be put to a use abso - lutely unwarranted by the terms of his will .

		It is not difficult to understand how this result has been brought to pass .

		Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	, himself a college president , travelled through the
United States	ORGANIZATION	consulting college presidents right and left , and got from them the advice that was to be expected .

		Obviously , this was too good a thing to be given up ; here was an educational prize of an unprecedented value , and no mere scruples based upon the wishes of the testator could weigh for much in compari - son with the importance of annexing such an opportunity to the sphere of university influ - ence .

		With practical unanimity these coun - sellors declared that it would never do to bestow the Khodes scholarship upon boys just out of school , that the benefits of the foundation would be far better appreciated by men of university training .

		Incidentally , the importance of every higher institution in the country would be en - hanced by its being able to hold out to its students the prospect of a possible Rhodes ap - pointment .

		It is not the point to insist that these considerations are reasonable ; it may be that they are .

		The point is that they set at naught the intentions of the founder , and use his bequest for a purpose totally different from that designated in his will .

		The real reason for the decision to send university students , and even university gradu - ates , to
Oxford	LOCATION	as the beneficiaries of the
Rhodes	PERSON	fund has been made sufficiently evident by the foregoing statements .

		The ostensible reason will doubtless be found in the plea that our American public school and academy graduates are not as well prepared for university work as are the boys sent from
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and
Harrow	LOCATION	.

		This is undoubtedly true , for the reason that our schools do not restrict their work almost exclusively , as the English schools do , to pre - paration in mathematics and the classics .

		The average American sohool graduate would find the '' responsions '' test , with its requirements of prose composition and advanced reading , beyond his powers .

		But the force of the ob - jection vanishes clean out of sight when we consider that the question is not of sending students to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in large numbers , but of finding one picked student every year or two in each State who is equal to the test .

		Now there is not the slightest doubt that each of the
United States	LOCATION	could provide annually one or more students fully equipped to pass `` re - sponsions , '' students quite the equal of the average product of an English public school .

		This objection disposed of , we fail to see any other that might reasonably be urged in de - fence of the plan now formulated .

		If that plan be persisted in , the wishes of the testator will be thwarted in their most vital aspect .

		The plan as now made public throws the whole weight of administration into the hands of our universities .

		Each
State	ORGANIZATION	has a com - mittee for the selection of candidates , and in each case the chairman of that committee is the president of some university .

		The ma - chinery is now complete , and within a few weeks the process of selecting Rhodes scholars '' between nineteen and twenty-five years of age '' will be in active operation .

		We take no particular pleasure in recalling the fact that this perversion of the trust was foreseen by us , and the danger clearly pointed out , when we commented upon '' The Rhodes Benefaction '' a year ago last
May	DATE	.

		We spoke then of the like - lihood that the methods decided upon would be determined by our '' educational moguls , '' and our argument had for its most important conclusion '' the simple one that college and university interests should not have the pre - dominant voice in the administrative organiza - tion , '' but that '' the men who stand officially for the larger educational systems of States and cities , together with the men who stand for the secondary educational interest most directly affected by the Rhodes endowment , should prove the main reliance for its efficient administration . ''

		That view of the matter has been , as we feared it would be , completely ignored by those who are responsible for the administration of the fund , and we have no idea that they will now reconsider their decision .

		But we have felt it our duty to make the present protest , and its seriousness will be better understood after the lapse of another two years , when a hundred Rhodes scholars from this country will be living in
Oxford	LOCATION	, scattered among the many colleges , it is true , yet forming a class by themselves , several years older than their En - glish undergraduate associates , pursuing more advanced studies , and missing almost com - pletely the community of fellowship and the sympathy of social interest that it was the man - ifest desire of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	to create and to stimulate .

		THE DIAL 87 A POLEMIC O N CO D-FISHERIES .

		The cod-fishery is the principal business of the little Basque islands of
St. Pierre	LOCATION	and
Miquelon	LOCATION	; and since the French government offers a bounty upon all the product of the fishery which is sold out of
France	LOCATION	, the fishermen of these islands have an advantage over the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	fishermen which gives rise to many disputes and animosities .

		I was repeatedly told at St.
Pierre	PERSON	that the people who lived on the adjacent coasts of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	were pirates ; that they would not aid the French fisher - men , even in distress ; and that whenever a fishing vessel was wrecked on their shores , everything was stolen .

		The cry of '' Per/w ^ e Albion '' finds its echoes among the fogs of the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	banks ; and there are controversial writings , elaborate and pas - sionate , over the wrongs committed in these distant waters by the
Saxon	PERSON	upon the
Gaul	LOCATION	.

		I have before me a large octavo volume , with tables , maps , and illustrations , setting forth the grievances of the French fishermen .

		It is entitled , '' The French at
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, and on the Shores of
North America	LOCATION	.

		The
Great Cod Fishery of New	ORGANIZATION	- foundland , since the Discovery of the New World by the Basques in the
14th Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Adolf Bellet	PERSON	. ''

		* Although written as late as
1902	DATE	, it sounds like a controversial writing of the Middle Ages .

		It opens with a stately exordium celebrating the glories of the fishing industry ever since the creation of man .

		The first chapter is therefore entitled `` As Old as the World . ''

		Then the author descends from gen - eralities to specialties ; from the world at large to
France	LOCATION	; from fishing as a whole to cod-fishing in particular ; and he declares that '' If
France	LOCATION	is not the first country in the world where cod - fishing has been raised to the state of a national industry , she is at any rate in the first rank of maritime nations which are devoted to it , and notwithstanding all her political storms , notwithstanding the dark days of mourning through which she has passed , the disasters she has undergone , and which , on repeated occasions have ruined ' from turret to foundation stone ' both her national marine and the immense colonial empires she has founded , this industry , still flourishing after more than five centuries , has been perpetuated across the ages , and yet remains as active as on the day of its birth .

		It is precisely this extraordinary vitality , which nothing has yet been able to reach , that exasperates and enrages our foreign competitors , and especially the English . ''

		This patriotic Frenchman next throws a new flood of light upon the question of the discovery of
America	LOCATION	.

		It seems that the reputations of
Colum	PERSON	- bus and
Leif Ericsson	PERSON	are mideserved , since the real discoverers of
America	LOCATION	were the Basques !

		M. Bellet tells us that while the expedition by the
Northman	PERSON	was soon forgotten , it was not the same with the French Basques .

		He says : '' It is to this first landing ef the whale fishermen of
Cape Breton	LOCATION	, on the shores of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, that we should trace the true discovery of the new world , and the establishment of the first route really commercial between
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	I Unfortunately it is impossible to give a fixed date to this historical event .

		What we can affirm is , that it pre - ceded by a century and a half the first expedition of
Colum	PERSON	- * Published in
Paris	LOCATION	by
A. Challamel	PERSON	,
1902	DATE	.

		bus ; which , besides , was only organized by the Genoese navi - gator , upon the information given by other Basques , whom the wind had driven upon the Antilles about the year
1480	DATE	. ''

		And here
M. Bellet	PERSON	tells of a Basque pilot , who , after twenty-nine days of storm , found an island without a name , which it is believed must have been
San Domingo	LOCATION	!

		Out of his crew of seventeen men , only five got back to
Terceira	LOCATION	-LRB- one of the
Azores	LOCATION	-RRB- ; but one of these was the pilot , who took up his lodging in the house of
Columbus	LOCATION	, who was then making navigation charts , and it was upon this pilot 's story that
Columbus	LOCATION	formed the design of discovering
America	LOCATION	!

		This anecdote -LRB- related by one
M. Fournier	PERSON	, '' whose learning is beyond ques - tion '' -RRB- must greatly weaken the aureole of glory and of genius of the Genoese sailor , `` which an unreason - able enthusiasm ... had consecrated as the great discoverer of continents , since
Columbus	LOCATION	did not himself discover the route of the Antilles , but merely followed a track which had been pointed out to him . ''

		It would seem that a series of monuments to the Basque fishermen is now in order .

		But the great object of the book is to justify the exclusive rights of
France	LOCATION	to what is known as the French Shore of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, comprising the Western and part of the Northeastern coast .

		The author , after claiming for his country in the past a vast colony , extending from
Baflfin	LOCATION	's Bay to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, of which the French were unjustly despoUed by
England	LOCATION	, declares that in the treaty of
Utrecht	LOCATION	in
1713	DATE	the fishermen caused to be in - serted a clause protecting their rights on this French shore .

		Article 13 declares that
Newfoimdland	PERSON	and the adjacent islands should belong absolutely to
Great Britain	LOCATION	; that
France	LOCATION	should not establish any habitation therein except scaffolds and cabins neces - sary for drying fish ; nor should the French land upon the island at any other time than was proper for fishing , nor on any part of the island except from
Cape Bona Vista	LOCATION	up to the northern end and thence along the west coast to
Pointe Riche	LOCATION	.

		This treaty receives from
M. Bellet	PERSON	the very liberal con - struction that it was equivalent to a division of the island between the two nations !

		Gradually , we are told , the wicked aggressions of the English deprived the French of their just rights .

		The English colonists became accustomed to the occupation of fishing , which they had at first dis - dained ; but when , fifty years afterwards , the treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	took away
Canada	LOCATION	from
France	LOCATION	, the rights of the French fishermen to the French shore were confirmed , and as a base of operations
England	LOCATION	ceded to
France	LOCATION	the two little islands of
St. Pierre	LOCATION	and
Miquelon	LOCATION	.

		Again , by the treaty of
Versailles	LOCATION	, after the American Revolution , these unconscionable and astute Englishmen , '' in spite of the successes obtained by our fleets during the wai - , found the means of despoiling us of part of the coast which belonged to us for sixty-six years , under the pretext of rectifi - cation of boundaries , or rather exchange of coast , and took away from us the richest parts of the French shore , the most accessible for our fishermen , and 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, replaced them by a more distant shore with fewer fish on the west coast .

		All the advantage was in favor of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		But an act additional to this treaty provided that the king of
England	LOCATION	would take positive measures to prevent his subjects from troubling by their competition the French fishermen during the temporary exercise of their right on the coasts of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, and would withdraw any settlements established there .

		The French were to erect nothing but their scafPoldings , limiting them - selves to repairing the other buildings they had constructed , and not wintering there ; and the En - glish were not to molest them nor disturb their scaffoldings during their absence .

		The controversy between the two nations , as set forth by
M. Bellet	PERSON	, also involves the important question of the definition of the lobster and the crab .

		It will be remembered that in an early En - glish dictionary the crab was defined to be a small red fish which walks backward ; whereupon a critic remarked that the definition was perfect , except that the crab was not red , was not a fish , and did not walk backward .

		The people of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	now deny to the French the right to take lobsters on the French shore , on the ground that the lobster is not a fish .

		This ,
M. Bellet	PERSON	denounces as a great wrong , for the reason that the lobster was a fish when the treaty was made !

		He says : `` The lobster , like the crab , was regarded as a true fish , and naturalists currently classified it in the category of shell-fish ; and the expression ' to fish for lobster , ' which was then the only one used , has been continued every - where throughout the fishing world . ''

		In accordance with the declaration of
1783	DATE	, says
M. Bellet	PERSON	,
England	LOCATION	prohibited the colonization of the French shore of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		Roads could not be made , nor houses constructed , nor lands en - closed , within a zone of six miles from the coast ; but in
1810	DATE	the
Home Government	ORGANIZATION	began to act differ - ently , and the English colonists have succeeded in establishing settlements upon several points of this shore , so that there are now more than 15,000 in - habitants there .

		The French neglected to expel these English settlers , and naturally they grew in number and in boldness .

		In
1854	DATE	England gave an autonomous govern - ment to
Newfoimdland	LOCATION	, `` which now thinks that it has become a veritable power , and is unwilling to bear the servitude which rests as a burden upon its national patrimony for the profit of Frenchmen . ''

		In
1857	DATE	a convention was signed at
London	LOCATION	which gave to the French the exclusive right of using the French shore for fishing purposes during the fishing season , from
April	DATE	to
October	DATE	of each year , and provided that the French subjects should have the right to buy bait upon the south shore of Newfound - land -LRB- part of the English shore -RRB- , on the same footing as English subjects .

		It was further provided that the coast reserved for the exclusive right of the French should extend from a third to a half a mile inland , and that no English enclosure and construc - tion should be made or maintained on the French shore except for military defence or public admini - stration .

		One would think that it would be self-evident that the conditions prescribed by this convention could not continue indefinitely .

		According to these terms , the English can not use the shores of their own island , however valuable these may be ; nor can the French use them , except temporarily , during the fishing season and for fishing purposes alone .

		To tie up natural resources in this way , permanently and use - lessly , is clearly impossible ; yet it is the purpose of the treatise of
M. Bellet	PERSON	to insist that this shall be done .

		Naturally , the
Newfoundlanders	ORGANIZATION	will establish settlements , construct railways , and build cities , wherever the needs of the country require it , no matter what the treaties may be ; and it would be the part of wisdom to make some exchange of terri - tory by which the land could all be used .

		But this is precisely what
M. Bellet	PERSON	insists shall not be done .

		After a panegyric upon the activity which reigns upon the little desert islands of Miquelon and
St. Pierre	LOCATION	, the two points which
France	LOCATION	has been able to wrest from ''
Britannic	ORGANIZATION	rapacity , '' he insists that no part of the French shore shall ever be surrendered . ''

		We have seen the French Basques discovering the New World more than a hundred years before
Columbus	LOCATION	, and establishing fishing stations , the first foothold of Europeans on the
American Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		While we claim for our people the honor of being pioneers of the first trans-atlantic route , we are happy to be able to cast upon others , less scrupulous of the choice of means , the horror of the almost complete destruction of the race of aborigines , whose honor , sweetness and generosity are recognized by impartial judges !

		... It is not for vain glory that we would maintain ourselves upon the French shore , nor is it to injure the interests of the New - foundlanders , nor to draw from them a petty revenge for all the chicaneries of which they have been guilty for more than two centuries .

		We rise above all these little meannesses , and the only motive which moves us in the affair is the defense of the higher interests of the French codfishing in - dustry .

		The French shore of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	is the stumbling - block of our American fisheries , the foundation and the sine qua non on which rests the future of our codfishing industry .

		We offer here only two arguments in support of this thesis ; but they are decisive and irrefutable .

		The first relates to the cod itself ; the second rests upon the question of bait , without which the fishery would become impossible .

		On the point of the cod , we have said that this fish , without being migratory , is essentially a traveller .

		He has during these last years almost completely disappeared from the French shore ; and it is precisely this disappearance which has led to our progressive abandonment of the place where our fisher - men formerly went to seek him .

		Who , then , can assure us that , by a contrary phenomenon , he will not come to abandon the banks where we are now actively exercising our industry , to return again to the shores which have been conceded to us ? ''

		M. Bellet becomes equally irresistible in his logic when he approaches the question of bait .

		The
Government of Newfoundland	ORGANIZATION	passed an act forbid - ding Newfoundlanders to sell bait to the French - men .

		For the time , this act has not caused much mischief , since the French have been able to catch other kinds of bait on the banks , far out from land ; but this other bait is becoming more scarce , and perhaps they may have to return to the French shore .

		`` It is therefore absolutely necessary to keep the whole of that shore .

		If the Newfoundlanders want to exploit the
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 mines there , or build railroads , a commission might be chosen to select for them , for a just compensation , certain points , -- but to abandon our rights upon the shore , even in part , we must never think of it !

		Better deliver to them our entire national fleet , for we could rebuild it ; but if we abandon
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, we can not find the sailors to equip the ships that assure our national defense .

		It is by the great fishery that we planted ourselves first in the
New World of North America	LOCATION	; and it is for the purpose of defending this industry that we must remain there at whatever cost .

		The superior interest of our country demands it . ''

		Such is the French side of this interesting con - troversy , a controversy which does not seem any - where near a settlement .

		It would look as though French seamanship were in pretty bad straits , if the maintenance of the
Newfoimdland	LOCATION	codfishing is necessary to its preser - vation .


Germany	LOCATION	, with natural facilities infinitely more limited than
France	LOCATION	, has been able without any such aids to establish a merchant marine as well as a navy which is respected everywhere .

		If there be any difficulty with the French upon the sea , it proceeds more from the peculiar Gallic tem - perament than from the lack of facilities for mari - time activity .

		Most Frenchmen are not fond of the water ; and they are too much enamored of the delights of their own beautiful
France	LOCATION	to be willing to abandon them for the trackless paths of `` the unharvested sea . ''

		I had a striking illustration of the incompetency of French seamanship upon my return from
St. Pierre	LOCATION	to
Cape Breton	LOCATION	.

		The captain of the '' Pro Patria , '' on my outward voyage , was a man of con - siderable experience , who had commanded the vessel for a number of years .

		But he was dismissed sum - marily on landing at
St. Pierre	LOCATION	, not because of any complaint against him personally , but because he was related by marriage to certain persons who were obnoxious to the new proprietor of the vessel .

		In his place there was appointed the captain of one of the fishing-craft coming to
St. Pierre	LOCATION	, a man who was not only without knowledge of the course of the vessel -LRB- which is intricate and difficult -RRB- , but who had never been in command of a steam vessel before .

		Luckily , however , on my return voyage the old cap - tain was on board the steamer as a passenger on lus way to
France	LOCATION	.

		It was a beautiful
moonlight night	TIME	when we steamed out of the harbor , -- an impossible night , one would think , for a commanding officer to lose his vessel .

		Yet on the following morning the captain called his predecessor up on the bridge , and , pointing to a coast ahead , asked him what land that was .

		He was told that it was Ingonish and
North Cape	LOCATION	.

		In a single night he had gone more than twenty miles out of his course !

		A few hours later , while I was at breakfast , there was a tremendous crash .

		I asked the cabin-boy what was the matter , and he answered , `` Oh , it 's nothing but the wharf ! ''

		and going on deck I found that we had dexterously taken ofp a corner of the pier at
North Sidney	LOCATION	.

		French seamanship will hardly become an object of admiration so long as such things occur .

		Bismarck and his Empbror .

		* Since the death of Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, a large amount of biographical material and several formal biographies have appeared .

		The result is that to-day the world at large knows , or may know , the Iron Chancellor more fully , and may understand better the definite trend of his whole policy , than was possible during his life-time for any except the few who were favored with his personal friendship and intimate confidence .

		His letters to his wife revealed a side of his nature of which the public had little idea ; ten - derness and sentiment are not qualities that had been generally attributed to him .

		In similar fashion , though not in so great a degree , the recently published volumes of Correspondence between
William I.	PERSON	and
Bismarck	PERSON	not only throw new light upon the
Emperor	ORGANIZATION	's policy , but bring out most clearly the characters of both men , and especially that of
Bismarck	PERSON	as the German citizen and Prussian subject .

		The volumes also contain much material of value to the close student of the Bismarck period , and even serve to confirm or to modify views that are already coming to be accepted as historicaL To the ordinary reader , however , it is the for - mer aspect of the work that will be the more interesting ; and from that point of view it is worth while devoting a little space to its exam - ination .

		One of the most striking characteristics of the letters is the tone of sincere personal friend - ship and warm affection that runs through the notes not purely official .

		`` Your faithfully devoted
Wilhelm	PERSON	, '' '' Your affectionate King , '' and , added in the Emperor 's own hand , `` Your faithfully devoted friend Wilhelm , '' are exam - ples of the royal signature .

		The Chancellor , , for whom etiquette dictated simply '' v. Bis - marck '' as the proper form , frequently ex - presses in the body of his communication the most cordial sentiments .

		One rather long pas - sage deserves to be cited .

		In acknowledging a gift from his sovereign , on the occasion of his silver wedding ,
Bismarck	PERSON	wrote : '' Your Majesty justly emphasizes happiness in the home as being among the chief blessings for which I have to thank God ; but part of the happiness in my house , for my wife as well as myself , comes from the conscionsness of your
Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's satisfaction , and the • Correspondence op
Kaiser Wilhelm I.	PERSON	and

		40 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, exceedingly gracious and kindly words of appreciation which your Majesty 's letter contains are naore beneficial to afflicted nerves than is all medical assistance .

		In looking back over my life , I have such inexhaustible cause to thank God for His unmerited mercy , that I often fear everything will not go so well with me until the end .

		I recognize it as an especially happy dispen - sation that God has called me on earth to the service of a master whom I serve joyfully and with love , as the innate fidelity of the subject never has to fear , under your Majesty 's leadership , coming into conflict with a warm feeling for the honour and the welfare of the Fatherland . ''

		This note of cordial personal attachment is sounded again and again by the Emperor , nut only in connection with gifts and honors con - ferred upon his eminent servant , but even more strikingly in his emphatic protests against even entertaining the idea of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's retirement .

		Thus , in
February , 1869	DATE	,
Wilhelm	PERSON	wrote : '' How can you possibly imagine that I could even think of acceding to your idea ?

		It is my greatest hap - piness to live with you and to thoroughly agree with you .

		How can you be so hypochondriac as to allow one single difference -LSB- t. e. , regarding a gift to the city of
Frankfurt	LOCATION	-RSB- to mislead you into taking the extreme step ?

		... Your name stands higher in Prussian his - tory than that of any other Prussian statesman .

		And I am to let that man go ?

		Never .

		Quiet and prayer will adjust everything .

		Your most faithful friend . ''

		The words in italics are twice underscored , in the last instance three times in the original .

		A few days later , in connection with the same matter , the Emperor wrote : '' I understand all that -LSB- t. e. ,
Bismarck	PERSON	's morbid state and exhaustion -RSB- perfectly well , for I feel the same ; but can or may I , for that reason , think of laying down my office ?

		Just as it is impossible for me to do that , so it is impossible for you !

		You do not belong only to yourself ; your existence is too closely bound up with the history of
Prussia	LOCATION	, of
Germany	LOCATION	, and of
Europe	LOCATION	, for you to withdraw from a scene of action which you have helped to create . ''

		After making some suggestions to lighten the minister 's burdens , he adds : '' Above all , never doubt my unaltered confidence and my unquenchable gratitude !

		I '' As is well known , there is some doubt just when and where the idea of turning the Ger - man Confederation into an empire originated .

		The question is too complicated for a discus - sion in this place , but it is worth while citing one or two statements by
Wilhelm I.	PERSON	bearing upon it .

		On the occasion of the meeting of the first German Reichstag at
Berlin	LOCATION	,
March 21 , 1871	DATE	, his Majesty wrote to Bismarck : '' It is to your counsel , your circumspection , your unwearying activity , that
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	owe the world-historical occurrence which is embodied in my capital to-day . ''

		A year later , upon the anniversary of peace , he wrote : '' We celebrate to-day the first anniversary of the glorious conclusion of peace , which was attained by bravery and sacrifices of all kinds , but through your circumspection and energy led to results which had never been dreamed of I '' Again , in a letter of congratulation , he wrote , in
July	DATE	of the same year : '' My prayers of thanksgiving ... include thanks to God for having placed you at my side at a decisive moment , and thus opened up a career for my Govern - ment far exceeding thought and comprehension . ''

		In connection with
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's distinguished services in founding the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, it is interest - ing to note his loyalty to
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		In
1869	DATE	he wrote from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	to
Baron von Schleinitz	PERSON	, the Minister of State : '' I should like to see the word * German ' written instead of ' Prussian ' on our banner only when we are bound more closely and more expediently to the rest of our countrymen than we are at present ; it loses its charm when it is used too much in its Bundestag nexus . ''

		Nearly twenty years later , in acknowledging a fresh decoration conferred upon him , he wrote : '' I have prayed to God more fervently than ever for the health which I need , in order to evince to your Majesty by deeds , as long as I live , my heartfelt grati - tude , and my fidelity as a born vassal of the
Branden	PERSON	- burg ruling house . ''

		One passage of peculiar interest , as an ex - pression of
Bismarck	PERSON	's ideal of a career , is found in a letter acknowledging the Emperor 's Christmas gift of a copy of
Ranch	ORGANIZATION	's monu - ment to Frederick the Great .

		He says : '' I have always regretted that it was not permitted to me , according to the wishes of my parents , to mani - fest at the front rather than behind the writing-desk my attachment for the
Royal House	ORGANIZATION	and my enthusiasm for the greatness and glory of the
Fatherland	LOCATION	.

		Even to-day , after your Majesty has raised me to the highest honours which a statesman can attain , I can not quite suppress the regret that I have not won similiar pro- motion as a soldier .

		... I should perhaps have been useless as a general , but if I had followed my own inclination I would rather have won battles for your Majesty ... than diplomatic campaigns . ''

		So far , no mention has been made of the second , and in some respects more important , volume of the correspondence , -- the letters other than those from and to Emperor Will - iam I .

		This volume includes some two hun - dred letters , of which about forty are from
Bismarck	LOCATION	, the others being addressed to him by various statesmen and royal persons .

		Space forbids any detailed examination of these , but one specially significant letter of
1859	DATE	, showing
Bismarck	PERSON	's far-sighted policy , deserves to be cited .

		He writes : '' My eight years ' experience at
Frankfurt	LOCATION	has con - vinced me that the Bund institutions are shackles on
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 41
Prussia	LOCATION	, galling in times of peace , and absolutely dan - gerous to her existence at critical periods ... Per - haps I go too far when I suggest that we should eagerly seize every lawful opportunity to assume the role of the offended party , and out of this to attain the revision of our mutual relations which
Prussia	LOCATION	needs in order that she may live permanently in satisfactory relations with the smaller German states .

		... In my eyes , our rela - tionship with the Bund is an infirmity of
Prussia	LOCATION	's which , sooner or later , we shall have to heal ferro et igni if we do not take a favorable opportunity to combat it in time . ''

		The letters given to the public in these two volumes were selected by Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	himself , and were found after his death , ar - ranged in portfolios .

		The translation , made by Mr.
J. A. Ford	PERSON	, is in every way satisfactory , and particularly so when one considers the diffi - culties of German epistolary style .

		As in the German edition , some facsimile reproductions have been included -- fewer in the English , however , than in the German .

		All in all , the work is one of more than passing interest and value .

		It will be indispensable in any library that deals , except in the most general way , with recent German history .

		American Moths .

		* In former times books with good colored illustrations of butterflies and moths were so expensive as to be quite beyond the means of ordinary individuals .

		Chromolithography , in the hands of experts , reached a high degree of excellence , and some very good works were published at fairly reasonable prices during the latter part of the nineteenth century .

		Indeed , the demand for such publications in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	led to the appearance of an aston - ishing number of illustrated guides to various branches of entomology , which rendered the work of the amateur collector in those coun - tries comparatively easy .

		While it is true that these books appeared in response to a demand , they also served to create a further one , and 80 the amateur study of natural phenomena be - came increasingly more prevalent and , I believe , more scientific .

		If I may judge from my own experience as a boy in
England	LOCATION	, the value of such literature to the cause of science can hardly be overestimated .

		In the old-fashioned schools of that country , science was practically ignored , and the student was obliged to resort to books and the public museums for information .

		The * Thb Moth Book .

New York	LOCATION	: Doubleday , Page & Go .

		excellence of these agencies , however , made it possible to progress satisfactorily ; and it is even open to question whether such means , in the hands of an interested student , were not after all superior to class-instruction .

		I believe a strong argument could be presented for the abandonment of formal instruction in science as a means of education , except in relation to certain manifest utilities and technical trades , and the substitution of something more like the apparently hap-hazard method of the English amateur .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, the amateur ento - mologist has not been so favorably situated , and his tribe has not increased as fast as we could wish .

		The excellent publications of
the Division of Entomology	ORGANIZATION	of the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	have been very helpful , and there have appeared several general handbooks , and some works on special groups .

		Nevertheless , even among the butterflies and moths it has been very difficult for collectors to accurately determine their own captures , and they have depended upon the assistance of specialists whenever it could be obtained .

		This condition of comparative ignorance and dependence has not been favorable to the development of orig - inality , and many who might no doubt have done good work have been checked at the out - set by the obstacles to be overcome .

		The publication , a few years ago , of Dr.
Holland	PERSON	's '' Butterfly Book '' marked a long step towards remedying these conditions .

		The new '' three - color '' photographic process was here put to a fair test , and the results were remarkably sat - isfactory .

		For the first time , all except the smaller and more obscure butterflies of the
United States	LOCATION	were well figured in colors ; and the book , containing also good descriptions and much other matter , was sold at a price which made it accessible everywhere .

		Now we have before us a similar but somewhat larger book on the American moths , by the same author .

		As there are over six thousand moths known in this country , it was found impossible to figure them all , and for that matter very many of them are too small to be treated successfully by the means employed .

		It was also found necessary to omit the descriptions , leaving the student to determine his specimens from the pictures , aided by such information regarding particular features , distribution and habits as could be furnished within a small space .

		Not - withstanding these unavoidable deficiencies , there are pictures of one-fourth of the known species , including nearly all of the larger and 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, more conspicuous ones , and there is quite 8u # & - cient to give the student an excellent prelim - inary grasp of the subject .

		While the '' Moth Book '' is thus less complete than that on but - terflies , as compared with what was previously available it marks a considerably greater ad - vance , and from an amateur 's point of view it puts the whole subject on an entirely new foot - ing .

		If it is necessary to replace it in a few years by something better , that will be the best proof of its success .

		Although the author took great pains to have the identifications of his moths correct , there are several errors , which have been pointed out by Dr.
Dyar	PERSON	of the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a future edition , these will of course be corrected , and one may perhaps be permitted to suggest that something more might be added concerning the characters which distinguish the various genera .

		It would also , I think , be an excellent plan to take a few more pages and give a full account -LRB- including all stages of development , distribu - tion , variation , natural enemies , etc. -RCB- of some one species , as a model for the student .

		One is a little afraid that there will be a tendency to merely match specimens with pictures , and forget that there is anything more to be done .

		Although this notice has been written with reference to the utility of the '' Moth Book '' to begineers and amateurs , it is proper to add that there is no specialist who will not find it of the utmost value .

		This purpose permits the writer to omit facts con - cerning ancestry and family life , obtainable elsewhere , and to utilize fully his intimate knowledge and sympathetic insight .

		These result from personal experience ; for , as Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	tells us , his life and theology were so revolutionized by

		guished success in his interpretation was there - fore to be expected .

		As a chief means of understanding the per - sonality of
Beecher	PERSON	, his conception of Christian truth and his two motives '' love for God '' and '' desire for God 's love '' are explained and em - phasized until the reader perceives in them the key to
Beecher	PERSON	's nature , to his intense activity and power of relaxation , to his courage and caution , his outspokenness and reserve , his self - confidence and self-depreciation , and also to his continually present and potent qualities , '' the spontaneity of his humor , his love of beauty , the strength of his conscience , his chivalry toward women and children , and his transparent sin - cerity . ''

		To this portrayal , Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's own reminiscences lend life and value .

		For exam - ple , he thus describes a scene when , at his instigation ,
Beecher	PERSON	was endeavoring to revise the proof of a sermon : `` He cut out here ; interpolated there ; again and again threw down the proof in impatience ; again and again I took it up and insisted on his continuing the task .

		At last , sticking the pencil through the proof with a vicious stab , and throwing both upon the table before him , he said ,
< Abbott	PERSON	, the thing I wanted to say I did n't say ; and the thing I did n't want to say I did say ; and I do n't know how to preach anyhow . ' ''

		Illustrations of
Beecher	PERSON	's humor are numerous .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	says : '' After I took the editorship of `` The
Christian Union	ORGANIZATION	' I urged him to give his views on public ques - tions through its columns .

		■ `` As it is now , ' I said , `` any interviewer who comes to you gets a column from you ; and the public is as apt to get your views in any other paper as in your own . '

		` Yes , ' he said , * I am like the town pump : anyone who will come and work the handle can carry o # E a pailful of water . '

		On one occasion I argued for Calvinism , that it had produced splendid characters in
Scotland	LOCATION	and in
New England	LOCATION	.

		` Yes , * he replied , < Calvinism makes a few good men and destroys many mediocre men .

		It is like a churn : it makes good butter , but it throws away a lot of butter - milk . ' ''

		The
Beecher	PERSON	herein interpreted is not simply a remarkable personality , but a writer , preacher , and orator ; and here too we catch Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's enthusiasm , as he illustrates and analyzes
Beecher	PERSON	's power in the pulpit of
Plymouth Church	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	.

		The chap - ter called '' The
Yale Lectures	ORGANIZATION	on Preaching '' is an excellent piece of criticism .

		We like also his characterization of
Beecher	PERSON	as com - pared with
Webster	PERSON	,
Phillips	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Gough	PERSON	,
Gladstone	PERSON	, and other contemporary orators .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	points out Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	's superi - ority to
George William Curtis	PERSON	'' in inflaming , convincing , coercing power , '' though lacking
Curtis	PERSON	's `` grace and perfect art '' ; his method

		J THE DIAL 48 of reaching '' the conscience through ideality , '' as contrasted with
Finney	PERSON	's coercion through '' logic aflame '' ; his spontaneity , and his use of illustrations from life , as opposed to Dr.
Storrs	PERSON	's more artificial rhetoric and illustrations from books ; and the description of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	as '' a greater preacher '' and of
Beecher	PERSON	as a '' greater orator . ''

		Throughout the book the exposition of
Beecher	PERSON	's oratory is such that we are left with Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's impression : '' If the test of the oration is its perfection , whether of structure or of expression , other orators have surpassed Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	; if the test of oratory is the power of the speaker to impart to his audience his life , to impress on them his conviction , animate them with his purpose , and direct their action to the accomplishment of his `` nd , then Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	was the greatest orator I have ever heard ; and , in my judgment , whether measured by the immediate or the permanent effects of his ad - dresses , takes his place in the rank of the great orators • of the world . ''

		We are particularly grateful for the repre - sentation we here find of
Beecher	PERSON	's scholarship and statesmanship , which the more brilliant qualities of his orations have obscured .

		In
Beecher	PERSON	's speeches in
England	LOCATION	, Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	discovers '' great accuracy of historical infor - mation , '' `` detailed acquaintance with the economic and industrial aspects of the slavery question , '' '' clear apprehension of constitu - tional issues involved , '' and unanswerable logic .

		That
Beecher	PERSON	had a statesman 's clear - ness of insight and practical grasp of difficult situations , is continually made evident .

		Though aflame with anti-slavery fire , he was not an abolitionist , and foresaw the possible final overthrow of slavery by limiting its territory .

		Though a man who never lowered his ideals , his common-sense led him to insist upon prac - ticable methods .

		For example , though believ - ing in universal suffrage , he advocated that , in the case of the negroes , suffrage for a time be restricted by educational and property qualifications .

		He has been represented as inconsistent , not only by people who have over-emphasized seeming discrepancies in his statements , and by those to whom the merri - ment and reverence for which he was distin - guished seemed incompatible , but by those who misunderstood his shifting political affiliations and later theological views .

		Some of these inconsistencies are explained by this concep - tion of him as scholar and statesman .

		He always believed principles more binding than party , and his statesmanship led him to side with
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	and the Democratic leaders in desiring the speedy * ' restoration of all the States late in rebellion to their Federal relation , '' for '' their own health , as indirectly the best policy for the freedmen , as peculiarly needful for the safety of our Government . ''

		Moreover , a life-long individualist and student of economics , he consistently believed in Free Trade , for which Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	stood ; and the fact that he spent years in studying
Evolu	PERSON	- tion accounts for the new emphasis in his later preaching .

		The insignificance of the theo - logical adjustments that he found necessary , and his courage in advocating new truths years before their common acceptance , awaken his biographer 's admiration .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	gives much information con - cerning American religious and political life during the last century .

		In Chapter I. we read that the legacy left by eighteenth - century Puritan theology was `` A fear of God ; a reverence for his law ; a strenuous though narrow and conventional conscience ; but also a religion divorced from ethics ; a Church silent in the presence of intemperance and slavery ; without mis - sionary zeal or missionary organization ; threatened by the intellectual revolt which eventually carried from it some of its wisest and noblest men ; and surrounded by a community lapsing into indifference and neglect or combining in open and cynical infidelity . ''

		Equally valuable is the account of the theology which regarded religion as a '' form of life , '' and which , under the leadership of
Horace Bushnell	PERSON	'' the apostle of faith , ''
Charles G. Finney	PERSON	'' the apostle of hope , '' and
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	'' the apostle of love , '' succeeded in replacing Puritan rationalism .

		Chapter III .

		gives a picture of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	and
Indianapolis	LOCATION	in the thirties and forties , and a suggestive contrast between the methods then in vogue of fitting men for life and those used to-day .

		The chapter called '' Parenthetical '' contains a comprehensive and clearly defined exposition of the complications of the anti-slavery issue , and a description of the three parties that in
1847	DATE	clashed in the North .

		In Chapter IV .

		are found a statement of the principles of Congregationalism , a comparison of Congre - gational and quartette singing , and a division of churches into two classes -- the one empha - sizing worship , the other preaching ; the one building a cathedral , the other a '' meeting - house . ''

		For classification , Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	has a veritable genius , separating prayers into three groups , and lives of Christ into eight .

		Doubtless the introduction of so much that is but indirectly ancillary to the writer 's main purpose greatly enriches the book .

		And such is Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's ability to summarize and sub - ordinate that this seemingly extraneous mat - 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ter in no way impairs its structural unity .

		Thus our attention throughout centres on Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	, * ' a man of great spiritual and intellectual genius , whose faults were super - ficial , whose virtues were profound , whose influence will outlive his fame , and who has probably done more to change directly the religious life , and indirectly the theological thought in

		* One of the most interesting discussions in literary history has grown from the attempt to fix the responsibility for certain statements in
Father Hennepin	LOCATION	's later publications concern - ing the original exploration of the lower Mis - sissippi by members of the La Salle expedition .

		In
1673	DATE	Joliet and
Father Marquette	ORGANIZATION	descended the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, by the gateway of the
Wiscon	PERSON	- sin , as far south as the mouth of the
Arkansas	LOCATION	, returning by way of the
Illinois	LOCATION	river and
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	to
Green Bay	LOCATION	.

		Although these ex - plorers did not reach the mouth of the Mis - sissippi , they had gone far enough to determine that it had its outlet not in the ' ■ * ■ South Sea '' but in the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The chevalier La Salle , who for some years , from his deri - sively named outpost of La Chine on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, had been seeking a way overland to
China	LOCATION	, caught a new inspiration from the new discovery , and turned his purposes from the West to the South .

		No longer a trade route to the further East but a French empire in the nearer
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, became the goal of his ambitions .

		Count Frontenac , whose name shines in the temple of fame along - side that of his less fortunate successor who perished on the heights of
Abraham	LOCATION	, was ruling in the French colony on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	.

		His vision was one with that of La Salle .

		Both saw a great opportunity for French ascendancy , political and commercial , in the still unoccupied valley of the

		personal welfare of the American Indian than upon the exploitation of the undeveloped re - sources of his broad lands , they looked at first with cold indifference on the noble services rendered to humanity by the Jesuit fathers .

		But their indifference changed to a more pos - itive disfavor when the plans for exploitation on the one hand and for salvation on the other clashed over an '' Indian policy '' in regard to '' fire water '' and other doubtful blessings of civilization .

		Consequently when La Salle 's little band went out into the wilderness in
1678	DATE	they took with them as spiritual advisers and mis - sionaries four members of that more tractable religious brotherhood , the
RecoUet Order of Franciscans	ORGANIZATION	.

		That one of this group who has become well known through his narrative of the expedition was Father
Louis Hennepin	PERSON	.

		Born about
1640	DATE	, in the province of Hainault in the
Spanish Netherlands	LOCATION	, he entered the RecoUet order while still a lad .

		But his spirit and his aspira - tions were hardly those of a friar and recluse .

		He says : '' I was passionately in love with hearing the rela - tions that masters of ships gave of their voyages .

		I used oft-times to skulk behind the doors of victualling - houses to hear the seamen give an account of their adventures .

		This occupation was so agreeable and engaging that I have spent whole days and nights at it without eating ; for hereby I always came to under - stand some new thing , concerning the customs and ways of living in remote places , and concerning the pleasant - ness , fertility , and riches of the countries where these men had been . ''

		After serving for a time as an army chaplain in the wars with
France	LOCATION	, his desires were grati - fied in
1675	DATE	, when the superior of his order commanded him to sail with four others to the help of Frontenac in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Going out on the same ship with La Salle he did not again come in touch with him until in
1678	DATE	, when , again at the order of his superior in
Paris	LOCATION	, he joined La Salle for his great journey to the unexplored West .

		Two years were spent as chaplain at the outpost of
Fort Frontenac	LOCATION	on
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	, where , he says , `` I gave myself much to the reading of voyages , and encreas 'd the ambition I had to pursue my design of making this discovery . ''

		Another year was spent in convent at
Quebec	LOCATION	, '' in order to prepare and sanctifie myself for commencing our discovery . ''

		In
September , 1678	DATE	, the party was made up , with La Salle at its head , ably seconded by

		THE DIAL 45 The winter rendezvous was above the falls of
Niagara	LOCATION	, where a vessel of forty-five tons called the '' Griffon '' was built .

		On the seventh of
August , 1679	DATE	, the expedition sailed for
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	on this ship -- the first keeled boat that ever navigated the great lakes .

		The win - ter of 1679-80 was spent on the
Illinois River	LOCATION	, where
Fort Crevecoeur	PERSON	was built near
Lake Peoria	LOCATION	.

		At the beginning of
March	DATE	the party separated .

		La Salle with four companions re - turned to Frontenac for supplies , Tonty and fifteen Frenchmen remained to hold the out - post on the
Illinois	LOCATION	, and Father Hennepin , in company with
Michael Accau	PERSON	and
Antoine Augel	PERSON	, started on the now famous canoe voy - age to explore the
Illinois	LOCATION	to its junction with the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and to further ascend the latter river as far as feasible .

		Although Hennepin always poses as the leader of this expedition ,
Accau	PERSON	, who knew the Indian languages , was the official leader .

		But the man of the pen , as usual , has triumphed over him of the sword , and the fame of this daring adventure will always be
Hennepin 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Captured by a party of
Sioux	LOCATION	near
Lake Pepin	LOCATION	, the little band of white men made an involuntary acquaintance with the higher reaches of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	as far as the Falls of
St. Anthony	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here they were rescued by a party of five coureurs de hois led by that great adventurer and explorer ,
Daniel Greysolon	PERSON	du Lhut .

		This masterful man , who could go with safety almost alone among In - dians hostile to the white man , was welcomed with as much joy by the
Sioux	LOCATION	as by the pris - oners , and in his keeping the whole party of whites came out , by the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	and Win - nebago route , to spend the winter of 1680-81 at
Mackinac	LOCATION	.

		In the
summer of 1681	DATE	Hennepin was once more at
Quebec	LOCATION	, and in the fall he sailed for
France	LOCATION	and his career as an explorer ended .

		At the beginning of
1683	DATE	he published at
Paris	LOCATION	a work entitled '' Description de la Louisiane , '' and its narrative of the events of the
spring	DATE	and
summer of 1680	DATE	are fully authenticated in the independent narratives of La Salle and du Lhut .

		But while Hennepin at
St. Germain	LOCATION	in
1682	DATE	was writing his book .

		La Salle , who had returned to the
Illinois	LOCATION	country in
1681	DATE	, was making his wonderful voyage down the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to the sea , and Father Membre was of his party .

		In
1690	DATE	was published Le Clercq 's '' Etablissement de la Foi , '' which contained Membre 's narrative of that expedi - tion .

		But Le Clercq 's book was almost imme - diately suppressed , and its contents and the achievements they narrated appear to have been known only to a few persons .

		Here was a literary opportunity that appealed to the mercurial mind of
Hennepin	LOCATION	.

		In
1697	DATE	he published at
Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	his `` Nouvelle Decouverte d'un tres grand Pays , situe dans I ` Ameriqiie . ''

		In this volume he boldly appropriates Membre 's narrative and La Salle 's glory , and incorporates the voyage to the mouth of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	into his trip of
1680	DATE	as a preliminary to the voyage on the upper river .

		This claim was in the face of the statement in his earlier book that '' the tribes that took us prisoners gave us no time to navigate this river both up and down . ''

		His party left the
Illinois	LOCATION	in a canoe about the twelfth of
March	DATE	, and were captured near
Lake Pepin	LOCATION	on the eleventh of
April	DATE	.

		Yet the latter book claims for this month a canoe voy - age of 3300 miles , two-thirds of the distance against the current of the Father of Waters !

		All the authorities , with one exception , from
Jared Sparks	PERSON	to Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, have duly char - acterized the mendacity of
Hennepin	LOCATION	, who if an honest man might have achieved a worthy fame with one immortal voyage and one praise - worthy book .

		The exception is
John Gilmary Shea	PERSON	.

		In his '' Discovery and Exploration of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, '' published in
1852	DATE	, Mr.
Shea	PERSON	joins in the general condemnation of
Hennepin	LOCATION	's monumental '' steal , '' but in his ''
Hennepin	PERSON	's Description of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, '' published in
1880	DATE	, he puts forward the ingenious theory that
Hennepin	PERSON	was the guileless victim of a sup - posititious editor whom Broedelet , the
Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	publisher , employed to refashion
Hennepin	ORGANIZATION	's genuine narrative .

		A detailed investigation of the whole matter leads one to follow Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	when he says : '' A careful compari - son between Louisiane and its successors leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that , as
Shea	PERSON	originally held , the blame must rest upon the shoulders of Hennepin quite as much as upon those of his publishers . ''

		This imposture , the `` Nouvelle Decouverte , '' published in
1697	DATE	, while containing
Henne	PERSON	- pin 's true voyage , and much other matter true and false , omits the valuable accounts of the Indian life and manners contained in the '' Louisiane . ''

		However , it went through many editions speedily , and was translated into nu - merous languages .

		In
1698	DATE	a third work of his , the ''
Nouveau Voyage	ORGANIZATION	d'un Pais plus grand que I `
Europe	LOCATION	, '' was published at
Utrecht	LOCATION	.

		This is a patchwork of Indian customs from the '' Louisiane '' and travels by La Salle and others from Le Clercq .

		The same year 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, was published at
London	LOCATION	an English transla - tion of
Hennepin	LOCATION	's works entitled '' A New Discovery of a Vast Country in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		This consists practically of the `` Nouvelle Deeouverte '' and the '' Nouveau Voyage , '' with some added material cribbed from earlier trav - ellers .

		It is this English translation or version that Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	has undertaken to edit , so that with
Shea	PERSON	's reprint of
1880	DATE	we may have a complete set of the voyages by
Hennepin	LOCATION	.

		The work , as we expect from this editor , has been splendidly done .

		An introduction deals with the career and literary duplicity of the author , and Mr.
Victor Hugo Paltsits	PERSON	of the
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	furnishes the first accurate bibliography of
Hennepin	LOCATION	.

		Excellent copies of the original maps and engravings are in - cluded .

		The publishers have given this accu - rate reproduction a worthy setting in paper , print , and binding to delight a book lover .

		Besides the regular edition , in two volumes , there are 160 numbered copies beautifully printed on handmade paper .

		CL.OTHES AND COSTUMK IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The unbeliever who has read all the books that have been written on colonial times , would have said that there was not enough material left for another .

		But he would have under - rated both the potency of Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's divining-rod , and the richness of trea - sure which lurks in the subject of clothes .

		That potency and richness are proved by two ample and sumptuous volumes recently pro- duced by Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	under the title '' Two Centuries of Costume in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Being content , for the most part , to leave the deeper and vaguer phases of her subject to
Carlyle	PERSON	, who as a mere man and philosopher can not enter with joy into the details of actual dress , and having moreover disposed of the more scientific side in '' Customs and Fashions in Old
New England	LOCATION	, '' Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	is free in the present work to revel in all the gorgeousness of historic finery .

		And what an array she gives !

		From the beautiful Van Dyck costumes , and the plain dress of the Quakers and early Puritans , through the ugly ornateness of Res - toration times , to the prettiness of
Watteau 's * Two Cbnturibs of Costume	ORGANIZATION	in

		conceits , the `` witless bravery '' of hoop skirts , and the immodest scantiness of Empire fash - ions , -- all are here , described in Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's piquant style , and made real by a wealth of illustrations which form a treasure-house in themselves .

		The author 's love of the glint and rustle of brocade and the soft witchery of gauze and lace is testified on every page ; and who - ever does not feel a responding love in his own soul is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils .

		Let not the eternal masculine scoff .

		He will love to read of his past glories , or he is not of the same race as the
Boston	LOCATION	groom of whom it is recorded that '' his dress was so much more striking than the bride 's that she had a hearty fit of crying over it . ''

		Historically , of course , the book is of great value , especially the chapters on the Evolution of Coats and Waistcoats , and of Pantaloons and Pantalets .

		Shorn of the embroidery of quaint terms and clever phrases , some of the interesting general facts which are developed are these : that as a class Americans from
1650	DATE	to i860 dressed more expensively and fashionably than Englishmen ; that men were not less gorgeously clad than women , nor less anxious to be in '' the high kick of fashion '' ; that '' the most devoted follower of fashion in the present day gives no more heed to dress and the modes than did the early American Colonists '' ; and that even the Puritan who dressed in '' sad color '' was not necessarily sombre in attire , since `` sad color '' included purple and green , and many a Puritan wore a red waistcoat .

		It is dangerous to quote , for there is no place to stop .

		But one can not resist repeating the mere words in this list of colors : '' Billymot , phillymurt , or philomot -LRB- feuille-mort -RRB- , murry , gridolin -LRB- gris-de-lin or flax blossom -RRB- , puce color , Kendal green , Lincoln green , barry , milly , stam - mel red , zaffer-blue . ''

		This is irresistible , too , though the tribute is to an Englishman : ' < The guards of lace a finger broad laid on over the seams of the gown are described by
Pepys	PERSON	in his day .

		He had some of these guards of gold lace taken from the seams of one of his wife 's old gowns to overlay the seams of one of his own cassocks and rig it up for wear , just as he took his wife 's old muff , like a thrifty husband , and bought her a new muff , like a kind one ... Really a seventeenth century husband was not so bad . ''

		A
Century of Expansion	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In his account of `` A Century of Expansion '' Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has sought to do more than write a mere sketch of territorial acquisitions by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the first place , his concep - tion of his subject is such that he finds it necessary to devote a third of his book to a description of conditions and events prior to the first accession of territory under the Con - stitution .

		The forces which rendered American expansion '' not only possible but inevitable '' are declared to have '' preceded the formation or even the conception of the Republic '' -- in fact to have been `` anticipated in the very circumstances of the Columbian discovery . ''

		More striking than this is the scope which Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	attaches to the term `` expansion . ''

		* ' The history of American expansion , '' he says , * ' is something far more than a record of geo - graphical extension , or even of wars and treaties .

		It involves the history , in large measure , of constitutional development and interpretation , of domestic institutions , of foreign relations , and of our whole national life . ''

		This , of course , makes of expansion an exceedingly vast subject .

		great story .

		The history of American expan - sion is recognized to be not all '' pride and sunshine . '' ''

		The nation , '' we read , '' has not always acted wisely and well .

		There are things to condemn as well as to commend .

		Acts are not always necessarily right just because our country performs them . ''

		This is sound doc - trine , and while it does not represent any new revelation , it can not be preached with too great frequency .

		It is gratifying to encounter a writer who proclaims the truth so straight - forwardly .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	writes thus from such a whole - some point of view , and draws the bold outlines of his subject in such a convincing manner , that one can not but regret the more deeply his occasional superficiality and carelessness in handling details .

		It would be an easy matter to make up a long list of more or less serious errors into which he has fallen .

		For instance , it was in
1716	DATE	, not
1718	DATE	, that Lieutenant - Governor
Spotswood	LOCATION	and his fifty '' Knights of the Golden Horseshqg '' crossed the
Blue Ridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		And why spell it `` Spottswood '' ?

		The worthy gentleman himself did not do so .


Pittsburg	LOCATION	is spoken of as existing in
1764	DATE	, although '' the Forks '' did not bear that name until nearly a decade later .

		The story of a Jesuit college at
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	in
the first quarter of the eighteenth century	DATE	, as ridiculous as it is oft-repeated , is scrupulously preserved .

		The extent of westward migration prior to the Revolution is considerably exaggerated .

		The fact of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	's conquest of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	in 1778-79 played no part in the peace negotiations at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1782	DATE	, though the contrary is here strongly implied .

		Western state-making during the Revolution is very in - adequately treated .

		It is certainly quite un - necessary to explain
Clark	PERSON	's acquiescence in
Genet	LOCATION	's intrigues for the alienation of the West from the
United States	LOCATION	on the theory that he was '' partially insane '' ; else such in - sanity must have been frightfully common about 1793-94 .

		The utterly unanticipated character of the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	is ob - scured by an exaggerated statement of an alleged American determination about 1800-2 to oust
Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	completely from the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		Throughout the discus - sion of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	annexation there is , if not too much praise for
Hamilton	PERSON	's enthusiastic defiance of European powers , at least a very stinted recognition of the fact that , after all , events proved
Jefferson	PERSON	's policy of '' palliation 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, and endurance '' unquestionably the wisest that could have been pursued under existing con - ditions .

		The treaty by which
Florida	LOCATION	was purchased from
Spain	LOCATION	was signed in
1819	DATE	, not
1818	DATE	.

		It is mere waste of space to set down the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	as in any degree a basis of American claim to
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		The
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	legend still lives , though in a rather emasculated condition , in this book .

		Though the author does not go so far as to attribute to Whitman any actual influence in '' saving
Oregon	LOCATION	, '' yet he represents
Whitman	PERSON	's famous trip to the
East	LOCATION	in the winter of 1842-43 as made for that purpose absolutely .

		In view of Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's convincing argument that
Whitman	PERSON	's mission was entirely for religious , not political , purposes , there can no longer be excuse for such blunt adherence to the old view , with not the slightest mention of the new .

		The most satisfactory portions of the book are the chapters on the Mexican and
Oregon	LOCATION	acquisitions , `` Our Afctic Province --
Alaska	LOCATION	, '' '' Mid-Sea Possessions , '' and '' The Spanish Islands . ''

		There are perhaps no better brief , non-technical treatises on these topics in print .

		Despite the avowed popular character of the book , it is a matter for regret that there are no citations of sources and authorities .

		The author clearly believes the expansion which has thus far marked the career of the
United States	LOCATION	to have been quite inevitable .

		To him the annexation of
the Philippines	LOCATION	did not mark any new departure in American policy -- did not even make
America	LOCATION	for the first time a '' world power . ''

		The thesis is ardently main - tained , and with a good deal of success , that '' from the very beginning
America	LOCATION	has been a world power and a participant in world poli - tics . ''

		The only region , however , in which further territorial acquisition may be expected is the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		Finally the author , after his survey of the whole field , arrives at the following concisely stated conclusion : '' Expansion has never been and never should be an end in itself , but merely a means of working out our highest national destiny .

		It has in the past proved such a means , absolutely essential and inestimably profitable .

		It would hereafter be deplorable , and deserving of strongest condemnation , for
America	LOCATION	to sieze upon any additional territory , great or small , through mere lust of land .

		It would be equally deplorable and worthy of condemnation for
America	LOCATION	to decline the acquisition , whether by peaceful purchase or by forcible conquest , of any territory the control of which by us was dictated by humanity or honor , or the possession of which was essential to our own safety , peace , and prosperity . ''

		That mind is something more than ZpZlled mind . ''

		product of material evolution has never been more convincingly brought home to the thoughtful observer than by the lives of
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	and
Helen Keller	PERSON	.

		How the latter was led oat of darkness into light has recently been told us .

		To this account is now added an equally interesting and instructive narrative , illus - trated by copious extracts from her joarnal and letters , of
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	's remarkable history .

		In some respects , this is the more noteworthy vol - ume of the two ; for hers was the earliest case of its kind successfully treated , and we are made to follow , almost with bated breath , the first groping and tentative efforts of teacher and pupil to break through the thick wall of darkness which the skep - tical public believed to be impenetrable .

		The book -- its title in full is ''
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	, Dr.
Howe	PERSON	's Famous Pupil , and What he Taught her '' -- is written by two of the philanthropist 's daughters , Mrs.
Maud Howe Elliott	PERSON	and Mrs.
Florence Howe Hall	PERSON	, is illustrated -LRB- sparingly -RRB- by a son-in-law , Mr.
John Elliott	PERSON	, and is published in attractive form by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a filial tribute to Dr.
Howe	PERSON	, as well as an account of his remark - able pupil .

		More impressive even than the won - derful unfolding of the afflicted girl 's mind is the free and natural development of her fine moral sense , -- until sectarian influences , despite Dr.
Howe	PERSON	's watchful care , were brought to bear on her during a vacation at her home in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		The worst effects of these largely wore off with time ; but one perceives here a sad interruption to the spontaneous and harmonious growth of her religious nature .

		The student of language will find in this volume much that is both amusing and in - structive , as well as pathetic , in poor
Laura	LOCATION	's heroic struggle to express herself in writing .

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has col - Thahutoryof lected into a volume , which is pub - dramatxe art .

		, .

		, , , , tr i ~ .

		- i hshed by the Messrs. bcribner , a course of ten lectures on '' The Development of the Drama , '' which he has given during the past two or three years before various audiences in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is not a very stout book , but it sketches the history of dramatic art in its great epochs both ancient and modern , and tells a story that has not heretofore been told , as far as we are aware , within the limits of a single volume .

		Other and more extensive histories of dramatic literature there are , no doubt , but as Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	points out , they are '' unduly distended '' by bio - graphical and controversial matter , and fail to give adequate attention to the shaping influences of cir - cumstances and intellectual environment upon the development of dramatic art .

		Summarized , this interesting volume gives us a preliminary chapter upon '' The Art of the Dramatist , '' two chapters on the Greek and Roman drama , one on the drama
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 of the Middle Ages , three upon the blossoming of the art in
Spain	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, respectively , one each upon the stage of the eighteenth and the nineteenth century , and a final forecast of '' The Future of the Drama . ''

		Throughout , the material is judiciously selected , and the treatment is fresh and suggestive .

		The author is mainly concerned with the technical aspects of dramatic art , and brings to bear upon his treatment an extensive knowledge of stagecraft , based upon a thorough historical study of the theatre , ancient and modern .

		Those who think primarily of the drama as a spe - cies of literature will wince more than once at the author 's remarks about the great poets , but the criticisms which he makes of their work , although sometimes startling , may fairly be allowed if we remember that an exposition of dramatic technique rather than of literary expression is the main pur - pose which he has in view .

		By way of illustration of both the author 's style and the comprehensive - ness of his survey , we will close this notice of an extremely interesting book with a passage from the closing chapter .

		`` Thus it 18 that Ibsen stretches back across the centuries to clasp hands with Sophocles ; and a comparison of the sus - taining skeleton of the story in ' Oedipus the King ' with that in ' Ghosts ' will bring out the fundamental likeness of the Scandinavian dramatist to the Greek , -- at least in so far as the building of their plots is concerned .

		Inspired in the one case by the idea of fate and in the other by the doctrine of heredity , each of them worked out a theme of overwhelming import and of weighty simplicity .

		Each of them in his drama dealt not so much with action in the present before the eyes of the spectator , as with the appalling and inexorable con - sequences of action in the past before the play began .

		In both dramas these deeds done long ago are not set forth in a brief exposition more or less ingeniously included in the ear - lier scenes : they are slowly revealed one by one in the course of the play , and each at the moment when the revelation is most harrowing . ''

		The truth of this comparison is unassailable , how - ever it may be scoffed at by the classicist , who is scandalized at the very idea of naming the two poets in the same breath .

		The
Shakespeare Jwo	ORGANIZATION	interesting and somewhat sim - eountry described ilar Contributions to Shakespeariana andiuuxraied .

		jj ^ ^ g recently made an almost sim - ultaneuus appearance . ''

		The Shakespeare Coun - try '' -- first issued in the '' Country Life Library '' and now reprinted and imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -- is notable chiefly for its pic - tures ; though the text , by Mr.
John Ley	PERSON	land , is far from being without intrinsic value .

		Mr.
Ley	PERSON	- land is wise enough not to attempt to theorize about the incidents of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life ; instead , he expends his efforts upon a reconstruction of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan
Warwickshire	LOCATION	, where without doubt -- if we except the Baconian theory -- Shakespeare spent much of his life .

		He puts a fresh and really impressive emphasis on the fact that , while we know not what manner of man Shakespeare was , nor how he brewed his magic potion out of hillside beauty , churchyard horror , and village revel , we can know with very accurate approximation his physical en - vironment , and so can get a background with which to surround , though not after modern methods to '' explain , '' his very lonely personality .

		The illus - trations of this volume consist of over a hundred remarkably clear and beautiful half-tone plates , made from photographs .

		These picture all the interesting landmarks of
Stratford	LOCATION	and
Shottery	PERSON	, and give glimpses of the neighboring villages , of
Warwick	ORGANIZATION	,
Kenilworth	LOCATION	, and
Stoneleigh Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		-- Less popular in method and much wider in scope than the foregoing is the work entitled ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Home-Land '' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- .

		Its author , Mr.
W. Salt Brassington	PERSON	, is an enthusiastic antiquarian , who cares little for mere landscape , but revels in tradition , legend , and genealogical lore .

		He at - tempts , however , to record accurately and pains - takingly his impressions of the country around
Stratford	LOCATION	; and in this part of his work he is greatly aided by the dainty little pen-and-ink sketches which are thickly scattered through his pages .

		But he is most interesting , because most interested , when he is delving deep into the perplexing question of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ancestry or his possible connection with the Gunpowder Plot , collecting all the local traditions of the poet , giving an exhaustive account of the relics and portraits of him , and finally rang - ing far afield to gather all the historic and legendary associations of places within easy distance of Strat - ford , whether or not they have any connection with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the stay-at-home reader , a perusal of the book may prove burdensome because of the wealth of material included ; but the pilgrim to the region around
Stratford	LOCATION	will find it a valuable companion for a leisurely jaunt through
Warwick	PERSON	- shire and parts of the neighboring counties . ''

		Watts was born with a delicate con - ` o * rw ^ uJ!r.a .

		stJtution , and all his life has been far from robust ; indeed , often weak and sickly .

		... It has often been noticed that strong men have one weak point , and their general con - stitution is not stronger than that one point . ''

		When Mr.
Hugh Macmillan	PERSON	wrote these words in comment upon his friend
George Frederick Watts	PERSON	, he little imagined that the work of revising the proofs of the book would devolve upon the subject of his study .

		As the title , '' The Life - Work of
George Frederick Watts	PERSON	, '' suggests , Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	has devoted himself to the explanation of Mr.
Watts	PERSON	's pictures and methods of work rather than to what might be called a biography in the strict sense of the word .

		At the same time the several extracts from letters , and the scraps of conversa - tion , so skilfully used , tell of the close relation between writer and subject .

		Of Mr.
Watts	PERSON	's por - traits , which were his first serious woiks in art , Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	says : `` They do not depict the expression which happens at the moment to come into the face , but the inner mystery of the person - ality ; not the accidencies of life , but the essentials .

		... We have had no such perception of character -- no such power to paint the mind as well as the body 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, in portraiture , since
Vandyke	ORGANIZATION	painted
Charles I.	PERSON	,
Henrietta Maria	PERSON	,
Strafford	LOCATION	, Laud , or the Countess of Carlyle . ''

		From portrait-painting the artist passed to the broader field of imagination , to repre - senting the Greek myths and Hebrew stories in pictures ; and then to what he considered his par - ticular sphere -- Allegory .

		The didactic purpose of these pictures greatly impressed Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	; and the explanations of the allegories , the fitting out of Mr.
Watts	PERSON	's suggestions by the author , pro- vide many points of interest .

		Yet we sometimes wish Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	had not admired his subject quite so ardently .

		Not that the subject is unde - serving of his praise , but the frequent reiteration of the artist 's peculiar fitness for every department of his art is likely to pall upon us .

		The book is filled with many poetic and literary reminiscences , oftentimes merely quotations , but more frequently inwrought in the author 's sentences .

		The accurate and comprehensive index renders the book valuable as a work of reference , not alone to Mr.
Watts	PERSON	's work , but to contemporary art as well .

		Near the summit of Echo Mountain , Ech ^ MMin .

		overlooking the beautiful city of
Pasadena	LOCATION	, in the fertile
San Gabriel Valley of California	LOCATION	, is situated the
Lowe Obser	PERSON	- vatory , the director of which , Mr.
E. L. Larkin	PERSON	, entranced by the beauties of the scenes around him and by those of the overhanging vault of heaven , has written a little book in which he portrays the glories which flash from sun and star , and indicates the results which astronomers have won with the spectroscope and photographic plate .

		The title of the book , '' Radiant Energy '' -LRB-
Los Angeles	LOCATION	:
Baum	PERSON	- gardt
Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is doubly happy ; for it sug - gests not only the flashings of power from distant worlds , but also the exuberant spirit of the author .

		For him , '' The Galactic hosts are splashed and strewn in spray , in spirals , and are tumbled in con - fusion on a carpet of jet-black velvet , or cosmical hail of pearls and diamonds on blackened wastes of space , or piled in heaps , raked into windrows and rolled into banks and bulwarks , all flashing and blazing with supernal colors . ''

		To him , spectrum analysis is the '' chief study that ever actuated the human brain '' ; and of the dark lines in the solar spectrum , he says , '' Their discovery and translation is the chief event that has occurred on the earth within the period of written history . ''

		Of the men who make astrophysical investigations , we are told that '' no labor ever performed by the human frame is more arduous and exacting than that hourly engaged in by a working astrophysicist .

		A trained astronomer is a machine of precision , with every phase of bodily life , every faculty of mind , every - thing in his being , an abject slave to indomitable will . ''

		Even the apparently insignificant decimal .00002010899 may produce in us a feeling of awe , when we are informed that it has '' tremendous analytical power , and there is no escape from its clutch for any mass , if it is moving . ''

		The reader bows humbly before the parallax of
Alpha Centauri	ORGANIZATION	, when he becomes aware that it is '' that number whose value can not be compared to anything in the possession of man . ''

		But the reader must go to the book itself to enjoy to the full the freshness and uncoDventionality of the author .

		After reading the last twenty-five pages , in which are described the beautiful location of the
Lowe Observatory	ORGANIZATION	and the wonderful appearance of the starry vault above it , one may be pardoned for taking the next train to
Southern California	LOCATION	, in acceptance of Mr.
Larkin	PERSON	's invitation found on p. 317 , which runs as follows : '' So , to geologists , biologists , entomologists , botanists , mineralogists , microscopists , meteorolo - gists , naturalists , lovers of nature in her most splen - did forms and modes , students of the sea , growers of fruit , engineers , electricians , railroad builders , mountain climbers , explorers , spectroscopists , pho - tographers , artists , and astronomers , it is said , come to this wondrous place -- Echo Mountain . ''

		The autobiographical record of the o/lnA ^ itrZT ^ !

		formative influences in a notable life is always instructive ; and such a record gains in interest when it is made to include , besides an account of the author 's own work , nu - merous anecdotes and pen-sketches of great men with whom it was his good fortune to be asso - ciated .

		The earlier chapters of Professor New - comb 's `` Reminiscences '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deal with the boyish yearnings of the author for something more than a mere living , and with his successful efforts to escape from the '' world of cold and darkness '' into the regions of '' sweetness and light . ''

		Pro- fessor
Newcomb	PERSON	writes of his early life in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, of his attempts to teach school in
Maryland	LOCATION	, and of the years he spent in fitting himself for his great work in astronomy , with simple candor and directness .

		More interesting still are the chapters dealing with the life-work of the author , connecting him with the great movements of astro - nomical thought and scientific progress during the past forty or fifty years .

		One great value of the book lies in its collection of sketches of scientific men .

		The author writes of personal contact with such men as
Leverrier	PERSON	and
Adams	PERSON	, the twin dis - coverers of
Neptune	LOCATION	, of Airy the Astronomer Royal , of
Hansen	LOCATION	,
Holden	PERSON	,
Barnard	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Henry	PERSON	, Hill ,
Lord Kelvin	PERSON	,
Struve	PERSON	, and many others .

		Some of the author 's feats of observation read like the detec - tive stories of
Conan Doyle	PERSON	.

		His method of clear - ing Father Hell of suspected forgery was worthy of the celebrated
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	himself .

		He is never wearisome , -- and whether he tells us of his life in
Paris	LOCATION	at the time of the capitulation to the Prussians , or of the humorous antics of a Washing - ton newsboy during our Civil War , his words are full of that human sympathy which is a character - istic of the man .

		The book is readable throughout ; indeed , it is preeminently one of those of which it can truthfully be said that '' there is not a dull page in it . ''

		^ gj.g literature , '' The Compromises of Life '' -LRB-
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the editor of the
Louisville	LOCATION	'' Courier-Journal , '' will give satisfaction .

		Written by a man of wide experience outside his chosen field of journalism , this collection of public addresses is a pleasing change from the lucubrations of the closet philosopher .

		Mr.
Watterson	PERSON	is honest , outspoken , abundantly endowed with what is known as horse sense , always sanely optimistic , and never - failing in wit and humor .

		In his own way , and choosing his own illustrations , he preaches the gos - pel that the life is more than meat , and the body than raiment .

		That a public speaker should never contradict himself , is too much to expect ; and 80 we find Mr.
Watterson	PERSON	not entirely free from an Emersonian disregard of consistency .

		In the title-chapter of his book he deprecates the horrors of armed conflict , and declares , '' I would compro - mise war , '' adding that the occasions on which it is necessary are '' most exceptional . ''

		Yet in a speech delivered only two years after the utterance of these words he does not hesitate to say , in reference to international arbitration , that the '' elimination -LSB- of war -RSB- makes the emasculation of the human species simply a question of time '' ; and again , in his ad - dress on Lincoln , alluding to the latter 's attempts to avert civil strife , he rejoices that the war '' was fought out to its bitter and logical conclusion . ''

		The best and most authoritative chapters in the book are those dealing with conditions in the South and with journalism .

Danes	PERSON	-RRB- , is now the smallest of European kingdoms ; but she is by no means the least important , -- certainly not the least interesting .

		Specialists from almost all countries make it their business to study Danish institutions , with the result that these institutions are often copied elsewhere .


Denmark	LOCATION	has set the world an example in the adoption of a perfect cooperative system in connection with agriculture .

		In the re - clamation of barren lands for the formation of plan - tations of vast extent , she has shown other countries what things may be done , and how .

		Her breweries are models , her schools and hospitals are admirable .

		She has been conservative of her national customs in a manner quite at variance with the more push - ing and rushing nations and with young republics .

		The Dane is in no hurry .

		He does not come of age until he is twenty-five , nor attain to the parliament - ary suffrage until
five years later	DATE	.

		He takes time to do things thoroughly , and lives to a good old age .

		Denmark therefore offers an extremely interesting subject for a volume of the '' European Neighbours '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , and Miss
Jessie Brochner	PERSON	treats it in her volume on '' Danish Life in Town and Coun - try '' with a thoroughness and sympathy that leave nothing to be desired .

		It may be that the town-life as exhibited in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, the capital , is more fully treated than the country ; but the reader would be captious indeed who would find this a fault in the book .

		The half-tone illustrations , sixteen in number -LRB- three of them from paintings by Danish artists -RRB- , prove that
Denmark	LOCATION	and Danish life are by no means deficient in the picturesque element .

		About one - twelfth of this , harvest of an observant eye and a listening ear has been culled out by Mr.
A. R. Waller	PERSON	for republication in a stout octavo entitled '' Gossip from
Paris	LOCATION	during the Second Empire '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The correspondent shows himself a wide-awake young man , ready to take an interest in anything that has a promise of '' copy , '' and putting his matter into attractive shape for English readers .

		The very first letter of the volume has a humorous account of a retired grocer who chose to end his days as a Norman baron , building himself an ancient castle , with moat and keep and dungeon dark , and , with the sexton 's aid , providing his es - tablishment with a graveyard skeleton for suspen - sion in chains over the tower-flanked entrance ta his frowning fortress .

		Turning a few leaves , we come to an instructive note on the fertilizing prop - erties of rags , which , we are assured , make an excellent dressing for siliceous soil .

		Some of the items partake of the grim and ghastly , others ap - peal to lovers of the frivolous or of the sensational , , but many are of literary or historical interest .

		A long extract is given from
General Dix	ORGANIZATION	's speech to the American colony on his relinquishing his post as
United States	LOCATION	minister to
France	LOCATION	.

		Taken as a whole , the book will be found to have some - thing likely to interest all sorts and conditions of readers .

		The long period of religious conflict Itli'ojFTancl t ^ at began with the
Protestant Ref	ORGANIZATION	- ormation and closed with the Thirty Years ' War will always be of great interest to all readers of history .

		Especially does it appeal to that class of students who delight in tracing the influence of human passion on the course of great events .

		Among the more recent books dealing with this century is a volume by Lieut.-Colonel
Andrew C. P. Haggard	PERSON	, entitled `` Sidelights on the Court of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		This work belongs to the bor - derland of history and biography ; though the au - thor discusses such eminently historic subjects as the
League	ORGANIZATION	, the fate of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, and the policies of Richelieu , his principal theme is the public and private life of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	.

		It can not be said that his presentation is such that it adds much to 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, oar general knowledge of that sinful period ; that the Bourbon court was not a place where morality was likely to thrive , is a fact too well known to need the additional emphasis given by a detailed account of weakness and wickedness like the one here presented .

		As for the author 's treatment of
Henry IV.	ORGANIZATION	, it must be said that the unlovely side of his character is given undue prominence , and too little is said of the really great things that he did for
France	LOCATION	.

		The author 's sources are apparently of the memoir type , and French memoirs are noto - riously untrustworthy .

		The book is written in an easy , spicy , and somewhat careless style , such as we should expect to find in a work so largely devoted to scandal and intrigue .

		The Nemesis of Froude '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Sir
James Crichton Browne	PERSON	and Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	, is an elaborate and con - vincing refutation of the flimsy charges contained in
Froude	PERSON	's posthumous pamphlet , '' My Relations with
Carlyle	PERSON	, '' recently published by members of bis family .

		A rejoinder was hardly necessary , as the writer of the pamphlet already stands convicted out of his own mouth , his self-contradictions de - stroying his credibility .

		It is the old story of forg - ing new falsehoods -- or , which amounts to the same thing , new half-truths -- to buttress the tot - tering structure of the old , only to make more sig - nal the final ruin .

		Pathetic , in view of what was to follow , are
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's words to
Miss Jewsbury	PERSON	, relating to a `` mythical '' portraiture of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	which she had submitted to his inspection , and which , although he expressly commanded its suppression as a distortion of the truth ,
Froude	PERSON	took pains to pub - lish in full . ''

		, , , , , i ■ attention of thoughtful men during the past four or five years by its exceptionally clear and vigorous discussion of public affairs .

		It has been particularly effective as a mouthpiece of those who are opposed to the bastard imperialism which has written into our national annals their most shameful chapters .

		No more effective pro- test against this ominous tendency of our public policy has been made than that which has been voiced in '' The Public '' from week to week by Mr.
Louis F. Post	PERSON	, the editor of the periodical .

		Mr.
Post	PERSON	has now collected his scattered papers upon this and other subjects of national concern into a volume called '' Ethics of Democracy , '' fur - ther described as '' a series of optimistic essays on the natural laws of human society , '' and issued by the
Moody Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Post	PERSON	is a strong and fearless thinker , with a remarkable gift of ex - position , and the radical system of Democratic ethics which he outlines is fairly self-consistent .

		In many respects it will command the hearty ap - proval of all honest thinkers , although to our mind it is vitiated by its acceptance of the single-tax idea with its sundry implications .

		`` We do not object to the single tax as a theory so much as we object to the fashion in which Mr. Post and its other advo - cates override the most elementary considerations of justice in their propaganda for the institution of their pet reform .

		They have adopted toward the private holding of land the fanatical position of the extreme abolitionists toward the holding of human beings in slavery , and will not allow that the present owner of real property has any rights that need be considered in the economic readjust - ment which they aim to bring about .

		From this position to the advocacy of a lawless termination of such contracts as public franchises and even to the repudiation of public debts is an easy step , and one that the author does not hesitate to take . ''

		Repudiation is a sacred right of the people '' are his own words .

		We regret that this perverse polit - ical morality should be found underlying a book with which we are in many ways heartily in sym - pathy , which is so entirely right in its denunciation of imperialism , and which is so exceptionally sound and clear in its view of such matters as free trade and international balances .

		In
M. Eugene Bohm-Bawerk	PERSON	's lat - Recenttheoriet ggj hook , '' Recent Literature on In - terest '' -LRB- translated by Mr.
Wm. A. Scott	PERSON	and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , he has supplemented his '' Capital and Interest '' by giving a critical summary of the interest theories advanced from
1884	DATE	to
1889	DATE	.

		The author has evidently at - tempted a criticism of the salient points in various men 's arguments on this subject , rather than a lengthy exposition of the arguments themselves .

		Therefore the book presupposes a certain amount of intimacy with modern writers on interest ; and for this reason it appeals primarily , if not exclusively , to the student of economics .

		M. Bohm-Bawerk keenly points out the fallacies in the use , the absti - nence , the labor , the productivity , and the exploita - tion theories of interest , and shows the weak position of the eclectics .

		His method of attack is to follow the premises of the various writers to their logical conclusion , -- a reductio ad absurdum .

		Especially skilful are his treatments of
Marshall	PERSON	's abstinence theory and
Stolzmann	ORGANIZATION	's labor-cost theory .

		M. Bohm-Bawerk , as an advocate of the agio theory , draws the conclusion that '' nowadays it may be considered as a recognized truth that the final causes of the phenomenon of interest are to be found , on

1899	DATE	.

		The necrology alone makes a list of nearly thirty closely-printed pages .

		We have now a somewhat larger representation than for - merly of the financial and commercial callings , which gives a better balance to the work .

		Club memberships are now included in the information furnished .

		The educational , marriage , and age statistics compiled by the editor are of great interest .

		One man -LRB- who is not named , and whom we have not hunted down -RRB- was born in
1809	DATE	-- the annus mirabilis of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Darwin	PERSON	-- and is thus the oldest of Amer - ican '' who-whos . ''

		The year which gave birth to the largest number is
1858	DATE	, which claims 417 men and women , of whom President
Roosevelt	PERSON	is one .

		The work in its present form is more valuable than ever , and we could not commend in terms too high the accuracy and the judgment displayed in the work of compilation .

		Nine new volumes have been added by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	to their series of reprints of famous old En - glish books , most of them noteworthy because of their illustrations , which are carefully reproduced .

		The volumes are as follows : '' The Second Tour of Dr. Syntax , '' illustrated in color by
Rowlandson	PERSON	; '' The English Dance of Death , '' in two volumes , also with
Rowlandson	PERSON	's colored plates ; `` The Life of a Sports - man '' and '' The Analysis of the Hunting Field , '' both with colored illustrations by
Henry Aiken	PERSON	;
Ainsworth	PERSON	's '' Tower of
London	LOCATION	'' and ''
Windsor Castle	ORGANIZATION	, '' with drawings by
Cruikshank	PERSON	; `` • The Fables of -3 i8op and Others , '' with
Bewick	PERSON	's engravings ; and
William Blake	PERSON	's '' Illustrations of the Book of Job '' -- a thin volume of plates only , in miniature photogravure re - production .

		Volumes XII. , XIII. , and
XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		of `` The New International Encyclopoedia , '' published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have recently come to our table , and the end of the work is now brought within three volumes .

		Maximilian is the first entry in the volumes now at hand , and
Rice	PERSON	- Bird is the last .

		The policy of rich illustration is still pursued in these new issues , and the full-page plates and maps , both plain and colored , are a source of great satisfaction , tempting us to turn the pages for the sake of the pictures alone .

		This is not said in disparagement of the text , which maintains , and perhaps improves upon , its earlier stan - dards of readableness and accuracy .

		The
Dramatic Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Chicago	LOCATION	send us a volume of '' Modern Monologues '' by Miss
Marjorie Benton Cooke	PERSON	.

		The author is a young woman well known in
Chicago	LOCATION	as a talented amateur actress , and as the impersonator of the characters figured in this bright and entertaining volume .

		The success of the pieces , as presented by the author herself upon many semi-public occasions , has provided a very practical test of their effectiveness .

		Still another volume of '' Mono - logues , '' the work of
Miss May Isabel Fisk	ORGANIZATION	, is published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many of these com - positions have previously appeared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' and they certainly afford amusing reading .

		Gentle satire upon the foibles of society and of indi - viduals is the note of both these charming books .

		The following French texts are from the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	: '' An Easy First French Reader , '' by Mr.
L. C. Syms	PERSON	; '' Fifty Fables by La Fontaine , '' edited by Mr.
Kenneth McKenzie	PERSON	; Mdrimde 's '' Colomba , '' edited by Mr.
Hiram Parker Williamson	PERSON	; and Chateaubriand 's '' Les Aventures du Dernier Abencerage , '' edited by Dr.
James D. Bruner	PERSON	.

		From
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have ' `` A French Reader , '' by Messrs.
Fred Davis Aldrich	PERSON	and
Irving Lysander Foster	PERSON	; and George Sand 's • ' La Mare au Diable , '' edited by Dr.
Leigh R. Gregor	PERSON	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	also send us two important Spanish texts : '' A Practical Course in Span - ish , '' by Messrs.
H. M. Monsanto	PERSON	and
Louis A. Lan	PERSON	- guellier , revised by Professor
Freeman M. Josselyn	PERSON	, Jr. ; and the '' Dona Perfecta '' of
Senor B. Perez Galdds	PERSON	, edited by Professor
Edwin Seelye Lewis	PERSON	, 54 THE DIAL .

		The Colonel 's Opera Cloak '' was one of the most popular novels published in the '' No Name '' series of a quarter - century ago .

		It was afterwards revealed that Miss
Christine C. Brush	PERSON	was the author .

		A new illus - trated edition of this book is now issued by
Messrs. Little , Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Leonard Eckstein Opdycke	PERSON	's translation of
Castiglione	PERSON	's '' Book of the Courtier , '' published in a sumptuous limited edition a year or more ago , now reappears in a garb relatively more modest , yet still stately and worthy of the dignity of the text .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the publishers .

		`` The Founder of
Christendom	LOCATION	, '' an essay by Pro- fessor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, is published in a small volume by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Primarily an address prepared for a
Toronto	LOCATION	audience , the discussion is at once so reasonable and so weighty that it was richly deserving of its present permanent form .

		With its current number , the quarterly '' Book of Book-Plates '' makes a change of title to '' Books and Book-Plates , '' with a corresponding enlargement of scope and contents .

		The
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the Amer - ican publishers of this little periodical , which is both sensible in matter and attractive in form .

		Dr.

New England	LOCATION	history .

		Messrs.

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	has just issued his Christmas poem entitled '' The Word at
St. Kavin	LOCATION	's , '' privately printed at the
Monadnock Press	ORGANIZATION	in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, with an especially designed frontispiece and title-page by Mr.
John M. Cleland	PERSON	.

		The edition is limited to 250 copies , to be obtained only through the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		One of the interesting biographies promised for
1904	DATE	is the Life of
John A. Andrew	PERSON	, the war-governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, to be brought out by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is based upon both public and private records , the author , Mr.
Henry G. Pearson	PERSON	, having had access not only to the abundant documents and letters in the
State House	ORGANIZATION	, but also to private and family memorials . ''

		Marriage in Epigram , '' compiled by Mr.
Frederick W. Morton	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is described as a collection of '' stings , flings , facts , and fancies from the thought of ages , '' which seems to be both accurate and pleasantly alliterative .

		We miss from the index the name of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, who might surely have been drawn upon to spice , if not exactly to enrich , this collection .

		This
spring	DATE
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to have volumes of fiction from the following authors :
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	,
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	,
Hildegarde Hawthorne	PERSON	,
Andy Adams	PERSON	,
Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	,
Rose E. Young	PERSON	,

George B. McClellan	PERSON	,
Henry D. Sedgwick	PERSON	,
Washington Gladden	LOCATION	,
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	,
W. Starling Bur	PERSON	- gess , and
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	.

		`` < The
United States	LOCATION	in Our Own Time , '' by Chan - cellor
E. Benjamin Andrews	PERSON	, is the title given to a new edition of '' The History of the
Last Quarter Century	DATE	, '' to which , however , several new chapters have been added , making the record cover something like thirty-five years of our annals . ''

		From Reconstruction to Expansion '' is the sub-title , which serves fairly well as a delimitation of the ground covered .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are , as before , the publishers of the work .

		Among the important announcements of
spring	DATE	pub - lications from
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : '' A Bachelor in Arcady , '' an idyllic romance by Mr.
Halliwell Sutcliffe	PERSON	; '' The Life of
Dean Farrar	PERSON	, '' being the authorized biography of this noted theologian and writer , by his son Mr.
Reginald Farrar	PERSON	; ''
Ruskin Relics	PERSON	, '' a series of important and interesting Ruskiniana by that author 's friend and official bio - grapher , Mr.
W. G. CoUingwood	PERSON	; and '' Minute Mar - vels of Nature , '' by Mr.
John J. Ward	PERSON	, an illustrated work dealing for the first time in a popular way with the marvels of minute life which are revealed only by the microscope .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that they will publish this month the first number of a new periodical entitled '' The Artist Engraver , '' a quarterly magazine of orig - inal work .

		The first number will contain an etching by Professor
A. Legros	PERSON	, an engraving on copper by
William Strang	PERSON	, a woodcut by Mr.
C. H. Shannon	PERSON	, a lithograph by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, and an etching by Mr.
D. Y. Cameron	PERSON	.

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have also become the American publishers of '' The
Burlington Magazine	LOCATION	, '' which has become famous during its two and a half years of life for its beautiful reproductions of all sorts of rare objects of art , the real appreciation of which is confined chiefly to the connoisseur .

		An essay on '' Optimism , '' by Miss
Helen Keller	PERSON	, is made into a very pretty little book by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is Miss
Keller	PERSON	's first piece of original writing -LRB- with the exception of the remarkable autobiography published last year -RRB- , and its theme is not the least surprising of its characteristics .

		If
Miss Keller	PERSON	can be an optimist , there is small excuse for the rest of us who profess to be anything else . ''

		Tennyson 's Suppressed Poems , Now for the
First Time Collected	ORGANIZATION	, '' is the title of a volume published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
J. C. Thomson	PERSON	is the editor , and he seems to have done his work thoroughly , but it may be doubted whether it was worth doing .

		Many of the pieces here brought together have long been included in the American editions of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, although the editor assures us that they are not found in his '' Collected Works '' as issued by his own publishers .

		There is to be a new issue of ''
Cassell	PERSON	's
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' in enlarged form and attractive cloth cover with excellent type and paper . ''

		Silas Marner '' comes first , to be followed at weekly intervals by '' A Senti - mental Journey , '' ''
Richard II.	PERSON	, ''
Evelyn	PERSON	's Diary , selec - tions from
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's Letters ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	's and
Emerson	PERSON	's Essays , ''
Sartor	PERSON	Re - sartus , '' and
Thackeray	PERSON	's '' Four Georges . ''

		Professor
Henry Morley	PERSON	's introductions were a valuable feature of the old issue , and many '' eminent hands '' will per - form a like duty for the new volumes .

		An undertaking of great interest to every student of Western history has just been announced by
The Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		This is a series of '' Early Western Travels , '' 1748-1846 , comprising annotated reprints of some of the best and rarest contemporary volumes of travel , descriptive of the aborigines and social and economic conditions in the middle and far west , during the period of early American settlement .

		Exhaustive notes and introductions will be supplied by Dr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, editor of the '' Jesuit Re - lations '' and the foremost authority ^ on Western history , who is also to supply an elaborate analytical index , under one alphabet , to the complete series .

		This latter is an especially valuable feature , as almost all of the rare originals are without indexes .

		There are to be thirty-one volumes in all , illustrated with maps , fac - similes , etc. .

		The edition is limited to 750 complete sets , signed and numbered ; but in addition thereto , a limited number of the volumes will be sold separately .

		In connection with the limited folio reprint of
Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne , now in course of publication by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, it is interestipg to note that Mr.
George B. Ives	PERSON	, its editor , has found of great as - sistance the Montaigne collection recently acquired by the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library .

		This collection , by the way , was the property of the late Professor
Ferdinand Bocher	PERSON	, and was purchased for the library through the gener - osity of Mr.
James H. Hyde	PERSON	.

		It is not yet catalogued , but Mr.
Ives	PERSON	was granted special permission to inspect it , and it proved to be of exceptional service in pre - paring the bibliography of the essays which is to ap - pear in the third and final volume of the set .

		The author states that he now has absolutely accurate de - scriptions of almost all of the important editions , and is confident that his list will include some mention of very nearly every French edition .

		So it is safe to assume that the bibliography will prove by no means the least valuable feature of this notable and imposing edition .

		BRIEFER MENTION 94 NOTES 95 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 96 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 97 NET PRICES AND LIBRARIES .

		When the leading American publishers united , about two years ago , in the adoption of their plan for a rehabilitation of the book-selling business by establishing a uniform system of discounts , coupled with a refusal to sell to deal - ers who offered books for less than the prices fixed by the publishers , the effort was regarded favorably by the greater part of the thoughtful public , although it was not viewed altogether without misgivings .

		It was generally realized that the bookseller was in a bad way , and that the book-store of the old-fashioned type , well - stocked and intelligently conducted , was too civilizing an influence to be given up with a light heart , and it was felt that the combination attempted , although clearly '' in restraint of trade '' in the legal sense , was deserving of ap - proval in the larger interests of culture .

		As far as the misgivings with which the plan was received were legal , there was nothing to do but to put it into operation and to wait the action of the courts , concerning which point we may say , in passing , that the decisions thus far rendered leave the matter still doubt - ful , although with perhaps more of encour - agement to the publishers than they could fairly have anticipated .

		The other misgivings , to which we gave ex - pression when the subject first came up for debate , were based upon an apprehension that the publishing interests would not do their part in good faith .

		As we then pointed out , the publishers were bound to do two things if they would clear their skirts of the charge of seek - ing their own selfish ends under a hypocritical pretense of concern for the sufferings of the booksellers .

		One of these things was to publish all net books at prices which should be at least twenty per cent , below the scale previously in use ; the other was to raise voluntarily , and as a matter of course , the customary royalty to authors from ten to twelve and
one-half per cent	MONEY	.

		If these things were not done , it would become fairly evident that self-seeking rather than altruism was the underlying motive in the cooperative plan , and the fine professions with which it was heralded would soon be discounted by the public as uniformly as the price-lists by 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the publishers , and to far more radical effect .

		Now we have been observing these matters rather closely for about two years , and we have not yet heard of that general increase of authors ' royalties which simple justice demands , nor have we been convinced that prices under the net system are a full fifth lower than they would have been under the old conditions .

		This latter question is , we admit , confusing , and a good many publishers seem to have made an honest attempt to carry out their implied compact with the public .

		But the experience in this matter of the librarians , who have made a more systematic study of the subject than any other class of people , is not reassuring .

		They were promised in advance by figures -LRB- which proverbially can not lie -RRB- that the net system of prices , taken in connection with the discount of ten per cent , to libraries , would mean for them an average increase of eight per cent , in their invoices of current publications .

		This they were willing to allow as their contribution to a philanthropic movement , and the plan received their endorsement subject to this understand - ing .

		But subsequent experience seems to have made of the promised eight per cent , a barren ideality , and we have from them reports show - ing advances of fifteen , twenty , and twenty-five per cent , instead of the lower amount they were ready to concede .

		The dispute came to something like a dead - lock at the
Niagara Falls	ORGANIZATION	conference of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION
last year	DATE	, when the question was warmly debated by represen - tatives of both the publishing and the library interests , the latter demanding a larger dis - count , and the former declaring that it could not possibly be granted .

		Under these circum - stances , the only recourse left the librarians was to cast about for some means of reducing their book budgets under the ex ` sting condi - tions , and to this end a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Book Prices was constituted , and directed to advise librarians from time to time '' in regard to any feasible measures for avoiding the hardships of the net price system . ''

		That committee has now issued the first of a series of bulletins on the subjf ` Ct of economy in book - purchasing , and others will follow as new suggestions are made that seem worth considering .

		The leading point made in this bulletin is to the general effect that a good many books may be imported from
England	LOCATION	at a lower price than that at which they may be bought from American booksellers .

		It is notorious that our publishers who import English editions list them at a higher price than is justified .

		Tak - ing into account the large discount that the importing publisher receives , even the addition of the duty and the cost of transportation can - not excuse the listing of such books -LRB- as so fre - quently is done -RRB- at the rate of
thirty-five cents	MONEY	to the shilling .

		This is at least twenty-five per cent too much , and every large library can make a substantial saving on such books by sending to the English publishers for them .

		Among the instances quoted by the committee are the new Chambers 's '' Cyclopasdia of En - glish Literature '' and the
Garnett	PERSON	and
Gosse	PERSON	'' Illustrated History of English Literature . ''

		Here the net prices to libraries are respectively ,
$ 13.50	MONEY	as against
$ 7.88	MONEY	for the former work , and
$ 22.60	MONEY	as against
$ 15.00	MONEY	for the latter .

		A proportional saving may be made in many other cases , and this consideration clearly out - weighs the disadvantage of a month 's delay in getting the books .

		As far as this remedy goes , it is one to which libraries will do well to resort ; unfortunately it is not applicable to the ordinary new Ameri - can book .

		Here the bulletin suggests not buy - ing the book at all , but getting instead more copies of standard old books , buying sets of periodicals , rebinding the old books , and look - ing out for copies of recent publications at auction sales and elsewhere .

		This is too heroic a treatment of the difficulty to find much favor with a public crazed by the desire to read the newest books right away , but it is in the main sensible advice and should be followed as far as public sentiment will allow .

		It seems to us that the publishers have acted unwisely in taking so determined a stand against the wishes of the libraries .

		They need all the friends they can get in their effort to restore the bookselling business to its earlier dignity and security , and the libraries are on the whole the best friends they can have .

		A deep-seated antagonism has now been created which it will not be easy to soften .

		We be - lieve that underlying the whole controversy there may be still found among our publishers the notion that libraries tend to diminish the sale of books .

		Against this narrow view we have always protested , and will continue to protest .

		In the long run , we believe that every public library creates more private purchasers that it destroys , and that the permanent inter - ests of the publishing business have much more to gain than to lose from the multiplica - tion of libraries of all sorts .

		To take but one consideration , too often lost sight of , how valu -
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 able an asset to the whole business of serious publishing must be found in the mere existence of so large a number of libraries that the de - mand from them alone is sufficient to take up a respectable edition of any work of real val - ue , suffieiient to insure agjainst loss , in any event , and frequently sufficient to provide a substantial profit .

		It is publishing of the spectacular and sensational sort that has rea - son to fear the influence of the libraries , not the legitimate and conservative publishing which alone has claims upon our sympathy .

		THE LIBRA RIAN AS CRITIC .

		The distinguishing feature of the library move - ment at present is its wonderful expansion .

		In ad - dition to the usual sources of income , the gifts to libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	during the last two years have amounted , in round numbers , to
$ 30	MONEY	, - 000,000 .

		A vast deal of energy is expended in controlling and organizing this movement in order that its benefits may cover the widest possible area .

		So broad is the interest in libraries , and so much a matter of course is their existence in fa \ ured communities , that it is time , perhaps co put a stronger emphasis upon their more f.urictly educa - tional work .

		It is beginning to be evident that many libraries whose history falls within the recent period of library development , having experienced their first enthusiams , are now coming properly to a sober rec - ognition of the fact that a great popular educational movement , in order to amount to anything , must grip close to scholarship ; to the extent at least of appreciating its aims , endeavoring to share its spirit , and striving to use its methods , as far as possible .

		The highest type of public library in a large city is probably one which comes in contact with readers of all stages of development , from the grade schools to the university , in addition to the ungraded public of all degrees of intelligence .

		It is the librarian 's critical faculty , chiefly , which is called into requisition on the part of those who need it , for the promotion of this better use of books which is to resiUt in a larger body of readers of sound tastes less widely removed from the plane of scholarly habits .

		This function of criticism , broadly speaking , is exercised through the library by dis - crimination in the selection of books , by skilful cat - aloguing , and by the personal work of the library staff in encouraging a proper student habit .

		This being the animating spirit of all good librarians , it may not be out of place to examine a little in detail some of the means by which it is sought to carry out these ideas .

		The librarian 's critical work begins where the critic in print leaves off .

		He must supplement the work of the critic by seeing to it that the '' right book goes to the right man . ''

		This well-worn phrase means that , in default of any other guidance on be - half of the uncertain inquirer , it is the privilege of the librarian to suggest the book which will best apply to the need of the moment .

		As he is so ob - viously bulwarked by great stores of learning -- at least in the eye of the applicant , -- he is able to present what he has to offer , even though it may consist o `` f but a single reference , gained at the cost of much research , without falling into the error of didacticism , the especial '' tutorial '' failing which made
Stevenson	PERSON	's father willing to snub the entire race of schoolmasters .

		The critic who commits his judgment to writing , pronouncing upon the skill and capacity of the author , and in giving a final opinion concerning the especial distinction of the volume under review , comes to the conclusion of his task so far as the work in hand is concerned .

		The librarian is very grateful to him , reading everything he has to say with pleasure and profit , and subsequently confirm - ing , rejecting , or modifying somewhat the recorded opinion as it is tested by abundant application to varying needs , continued , perhaps , for years after the critic has placed the final period to his pages .

		But certain kinds of expert criticism he is occa - sionally obliged to do away with altogether .

		The scholar who presents the results of his own re - searches in a history , the best of the popular kind , intended to make its appeal to the foremost intelli - gence of a class of busy readers who can not pos - sibly command time for the more exhaustive works , may find the whole intent of the work overlooked , its drift and purpose ignored , and its general use - fulness set aside , for a discussion of certain technical defects which blind the critic to the general merit of the work .

		Take the case , also , of the historical novel .

		The librarian in his position as a public official need not fash himself over the conflicting views of the lit - erary merits of the historical novel as an art form .

		He well knows that the best of them delight thou - sands of readers , making their appeal equally to the confirmed reader of history and to the neophyte in historical knowledge .

		The former reads with the double satisfaction of interest in the story and of the exercise of his critical faculties upon the histor - ical representation ; the latter finds in it a stimulus to an interest in history which hitherto he may have lacked .

		Our recent American literature con - tains many excellent productions of this kind which were enjoyed as stories and which were often fol - lowed by deeper reading .

		`` The Crisis , '' for instance , created a new in - terest in the entire period of the Civil War .

		It was fortunate to have at hand such an admirable , com - pact history of American politics as Professor
Macy	PERSON	's `` Political Parties in the
United States	LOCATION	, 1846-1861 '' and Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's `` Life of Lincoln , '' 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, with which many eager readers supplemented the novel .

		In even so comparatively slight a work as
Archdeacon Brady	PERSON	's '' The Southerners '' there is one chapter detailing a dinner table conversation which is of considerable value in setting forth the variety of opinion at the South upon the political situation just before the war .

		Of Mr.
Page	PERSON	's '' Red Rock '' it is hardly too strong a statement to say that it absolutely opened the eyes of many readers at the North to conditions at the
South	LOCATION	during reconstiniction days .

		In ''
Richard	PERSON	`` Carvel '' we have in the colonial lawyer ,
Henry Swain	PERSON	, a character which finely illustrates the arrival of a distinctly new American type , one created by the freer opportunity to the individual which the chang - ing social conditions were already bringing about .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's `` Audrey , '' pure romance though it is , is remarkable for the variety of its pictures , the lights and shadows , heights and depths , breadths and colorings of
Virginia	LOCATION	colonial society ; all of it quite as true to fact as the beguilement of the story would persuade us into imagining .

		These examples are taken at random from recent fiction , because it is in the current historical novel that the special opportunity of the librarian lies .

		The great mas - ters are beyond question .

		Scott ,
Hugo	PERSON	,
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Auerbach	LOCATION	,
Shorthouse	PERSON	, for instance , have their fixed place and value in the interpretation of liistory , awaiting , their discovery by each new generation of readers .

		The primary grade of the personal work of the library consists in much downright suggested in - struction to the youthful reader upon the proper use of books ; the correct way of handling and of opening a book , an observation of the title-page , the advan - tages of referring to a table of contents instead of clumsily turning the leaves ; some comprehension of the index as a useful tool , and the desirability of noting an authority once consulted in order to avoid subsequent efforts to recover it by means of vague allusions to its color and size .

		It is surprising what can be found in the ordinary dictionary if one has never thought of it before .

		Observe the encyclopae - dias -- there are so many of them and they are of such different kinds .

		Then there are the gazetteers , the maps with all sorts of information , the ' * alma - nacs , '' the `` year-books , '' the `` chronologies , '' the `` digests . ''

		An unaccustomed reader soon becomes self-reliant by an intelligent use of all these helps .

		A great advance has been made when it is possible to distinguish between the magazine article written with authority and that which is the work of the industrious compiler ; or , when a compilation merely is wanted , to know which ones are well done .

		The education of the reader makes further prog - ress in his knowledge of the use of catalogues and bibliogi'aphies .

		A catalogue may be regarded as an exposition of the contents of a collection of books ; a bibliography , as a descriptive list of books bearing upon a special subject .

		Full cataloguing furnishes the foundation stones from which bibliographies are constriictedt A good annotated bibliography of a subject comes very near being a critical history of that subject .

		In our own country this feature of library work was not much attended to , previous to twenty-five years ago .

		At the present day much is done of a high order of merit and of an extreme degree of usefulness .

		A few libraries in widely scattered portions of the country have already made a beginning in the compilation of bibliogi'aphies of the local history of their respective sections .

		In all work of this nature the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	is tak - ing the lead through its
Department of Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	, both by way of issuing useful publications on its own account , and by serving as a bureau of inform - ation in regard to the progress of bibliographical un - dertakings throughout the states .

		As examples of the kind of '' reading lists '' coming from the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the following may be mentioned : Trusts , Reciprocity , Interoceanic Canals ,
Federal Control of Commercial Corporations	ORGANIZATION	, Negro Question ,
Indus	LOCATION	- trial Arbitration .

		As to the outlook upon the field of bibliography , it is the intention of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	to keep students informed from time to time through the columns of the `` Library Journal . ''

		Perhaps it is too much to claim for the influence of the library that its work in bibliography has af - fected the publishers ; but , at all events , it is true that coincident with this accomplishment inside the library , almost all publications of worth have now attached to them the bibliographies of their re - spective subjects .

		It goes without saying that this is frequently the most valuable portion of an encyclo - paedia article .

		Indeed , it is now so much the fashion to furnish '' lists of authorities '' or '' bibliographies '' with each new publication , that unfortunately it involves the appearance of some with but slender claim to consideration .

		A book without an index , too , has its usefulness so hampered that few in these days of little leisure make their appearance without that indispensable aid to quick and sure reference .

		A little note in each issue of the '' Library Journal '' calls attention to current publications lacking this feature .

		The library is now so well established as pur - veyor to the public that it ought to be able to gather up a pronounced concensus of the demand for va - rious branches of reading .

		It is not a point , to be sure , upon which statistics can be had , but the library must often , it would seem , be the means of interpreting this demand to the publisher .

		In spite of the appearance of many brilliant books of travel , especially of those relating to travel in the orient , good books of description are still needed , particu - larly those which deal with the beaten track of the tourist in
Europe	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	.

		There has been an improvement within the last few years , but the com - ing in of cheap processes of illustration has made it easy to dispense with the instruction of the narra - tive .

		Many of the descriptive books of fifty or seventy-five years ago are fuller in treatment , more accurate , and altogether more satisf actoiy as sources of information than some of the more recent ones which miss the art of being direct and simple in

		THE DIAI .

		75 statement .

		Good books covering the field in our own country are very scarce .

		Some excellent commercial geographies have come to us of late .

		More can be used .

		There is still room for popular histories of commerce , his - tories of various industries , milling , mining , manu - facturing ; short definite treatises on the economic relations of botany , ornithology , and entomology ; popular histories of transportation , especially of the railway systems of our own country .

		Librarians probably have no classified lists of these wants , but frequently in the course of their labors are they reminded of the number of useful books yet to be written .

		The library 's most pronounced success in the way of serious reading is perhaps in its response to the demand for books of sociology in general , and in particular for those relating to the labor question , civics , and mmiicipal affairs .

		Books like Dr.
Glad	PERSON	- den 's `` Social Facts and Forces , '' published a few years ago , and the more recent
Brooks	PERSON	's `` Social Unrest '' and
Bolen	PERSON	's `` Getting a Living '' have helped to clarify the opinions of countless readers .

		Countless more have awakened to an interest in American history .

		It would be interesting to find out , if it could be discovered , whether it is the imperfect discipline of a defective education , or the reaction from an un - fortunate religious training , or whatever the cause , that is leading so many people to read such `` queer '' things in religion and philosophy .

		An interesting experiment was recently tried at one of the library schools whereby it was sought to construct a ladder which should be the means for the lovers of crude fiction to climb into higher regions of enjoyment , beginning with such established favorites as
Mary J. Holmes	PERSON	or
Augusta Evans Wilson	PERSON	and reaching by degrees a permanent liking for the good things of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	, TroUope ,
Charles Reade	PERSON	, and sometimes , eventually , even for
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	.

		A similar progression from the amorphous writings of some unclassifiable ones -- let them be nameless here -- to Professors
Hoffman	PERSON	,
Mttnsterberg	LOCATION	, or
William James	PERSON	, for instance , ought not to be en - tirely impossible .

		Professor
Hoffman	PERSON	, in his preface to '' Psychology applied to Common Life , '' has the following interesting statement : '' Not many gener - ations ago the all-absorbing theme was physics , and little attention was paid to other studies .

		Later biology became the dominant science and gave di - rection to the current of thought .

		Now psychology has come to the front and holds undisputed sway . ''

		This opinion is one in which the librarian , from his observation of the public , can heartily concur .

		In noting the progress of the intelligent reader there is no opportunity to dwell upon the finer re - lationship of the library to lovers of pure literature .

		After aU , that kind `` cometh not so much with ob - servation . ''

		The intelligent reader does not always develop into the `` gentle reader , '' but when he does the librarian has reached his ultimate reward .

		To the list of remarkable old men whose work made bright the century just behind us may now be added the name of a remarkable old woman , who has just closed a life unique in literature , noble in its endeavor and its fulfilment , and yet who was but a name to thousands of persons who were deeply her debtor for pleasure and for instruction .

		Of her interesting life I am sure the readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	will be glad to have this account .


Mary # lizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	on the
26th of July , 1822	DATE	.

		She was the six - teenth in line of direct descent from Sir
John de Wormele	PERSON	, of the
Manor of Hatfield	ORGANIZATION	,
1312	DATE	, -- and the sixth , from
Ralph Wormeley	PERSON	of Rosegill , in
Virginia	LOCATION	, who was one of the founders of
William	LOCATION	and
Mary Col	PERSON	- lege .

		Her father , a later
Ralph Wormeley	PERSON	, was born in
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1786	DATE	, but was taken to
England	LOCATION	in his boy - hood , bred as an Englishman , entered His Majesty 's navy , and served so long and in so distinguished a manner , as to reach the rank of Rear Admiral before his retirement .

		After many daring deeds on many seas , and in many old sea-fights , he returned to
America	LOCATION	long enough to woo and win Miss
Caroline Preble	PERSON	, the daughter of an old East Indian merchant of
Boston	LOCATION	, whose brother .

		Commodore
Edward Preble	PERSON	, was one of the heroes of our early navy .

		A child so born could hardly help having an outlook on life out of the ordinary .

		It was
London	LOCATION	to-day ,
Boston	LOCATION	or
Newport	LOCATION	to-morrow , then
Virginia	LOCATION	, then En - gland again , in the rather unsettled life of the parents who ere long had four merry little children to look after ; and in the family migrations , and at her father 's house , she saw a thousand sights , and heard a thousand stories , which formed the broad and solid foundation on which rested her quick appreciation of different points of view : the wide outlook upon public affairs , and the intense interest in everything which pertained to hu - manity , which stood her in such good stead in the years which were to come and made her one of the most delightful of companions .

		Nothing could be more full of drollery than were her tales of her life as parlor boarder in a little school kept in
Ipswich	LOCATION	-- sacred to the memory of Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	!

		Mrs.
Cockle	PERSON	, the mistress of the school , was the widow of the inventor of some fa - mous pills , and was herself greatly interested in antiq - uities and relics of the most unusual sort .

		She went out a great deal in the very Cranford-like society of Ips - wich , taking the little girl with her for safekeeping , little imagining how the bright eyes of the child who sat beside her in her sedan chair were noting the costumes and manners of the ladies discussing the per - missibility of having a lump of sugar in their tea , lest they thereby participate in the crime of human slavery !

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	well remembered attending the funeral services of
William IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the apprehension that filled all
England	LOCATION	lest the young girl who was to be his suc - cessor be found unequal to the great task before her .

		With her mother , she had a place at a window close to the great door of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, through which the girlish
Victoria	PERSON	went to her coronation .

		From the hour in which she saw that little royal figure , until the day when she replaced the pink bow in her point-lace cap by a black one in token of her sorrow for the death of the aged Queen , her love and loyalty never wavered , 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, and she followed every step of that wonderful reign with a passion which made her one of its most appre - ciative interpreters .

		In the
London	LOCATION	of the days when Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
Everett	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	represented our country at
St. James	LOCATION	, the Wormeleys were constantly seeing all that was best in English society .

		Admiral
Wormeley	PERSON	's position and his personal charm made for his family a most enviable acquaintance , which the quiet elegance of his wife did much to enhance .

		One of the
Virginia	LOCATION	cousins ,
John Randolph	PERSON	of
Roanoke	LOCATION	, was a frequent vis - itor at this time .

		In
1839	DATE	, after the charming fashion of the old days , the family made a leisurely journey through
France	LOCATION	.

		They were in
Paris	LOCATION	when the remains of Napoleon were brought thither from
St. Helena	LOCATION	, and
Elizabeth	PERSON	witnessed the splendor of that second funeral .

		She made her debut at the balls of
Louis Phillippe	PERSON	, of whose uncourtly court she had a score of interesting stories .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	, too , the Wormeleys were intimate in the family of a tall young man who had brought his two little girls thither to be reared by his mother , their own being hopelessly insane .

		He was just printing a novel the success of which seemed to be extremely doubtful -- `` Vanity Fair '' !

		In
1842	DATE	Elizabeth came over to
America	LOCATION	to visit the family of
William H. Prescott	PERSON	, the historian , meeting all who were worth while knowing in the
Boston	LOCATION	of that splendid day .

		She , and the bevy of young girls of whom the brilliant
Julia Ward	PERSON	-LRB-
Howe	PERSON	-RRB- was the leader , danced and laughed as girls should do , but they read and studied also , and the atmosphere of the home in which Mr.
Prescott	PERSON	was doing his historical work had a great influence on her after-life .

		She later went back to En - i ; land , where she constantly met many delightful per - sonages , and here she printed the first novel she cared to acknowledge , '' Amabel . ''

		In
1851	DATE	her only brother ,
James Preble Wormeley	PERSON	, a man of most brilliant prom - ise , died , and
two years later	DATE	her father set sail on far vaster seas than any he had hitherto sailed .

		The family had returned to
New England	LOCATION	by that time , and the Admiral , as well as the son who had preceded him , and the wife who followed twenty years later , sleep in the old
Newport	LOCATION	burying ground .

		In
1856	DATE	Miss Wormeley married Mr.
Randolph Brandt Latimer	PERSON	, a civil engineer connected with the
Baltimore	LOCATION	and
Ohio Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's life for twenty years after this event was bound up in that of her husband , her children , and her home , broken by an occasional visit to her mother , in
Newport	LOCATION	, or by the duties of caring for the sick , the wounded , and the imprisoned soldiers of the Civil War .

		In
1876	DATE	, however , she entered literature as a serious profession .

		Her fre - quent contributions of stories , poems , and essays made her style so well known to the readers of the best maga - zines that it was not singular that some good guessers traced to her hand the authorship of three of the clever - est novels of the clever '' No Name Series '' which delighted the readers of twenty years ago .

		These were ```` The Princess Am ^ lie , '' '' My Wife and My Wife 's Sister , '' and `` Salvage . ''

		Her life-work was crowned by the brilliant series of historical works in which she reviewed the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	during the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a vast work for any woman to have undertaken ; it was mar - vellous that one past the three-score and ten of the Psalmist 's limit should have even contemplated such a task .

		With sight always feeble , and becoming more impaired each year , she read ceaselessly , she worked ceaselessly .

		She translated , she collected , she arranged , she wrote with an industry which was prodigious .

		`` The unfinished window in
Aladdin	LOCATION	's tower Unfinished must remain '' -- and the volume on
Germany	LOCATION	, on which she was at work when a sudden
fall	DATE	, and the death of the husband to whom she had been devoted for nearly fifty years , stayed forever the busy hand , will never be completed .

		Uniform with these books last named , Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	published '' My Scrap-book of the French Revolution , '' a storehouse of material otherwise unobtainable , and a most readable history of
Judea	LOCATION	; and she produced a mass of translations from the French , among them , '' The Love Letters of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	'' and `` The Unknown '' by
Camille Flammarion	PERSON	.

		Her last published work , which appeared last Fall , was finished after her eighty - first year had closed , and was a work which has made every student of the life of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	her debtor -- '' Talks of Napoleon at

General Gourgaud	ORGANIZATION	's notes .

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	spoke rapidly , and with the mostcharm - ing English accent .

		She was an admirable story teller and an admirable listener as well .

		She had a hearty appreciation of good literature , liking new books , but going back faithfully to the old writers .

		DR.
PARKIN	PERSON	AND THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In your interesting and undoubtedly just article en - titled '' A Perverted Trust , '' in the issue of The Dial for
January 16	DATE	, you make one slight misstatement .

		Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	is in one place said to be '' president of a Canadian college , '' and again , '' himself a college presi - dent , '' and the implication clearly is that this fact influenced him in recommending the granting of the Rhodes scholarships to college graduates , rather than to graduates of preparatory schools .

		As a matter of fact Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	is , or at any rate was until a short time ago -LRB- I think he resigned his position to take charge of the Rhodes scholarships -RRB- , principal of
Upper Canada College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though the name is somewhat misleading ,
Upper Canada College	ORGANIZATION	is a preparatory school , pat - terned after the great public schools of
England	LOCATION	.

		It is to all intents and purposes the preparatory school for
Toronto University	ORGANIZATION	, as the school at Port Hope is for
Trinity University	ORGANIZATION	, Lennoxville school for Bishop 's College , and the school at
Windsor	LOCATION	,
N. S.	PERSON	, for
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Consequently Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	made his recom - mendation -LRB- whether it was just or unjust -RRB- as principal of a preparatory school , not as president of a college , and one is forced to the conclusion that , in deciding against the best interests of the class of educational institutions with which he was himself identified , he must at least have acted in good faith and without prejudice .

		THE DIAL 77 Cfei S ^ fo g00ks .

		From Ensigx to Major-Genebal , .

		* Given the necessary facility as a writer and a glowing enthusiasm for one 's profession or calling , what autobiography could fail to in - terest ?

		Surely not that of a born soldier and leader of men such as Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's '' Story of a Soldier 's Life '' shows him to be .

		Even the most peace-loving of Quakers could hardly open the book without feeling a desire to read on .

		The narrative is brisk , varied , rich in Anecdote , and not untouched with humor -- to say nothing of the inevitable horrors -LRB- or glo - ries -RRB- of war that furnish the main theme .

		Born in
1838	DATE	,
Garnet Wolseley	PERSON	was too joung to hold high command in the Crimean War ; but he showed himself a worthy son of • old
Ireland	LOCATION	-LRB- how many famous British generals Are Irish ! -RRB-

		in the capacity of lieutenant .

		Then followed two years of service in the suppression • of the Indian mutiny of
1857	DATE	; a few months in the
China	LOCATION	war of
1860	DATE	; service in
Canada	LOCATION	, where he assisted in repelling the abortive Fenian invasion and headed the expedition sent to suppress the insurrection at
Fort Garry	LOCATION	in the
Red River	LOCATION	territory ; and finally , so far as this book is concerned , he planned and carried out the Ashantee campaign that humbled
King Koffee	LOCATION	and left the English masters of the
• Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two months ' leave of absence from his Canadian post in
1862	DATE	enabled him to visit Lee 's headquarters and to get an inside view of the Confederate situation , as may be seen by reading his anonymous article entitled '' A Month 's Visit to the Confederate Head - quarters , '' in
Blackwood	LOCATION	's Magazine for Janu - ary , 1
$ 63	MONEY	.

		In breaking off just as he reaches '' the last of life , for which the first was made , '' Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	has withheld the most valuable of his reminiscences ; but these , he leads us to hope , may follow in a later work .

		A brief outline of his life since
1874	DATE	will serve to hint at the riches he still holds in reserve for his readers .

		He was appointed inspector-general of auxiliary forces in
1874	DATE	; governor of

Ireland	LOCATION	,
1890	DATE	, and commander-in - chief of the British army -LRB- succeeding the
Duke of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in
1895	DATE	.

		Finally , as it will be remembered , he retired from this last office in
1900	DATE	, being succeeded by
Lord Roberts	PERSON	.

		Like all men of true courage .

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	is finely sensitive in temperament , even to such a degree that he declares the sight of raw meat has always nauseated him .

		The essence of genuine fortitude has not escaped him in his love for the clash of arms .

		Of certain effemi - nate officers of the famous Light Brigade he writes that they had `` fought well and had nobly led their men straight ; but yet they lacked the manliness to bear for any length of time the hardships and discomforts their men experienced daily . ''

		Continuing , he indicates that the strenuous life is not necessarily that led by the soldier . ''

		He must be a craven indeed , who , being well mounted , would not charge home at the head of his own men .

		It is not thus the noblest form of courage is made manifest , but in the daily endurance of cold and want . ''

		The following extract will throw light on this question of courage in battle , and will at the same time show that , like so many other military leaders , the author is somewhat of a fatalist , a '' man of destiny . ''

		* ' I have often been asked by foolish people if I never felt nervous when in danger .

		I do n't think that many men when in action have time to be nervous , or at least to analyze what is the real condition of their feelings on the point .

		But I often thought to myself before the bullets began to whistle near one , whether I should be killed or not that day .

		I can honestly say the one dread I had -- and it ate into my soul -- was that if killed I should die without having made the name for myself which I always hoped a kind and merciful God might permit me to win .

		All through my life -- sinner though I have been -- I trusted implicitly in God 's providence , I believed He watched over me and intended me for some important work .

		My numerous hair-breadth escapes in action confirmed me all the more in what perhaps others may deem my presumptuous belief . ''

		Before leaving this subject , it is worth while noting one situation which , though the author makes but modest mention of it , must have been a severe test of courage .

		The transport which took him and his company to the Orient in
1857	DATE	struck a reef in the Straits of
Banca	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's men were occupying a por - tion of the lower deck well forward , and there he was obliged to draw them up and wait for the word of command that should permit him to lead them up a narrow ladder and through a small hatchway , and embark them in the ship 's boats .

		Darkness , only made visible by 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the glimmer from the hatchway , a rapidly in - creasing perpendicularity of the deck under foot , and a momentary prospect of the vessel 's slipping off the rock that held her and plunging to the bottom , combined to make the situation a trying one .

		To be drowned like rats in a cage was the inglorious fate that threatened .

		Yet no one bolted , discipline was preserved , and at last an order from above ended the ago - nizing suspense .

		The young captain 's control of his unseasoned company in this instance is significant of much , and prepares us for his subsequent rapid promotion .

		The story of the relief of
Lucknow	LOCATION	has often been told , but none the less will Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's account of it , especially of his own share therein , be found of the highest interest .

		One circumstance is likely to excite comment .


Lord Roberts	PERSON	, who also participated in this hazardous expedition , has duly recorded in his recent book , * ' Forty-One Years in
India	LOCATION	, '' Brevet-Major
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's gallant assault and capture of the mess-house that formed so strat - egic a point on the outskirts of
Lucknow	LOCATION	.

		He has also related how , after the young officer had passed on to pierce an adjacent brick wall and open communications with the beleaguered forces , he himself , after two unsuccessful at - tempts and evidently with much personal dan - ger , raised the flag over the captured position .

		Now our author makes no mention whatever of this fellow-officer , although he does refer to the flag incident in the following rather re - markable manner : `` Some one in after years asserted that I claimed the honour of having hoisted a Union
Jack	PERSON	upon this
Mess House	ORGANIZATION	when we took it .

		My answer was , that it was taken by my company , immediately supported by Cap - tain
Irby	PERSON	's company , also of the 90th Light Infantry , but I did not know who the hero was that had hoisted a flag upon it : all I knew was that it was not I who had done so , and that no flag was hoisted upon the
Mess House	ORGANIZATION	`` rhilst I was in it , and as to what took place after my company had gone through it to take the
Motee Mahul	LOCATION	, I could say nothing . ''

		Is there here some lurking jealousy of his successor in office ?

		The author declares in a prefatory note that naught has been set down in malice ; but we do not even have to read between the lines to catch the personal note on many pages .

		The reader is left in no doubt of
Lord Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's profound contempt for all civilian war secretaries .

		Lord
Cardwell	PERSON	ex - cepted , of the withering scorn he entertains for university-bred staff officers of no military experience , and of his poor opinion of a gov - ernment that refuses to see the necessity of preparing for war in time of peace . ''

		When , '' he asks in despair , `` will civilian Secretaries of State for War cease from troubling in war affairs ? ''

		The American civil war , as viewed by him , '' contains many lessons for all non - military nations , ourselves for example , whose
Army	ORGANIZATION	affairs are ruled in an absolute fashion by a political civilian War Minister . ''

		In the light of history not yet ancient , there is significance in his resentment against the cunning politician who , when anything goes wrong in the manage - ment of a campaign , '' tries to turn the wrath of a deceived people upon the military author - ities , and those who are exclusively to blame are too often allowed to sneak off unhurt in the turmoil of execration they have raised against the soldiers who , though in office , are never in power . ''

		The last of these frequent reflections upon the havoc wrought by politicians in army matters finds its utterance , in a veiled form , in the closing words of the book . ''

		Should my narrative interest the general reader ^ it will be a pleasure to continue it to the date when I gladly bid good-bye to the War Office and ceased to be the nominal Commander-in-Chief of her Majesty 's Land Forces . ''

		Another and more amiable personal feeling is repeatedly voiced in his allusions to this country .

		He declares our army to be , so far at any rate as its membership is concerned , the finest in the world , and West Point the best of military schools in any country .

		In another burst of eulogy he says , '' Of this at least I am certain , that no outsider can have a deeper , a more sincere admiration than I have for their institutions , their people , their great soldiers and sailors , as well as for their writers and men of science . ''

		Again , in praise of patriotism , he indulges in the following panegyric of our country : '' And may I not assert with equal confidence that it is because that sentiment so deeply influences the hearts of the
United States	LOCATION	people that they have become the fore - most nation in the world , far greater than
Washington	LOCATION	and his able colleagues could ever have hoped for or even dreamt of . ''

		Another appeal to our national pride is in his expecta - tion that we shall one day save the world from '' the yellow peril '' ; for , as he thinks ,
China	LOCATION	only wants her
Napoleon	PERSON	or
Peter the Great	PERSON	to enable her to do great things . ''

		I have long selected them , '' he writes , referring to the Chinese , '' as the combatants on one side at the great battle of
Armageddon	LOCATION	, the people of the
United States of America	LOCATION	being their op - ponents .

		The latter nation is fast becoming
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 79 the greatest power of the world . ''

		Is all this from the heart , or has the author a thrifty eye on his American reading and book-buying public ?

		How explain such ready relinquish - ment of all claims to old
England	LOCATION	's unapproach - able preeminence among the world-powers ?

		The pen portraits of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	and
Jackson	PERSON	as seen by our author in camp and field are among the best passages in the book .

		Of Lee he writes in terms of the most ardent admiration . ''

		He was the ablest general , and to me seemed the greatest man I ever conversed with ; and yet I have had the privilege of meeting
Von Moltke	PERSON	and Prince Bis - marck , and at least upon one occasion had a very long and intensely interesting conversation with the latter .

		General
Lee	PERSON	was one of the few men who ever seriously impressed and awed me with their natural , their inhe - rent greatness .

		Forty years have come and gone since our meeting , yet the majesty of his manly bearing , the genial winning grace , the sweetness of his smile and the impressive dignity of his old-fashioned style of ad - dress , come back to me amongst the most cherished of my recollections .

		His greatness made me humble , and I never felt my own individual insignificance more keenly than I did in his presence .

		... As he listened to you attentively , he seemed to look into your heart and to search your brain .

		He spoke of the future with con - fidence , though one could clearly see be was of no very sanguine temperament .

		He deplored the bitterness introduced into the struggle , and also the treatment of the Southern folk who fell into hostile hands .

		But there was no rancour in his tone when he referred to the
Northern Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not even when he described how they had designedly destroyed his home at Arling - ton Heights , the property on the Potomac he had in - herited from
General Washington	LOCATION	.

		He had merely * gone with his
State	ORGANIZATION	' --
Virginia	LOCATION	-- the pervading prin - ciple that had influenced most of the soldiers I spoke with during my visit to the South . ''

		In sharp contrast with this portrait of the born aristocrat is that of the sturdy man of the people ,
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	. ''

		There was nothing of these refined characteristics in
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	, a man with huge hands and feet .

		But he possessed an assured self-confidence , the outcome of an absolute trust in God , that inspired his soldiers with an unquestioning belief in him as their leader .

		They did not ask him where he was going : they were content to follow him , '' Both of the portraits thus outlined are filled in with some elaboration by
Lord Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	, who well likens Lee to the high-born cavalier , while
Jackson	PERSON	was more after the pattern of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's Ironsides .

		The final campaign recorded is that con - ducted by the author against the Ashantees of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, in 1873-74 .

		Its immense difficulties , to say nothing of the deadly cli - mate , make the narrative a thrilling one .

		It deserves a more extended reference , and in fact the book as a whole is worthy of more detailed notice .

		It falls easily into the same class as
Lord Koberts	PERSON	's popular account of his life in
India	LOCATION	, and touches at one point on what that has given in graphic detail .

		Whether like that it will pass through fifteen impressions , besides one for the blind , in little over a year , remains to be seen .

		It deserves to be widely read .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		A
Composite History of our Country	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Perhaps no more disappointing book was issued from the press last year than the volume in the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History '' devoted to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The great but some - what elusive reputation of
Lord Acton	PERSON	, who planned the series , the prestige of the Univer - sity whose name it bears , and the favorable impression produced by the volume on the Renaissance , combined to create an expectation that the volume on the
United States	LOCATION	would prove a valuable contribution to American his - tory .

		There is no other nation whose history presents so great a variety of interests within so short a period of time , and whose progress from insignificant beginnings to great achieve - ment has been so rapid .

		There is great need that some single volume should present in strong color and with a broad stroke the un - derlying forces of this wonderful development .

		Someway it was expected that the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	would furnish this picture , but it might have been foreseen that the production of a dozen writers , chosen in large part at long range upon the basis of their general reputa - tion , and working independently of each other and without unity of plan , would not be satis - factory .

		This at least the event has proved .

		The work of the editors seems to have been confined to the division of the subject matter into chapters and their assignment to various writers .

		The whole period was divided into twenty-one chapters , to which were added two of general review , making a total of twenty - three .

		This is very nearly the division orig - inally made by
Lord Acton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Criticism of the work begins with this division .

		Its most strik - ing characteristic is the extraordinary amount of space devoted to military history .

		Seven chapters are filled with the purely military events of the French War , the Revolution , the War of
1812	DATE	, and the Rebellion , making nearly a third of the whole volume .

		These *
Thb Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Planned by the late
Lord Acton	PERSON	.

		Edited by
A. W. Ward	ORGANIZATION	and others .

		Volume VII. ,
The United States	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, wars were great turning points in American history .

		What is needed is an explanation of the conditions that caused them , a brief out - line of their grand strategy , and a full state - ment of their objective and subjective results .

		Instead we have a mass of military details , and no satisfactory statement of causes and results .

		The details of military events have no bearing upon the study of underlying causes , and could not be sufficiently minute to serve the purpose of the student of military history or of military science .

		They are therefore use - less , and give the book an undesirable '' drum and trumpet '' cast .

		The twenty-three chapters of the volume are divided among thirteen writers , of whom it is stated that but five were chosen by
Lord Acton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the thirteen , four are English and nine are American .

		Of the American writers , all but one are connected with colleges or universities , one as president and the remainder as profes - sors .

		Of the English writers only one appears to be engaged in teaching .

		As there is no uniform mode of treatment , there is no escape from the tedious process of reviewing the work of each contributor seriatim .

		There are four principal contributors .

		The colonial period is for the most part covered by Mr.
John A. Doyle	PERSON	, the Declaration of Independence and the formation of the Constitution by Professor
Melville Bigelow	PERSON	, the period from
1783	DATE	to
1850	DATE	by Professor
McMaster	PERSON	, and the Civil War by the late
John G. Nicolay	PERSON	.

		Ten other chapters , either supplementary or summary , are furnished by the nine other writers en - gaged upon the volume .

		Few men are better acquainted with the his - tory of the English colonies in
America	LOCATION	than Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	, but he lacks the powers of distinguishing between the vital and the accidental and of gen - eralization requisite for condensed statement .

		His chapters are a mass of details with which he seems himself impatient , but which he fails to show were the small beginnings of great things .

		There is no attempt to portray the forces back of the settlement of the different colonies or the forces operating within and characterizing them .

		As a single illustration , instead of show - ing how Antinomianism , by tending to subvert the Puritan theocracy , provoked persecution and contributed to the
New England	LOCATION	disper - sion , he dismisses it with the statement that '' it can only be understood after a careful study of Calvinistic theology . ''

		Of the Revo - lution he says '' no one can speak of the col - onists as loyal subjects goaded into rebellion by persistent ill treatment , '' but does not suf - ficiently explain the causes that did bring about separation .

		There is no adequate ac - count of the sacrifice of colonial to British interests , of the operation of the colonial sys - stem , and of the gradual differentiation of col - onies and mother country .

		The chapters are not even accurate in details .

		Franklin 's plan of union was not approved by the
Albany	LOCATION	Con - gress , but referred to the assemblies with the certainty that it would be rejected ; the re - lation of the
North Carolina	LOCATION	Regulators to the Revolution is misunderstood ;
James War	PERSON	- ren is confused with
Joseph Warren	PERSON	; the pro- visions of the transportation act and the cir - cumstances of Andre 's capture are misstated ;
Jay	PERSON	, whose influence was so important , is not mentioned in connection with the negotiation of peace , and
Laurens	PERSON	appears as
Henry Somers	PERSON	.

		The assignment of an historical sketch of the theory of the Revolution and the forma - tion of the Constitution to Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	is not very different from the employment of an his - torian to try a case in court .

		In the treatment of the first topic Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	subjects a num - ber of contemporary pamphlets upon both sides to careful legal analysis , the result of which is an interesting essay , that especially develops the extent to which the idea of nat - ural right was embodied in the common law but fails to meet the requirement of a history of revolutionary opinion .

		The essay conveys the impression that the colonial argument was fixed and stable , whereas it shifted as the struggle advanced and passed through at least four distinct phases .

		Even less satisfactory is the chapter on the Constitution .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	begins with a sketch of the formation of the state constitutions , apparently with the pur - pose of pointing out the connection between them and the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, and then omits to show the relation .

		His treatment of the latter consists in tracing each one of
Randolph	ORGANIZATION	's resolutions through the debates in the convention to its final form in the completed Constitution .

		This labor is performed with painstaking care , and the result is a useful piece of work , but it is the last thing needed in this particular place .

		Instead of it there should be a careful account of the movement that brought about the convention and a re - statement of the compromises between the con - tending forces within the convention .

		The chap - ter closes with but a single paragraph by way of comment , and that an erroneous one .

		It is
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's conclusion that
Alexander Ham	PERSON	- ilton was the master spirit of the convention .

		This is a tradition , resulting from a confusion of the part that
Hamilton	PERSON	played in bring - ing about the convention and in securing the ratification of the Constitution with his share in the convention itself .


Hamilton	PERSON	's ideas were entirely out of harmony with those of the con - vention , very few of his suggestions met with approval , he was embarrassed by the majority against him in his own delegation , and felt that his influence was so slight that he did not at - tend a considerable part of the sessions .

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	covers the period from the devolution to the Compromise of
1850	DATE	in the well known style of his '' History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		He tells the story chiefly for the purpose of giving '' local color , '' but does not undertake the statement of causes and results .

		Genet appears in his pages as
Genest	PERSON	, but more important is the omission of the real purpose of his mission .

		The statement of the European situation that produced the War of
1812	DATE	is not attempted .

		The story of nullification in
South Carolina	LOCATION	is told , but the momentous consequences of the virtual victory of the nullifiers are passed over in silence .

		The style glides smoothly from point to point without accentuation and conse - quently without perspective .

		Admirable as this may be for purposes of entertainment , it does not make much impression upon the mind or give much understanding of the subject .

		An entire volume written in this vein would meet a popular demand , but the method hardly seems suited to the purposes of this history .

		The standpoint of Mr.
Nicolay	PERSON	's chapters on the Civil War is , of course , that of the Lin - coln History .

		Three of the four are devoted to military events , and about a third of them to the mistakes of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The single chapter on the political phases of the period is much too short to cover the subject .

		It is almost entirely devoted to the abolition of slav - ery .

		The financial history of the struggle is briefly reviewed ; the period of uncertainty at the beginning , the shifting attitude of the North as the struggle advanced , the centrali - zation of government , which was the most im - portant subjective result of the war , and , what is especially surprising , all reference to for - eign relations , are omitted altogether .

		While the proportion of space given to military events and some of the views expressed may be open to criticism , the style of the whole is good .

		The shorter contributions must be passed in rapid review .

		In the chapter by Miss
Mary Bateson	PERSON	, Lecturer in
Newnham College	LOCATION	, upon the French in
America	LOCATION	, the material is thor - oughly mastered , admirably organized , and well presented .

		It is a model of the mode of treatment which should have been applied to the whole book .

		The chapter on the French War by Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	, an English author who lived for some time in the
United States	LOCATION	and is best known through his '' Fight with
France	LOCATION	for
North America	LOCATION	, '' is an accurate but not very picturesque account of a very pic - turesque contest .

		Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	, another English writer , covers the War of
1812	DATE	and the naval operations of the Rebellion .

		The partic - ular purpose of President
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's chapter on the decade from
1850 to 1860	DATE	is to explain the point of view of the South , a pur - pose which is well accomplished , although he finds it necessary to devote half of his space to an earlier period .

		It is not correct to say that
Utah	LOCATION	and
New Mexico	LOCATION	were organized '' with nothing said about slavery , '' and President
Wilson	PERSON	seems to have missed the point that
Kansas	LOCATION	and
Nebraska	LOCATION	were organized under precisely the same conditions as were
Utah	LOCATION	and
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Douglas was the most promi - nent man in public life during the decade from
1860	DATE	to
1860	DATE	and received in the latter year a larger vote for the presidency than any South - ern man .

		Here is a phenomenon which Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	does not attempt to explain .

		Supplementary to the chapters on the Civil War , Professor
Schwab	PERSON	furnishes one on the South during the War , which is an acceptable summary of his `` Financial and Industrial His - tory of the Confederate States . ''

		The period since the war is divided between Professor
T. C. Smith	PERSON	, now of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, and Profes - sor
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pro- fessor
Smith	ORGANIZATION	covers the ground thoroughly and systematically to the election of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and is sound and outspoken in his judgments .

		The reconstruction part suffers from lack of space , but otherwise could scarcely be improved .

		Professor
Moore	PERSON	reviews the re - cent diplomatic history of the
United States	LOCATION	, and closes with an account of the peace negotia - tions at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He is absolutely noncommittal on all vital points , apparently considering that his former o # Bicial connection with the Depart - ment of State bars the expression of individual opinion .

		Two summaries , one of economic and the other of intellectual development , complete the volume .

		The former , written by
Professor Emery of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, sets forth the extraordinary 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, agricultural and industrial expansion of recent years , and the latter , written by Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	of

		actual working of libraries in
Germany	LOCATION	and other countries .

		He shows little enthusiasm , and has little to say in criticism of present conditions , merely stating the facts in a calm , judicious manner .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, on the other hand , is nothing if not an enthusiast .

		He has his decided views as to how public libraries should be managed , and when he finds a ten - dency which he considers dangerous , he says so in no uncertain language .

		He is librarian in one of the most progressive municipal libra - ries in
Britain	LOCATION	, and presents the actual working of that particular class of libraries , with very few references to conditions elsewhere .

		But what references he does give are pointed enough , -- as when in his preface he says of American libraries : '' In the
United States	LOCATION	a much higher level of attain - ment has been reached -LSB- than in
France	LOCATION	-RSB- , but here again the paralyzing hand of uniformity has arrested progress after a certain standard of efficiency has become gen - eral .

		American libraries are conducted on lines which closely resemble those of ordinary commercial practice , in which everything is subordinated to the furtherance of profits and economy .

		Their methods are standard - ised , and everything is more or less interchangeable . ''

		The fact which is most forcibly brought out in regard to British municipal libraries is the limitation caused by the working of the library acts in regulating the percentage of the rates which may go to the support of the libraries . ''

		The principal amendment of the Libraries Acts , which authorities of all kinds now agree is essential and paramount to everything else , is the abolition or altera - tion of the rate limitation , which for fifty years has fettered the work of public libraries and in every way hindered their proper development .

		... If no limita - tion is placed upon the rates which can be levied for baths and washhouses , tramways , public health , lighting and education , it is surely an anomaly to retain on the Statute Book a restriction such as the fixing of the library rate , mainly , one supposes , because it was imposed about forty-seven years ago . ''

		The author of this book has long been an earnest advocate of '' safeguarded open access , '' that is , of giving the public access , under pro- per supervision , to all or most of the books in public libraries , and the last chapter is a full statement of the arguments in favor of this plan , chiefly quoted from a pamphlet published in iy99 under the title `` Account of the Safe - guarded Open-Access System in
Public Lend	LOCATION	- ing Libraries .

		Prepared and circulated by the librarians in charge of English open-access public libraries , '' and of which Mr.
Brown	PERSON	presumably is the chief author .

		He says here : '' The main object held in view by the advocates of open access is the extension of the usefulness of public libraries and books by enhancing their educational value

		in a practical and satisfactory manner .

		... To secure the end in view , methods of exact classification have been introduced into the safeguarded open-access libra - ries , by means of which it is possible to display to readers in one place the books possessed by the library on any specific subject . ''

		In this connection , as well as in the chapters especially devoted to that subject , the import - ance of classification of books on the shelves of public libraries is emphasized . ''

		Roughly , the plan most in vogue in English public libraries is to establish from six to twenty main classes like A Theology , B Sciences , C Biography , D History , E Fiction , etc. , and to number the books in each class consecutively as received , without regard to their sub - jects .

		... A more chaotic and unbusinesslike arrange - ment probably does not exist anywhere , in any depart - ment of life , than in a numerically arranged English public library on the plan just described .

		It is a mere wilderness of books dumped down on the shelves , with - out regard to topic relationships , or even an elementary idea of order or consistency . ''

		* Besides an earnest plea for the general prin - ciple of classification , three systems are briefly examined , namely the `` Decimal '' by Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	, the `` Expansive '' by the late Mr.
C. A. Cutter	PERSON	, and the `` Adjustable '' by Mr.
Brown	PERSON	.

		Somewhat more space is given to cataloguing ; various rules and methods are described , and the mechanical methods of dis - playing catalogues are fully treated .

		On this latter point the author comes nearer to making a comparative study of methods in various countries than in any other part of his book .

		The question of `` live '' and `` dead '' books , which has agitated American librarians for the last couple of years , is very forcibly treated from the standpoint of a '' workshop '' library which `` provides for the systematic and con - tinuous revision of the stock . ''

		The subject is treated both in the chapter on buildings and in that on book selection . ''

		The museum idea of a public library has been cul - tivated so long , that it is difficult to advance a plea for the more practical workshop idea without raising a storm of opposition from those conservators of literature who imagine that their little parochial libraries rival the British Museum or
Biblioth ^ que Nationale	ORGANIZATION	on a reduced scale .

		Yet , it is this practical workshop side of the question which we desire to advance in opposition to the museum , or haphazard collecting , method , which has for years prevailed .

		... No doubt the difficulty of selec - tion is the main reason why public libraries are allowed to grow up in a haphazard way , because it is a work which demands not only persevering industry , but an encyclopaedic knowledge of literature and the contents of books .

		Nevertheless , we regard this difficulty of selection , and the limitation of the field of selection , as powerful reasons why municipal libraries should com - * This kind of '' classification '' is not entirely unknown in ■ American libraries .

		pletely abandon the museum or storage ideal , and go boldly for making the workshop or practical utility ideal the one most worthy of realization ... Public library buildings should be erected , not on the principle of storing as many books as can possibly be collected in fifty years ' time , but of restricting the book accom - modation to the reasonable limits which careful selection and cautious discarding will fix , and increasing the space available for readers , and giving them only the very best literature , imaginative or instructive , that the world has to offer . ''

		The chapter on book selection is one of the most interesting , and to American readers one of the most valuable , in the whole book .

		The author has here occasion to take issue with an American library primer which he thinks `` may influence young librarians in a disas - trous fashion , '' as when its author recommends buying largely of the cheap books issued in `` series '' or `` libraries , '' which , as Mr.
Brown	PERSON	points out , '' are too often commercial ventures got up to sell by people who have nothing par - ticular to say . ''

		The author sounds a note of warning in re - gard to the particular attention that has lately been given to children 's libraries . ''

		With all respect for the admirable work in con - nection with children 's libraries and the cultivation of intimate relationships with the public schools , both in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Britain	LOCATION	, there is a very grave danger of this particular outlet for library enthusiasm becom - ing a damaging influence on the interests of the general work of public libraries .

		Already there are libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	where everything is subordinated to the special cult of the child , and where the claims of adult readers are being brushed aside in the pursuit of what is largely a sentimental phantasy .

		... There are strong and reasonable doubts as to the wisdom of treating juveniles like a separate class of human beings , and making all kinds of arrangements for their convenience , very often to the inconvenience of adults . ''

		In this connection it should , however , be re - membered that in many neighborhoods chil - dren are the only persons who can or care to avail themselves of the services of public libra - ries , and also that something must he done out - side the schools to interest children in reading for reading 's sake and to instruct them in the use of books as tools .

		When the writer says , `` to many observers , it must appear as if the school educational authorities in
America	LOCATION	and the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	had failed lamentably in their duty of providing elementary education , to warrant such interference on the part of libra - rians , '' he has perhaps touched the real root of the matter .

		The foregoing might be enough to give an idea of the general character of the book and the purpose of its author .

		Besides the 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, chapters here briefly noticed , those on heat - ing , lighting , ventilation , cleaning ; on printed catalogues ; on reading room methods and sub - sidiary departments , deserve particular atten - tion .

		Altogether , it is an admirable work , and one that deserves to be carefully read by Amer - ican librarians and library trustees .

		Though especially dealing with English conditions , the book is full of suggestions of value to libra - rians in any country , particularly in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Each chapter is followed by a short list of references , chiefly to articles in library period - icals .

		That these references are not as numer - ous as those in Dr.
Grasel	PERSON	's `` Bibliothekslehre '' is an advantage to the student .

1900	DATE	-RRB- .

		The list of cataloguing rules on p. 277 is rather inadequate .

		Even the revised British Museum rules are omitted .

		Granted that this book is principally for English librarians , the omission of such important codes as Dr.
Dziatzko	PERSON	's and that for the Prussian libraries is very singular .

		If the book-titles given on p. 66-71 as '' The Librarian 's Library '' had been arranged by subjects instead of alphabetically , it would have been more useful .

		Some of the books in this list are marked by a star to indicate their being '' parti uularly desirable . ''

		Why
Cush	PERSON	- ing 's '' Initials and Pseudonyms '' should be so marked , but not his '' Anonyms , '' is not easy to understand ; nor why the first edition of Cutter 's '' Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue '' should be more desirable than the third .

		That Mrs.

		Why Mr.

		THE DIAL 85 garded their omission from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's catalogue of biblia a-biblia merely in the nature of an oversight , or more likely an intentional exclu - sion of the obvious .

		To reveal the poetic charm that once at - tached to cookery , to prove that the cookery book may be the most delightful of literature , and no doubt also to gratify the proper pride of a collector in an unrivalled collection , has been the threefold aim of Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	in writing her account of `` My Cookery Books . ''

		She scatters our careless illusions on the sub - ject at the outset . ''

		The cookery book has every good quality that a book can have .

		In the first place , it makes a legiti - mate appeal to the collector , and
M. Vicaire	PERSON	and Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	show what the bibliographer can do with it .

		Man , the cooking animal , has had from the beginning a cooking literature .

		What are parts of the Old Tes - tament , of the Vedas , but cookery books ?

		You can not dip into Athenseus without realizing what an inspiration food and drink always were to the Greek poet .

		As for the Romans , from
Virgil	LOCATION	to
Horace	PERSON	, from
Petronius	LOCATION	to
Lucian	PERSON	, praise of good eating and drinking was forever their theme , both in prose and in verse .

		Early French and English historical manuscripts and records are full of cookery ; and almost as soon as there was a printing - press cookery books began to be printed , and they have kept on being printed ever since .

		It would be strange if , among them , there were not a few that provided the excitement of the hunt and the triumph of conquest . ''

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	is not of those who collect for the mere sake of collecting .

		She reads her cookery books , and , moreover , considers that they make the very best sort of reading , -- an opinion which readers of her own book will be quite ready to share .

		Indeed , so persuasive is her charm , that at the end one finds himself bitten with a like enthusiasm , and feels tempted forth - with to begin haunting the book-shops in search of such delightful treasures as are here de - scribed .

		It is in her shelf of seventeenth-century English books , ranging from
Gervase Mark	PERSON	- ham 's '' English Housewife '' to
Giles Rose	PERSON	's `` Perfect School of Instructions for theOflficers of the Mouth , '' that Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	finds great - est pleasure .

		Here are such noted names in gastronomical annals as
Robert	LOCATION
May	DATE	and Will Rabisha ; here also we find the inimitable '' Closet '' of Sir
Kenelm Digby	PERSON	, who cultivated this tenth muse of cookery no less assiduously than his politics or his theology .

		May and
Rabisha	PERSON	were types of the professional cook , the expert in culinary science .

		But
Sir Kenelm	PERSON	, the amateur , is more truly representative of his century .

		He is the connoisseur in epicurism , writing from the heart rather than the head , and clothing his instructions in language as quaint and refreshing as that of
Pepys	PERSON	or Montaigne .

		`` The cookery books are full of this brocaded lan - guage , full of extravagant conceits , full of artificial ornament ; a lover writing to his mistress , you would say , rather than a cook or a housewife giving practical directions .

		After the modern recipe , blunt to the point of brutality ; after the < Take so much of this , add so much of that , and boil , roast , fry , ' as the dull case may be , each fresh extravagance , each fresh affectation , is as enchanting as the crook of Lely 's ladies or the
Silvio of Herrick	ORGANIZATION	's verse .

		I should not want to try the recipes , so appalling often is the combination of savories andi sweets , so colossal the proportions .

		But they were written by artists who had as pretty a talent for turning a phrase as for inventing a new dish .

		Rose leaves and saffron , musk and • amber-greece , ' orange flower andi angelica , are scattered through them , until it seems as - if the feast had been spread only for
Phillis	LOCATION	or
Anthea	LOCATION	.

		And no water can be poured into their pots that is not .

		` fair , ' few blossoms chosen as ingredients that are not • pleasing . '

		Cakes are ' pretty conceits , ' and are gar - nished ` according to art . '

		If cider leaves its dregs , , these are ' naughty , ' and a sweet is recommended be - cause it ` comforteth the Stomach and Heart . '

		The names of the dishes are a joy : the tanzies of violets or cowslips , and the orangado phraises ; the syllabubs and the frumenties , -- ' all - tempting Frumenty ' ; the wiggs and pasties ; the eggs in moonshine ; the conserves of red roses ; the possets without end , almost as lyrical as .

		the poet 's , made ' With cream of lilies , not of kine , And maiden 's blush for spiced wine . '

		And the drinks : metheglin , -- do we not know to the day the date of
Pepys	PERSON	' first ' brave cup ' of it ?

		-- meath , hydromel , hypocras , -- a word that carries one to the - Guildhall buttery , a certain
Lord Mayor	ORGANIZATION	's day , where
Pepys	PERSON	is gayly tippling ; hypocras ' being to the best of my present judgment only a mixed compound drink , and .

		not any wine , ' which he had forsworn by solemn vow .

		< If I am mistaken , God forgive mel but I hope and do think I am not . ' ''

		Coming to the
eighteenth century	DATE	, we reach the choicest gem of the collection , and indeed the most noted volume in all culinary bibli - ography , -- a first edition in `` pot folio '' of
Hannah Glasse	PERSON	's `` Art of Cookery . ''

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	has particular reason to rejoice in her copy , for it reposed at one time in the library of
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	.

		It is not a littla distressing to find that the phrase by which good old
Hannah Glasse	PERSON	is now chiefly remem - bered , the famous '' First catch your hare , '' is here set down as apocryphal .

		But in the ac - tual identity and mundane existence of the lady herself , whom some critics -LRB- presumably dyspeptic -RRB- have chosen to regard in the light of a culinary Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	, firm belief is ex - pressed by our author .

		The cookery-book of
Hannah Glasse	PERSON	, as she herself modestly dis - claims , is `` not wrote in the high polite stile '' so typical of her day , but the taste of its deli - cious quality afforded in these pages makes u '' 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, wish that some publisher would honor it -LRB- and himself -RRB- with a fitting reprint .

		With
May	DATE	and
Eabisha	PERSON	came , as we have said , the professional element in English cook - ery affairs .

		Soon thereafter began the inva - sion of the French chefs , whose '' kickshaws '' and '' messes '' at first excited the contempt of patriotic Britishers , but before long found per - manent places on the national bill of fare .

		Between the increasing strength of these two influences , the amateur is effectually silenced by the middle of the eighteenth century , or soon after
Hannah Glasse	PERSON	's day .

		Henceforth there are no more little confidences between cook and consumer , no more flattering compro - mises to the individual taste , no more little allegories and dainty mysteries .

		Now it is the master-cook , or chef , bolstered up with a pedigree of service in various kitchens of the nobility , who from the fulness of his expert knowledge loftily directs us to do thus and so , exactly that and no more .

		Though the charm of manner , the refreshing naivete , is not always lacking in these latter eighteenth - century books , as a rule the tone is too pon - tifical to be edifying .

		Often , too , disdain of the amateur 's flowery periods leads to a de - pressing bluntness . '' '

		Stick your pig just above the breast-bone , ' says Mrs.
Elizabeth Raffald	PERSON	, without any preamble ; ` run your knife to the heart ; when it is dead , put it in cold water . '

		Whoever , after that , would eat of her pig has more courage than I. '' With the beginning of the nineteenth cen - tury , Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	stops short in her account .

		For here the book on cookery seems to change its character completely , becoming for the most part the dull practical affair that all of us are familiar with , the prosaic '' kitchen
Baedeker	PERSON	, '' lacking always in grace and not seldom in sense .

		Though she devotes an interesting chapter to the foreign books in her collection , it is evi - dent that here Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	loves rather by allowance than with personal love , -- to use
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's distinction .

		Following this chapter is the Bibliography , occupying more than a third of the entire volume .

		The author has not attempted to rival M.Vicaire , with his 2500 entries .

		She has done no more than prepare a descriptive list of the books that she herself owns , -- and even this within certain stated limits .

		The work is done extremely well , and this part of the book , aside from its value for reference purposes , is not less inter - esting than the rest .

		We should like , were it possible , to devote as much space to the form of Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's volume as we have to its matter , so excellent an example is it of distinguished bookmaking .

		Produced by the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	in an edition limited to 330 copies , it well sustains the repu - tation of that concern for results in artistic printing hardly equalled by any other Amer - ican press .

		It is quarto in size , printed on unbleached Arnold handmade paper , from a plain modern face of type , the page being altogether devoid of ornamentation .

		The bind - ing is a combination of marbled paper sides and linen back , with paper title-label .

		A num - ber of illustrations , consisting of old portraits , title-pages , colophons , etc. , in facsimile , add a pleasing antiquarian air .

		These are printed on paper of antique appearance , and mounted on blank pages throughout the book .

		So suc - cessful is the process of reproduction and printing , that these illustrations have every appearance of the originals , and even an expert might , at first glance , think that the volume had been extra-illustrated directly from Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's collection .

Italy	LOCATION	, and thereby lost his duchy and died miserably in the dungeons of
Loches	LOCATION	.

		Elizabetta Gonzaga , her sister-in - law and most intimate friend , was the wife of
Guidobaldo Montefeltro	PERSON	, Duke of
Urbino	LOCATION	, whose state was twice treacherously seized , once by
Caesar Borgia	ORGANIZATION	, and again by
Lorenzo dei Medici	ORGANIZATION	.

		Elizabetta Gonzaga was celebrated alike for her virtues and her misfortunes , and is the Duchess of
Urbino	LOCATION	whose praises are so devotedly sounded by
Count Baldessare Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tiglione , in II Cortegiano .

		Another kinsman was the
Connetable de Bourbon	ORGANIZATION	, son of
Isabella	LOCATION	's sister-in-law ,
Chiara Gonzaga	PERSON	and
Gilbert de Montpensier	ORGANIZATION	.

		The marriage of
Lucrezia Borgia	LOCATION	to
Isabella	LOCATION	's brother ,
Duke Alfonso d'Este	PERSON	, made a connection with the papal court of Alexander VI. , and led later to a second French alliance , when
Lucrezia	ORGANIZATION	's son ,
Duke Ercole II.	PERSON	, married
Renee	PERSON	, daughter of
Louis XII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and sister to
Queen Claude	PERSON	.

		By these various marriages the little court of
Mantua	LOCATION	became personally related to the courts of
Ferrara	ORGANIZATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Milan	LOCATION	,
Urbino	LOCATION	,
Eome	ORGANIZATION	, and
France	LOCATION	.

		The marriages reveal the state - craft of the time .

		Isabella d'Este was no match-maker , but she was the clever woman of her family , much cleverer than her hus - band , who was a blunt soldier , a better gen - eral than diplomatist , and often absent in the field .

		On these occasions he left his wife to govern the marquisate , and her success in maintaining the integrity of a small and com - paratively poor state through more than forty years of incessant war and intrigue , in which almost everybody else went down , sometimes more than once , explains
Cardinal Bembo	PERSON	's eulogy of her , `` the wisest and most for - tunate of women . ''

		An extant letter from
Isabella	LOCATION	d'Este to her son , the first Duke of
Mantua	LOCATION	, shows that in general she considered the papal alliance safest for
Mantua	LOCATION	.

		But at this time ,
1521	DATE	, she had already permitted the young Federico to make a long visit at the French court , and later she entertained the Emperor ,
Charles V.	PERSON	, magnificently in
Mantua	LOCATION	.

		The most dramatic bit of politics in which Isabella d'Este was engaged , characteristic at once of her and of her time , is the story of the red hat .

		She determined that her third son ,
Ercole	PERSON	, should be a cardinal , and had in vain asked for his elevation from Pope after Pope .

Clement	PERSON	hesi - tated , intrigued , and put her o # f , and Isabella ^ went on buying medals and antiques .

		Guic - ^ ciardini quotes the French ambassador ,
Du Bellay	PERSON	, to the effect that when the imperial allies were actually under the walls of
Rome	LOCATION	the terrified Pope summoned
Renzo da Ceri	ORGANIZATION	and ordered him to collect at once one thousand men to defend the city .

		But it was impossible to raise as many ducats .

		In his extremity Pope
Clement	PERSON	thought of the lady in the
Colonnai	LOCATION	palace .

		He appointed five new cardinals , each of whom paid forty thousand ducats , about half
a million dollars	MONEY	, into the papal treasury .

		On .


Sunday	DATE	,
May 5 , 1527	DATE	, Cardinal Pizzino carried a red hat to the Marchesa of
Mantua	LOCATION	in the
Palazzo Colonna	LOCATION	.

		The sack of
Rome	LOCATION	began at dawn on
Monday	DATE	,
May 6	DATE	.

		The one obstacle that
Isabella	PERSON	d'Este could not overcome until the stress of the eleventh hour was the fact that her nephew , the
Connetable de Bourbon	ORGANIZATION	, was leading the imperial army , and her second son ,
Ferrante	PERSON	, was captain of a Spanish troop in it .

		This string to her bow now saved her .

		The palace of the Marchesa of
Mantua	LOCATION	and the
Cancellaria	LOCATION	, occupied by
Cardinal Colonna	ORGANIZATION	, .

		were the only two houses in
Rome	LOCATION	that escaped spoliation .

		For a week
Isabella	PERSON	was practically a prisoner , but at the end of that time her son
Ferrante	PERSON	, with a strong Spanish guard , escorted ' her out of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		She carried with her many art treasures collected during the two years , and the red hat , which she had the pleasure herself of placing on her son 's head .


Ercole Gonzaga	PERSON	was in his twenty-second year when his mother made him a cardinal ; he was forty when he presided over the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , however , in her relations to the art and literature of the Renaissance that
Isabella d'Este	LOCATION	is most interesting .

		She was an intel - ligent and , for her means , munificent patron of art , and employed agents in all the large cities of
Italy	LOCATION	to keep her informed as to what was going on in the world of art and archaeology .

		The sculptor ,
Christoforo Romano	PERSON	, was her confidential adviser for many years .

		Christo - foro 's friend , the
Knight Templar Fra Sabba da Castiglione	ORGANIZATION	, exiled to the island of
Rhodes	LOCATION	, wrote to her that in the garden of the Grand Master there were '' many excellent sculptures `` 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, lying despised and uncared for , exposed to • wind and rain , which made him feel as if the bones of his father lay unburied . ''

		The Mar - • < 5he8a of
Mantua	LOCATION	collected her art treasures in ` her Studio of the
Grotta	PERSON	in the castello , a suite of rooms whose walls were hung with pictures by
Mantegna	PERSON	,
Costa	LOCATION	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	,
Bellini	PERSON	, and
Correggio	LOCATION	.

		A series of these pictures , now in the Galerie des Sept Metres of the
Louvre	LOCATION	, were called '' triumphs '' and were produced by successive orders of Isabella d'Este in carrying • out a general scheme .

		Having a definite idea of the '' triumph '' she wished depicted ,
Isabella	PERSON	communicated it to the humanist poet , Paride da Ceresara , who returned to her an elaborate fantasia of the subject .

		This fantasia she sent to the painter , together with threads showing the exact dimensions of the proposed picture , and information as to the place it was to oc - cupy , the light , neighboring pictures or objects in the Studio , and the like .

		Braghirolli counted ` fifty-three letters written by
Isabella d'Este	PERSON	to the artist and her agents before
Perugino	PERSON	's • * ' Triumph of Chastity '' was finally hung on her walls .

		The only great painter out of whom ` Isabella got no work was
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fantasia in this case was simple enough , '' a youthful Christ of about twelve years , '' but
Leonardo	PERSON	could not be brought to tie his genius to a lady 's ribbons , and the picture was never painted .

		This fact may not be without signifi - cance as to the red chalk drawing in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, reputed to be of Isabella d'Este by ^ Leonardo .

		Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	accepts the repute and furnishes a copy of the drawing for the front - ispiece of the first volume of her work .


Signor	PERSON	-LRB-
Luzio	LOCATION	, director of the Eoyal Archives of Man - tua , in an article in the Emporium on
Isabella	LOCATION	's portraits , declines to accept the drawing as her likeness , and indeed a comparison of the front - ispiece with the medal portrait of
Christoforo iKomano	PERSON	, figured at page 170 , would seem to sustain
Signor Luzio	PERSON	's judgment .

		Apart from the doubtful drawing in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, it is a - question whether any woman of the Renais - sance sat more often to artists than
Isabella ■	PERSON	d'Este .

		At different ages , her portrait was painted by
Raphael	PERSON	's father ,
Giovanni Santi	PERSON	, by
Andrea Mantegua	PERSON	, the Mantuan court painter , by
Gianfrancesco Maineri	PERSON	, by
Lorenzo Costa	PERSON	, by
Francia	LOCATION	, and by Titian twice , an original and a copy of
Francia	LOCATION	.

		In the seven - teenth century Rubens copied both of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's portraits .

		It is a pity that
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's original portrait , described in the inventory of the pictures of
Charles I.	PERSON	as a '' Duchess of Man - tua , in a red gowne , '' came to light in
England	LOCATION	only
last year	DATE	, too late to be printed in Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's book .

		There was something Greek in
Isabella	LOCATION	d'Este 's type of mind , art-loving and full of intellectual curiosity , ever desirous to learn some new thing , desiderosa di cosa nova , as she said of herself .

		She carried on a large correspondence and had a curious faculty for getting early news of things .


Messer Pandolfo Pico	PERSON	della
Mirandola	LOCATION	wrote to her
Easter Eve	ORGANIZATION	,
1520	DATE	, of the death of Raphael on Good
Friday	DATE
night	TIME	: '' Here we talk of nothing but the death of this great man , who has ended his first life at the age of thirty - three .

		His second life , that immortal fame which knows neither time nor death , will endure eternally , both by reason of his works and by the labors of scholars who will write his praises , and who will find in him a never failing theme . ''

		`` Within five weeks after the JVina dropped anchor in the little harbor of Palos , the news reached
Mantua	LOCATION	that '' a man named
Colum	PERSON	- bus has lately discovered an island for the
King of Spain	ORGANIZATION	, on which are men of our height but of copper-colored skin , with noses like apes . ''

		One of the most interesting of Isabella d'Este 's correspondents was the papal nuncio ,
Francesco Chiericati	PERSON	, who gave her a great deal of information about the lands and peoples he visited in the course of various diplomatic mis - sions .

		Chiericati introduced to her his servant , the chevalier
Antonio Pigafetta	PERSON	, of
Vicenza	LOCATION	, who , '' for to see the marvels of the ocean , '' accompanied
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	in the first circumnavi - gation of the globe .

		Pigafetta went to see Isabella at her request and took with him his journal kept during those three years '' Of moving accidents by flood and field , '' which
Chiericati	PERSON	had described to her as `` a divine thing . ''

		A letter from
Chiericati	LOCATION	to
Isabella	LOCATION	dated
Middelburg	LOCATION	,
Zealand	LOCATION	,
28th August , 1517	DATE	, con - tains an entertaining account of his trip to
Ireland	LOCATION	, during the
summer	DATE	of that year , to see the celebrated
Purgatory of St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	in
Lough Derg	LOCATION	.

		The papal legate prudently de - clined to enter the purgatorial cave of the saint , but waited outside for his companions for ten weary days , during which time , he says , he ate up the greater part of the food of the pilgrims , who were fasting within on bread and water .

		The comfortable nuncio did not , however , escape purgatory after all , for on the return journey , he records of Down : '' In this
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 place I could not walk about the streets with - out being pursued by people , who came running out of their houses to kiss my clothes , when they heard I was the Pope 's nuncio , so I was forced to stay in .

		Such is the annoyance which arises from over-much religion !

		But the good bishop -LSB- an Italian -RSB- treated me very kindly , and gave me some excellent fishing . ''

		Isabella d'Este 's library of the
Grotta	PERSON	was quite as unique as her paintings , sculptures , and objets d'art .

		For fifty years she collected books , not only rare manuscripts and illumi - nated books , but French and Spanish romances , the Aldine classics , Latin translations from the Greek , and contemporary Italian literature .

		Poets , novelists , and humanists alike sent their works to the great lady who read everything .

		Trissino described her in his JRitratti ^ and sent her a canzone , to '' My Lady Isabella playing on the Lute , '' which celebrates her charms at the age of forty-seven .


Bernardo Tasso	PERSON	pre - sented her his book of poems , II Lihro degli Amori , with a pretty letter .

		Once during an illness , her brother .

		Cardinal d'Este , dispatched
Ariosto	PERSON	to her , who beguiled the weariness of convalescence by reading to her the
Orlando Furioso	LOCATION	.

		Later the poet sent her a copy of the third edition of his poem , containing the famous lines in her praise , beginning '' D ^ opere illustre e di bei studi arnica '' By way of thanks
Isabella	PERSON	invited
Ariosto	PERSON	to
Mantua	LOCATION	to meet the Emperor Charles V .

		The novelist ,
Bandello	LOCATION	, lived for two or three years in the Dominican monastery in
Mantua	LOCATION	, and many of the ladies and gentlemen of Isabella d'Este 's court figure in his pages .

		There is the
Marquis Francesco	PERSON	, fond of rough jests ; his brother Giovanni , '' as honest and sensible a man as ever lived '' ; Paride da Cer - esara , '' a man after the heart of
Terence	PERSON	, qui nihil humani a se alienum putat '' ;
Aldo Man	PERSON	- uzio , the printer ;
Pomponazzi	LOCATION	, the skeptical Bolognese professor ;
Alessaudro Baesso	PERSON	,
Isa	LOCATION	- bella 's seneschal , '' old in years , but singularly merry in disposition '' ; and Madama herself , coming into the company announced by the barking of her pet dogs , and perhaps starting a discussion on the distinction between wit and humor .

		Oddly enough , Bandello dedicates to the serene and correct Marchesa of
Mantua	LOCATION	his tragical story of the loves and crimes of the Countess of
Celant	PERSON	, '' The Insatiate Countess '' of
John Marston	PERSON	.

		The dedication is of a piece with the letter Isabella d'Este wrote for Ban - dello , vouching for his '' religious and modest life , '' and begging the vicar-general of the Dominicans '' to hold him dear , and to honor him as his infinite virtues deserved . ''

		Isabella d'Este was a woman of the
Kenais	PERSON	- sance .

		Unlike
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	and Mar - guerite of Valois , she was not affected by the new doctrines of the Reformation .

		In
Ariosto	PERSON	's phrase , her religion was '' that of other people . ''

		Her fate as a wife was not different from that of women of her time generally , but her own family relations were simple and domestic .

		Although she led an active life , full of many interests , she was the mother of eight children of whom she reared six .

		An anecdote related in the
Ferrarese Archives	ORGANIZATION	illustrates Isabella d'Este 's personal attitude towards contempo - rary manners .

		At the marriage of her brother ,
Alfonso d'Este	PERSON	, to
Lucrezia Borgia	LOCATION	, she refused to allow any of her ladies to be present at the representation of Plautus 's comedy ,
Casina	LOCATION	^ which she described as '' immoral beyond words . ''

		This play , by the way , Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	calls
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- saria , confusing Plautus with
Ariosto	PERSON	.

		It is unfortunate that with her undoubted gift for popularization Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	has not known better her limitations .

		More discreetly she might have written an entertaining account of Isa - bella d'Este in one volume .

		Instead , she prints an imposing array of authorities which have the flimsiest relation to her text , or none at all , and her publisher has had to pay an in - demnity to the two Italian scholars most griev - ously exploited .

		Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	has agreed not to sanction an Italian translation of her book .

		If it comes out again in English , it is to be hoped that it will be carefully revised .

		The readable English style leaves something to be desired in taste as well as grammar .

		Raphael as '' the Urbinate , '' St.
Peter	PERSON	as '' the Prince of the Apostles , '' and
Lucrezia Borgia	PERSON	'' washing her head '' run on all fours as English , and it is not English to the manner born .

		Proper names throughout Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's work are most uncertain . ''

		Girolamo da
Casio	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- I. 320 -RRB- appears as ''
Girolamo	PERSON	di
Casio	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- IL 311 -RRB- and ``
Girolamo Casio	PERSON	'' -LRB- L 388 -RRB- .

		`` Brogna '' -LRB- I. 72 -RRB- is `` Brognina '' -LRB- II .

		81 -RRB- , but she is indexed as two persons -LRB- II .

		396 -RRB- .

		It only adds to the mystery shrouding the fate of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's Sleeping Cupid to refer to it -LRB- I. 272 -RRB- as ``
Michel Angelo	PERSON	's sleeping Cupids . ''

		And why should Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	quote Shakespeare from the `` Quarterly Review '' ?

August , 1887	DATE	, with his mother , the Adirondack !

		wife , and stepson ,
Robert Louis	PERSON	and elsewhere .

		StevensoD Started for
America	LOCATION	and the Adirondacks in quest of health .

		After a rig - orous but bracing winter at
Saranac	LOCATION	, the party pro- ceeded to
California	LOCATION	and set sail in the yacht
Casco	LOCATION	for the
Marquesas Islands	LOCATION	.

		Having cruised about , with longer and shorter pauses at different points in the
South Seas	LOCATION	, they recrossed the line and found themselves in
Honolulu	LOCATION	at the end of
January , 1889	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Margaret Isabella	PERSON	-LRB-
Balfour	LOCATION	-RRB-
Stevenson	PERSON	, the proud and devoted mother of her famous son , left a pleasant record of these wanderings in letters home , now collected and published under the title , '' From Saranac to the Marquesas and Beyond '' -LRB- imported by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The experiences chronicled are as varied as the degrees of tempera - ture experienced in passing from a winter in the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	to a
summer	DATE	in the tropics .

		To be - guile the tedium of the cruise , the party used to '' decline and
fall	DATE	, '' after the manner of
Silas Wegg	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Boffin	PERSON	.

		With the dusky denizens of the southern seas they struck up friendly relations ; and it is this disposition to enter into the spirit of all that was new and interesting and wholesome that made their outing so enjoyable to themselves , and Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	's account of it so entertaining to the reader .

		The editor ,
Miss Marie Clothilde Balfour	PERSON	, has supplied footnotes , an index , and fifty fine-print pages of illustrative matter drawn from a considerable range of sources , notably from
Herman Melville	PERSON	, whose vivid pictures of south-sea life are regarded by
Miss Balfour	LOCATION	as more trust - worthy than they are commonly considered .

		For some reason she repeatedly refers to bis '' Omoo '' as '' Omua . ''

		Two unfamiliar portraits of the boy
Stevenson	PERSON	and three of his mother are among the illustrations .

		An Introduction by Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	's brother , Dr.
George W. Balfour	PERSON	, contains some items of interest concerning the
Balfour	PERSON	family and the old manse where they lived .

		Possibly no other of our
American futud/amai	ORGANIZATION	.

		poet-dramatists has Mr.
Francis Howard Williams	PERSON	's acquaintance with the technique of the stage .

		As a result , the three little dramas in his new volume , ' ■ ' ■ At the Rise of the Curtain '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , seem ready-made for the use of the theatre .

		The speeches in them are short , there is a continual movement , and theatrical effects abound .

		The pieces are tragic in theme , though the last one ends happily .

		The longest , '' Holyrood , '' is a new study of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, a projection of the scenes incident to the murder of Biccio .

		We are inclined to think that nothing the Queen of Scots did in her lifetime was so deplorable as the apolo - getic histories and plays she has been the occasion of since her death .

		Scott 's picture of her was frankly romantic , and , slurring over the darker passages of her history , is full of charm .


Schiller	PERSON	's play is cast in large dramatic form , but as far as reality is concerned , is hardly more than a myth .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's vast and elaborate apology for and explanation of her character seems to us poor drama and poor art .

		A thoroughly bad woman , who is admitted to be bad , may be a great dramatic figure , vide Cleopatra and Becky Sharp ; but a bad woman who poses , or is posed , as rather better than an angel , is simply detestable .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	does not apologize for
Mary	PERSON	, and he has at least given the essentials of her character and situation in terse , bright form .

		The other two pieces we think are much better . '

		< Nemesis '' is a story of
Milan	LOCATION	, of the fifteenth century .

		It relates the revenge planned by Alfeo , a court jester , against
Sforza	PERSON	, the great mer - cenary captain of the day , for the seduction of his wife .

		It is told in terse lines full of wit and fire , and is worked up to a thoroughly dramatic crisis .

		In fact , the acting capabilities of the piece seem to us remarkably good .

		We are not sure that psy - chologically Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has quite made out his case ; for the emotion of gratitude , which at the last moment overpowers
Alfeo	ORGANIZATION	's hatred and makes him take upon himself the death he had planned for his enemy , seems to us a trifle overstrained . ''

		Marie del Carmen '' is the most human and beautiful of Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's trio of curtain-raisers .

		It tells the story of a Spanish woman who hides and saves her hus - band from the search of a detachment of French soldiers .

		The situation is this : Her husband is hidden in the house , and she is given half an hour to disclose his hiding-place on the penalty of the loss of her baby .

		Meanwhile a sentry is placed over her , and her business is to use her time in moving the soldier to permit her husband 's escape .

		There is a vague resemblance in the situation to that scene in
Dumas	LOCATION	where Lady
Winter	DATE	seduces the Puritan officer
Fenton	PERSON	from his duty .

		But Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's heroine works only with the noblest and most exalted means of persuasion , and it is a tribute to her purity and devotedness that we feel the sentinel hero is justified , in the end , in yielding to human emotion , and , by the most direct dereliction of duty , aiding the escape .

		A
Massachusetts	LOCATION	woman of mature aZZZZ ' ^ years .

		Jeft a widow just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War , found re - lief for her sorrow in the vocation of nurse in the hospitals of the
Union Army	ORGANIZATION	on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast .

		The advent of the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian war , in
1870	DATE	, spurred her again to the same occupation ; and , going to
Germany	LOCATION	, she succeeded , after some diffi - culty , in securing employment in the Prussian field and post hospitals in
France	LOCATION	.

		Out of this duplicated experience came numerous letters to friends in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, from this nurse , Mrs.
Mary Phinney von Olnhausen	PERSON	, and a fragmentary '' Diary '' or `` Autobiography , '' written by her at the time .

		These have been preserved by her friends , and since her death have been edited by loving hands , and made the basis of a newly-published
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi 91 volume entitled '' Adventures of an
Army Nurse	ORGANIZATION	in Two Wars '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The hos - pital services of this lady during the Civil War were so efficient as to win her hearty conamendation while that war was still going on , and their illus - tration in these reminiscences will revive the war - time recollections of many readers .

		These papers have not been so over-edited as to rob them of the flavor and feeling of the strenuous time in which they were written , and their genuineness and contemporaneousness are unmistakable .

		Mrs.
von Olnhausen	PERSON	was a keen observer and an interesting narrator .

		Her description of the deficiencies and hardships of a '' convalescent camp '' of the Civil War is faithful and vivid , as the writer of this notice can testify from his own recollection of a similar institution of the same period .

		The harsh treatment which military necessity often imposed upon wounded and sick soldiers , the unnecessarily rough conduct of some army surgeons , the genial manners of many others , and the embarrassments surrounding a woman nurse in camp and hospital , are all sharply portrayed .

		Contrast is inevitably suggested between the best work of the medical profession in those days and surgical achievements in more recent years .

		But it is notable that this experienced and capable nurse testified , at the time of the Franco-Prussian war , to the inferior work of the surgeons in that conflict , as contrasted with the accomplishments of American surgery nearly a decade earlier .

		What she relates of the malingering of some of the rank and file , the quest of inefficient officers for `` soft places , '' and the eagerness of both active and inactive holders of position , in both staff and line , to divert to their own use supplies and dainties intended for the sick , seems a prophetic suggestion of the greed and `` graft '' with which the American public is recently becoming too pain - fully familiar .

		The eminently unselfish character of the work of this brave lady won for her the rare honor of the Iron Cross of
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		If ever a literary censorship is estab - Senrible articles t u j • iU - i j j ; i ^ u r about book-bindinff . ''

		^ hed m this land of the free , it may well be on account of the exaspera - tion of the free with misleading and inexact book - titles .

		The careless christening of a book is often - times the reason for its only fault , but it is a most trying blemish .

		Miss
S. T. Prideaux	PERSON	has made a vol - ume of eight magazine articles -- pleasant articles and well-written , but nothing can be slighter than eight magazine articles unless it be nine , -- to which she has given the name '' Bookbinders and their Craft '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is an admirable title in itself , broad - minded , comprehensive , and would do so well on the back of an encyclopaedia that one is afraid , if
Miss Prideaux	LOCATION	ever publishes a really exhaustive volume , she will regret this early prodigality .

		They who are all the Bookbinders and half the title , are
Roger Payne	PERSON	, treated individually ; some modern French and some early Italians , treated collectively ; and some minor craftsmen and almost legendary schools of a somewhat crepuscular character , found in the byways aside from the great historic high - way along which the craft has developed and de - clined .

		There is also a review of '' Les Relieurs Fran ^ ais '' by
M. Thoinan	PERSON	, and some notes on pat - tern-making .

		All in all the information contained is neither massive nor overwhelming , but the bouk has a distinct and grateful quality , being written with that interest which comes when long years of acquaintance with a subject has developed a recog - nition of essentials .

		The papers on '' Some En - glish and Scotch Bindings , '' ''
Roger Payne	PERSON	, '' and '' Early Stamped Bindings '' have the most interest , partly from a sort of quiet aloofness of the matter and partly because
Miss Prideaux	LOCATION	's style of descrip - tion , which is somewhat quiet and aloof also , seems to fit the subject .

		It is very pleasant to find a specialist who can write about her subject with a modified rapture that maintains true values .

		Miss
Prideaux	PERSON	does this , and if the historic light she turns on has not the full power of noon , it is how - ever a very pleasant dawn or twilight which , after all , is much better for some localities .

		Some of the things of which Miss
Prideaux	PERSON	writes are interest - ing to happen on , to understand , and to know about , and none the less so because achieved through the medium of a cool , sane style that dominates adjec - tives and uses emphasis with all the discretion of a musical direction .

		`` Ma non troppo '' says the score , and
Miss Prideaux	PERSON	somehow manages the `` non troppo '' -- always excepting in the title .

		Her notes on pattern-making and design leave one calm in the same manner as the historical essays .

		They are not epoch-making nor revelations , but then there is no particular reason why one should expect them to be .

		As the unimpassioned utterance of
Miss Prideaux	LOCATION	's experience one can excuse them quietly and disagree with all if one will , without the acceleration of a single heart-beat , but always with the conviction that the lady has some knowledge of , and sympathy for , her subject .

		The book is of a convenient size , is nicely bound , and well illustrated .

		Some famous ^ he essays contained in Mr.
Andrew	PERSON	mysteries and
Lang	PERSON	's latest volume , '' The Valet 's controversies .

		Tragedy '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , are described by their author as '' studies in secret history . ''

		There are twelve of these studies , but only half of them really belong to the field of history .

		The initial essay is an effort to penetrate a little further into the mystery of the Man with the Iron Mask .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	agrees with those who hold that this famous individual was merely an inoffensive valet who , it was feared , might be in possession of secrets which in reality he knew nothing about .

		While the author 's theory and conclusion in the case seem plausible and are probably correct , they can not be said to be fully established .

		The second essay is devoted to the valet 's master , in the hope of throwing some light on the secret of the servant but confessedly without success .

		Of considerable interest is the study of the
Amy Robsart	PERSON	mystery , which , how - 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, ever , ia left unsolved .

		Still , the author does show that there is no basis for the charge that
Queen Elizabeth	PERSON	had knowledge of
Amy	ORGANIZATION	's impending death .

		The essays on the false
Joan	PERSON	of Are , the murder of Sir
Edmund Berry Godfrey	PERSON	, and the fate of
James de la Cloche	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- a natural son of Charles II . -RRB-

		are of minor importance .

		Students of literature will be interested in the ballad studies , '' The Queen 's Marie '' and `` The Mystery of
Lord Bateman	PERSON	, '' in which the author displays extended knowledge of his subject and great familiarity with his field .

		In the closing essay the Shakespeare-Bacon contro - versy is taken up , and the claims of the Baconians subjected to a most searching analysis which clearly shows their position to be untenable .

		As a piece of literary polemics this is a brilliant effort .

		The remaining studies , dealing with such themes as the '' voices '' of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc and certain historic ghosts , will doubtless interest students of psychology , but they can hardly be termed studies in secret history .

		The volume is of the popular type , and is written in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's vigorous though good-natured En - glish .

		While the essays do not contribute much toward the solution of the mysteries discussed , the author has accomplished something in the way of eliminating certain current errors , and the volume has its value .

		A history I ^ * '' ' J * ^ - Saudys , Public Orator in of classical the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, has scholarship .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ f ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ y ^ ^ ^ g p ^ ^ ^ upon the task of tracing the history of classical scholarship down through the centuries , from its beginnings in the Athenian age to the Revival of Learning .

		The volume now issued as a result of his researches comes only to the year
1350	DATE	, as the mass of material has outgrown the limits originally set .

		A second volume is to follow , and is well on its way to completion .

		We had looked forward to this work with a lively hope that the subject would be treated in a readable manner , and the part of classical scholarship in the development of European civilization clearly and philosophically pointed out .

		We have read this initial volume through with a growing sense of disappointment .

		It is distinctly not readable , and it makes practically no attempt to fix the place of classical scholarship as a force in the development of the race .

		It is simply an enor - mous mass of facts about hundreds of men and a few women who gave more or less attention to the study of the language , literature , and art of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	during the period in question .

		Large num - bers of these facts seem completely isolated and unimportant , and if Dr.
Sandys	PERSON	was aware of any vital relation which they sustain to his subject he has denied his readers the benefit of his knowledge .

		The volume is divided into six '' books , '' treating respectively of the Athenian Age , the Alexandrian Age , the Roman Age of Latin Scholarship , the Roman Age of Greek Scholarship , the Byzantine Age , and the Middle Ages in the
West	LOCATION	.

		The typical chapter in any one of these divisions is as indicated above , simply a collection of facts , with the veriest minimum of illuminating discussion , concerning individual `` scholars . ''

		Perhaps very few classical scholars are satisfied with
Professor Saintsbury	ORGANIZATION	's campaigns in their territory , but for any really vital knowledge of the subject of the book before us we should prefer to send the ordi - nary intelligent reader rather to the first volume of
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' History of Criticism . ''

		We are sorry to make these strictures , for Dr.
Sandys	PERSON	has here - tofore done great and lasting service to the cause of classical learning , both Greek and Roman .

Hartmann	PERSON	to explam in the preface to his `` Japanese Art '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that the book is not intended for ex - perts and connoisseurs , so glaringly obvious is the author 's lack of knowledge of his subject .

		Mis - takes that the merest tyro should have no difiiculty in avoiding abound on almost every page .

		In many instances the Japanese proper names are so spelled as to be almost unrecognizable ; nor is there uni - formity in the orthographic errors .

		For Tokugawa we read '' Takugawa , '' '' Takigawa , '' and even '' Fukugawa . ''

		Instead of Sakya-muni W3 have `` Sakia '' ; the great
Sessha	PERSON	is made to masquerade as `` Sesshin '' ;
Shokwado	PERSON	is metamorphosed into `` Shioukada '' ; while as to ''
Husuyuma Moro	PERSON	, '' it would be a clever expert that could discover his identity .

		This list could be extended almost in - definitely .

		More serious is the distorted perspect - ive that exalts the artists of the popular school of the eighteenth century above the giants of the past .

		Kuniyoshi may have been '' a wild unrestrained talent , with an imagination that was neither to bend nor to break , '' but the world will scarcely agree with the author in regarding Utamaro as '' the most ethereal of painters . ''

		And the explanation of that artist 's reason for using geishas and courtesans as models is , to say the least , amusing .

		There is an excellent chapter on modern Japanese art , and an intelligent description of the technical methods of the Japanese painters .

		But the good in the book is so buried in the mass of misstatements , slipshod phrases , and `` fine writing , '' that like Gratiano 's reasons it may be compared to '' two grains of wheat in a bushel of chaff . ''

		A few of the illustrations are well-chosen ; one is placed upside down ; and the plate entitled `` lacquer-work '' is a reproduction of a piece of cloisonn ^ enamel .

		Mr.
Hartmann	PERSON	as - serts that '' in looking at a statue the optical con - ciousness can not readily be divided . ''

		Possibly this may apply also to looking at enamels !

		It is a remarkable fact that while A new field of j ^ jg ^ e \ \ q , \ q been many contributors Napoleonic study .

		, T i • i • to the military and diplomatic his - tory of the Napoleonic period , very little has been attempted on the civics of that period .

		This defi - ciency has furnished a field for original study on a
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 93 wide topic to Mr.
Herbert A. L. Fisher	PERSON	, whose first results are now presented in a volume entitled `` Studies in Napoleonic Statesmanship in Ger - many '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author tells us that `` no complete history of the civil side of the
Napoleonic Empire	ORGANIZATION	has yet appeared , and indeed , while so much material still remains unpub - lished and unexplored , it is unlikely that the great work will be accomplished in this generation . ''

		His present purpose is therefore to furnish a provisional account which , while not in any way claiming finality of treatment , shall at least be of value in indicating new lines of research .

		This purpose has been admirably fulfilled , for his treatment of condi - tions in
Germany	LOCATION	, both before and during the time of French control , is first of all notable in the evi - dence furnished of the vast unworked sources of information reposing in the archives of various German states .

		These Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	has investigated sufficiently to affjrd him some striking and original results .


Hanover	LOCATION	, for example , is shown to have been burdened with such an antiquated and incom - petent form of government as to explain in part the readiness with which its citizens submitted to Napoleonic control .

		The facts here brought out are largely those of constitutional form and govern - mental machinery ; but the dryness of such descrip - tion is relieved by carefully drawn portraits of the men responsible for the working of that machinery .

		In other ways , also , Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	has succeeded in relieving the tedium of minute investigation , for he has great discrimination in the choice of words , and much power in convincing summation .

		It is his purpose , if the work be well received , to follow it with volumes on
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and Bel - gium .

		Of that favorable reception there can be no doubt ; for even if , as is inevitable in studies of this nature , criticisms are made on the accuracy of this or that historical incident , there can be but one opinion of the service rendered by Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	in opening a new field for historical investigation .

		Another volume of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's cor - More letters j i i i i of
Bismarck	LOCATION	.

		respondence uas recently been pub - lished by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, -- ``
Bismarck	PERSON	's Letters to his Wife from the Sesxt of War , 1870-1871 . ''

		In the letters published some three years ago those of this period were not included , and it was supposed that they were with - held because they might arouse animosity in official circles .

		But this , it seems , was not the case .

		These letters had been preserved by the Chancellor 's wife in a locked casket , which was not opened at the time of her death .

		A year ago they were found , and last
May	DATE	were given to the public .

		The collection is thoroughly enjoyable , the quantity -LRB- a little over a hundred pages in all -RRB- being just enough to give the flavor of the larger collection without the sense of weariness produced by con - templating the stout volumes of the , former series .

		The tone is naturally very intimate , often humorous or ironical .

		The breaking oflf of negotiations with
Favre	PERSON	in
September of 1870	DATE	because the French '' still get the gripes so severely about
Alsace	LOCATION	, '' or the remark in a postscript , '' Birthday of the King of
Bavaria	LOCATION	and I without my decorations , '' are ex - amples in point .

		The Chancellor 's attitude on the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	and the bombardment of the forts is very sharply stated .

		A very interesting , almost pathetic , letter is the one describing the interview with
Napoleon	PERSON	after Sedan .

		From another point of view the postscript on
January 9 , 1871	DATE	, is inter - esting : '' Read Psalm 27 yesterday in bed and fell asleep comforted with verse 14 . ''

		The thought of trust in God is a dominant note throughout the let - ters , though his confidence that the '' Lord will not intervene '' in behalf of
France	LOCATION	is apt to provoke a smile .

		The translation here presented was made by
Arnim Harder	ORGANIZATION	and is generally idiomatic and satisfactory , though an occasional phrase as '' re - mained on the field '' hardly gives the thought of the original .

		The volume has also an interesting introduction by Mr.
Walter Littlefield	PERSON	.

		The ab - sence of any index is to be regretted .

		Dabney '' -LRB-
Presbyterian Committee of Publication	ORGANIZATION	,
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	-RRB- , we have a full ac - count of the long and useful career of an eminent Southern educator and theologian .

		The name
Dabney	PERSON	-LRB- d'Aubignd -RRB- indicates good Huguenot an - cestry , and the
Virginia	LOCATION	family appears to have upheld the honored traditions of its origin .

		Edu - cated at
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Dabney	PERSON	was called to the chair of church history and polity at
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, Hampden-Sidney ,
Va.	LOCATION	, and in later life to that of moral and mental philosophy at
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	.

		He served in the Confederate army , four months as chaplain , and then , after two days devoted to
Halleck	PERSON	's '' Articles of War , '' four months as chief of staff to
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	, whose biography he afterward wrote .

		He was a zealous preacher as well as teacher .

		Uncompromising in his adherence to the old school of Southern Presbyterianism , he opposed all move - ments for uniting with the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	section of that church , and was equally hostile toward the proposed
Pan-Presbyterian Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's book is , from cover to cover , a glowing eulogy , and can not fail to please the relatives and friends of the deceased .

		Frequent extracts from Dr.
Dabney	PERSON	's writings , both prose and verse , are given , as well as two portraits of him and several views of college buildings .

		Of his surviving children the best-known is President
Charles W. Dabney	PERSON	of
the University of Tennessee	ORGANIZATION	.

		The old Greeks delighted in delin - Stiort history of .

		• .

		.

		, Greek sculpture .

		eating nature m her most perfect development ; and their consummate knowledge of the human form , combined with their exquisite craftsmanship , have given to the world the u THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, greatest sculptures in the whole range of art-history .

		The surviving works of their artists , abundant though fragmentary , are preserved in the museums of all the principal capitals of
Europe	LOCATION	, and are familiar to us through plaster and bronze casts to be found in most of our galleries and art schools .

		A study of these sculptures trains the faculty for observation , and cultivates a taste for pleasing forms and a power of seeing the ideal in the actual .

		It is to assist in such a study , chiefly among the young , that Miss
Helen Edith Legge	PERSON	has provided '' A Short History of the Ancient Greek Sculptors '' -LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein is traced the development of the sculptor 's art from the time of the wooden images of the gods attributed by tradition to
Daedalus	ORGANIZATION	,
Dipoeaus	PERSON	, and
Scyllis	PERSON	, down to the time of Pheidias in the
fifth century	DATE	, B. C , when Greek art reached its zenith .

		The author 's account of the sculptors is not only illustrated with admirable pictures of some of the more notable of their surviving works , but also by comments upon their art , stimulating a study of their scope and meaning .

		Although evi - dently intended for youthful readers , and avoid - ing all technical language , the book is valuable for more advanced art students , and might be found useful as a book of ready reference by all stu - dents of Greek art .

		Professor
Percy Gardner	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, furnishes a few pages of introduction , which are like most introductions to books of this character -- unnecessary .

		The phUosophy of road mending .

		The eleventh impression of
Michael Fairless	PERSON	's `` The Roadmender '' comes from
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in an ornate but inartistic binding , and with several quaint illustrations that emphasize in rather crude fashion the symbolism of the text .

		The sketches set forth the claim of roadmending , literal and figurative , to be the ideal means of earning a liveli - hood , at least for the '' vagrant child of nature . ''

		Their philosophy is contentment with the simple life , joy in service and in the free gifts of the great outdoor world , and sympathetic relations with one 's fellows , brute and human .

		There is nothing icono - clastic or recondite about the author 's view of life , but his breadth of sympathy that enables him to turn quickly and eagerly from one interest to another , his steadfast courage and sweetness of spirit , and his simple , unaffected style of writing , account easily for the popularity of the book .

		Its title is taken from that of the first sketch .

		The other two , `` Out of the Shadow '' and `` At the White Gate , '' tell how the Roadmender clung to his philosophy in the face of illness and death ; and how , forced to leave the `` lonely companion - ship '' of the road and its denizens , he found new interests in a
London	LOCATION	hospital , and great joy , a little later , in coming back , even as a helpless on - looker , to the road with its sunny , flower-girt meadows and its
White Gate	LOCATION	, symbol to him of the entrance into another world .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Vanity Fair , '' in three volumes , inaugurates the new '' Kensington ''
Thackeray	PERSON	, published by subscrip - tion by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		There are to be thirty - two volumes , printed from new plates made by Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	, and abundantly illustrated , both with the original drawings and with additional portraits and views .

		The volumes will appear at the rate of three every month .

		This is evidently to be an edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	pure and simple , without impertinent edi - torial matter , and the execution of the work is such as to deserve the highest praise .

		In their general form the volumes approach closely to the model set by the publishers in their recent edition of TourgudniefE .

		More than forty years ago , the late
George Cruik	PERSON	- shank made a series of drawings on wood for the illus - tration of '' The Pilgrim 's Progress . ''

		These drawings , left in the possession of Mr.
Edwin Truman	PERSON	, a friend of the artist , have remained unpublished up to the present time , when they have afforded the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	an excellent pretext for a new edition of
Bunyan	ORGANIZATION	's allegory .

		This edition is a sumptuous affair , beautifully printed in old-fashioned typography on handmade paper , and limited to a thousand copies .

		Of the illustrations themselves little can be said that is good .

		With a few exceptions , they are trivial and carelessly drawn , and by no means represent the genius of the artist .

		We are not surprised that they should have lain in a portfolio all these years .

		A pretty pocket edition of
Holbein	PERSON	's '' Dance of Death , '' with a prefatory note by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, is published by the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The designs are printed direct from the blocks originally engraved by Messrs.
Bonner	PERSON	and
John Byfield	PERSON	for
Douce	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
1833	DATE	, -- the best imitations on wood , according to Mr.
Linton	PERSON	.

		Thus being reproduced in the same medium as the originals -LRB- though the latter were cut and not en - graved -RRB- , they have an interest not found in the usual photographic reproductions .

		The book is printed on Japanese paper , and issued in a limited edition .

		Shakespeare , in three volumes , and
Keats	PERSON	, in one , are now added to the select company of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	's '' Oxford Miniature Poets . ''

		We are glad to have them both in this exquisite setting , and the
Shakespeare	PERSON	espe - cially is a real boon .

		The tragedies are in one volume , the comedies in another , the histories , poems , and son - nets in the third .

		Mr.
W. J. Craig	PERSON	is responsible for the text and for a glossary in each volume .

		There are many '' pocket '' editions of Shakespeare to be had , but for real compactness , convenience , and perfection in printing none can compare with this .

		Mr.
Lionel Strachey	PERSON	has added another to his trans - lations from the French , choosing this time the memoirs of Madame Le
Brun	PERSON	.

		His rendering , which is fluent and readable , is less literal than the anonymous version of
1879	DATE	; but it hardly appears that anything has been gained by this freedom of treatment .

		The thirty-five letters , or chapters , as he calls them , have been regrouped into eighteen , with excisions to bring the work into uniformity with the translator 's versions of the
Countess Potocka	ORGANIZATION	's memoirs and the '' Memoirs of a Contemporary . ''

		Three distinguishing features which go far toward justifying this new translation are the thirty-two reproductions from Mme. Le
Brun	PERSON	's por - traits of eminent persons , the chronological list of her paintings , and the index .

		THE DIAL 95 Notes .

		Messrs.
Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us a treatise on `` Bridge Tactics , '' by Mr.

Moore	PERSON	's para - phrase , with a series of illustrations designed by
M. Girodet de Roussy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A Little Tragedy at Tien-Tsin , and Other Stories from Elsewhere , '' by Miss
Frances Aymar Mathews	PERSON	, author of '' My Lady Peggy Goes to Town , '' will appear shortly from the press of Mr.
Robert Grier Cooke	PERSON	.

		It is understood that Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	, of Har -
vard University	ORGANIZATION	, is completing a new book , upon which he has been engaged for some time , entitled '' The Citizen , '' being a study of the Individual and the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Daniel Munro Wilson	PERSON	's interesting volume enti - tled '' Where American Independence Began '' is issued by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a second edition , containing considerable new matter and a number of additional illustrations .

		Two new volumes in the '' Temple Bible '' comprise '' Tobit and the Babylonian Apocryphal Writings , '' ed - ited by Professor
A. H. Sayce	PERSON	, and '' Wisdom and the Jewish Apocryphal Writings , '' edited by Mr.
W. B. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	are the American publishers of this series .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, publish in a single volume `` The Poetical Works of
John Townsend Trowbridge	PERSON	, '' thus doing belated justice to one who has been for half a century past one of the most popular American writers of verse .

		A fine portrait of the venerable author serves as a frontispiece .

		`` Months and Moods '' is the title of a fifteen-year -LRB- 1901-1915 -RRB- calendar , `` versified and diversified '' by Mr.
Edward Curtis	PERSON	, and published by the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The verses are original poems on the seasons , the work of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	, and the whole calendar is a substantially-bound book , which it had to be to promise fifteen years of use .

		A standard edition of the complete works of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, comprising probably nine octavo volumes , is to be published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Delegates of the Press have secured the cooperation of Prof.
C. H. Herford	PERSON	and of Mr.
Percy Simpson	PERSON	, who have been engaged for ten years or more on a critical examination of
Jonson	PERSON	's text .

		Messrs.
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish this
spring	DATE	a comprehensive and timely book by Prof , liicholas
Paine Gilman	PERSON	on '' Methods of Industrial Peace . ''

		The subjects dealt with are Trade-Unionism , Employers ' Associations , Collective Bargaining ,
Labor Disputes	ORGANIZATION	, and the various forms of Conciliation and Arbitration practiced in the
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		Some of the earliest announcements in the field of
spring	DATE	fiction come from
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have in press for
March	DATE	publication two novels of more than usual interest .

		One of these , the work of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	, centres about the dramatic events at
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	in
1812	DATE	; the other deals with the picturesque figure of
Robert Cavelier de la Salle	ORGANIZATION	, and is written by Mr.
William Dana Orcutt	PERSON	.

		Both volumes will be elaborately illustrated in color .

		`` The Book Monthly , '' aptly described as `` a pic - tured and picturesque who 's who and what 's what of bookland , '' is the latest venture in English literary journalism .

		It has no concern with criticism , but is not the less useful and interesting on that account to all who have to do with books .

		American readers will do well to make its acquaintance .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's historical drama , '' The Dynasts , '' will be published at once by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though complete in itself , it is designed ulti - mately to form one of a trilogy , of which the second play or part will cover the zenith of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's power , and the third his decline and fall , with the restoration to equilibrium of the old dynasties .


M. Auguste Fournier	PERSON	's biography of '' Napoleon the First , '' translated by Mrs.
Margaret Bacon Corwin	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Dart Bissell	PERSON	, and edited by Professor
Edward Gaylord Bourne	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is one of the best of the single-volume biographies , and its value is greatly enhanced by the exhaustive bibliography which is ap - pended .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have completed ar - rangements for the publication in
England	LOCATION	of Mr.
Clement	PERSON	's '' Handbook of
Modern Japan	LOCATION	, '' which has proved so timely a book in view of events in the Orient .

		This work is planned to give in the most convenient form the information most likely to be sought for by those who wish to know and understand the status and development of
Modern Japan	LOCATION	.

		M.
Emile Michel	PERSON	's great work on `` Rembrandt : His Life , his Work , and his Time '' is reissued in a third edition , imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	coincidently with the author 's visit to this country .

		It is , as before , translated by
Miss Florence Simmonds	ORGANIZATION	and edited by Mr.
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	.

		There are no less than three hundred and twenty-six illustrations satisfactorily re - produced .

		This work has been standard for its subject smce its original publication six years ago .

		Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	has compiled '' A Canadian Bibliography for the Year
1901	DATE	, '' which is now reprinted from the Transactions of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Canada	LOCATION	, and published in pamphlet form by Messrs.
James Hope & Son	ORGANIZATION	,
Ottawa	LOCATION	.

		The work includes contributions to periodicals as well as larger works , and is carefully indexed .

		We note no less than thirty - five entries under the name of
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, which may serve as an in - dication of the thoroughness of Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	's work .

		An attempt at an exhaustive bibliography of books and periodical articles on
United States	LOCATION	history pub - lished during the year
1902	DATE	, together with some con - tributions towards bibliography of writings on other parts of the Americas for the same year , prepared by Messrs.
Ernest Cushing Richardson	PERSON	and
Anson Ely Morse	PERSON	, is announced for early publication by Mr.
C. Martins	PERSON	,
Library Bookstore	ORGANIZATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	, N. J .

		The work will contain more than one thousand titles of books and pamphlets and over five thousand titles of periodical articles .

		It is planned to issue similar annual volumes regularly in the future .

		Messrs.
Methuen & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have in preparation , under the direction of Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, a new collection of classical literature on a plan which does not seem to have been already attempted in a systematic way either in
England	LOCATION	or in this country .

		They propose to issue under the title of ''
Methuen	LOCATION	's Universal Library '' at a very low price and at very short regular intervals a THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb.	DATE	! -RSB-

		, carefully printed series of books of classical repute , comprising not only accessible works , but also some rarer volumes of which no cheap editions exist .

		It is hoped that the Library may bring in due time all the best literature of
England	LOCATION	and other nations within the reach of every class of readers .

		Special efforts will be made to render textual accuracy as notable a charac - teristic of the new venture as cheapness , completeness , and typographical clearness .

		The text of each work , which will be unabridged , will be prepared from the best sources by competent scholars , and the works of many of the great masters of poetry , drama , fiction , belles lettres , history , and biography are now in the press .

		In the case of the more eminent authors their complete works will be supplied in two or more vol - umes , but any single masterpiece will be produced sep - arately .

		General editorial comment will be excluded , but each volume will open with a brief biographical and bibliographical note by Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, who will be the general editor of this Library .

		A NOTED LIBRARY WORKER .

		News has just been received of the death of Dr.
Otto Hartwig	PERSON	, formerly Director of the
University Library of Halle	ORGANIZATION	,
A. S.	PERSON	, and until recently editor of '' Centralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen . ''

		Born in
1830	DATE	, Dr.
Hartwig	PERSON	studied theology and philology and was pastor of the German congregation in
Messina	LOCATION	,
Sicily	LOCATION	, from
1860	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		After a short career as teacher he entered the service of the university library of Mar - burg in
1867	DATE	, remaining there until
1874	DATE	when he ac - cepted a position in the university library of
Halle	LOCATION	.

		In
1876	DATE	he was promoted to chief librarian at
Halle	LOCATION	.

		Here he met with conditions that taxed to the ut - most his administrative talent .

		The library was defi - cient in many important branches of learning , the reclassification and recataloguing of the library was an important desideratum , and a new building urgently needed .

		All these problems he attacked with vigor and care .

		The new building was completed and the books removed to it in
1880	DATE	, and
eight years later	DATE	the recata - loguing and reclassification were finished .

		In
1898	DATE	an ` affection of the eyes caused him to ask for six months ' leave of absence , and in
December	DATE	of the same year his resignation was offered and accepted .

		Shortly be - fore he had been appointed a member of the '' Kura - torium ' * of the university library of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Since retiring from active work he has resided in
Marburg	LOCATION	, and here he died on
December 22 , 1903	DATE	.

		In
1884	DATE	the first number of '' Centralblatt fiir Bibliothekswesen '' appeared , with Dr.
Hartwig	PERSON	and Dr.
K. Schulz	PERSON	, libra - rian of the Imperial supreme court in
Leipzig	LOCATION	, as edit - ors .

		Since 1886 Dr.
Hartwig	PERSON	has been the sole responsible editor , only relinquishing the work with the
December	DATE	number of last year .

		As editor of the `` Centralblatt '' Dr.
Hartwig	PERSON	exercised a very distinct influence on library progress in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		His con - tributions on library matters to his own journal and others were not numerous , but always of importance .

		A question in which he took particular interest was that of inter-library loan of manuscripts , and he contributed a paper on this subject to the World 's
Congress of Librarians	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		A list of his inde - pendent publications in other fields shows a wide range of studies and literary interests .

		In

		In this volume Doctor
Briggs	PERSON	sets forth a new order of the events and teaching in the life of Jesus , in the light of which a large proportion of the disputes as to the harmony of the Gospels disappear .

		The result is revolutionary so far as modem opinions are concerned ; but actually the results are conservative , being in the main a return to ancient opinions .

		The composition of the various Gospels also become much easier of explanation , and the entire subject acquires new results .

		The book is not technical , and it has been so written as to make it useful and interesting to all intelligent persons .

		BREFER MENTION 126 NOTES 127 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 128 THE SA VING GRAC E OF HUMOR .

		When
Shelley	PERSON	, deserting wife and child , and running away with
Mary Godwin	PERSON	, wrote back to
Harriet	PERSON	inviting her to come and join them , he showed a lack of humor .

		So amaz - ing is the effrontery of the letter that , with no further knowledge of its writer , one would be tempted to believe him indulging in a hideous joke , and so not destitute of a certain sugges - tion of humor , after all .

		His defect is so pronounced that it approaches the point where extremes meet and the serious passes over into the facetious .

		How difficult not to imagine him laughing in his sleeve when he says : '' I write to show that I do not forget you ; I write to urge you to come to
Switzerland	LOCATION	, where you will find one firm and constant friend to whom your interests will be always dear -- by whom your feelings will never wilfully be injured . ''

		Could malice itself have devised anything to surpass this ?

		When the artist-poet
Blake	PERSON	proposed to his young wife the taking to his bosom of an additional partner -- perhaps thinking thus to provide her with a pleasant companion , and possibly , with his patriarchal notions , expecting her to emulate the biblical example of
Sarah	LOCATION	-- he disclosed to her indig - nant and astonished gaze a gaping void where the sense of humor should have been .

		The big and muscular glutton who devours a weak and defenseless brother , and then , with a sanctimonious folding of the hands over his distended stomach , attributes the satisfying of his appetite to the inscrutable workings of manifest destiny , has by over-feed - ing dulled his sense of humor .

		The tyrant fights shy of the satirist .

		Napoleon was un - friendly to men of wit and humor .

		To quote
Thackeray	PERSON	's familiar definition , humor is a mixture of love and wit .

		Being of the nature of love , it does not behave itself unseemly .

		It is kindly affectioned .

		It is of the nature of sweet reasonableness .

		Its generous inclusive - ness admits the recognition of contrary claims .

		In fact , the very breath of its life is this per - ception of conflicting truths , of incongruities , of paradoxes .

		Seeing both sides of a question at once , it is a foe to all narrowness , unfair - 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ness , selfishness , arrogance , cruelty .

		Can one conceive of a genuine humorist as unkind ? ''

		The perception of the comic , '' as
Emerson	PERSON	has well said , '' is a tie of sympathy with other men , a pledge of sanity , and a protection from those perverse tendencies and gloomy insan - ities in which fine intellects sometimes lose themselves .

		A rogue alive to the ludicrous is still convertible .

		If that sense is lost , his fellow-men can do little for him . ''

		A sense of humor , then , saves a man from the enemy in his own bosom .

		It warns him not to take himself too seriously .

		A large part of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's output of verse would have remained unpublished , unwritten , not so much as conceived , had humor been one of the poet 's gifts .

		Milton 's controversial pamphlets show attempts at humor that make the judi - cious grieve .

		A true sense of the humorous would have spared his admirers this pain .

		His fun reminds one of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's description of a piece of fooling laboriously evolved from the brain of
Hegesias of Magnesia	ORGANIZATION	, -- `` a ponderous joke , dull enough to have put out the fire . ''

		Excessive enthusiasm and mis - applied zeal are wholesomely curbed by a quick perception of the ludicrous .

		To draw upon
Emerson	PERSON	once more , we encounter in one of his essays a physician who , in reply to an anxious inquiry concerning a patient , ex - claimed with professional joy sparkling in his eyes : '' Oh , I saw him
this morning	TIME	; it is the most correct apoplexy I have ever seen : face and hands livid , breathing stertorious , all the symptoms perfect ! ''

		A case so bea \ itifully in harmony with the books was too much for the medical man 's humanity .

		The venerable Dr.
Samuel Hopkins	PERSON	of
Newport	LOCATION	once elicited a charmingly simple reply from a parishioner , whose matter-of-fact habit of mind must have betrayed him into countless similar blunders .

		The thoughtful pastor had offered to bring some of his recent sermons and read them to this member of his flock , who had for several
Sundays	DATE	been kept from church by illness . ''

		Do so , '' was the cordial rejoinder , '' for I have had no sleep since this attack began . ''

		Many a failure , the result of attempting the absurdly impossible , would have been prevented had zeal been tempered with humor .

		Unfor - tunate enterprises of this nature , unaccom - panied with any sense of humor in the actors , often excite this feeling most irresistibly in the spectators .

		For , to quote a pregnant utterance from '' The Gentle Reader , '' '' the atmospheric currents of merriment move irresistibly toward a vacuum .

		Create a character altogether des - titute of humor and the most sluggish intelli - gence is stirred in the effort to fill the void . ''

		Thus there is something at once pathetic and humorous in the fond attempt of Charlemagne to make his mushroom state emulate , in the arts as well as in polity , the mature empire that had been the growth of a thousand years .

		No wonder his ill-cemented structure fell to pieces of its own weight before it reached the hands of his grandchildren .

		His second
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- Aix-la-Chapelle -RRB- , with its extemporized forum and its senate of half-civilized
Franks	PERSON	, and with its pretentious but uncouth buildings that rudely aped the architecture of
Ravenna	LOCATION	, may well excite a smile of pity .

		The very words of his biographer and inseparable companion seem to invite disaster . ''

		The second
Rome	LOCATION	lifts herself , '' he proudly declares , '' in new , unwonted bloom , with massive buildings whose lofty domes touch the stars .

		The godly
Charles	PERSON	stands far from his palace , selecting the vari - ous sites , and fixes in their order the high walls of the future
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		A further touch of that humor that is so closely akin to pathos is felt by the observer as he watches the monk - ish Eginhard apply himself to the study of Vitruvius .

		The buildings that came of this study would have struck the architect of Au - gustus with amaze .

		It has been usual to class women among the unfortunates born without sense of humor .

		Exceptions will readily come to mind .

		The creator of Mrs.
Poyser	PERSON	and
Tommy Trounsom	PERSON	and Wiry
Ben	PERSON	was certainly not blind to the humorous aspects of human nature .

		But the peculiarly feminine , das ewig Weibliche , , we do not associate with a keen appreciation of the incongruous .

		The ardent suitor who is as - sured by the object of his passion that , though she can never be his wife , she will always be a sister to him , distinctly feels in the offered substitute the presence of a certain something quite different from that admirable blend of love and wit whereof humor is composed .

		The fascinating coquette , to whom man 's attentions are more than meat and drink , and whose sig - nals of distress when he withholds his devotion hardly ever fail to bring him to his knees , shows a defective grasp of the situation in its logical implications .

		Hence the pained sur - prise and the injured innocence affected by her the moment she is honored with the treat - ment accorded to a reasonable being and is expected to harmonize inward purpose with outward seeming .

		This not un amiable weak -
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 ness , the sure index of a conspicuous lack of humor , the older novelists were fond of exhib - iting in its coarser manifestations , and it will ever remain a useful property to the construc - tor of love stories .

		Woman is proverbially cruel to woman .

		Nor is her heartlessness always confined to this traditional severity toward the foibles of her own sex .

		In '' The People of the Abyss '' we have recently been told that the sufferings of the
London	LOCATION	poor , as the destitute wretches exhibit themselves in the public parks , excite amusement oftener than pity in the passing women , especially the young women , of the well-to-do classes .


Walter Pater	PERSON	, in his essay on
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, regards humor as an amalgam of pity with mirth .

		Thus viewing its composition , we may safely conclude that where pitilessness displays itself there will be found no keen perception of the humorous factors of our existence .

		Let it be added , how - ever , for the consolation of the many excellent women who are deficient in this sense -- though they never will admit the deficiency -- that they are not without good company .

		The singleness of purpose characteristic of heroes and martyrs is , from its very nature , incom - patible with a lively appreciation of incongrui - ties .

		With the sense of humor too insistently acute , the river of life seems somehow to be split into channels so minute that it loses itself in the sand ; there is no steady current of seri - ous thought and purpose .

		The typical reformer is terribly in earnest .


Horace Mann	PERSON	planted himself one day , tall and tragic , before
Haw	PERSON	- thorne , and , fired with anti-tobacco zeal , deliv - ered himself of his opinion of a brother-in-law who could so far deviate from the path of rectitude as to smoke . ''

		Do I understand you to say , Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	, that you actually use tobacco ? ''

		he inquired severely .

		`` Yes , I smoke a cigar once in a while , '' was the good-natured reply . ''

		Then , Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	, it is my duty to tell you that I no longer have the same re - spect for you that I have had . ''

		Therewith the self-appointed censor turned and strode from the room .

		It is easy enough to say , with
Haw	PERSON	- thorne 's son , that
Horace Mann	PERSON	was wholly destitute of humor .

		But it is more than prob - able that the excellent man himself would have stoutly denied the charge ; and perhaps in matters less deeply moving his feelings he was not without a perception of the ludicrous .

		Who of us is never blind to the comic in things that affect our dearest interests ?

		Angry denial will stamp one immediately as sadly defective in humor , just as hot resentment at the charge of insanity is pretty good evidence of an unbal - anced mind .

		Perhaps there is no better mark of a plentiful endowment of humor than the ability to wear a smiling face when in deepest earnest .

		The child , with his sense of humor still in embryo , can not do this .

		Not without reason did
Cicero	PERSON	liken a jest - book to a salt-pit .

		Humor is the salt that keeps the temper sweet , the saving element that pre - vents sentiment and religion from degenerating into maudlin emotionalism , and an ever-neces - sary accompaniment to all unconstrained social intercourse .

		As man is the only being at once conscious of the miseries of life and able to laugh at them , so this peculiarly human quality is found in anything like perfection only among the most highly civilized .

		Savages have it not , or only in a form that savors more of cruelty than of kindness .

		Both the too sentimental and the too practical want it .

		It would seem to be the arch enemy of excess in any direction .

		Nil in extremis is its motto .

		Its presence indicates a normal and healthy state of tension between the upbuilding and the down-pulling forces whose interaction is life .

		It is a potent aid in the discharge of physical as well as mental functions , ^ sculapius is said to have written comic songs to quicken the circulation in his patients .

		A
London	LOCATION	physician prescribed ''
Peregrine Pickle	ORGANIZATION	'' for certain complaints .

		Sustained by his unconquerable merriness of humor ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	bravely bore a life-long anxiety .

		A sane enjoyment of the countless paradoxes and ironies of life is of the essence of the high - est wisdom .

		Without such enjoyment these numberless incongruities will annoy and de - press .

		The ardor of hero-worship will be chilled when the worshipper discovers how few human lives fail to reveal a seamy side upon closer scrutiny .

		The world 's progress owes much to great men whose characters do not square with their deeds .

		Many a good cause has prevailed by questionable means .

		There is no system of philosophy but encounters stubborn facts that sadly mar its symmetry .

		Vice fares sumptu - ously and goes arrayed in purple and fine linen , while virtue starves and clothes herself in rags .

		Rewards and punishments appear to be as - signed by chance .

		Next to the sublimity of a blind faith , there is nothing equal to an abiding sense of the humor of it all to save one from pessimism .

		Without this neither life nor that literature which aims to be the faithful transcript of life can be rightly enjoyed .

		Some Impressions of
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Arthur Jerome Eddy	PERSON	's '' Recollections and Impressions of
Whistler	LOCATION	'' is the sort of book for which
Whistler	LOCATION	's unique personality and sparkling wit provided such tempting and abundant material .

		Its method is haphazard , its preparation too evidently hasty ; in critical acumen it is unfortunately lacking .

		But a large body of readers will no doubt prefer it to a more formal and studied biography , for the reason that it is not burdened with the details of the artist 's career nor with fine-spun distinctions about his genius , but merely pre - sents his very attractive individuality in the form of countless witty anecdotes and amusing odds and ends of comment and reminiscence , while its information about his pictures is of a useful sort .

		The book is well printed , suit - ably bound in boards of a shade of
Whistler	LOCATION	's favorite brown , and illustrated with excellent reproductions in photogravure of eleven of the artist 's works .

		The familiar portrait by Rajon forms the frontispiece .

		Thus mechanical beauty and the very great charm of the subject atone in large measure for the faults of authorship ; and many admirers of
Whistler	LOCATION	will wish to add the book to their libraries .

		These should not expect , however , to find much that is new to them in Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's memoir .

		He does , to be sure , explain in the preface that his '' reminiscences are mostly personal , '' that many of the anecdotes were had from the artist 's own lips , and that the views concerning his art were formed from watching him at work day by day , and after many inter - views , in which , occasionally at least , he broke his habitual reticence to talk of the one thing in which he took a serious interest .

		These statements are unquestionably true -LRB- although no details of the personal relationship are given -RRB- , but we could never have guessed it from what follows .

		acquaintance with
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		This is no fault of Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's .

		The truth is , the penny-a - liners have long appreciated
Whistler	LOCATION	's literary value , recognizing his claim to be master-artist in words if not in nocturnes ; and they have circulated his bon-mots and his eccentricities industriously through their columns .

		The exceeding sharpness of
Whistler	LOCATION	's wit , and his habit of letting his best shafts fly more than once , contributed to making his witticisms common property .

		And so , after last sum - mer 's flood of post-mortem paragraphs , even an intimate of
Whistler	LOCATION	's -- if he had any -- must expect to find himself anticipated along anecdotal lines .

		But if Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's stories are not for the most part new , they are both well selected and well told , and it is much to have so large a body of them preserved in so attractive a volume .

		Among the letters which Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	quotes , and which we do not remember seeing else - where , is one written in
Whistler	LOCATION	's crispest epistolary style , and illustrating , besides , his well-known disinclination to promptness .

		An ojSicial connected with an international exhibit sent notes to various artists in
Paris	LOCATION	, announc - ing his intended visit to the city and making appointments with them at his hotel .

		Whist - ler 's hour was fixed at '' 4.30 precisely . ''

		The artist answered thus : '' Dear Sir : -- I have received your letter announcing that you will arrive in
Paris	LOCATION	on the - th .

		I congratulate you .

		I never have been able , and never shalL be able , to be anywhere at `` 4.30 precisely . ' ''

		Yours most faithfully ,
J. McN	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whistler . ''

		The same aptness in making what one of the Enemies of '' The Gentle Art '' has styled '' very unbecoming and improper '' answers , is shown in the artist 's retort to an excited Cock - ney gentleman who rushed into a shop where
Whistler	LOCATION	was trying on a hat , and mistaking him for a salesman cried : '' I say , this ` at does n't fit . ''

		Eyeing him critically a moment
Whistler	LOCATION	said : '' Neither does your coat . ''

		His own immaculate attire was proverbial .

		So were the dapper silk hat , the yellow gloves , the slender walking-stick , the monocle , the curled mustache , the be-ribboned white fore - lock , `` famous as the plume of
Navarre	LOCATION	. ''

		Somebody once gave
Whistler	LOCATION	an American umbrella of the sort that furls very tightly .

		He used it as a cane , and his delight in it knew no bounds .

		On one occasion , according to Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	,
Whistler	LOCATION	was coming out of his studio with a friend , and as they made their
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 111 way to a nearby cab-stand , it began to drizzle .

		His friend , who had no umbrella , said : '' Hurry and put up your umbrella or we '11 get our hats wet . ''

		Whistler fumbled for a second at the umbrella , then hurried on . ''

		But I would get my umbrella wet , '' he said .

		So much for the '' Reminiscences '' -- for it is unfair to steal more of Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's stories ; and the biographical data , being from casual sources and intended only as a connecting thread on which to hang the anecdotes and the estimates of the man and his work , need not delay us here .

		As an art critic Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's attitude is surely too much marked by undiscriminating enthusiasm to merit complete confidence ; but as an expositor of such matters as
Whistler	LOCATION	's title to be called a colorist , his attitude toward portraiture , or his theory of the suitable hang - ing of pictures , his work is clear and inter - esting -- likely to be decidedly illuminating to the '' plain man '' of
Whistler	LOCATION	's own satire .

		Toward his subject 's personality Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	appears somewhat in the character of an apol - ogist .

		His sense of humor is not strong .

		Dis - liking flippancy however polished , he naturally wishes that the Master had been less ardent an * ' Apostle of Persiflage '' in his idle moments , less artistic a maker of enemies in his bitter ones .

		And it is possible that the nocturnes and symphonies would have been taken more seriously , or at least have received quicker rec - ognition , if the critics had not had the memory of the Butterfly 's insinuating '' reflections '' to wipe out .

		It is also no doubt true that
Whistler	LOCATION	's egotism and affectation have been vastly exaggerated .

		From a painful sense of duty , then , the biographer should strive to put us into the more receptive attitude of the French , whose prompter appreciation of
Whistler	LOCATION	's genius Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	refers in part to their inability to resent his untranslatable irony .

		Still , we find it hard to forgive Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's elaborate attempt to explain away the paradoxes of '' The Ten O'clock Lecture , '' or his doubt about the advisability of reprinting the delicious impertinences of '' The Gentle Art of Making Enemies . ''

		We prefer '' the real Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	, '' -- who , instead of laying his habit of controversy to either his West Point training or his long and bitter struggle for recognition , frankly confessed to being '' a bundle of nerves and dyspepsia . ''

		The fact that his personal motives often appear as vague and inscrutable as the outline of Battersea Bridge in the blue and silver nocturne , can not reasonably affect our pleasure in the picture .

		But it does add to the charm of the man , and to our enjoyment of a book like Mr.
Eddy	PERSON	's , much of whose point and vivacity depends on the fact that
Whistler	LOCATION	was to the last an insol - uble enigma .

Russia	LOCATION	as a Model .

		.

		* Coming at just this time , when war clouds are thundering over the eastern shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, -- a name seemingly destined to be - come a complete misnomer , -- the book result - ing from the recent journey of Mr.
Albert J. Beveridge	PERSON	, junior senator of the
United States	LOCATION	from
Indiana	LOCATION	, has unusual pertinence and will be read with assiduity by all who desire infor - mation regarding certain phases of an in - evitable struggle .

		It appears that the author has recently returned from a journey through
Russia	LOCATION	,
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and
Corea	LOCATION	; but his volume is limited to a consideration of
Asiatic Russia	LOCATION	, with a portion of a single chapter referring to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Nothing at all is said about
Corea	LOCATION	.

		The attitude throughout the book is so markedly pro-Russian that it deserves the stronger term of Slavophile .

		Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	is an ardent worshipper at the shrine of the ancient ideals of pagan
Rome	LOCATION	revived in modern times under the title of imperialism .

		He is a devotee of might , and right is seldom considered in his work .

		Being enamored of '' world power , '' he necessarily fell under the spell of a theocratic autocracy as the best engine for putting into practice these wholly un-American conceptions .

		In his treat - ment of the Russian administration he seems de - terminately to have put behind all conceptions of popular or free government ; and his faith in these conceptions is too small , apparently , to permit him to undertake any defense of de - mocracy against the frequent adverse criticisms quoted by him as passed upon its shortcomings by Russian officials .

		Especially does he lay stress on the possibility of rising into imperial power from the humbler walks of life , as in the case of the Russian minister of finance ,
Sergius Witte	PERSON	, ignoring the vastly greater difficulties attending such a feat in
Russia	LOCATION	as compared with this country .

		As a senator of the United States Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	was accorded every privilege by the Russian authorities in his journey across
Asia	LOCATION	.

		* The Russian Advance .

		By
Albert J. Beveridge	PERSON	.

		With maps .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		112 THE DIALi -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, He evidently expected that obstacles would be thrown in his way , especially in
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		But the Russians were wise enough to secure his good will at the outset , and thereafter they must have felt that they could not lose it .

		They would certainly have been right in the supposition , for nothing could have alienated an affection given so whole-heartedly .

		A strik - ing instance of Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	's tenderness for
Russia	LOCATION	is shown in his account of the hideous massacre at Blagovestchensk in
1900	DATE	.

		What he admits '' may have been only a rumor '' led the Russians in this town on recently-stolen territory to assume that a Chinese army was descending upon them , that the Chinese on their own territory across the river were arm - ing against them , that the Chinese in their own settlement were to join with their countrymen across the river , and that by a junction of these three forces Blagovestchensk would be im - perilled .

		Thereupon '' the Chinese in the city itself were driven by the few Cossacks down to the river 's edge below the town and forced into the river .

		Three or four thousand of them perished . ''

		It seems to have been after this wholesale massacre that the Chinese across the river began a futile bombardment of Blag - ovestchensk with muskets , -- '' you may now see the bullet-marks made in the home of the local governor .

		Many houses of Blagovestchensk still show these signs of actual peril . ''

		Then came the chief horror .

		Even Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	does not state the total slaughter , estimated at not less than fifteen thousand men , women , and children .

		But his humane conclusions are par - ticularly noteworthy .

		`` Finally reinforcements arrived , the Russians crossed the river , and literally wiped the Chinese town off the face of the earth .

		You may visit its site now , but you will see nothing but waving grass and here and there the demolished remains of the crumbling wall of a house .

		Such , stripped of its many variations , is the story of the great < massacre ' of the Chinese by the Russians of Blagovestchensk in
1900	DATE	which made the world • shudder . '

		... `` So much space has been given to this incident be - cause of the tremendous publicity given to it and the distortion of all of its features , and because , too , it is a very fair illustration of the manner in which any inci - dent of Russian advance is painted to the American and European world .

		When we hear of Russian outrages we must always bear in mind that while it may well be that all of their details are entirely true , yet the chances are that the forbidding aspects of each affair are magnified . ''

		Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant .

		This acceptance of the Russian point of view leads Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	to seeming endorsement of ideals not in the least American .

		He says , for example : '' More than a score of different peoples are now under the colors of the Czar ; and , say what we will from our western point of view , they appear to be as highly contented as the people of the more advanced countries , such as
Germany	LOCATION	or
Italy	LOCATION	-LSB- has the writer forgotten the German socialist , and the emigrating ^ Italian peasant ? -RSB-

		, and far more satisfied with their conditions than are the English . ''

		This places contentment among the desirable national qualities , and presents another phase of the constant confusion made throughout the book between '' good '' government and free government , generally to the disparagement of the latter .

		There is a stress laid on the virtues of efficient civil service sadly at vari - ance with the practices of our last two na - tional administrations .

		And there are some convincing arguments against the high tariffs of the same period , from the statement ' ■ ' ■ the Russians are still buying in the best and cheap - est market , and the best and cheapest market is our own , '' through the account of the acerbi - ties arising between the Russian and American governments over the sugar duties , to the strong probability of the total loss to the
United States	LOCATION	of its Russian markets .

		Commercialism and imperialism go hand in hand , and the comments of several persona whom Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	interviewed , to the effect that '' we do n't know , and we do n't care , wha governs the country , '' explain this in part .

		Still , there must be some Americans who will object to the implication behind the statement of the
Indiana	LOCATION	senator that `` When American trade held the first place in the Orient , the American flag was seen in every port .

		It was a great advertisement then . ''

		And there is another fine suggestion for the future in this : `` Another thing which the government might do , and which would have a beneficial effect upon American trade in
China	LOCATION	, is to keep in Chinese waters all but on & or two ships of our
Pacific	LOCATION	squadron .

		Moreover , the heaviest part of our navy should be kept in Asiatic waters .

		It is there that the conflicts of the future will occur , and it is there where our visible power should be manifest to all beholders . ''

		It is a pleasant thought that we are to make men and money unproductive by heavy taxa - tion for a navy , trying to make up the loss of a profitable home market consequent upon thia by seeking a doubtfully profitable foreign market , and then , for our pains , '' Let the guU 'd fool the toils of war pursue , Where bleed the many to enrich the few . ''

		But objections of this sort are what Mr.
Bev	PERSON	- eridge refers to when he says that ''
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	have been wasting time on
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 academic argumentations about unsubstantial theories . ''

		There are some inaccuracies in the book , due no doubt to haste in preparation .

		Of Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	's style something may be learned from the extracts here given .

		It abounds in repetitions , and is inflated throughout , apparently suffering from the vices which
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	noted as inherent in dicta - tion .

		Among numerous similar lapses , Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	speaks of '' witnessing cathedrals , '' of '' vocalinity , '' and of one who '' does not look like we are . ''

		And the book is without an index , an unpardonable omission in such a work .

		Having thus summed up , in good part , the faults of the book , both in regard to man - ner and matter , substance and form , it is to be said , on the other hand , that the very sympathy shown for
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	has enabled Mr.
Beveridge	PERSON	to present a picture of the empire and of its people unsurpassed in serious lit - erature for accuracy and comprehension .

		From the virtual chancellor of the empire to the most ignorant peasant , the Kussian is sketched with lines now broad , now narrow , until every phase of his none too complex nature has been sub - mitted to a sort of psychological dissection and laid bare to the enquiring mind .

		Not only is the government of the Czar analyzed and explained , but its methods in respect of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	as well , its educational aspirations , its interference between employer and employed to prevent the industrial horrors of western
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, its firm conviction of its mission as a civilizing and christianizing power through the world , its aspirations toward a dominion over other peoples to be acquired by a combination of velvet glove and iron fist , its permanency of policy made possible by its autocracy , and , coming down to detail , the manner in which these circumstances are put into play in the occupation of
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and the ceaseless , resistless force with which the machinery moves on , slowly and surely enough to suggest the mills of the gods , all character - ized in a word by a youthful and enthusiastic officer when he said '' Kussia the Inevitable . ''

		As regards the immediate future , and the issue of the war between the armies of the Mi - kado and the Czar , Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	imparts a clear impression of the facts .

		It was unques - tionably to the interest of
Russia	LOCATION	to secure delay .

		Her single line of railway track will not suffice for the victualling of great military forces in eastern
Asia	LOCATION	, and her settlement of
Manchuria	LOCATION	is far too incomplete to permit any reliance upon the present resources of the country , fertile as it is .

		There appeared , from his statement , to be inherent weakness in the Kussian squadrons in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, making her control of water transportation from St.
Peters	PERSON	- burg and
Odessa	LOCATION	to
Vladivostok	LOCATION	and Port
Arthur	PERSON	more than doubtful , while the Black Sea squadron is tied up in those waters by the concert of
Europe	LOCATION	, and possible British hos - tility makes it inexpedient to use the naval ves - sels now in the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	.

		Nor can it be said that the fortifications at Port
Arthur	PERSON	and
Dalni	PERSON	are in a condition entirely satisfactory for defence , while
Vladivostok	LOCATION	is ice-bound during no small portion of the year , and the transportation from that port to its southern sisters is also dependent upon a single line of rails .

		But if
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	desired delay , the reverse was true of
Tokyo	LOCATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	, maintaining her ancient birth-rate while introducing the practice of modern hygiene , is seriously over - populated now , and the strain upon her re - sources is a permanently growing one .

		Her statesmen are seeking an outlet for her throng - ing thousands as a necessity of national exist - ence .

		The treaty of
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	would have secured southern
Manchuria	LOCATION	for this purpose , had not
Eussia	LOCATION	, aided and abetted by
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, forced from
Japan	LOCATION	the fruits of her victory in
1895	DATE	.

		Baffled here , they have turned to
Corea	LOCATION	, under-populated and more fertile than
Japan	LOCATION	's own soil .

		But
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	's interference in
1895	DATE	secured for the Czar the ports of Dalni and
Port Arthur	PERSON	, and the railway connecting them with
Vladivostok	LOCATION	through the Manchurian road is an essential to their maintenance in the face of
Japan	LOCATION	's efficient naval force .

		Should Corea fall into Japanese hands , placing
Japan	LOCATION	within less than two hundred miles of this essential line of communication between
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- sia 's
Pacific	LOCATION	naval stations , a line representing her ambitions in Peking itself , the whole policy of the Eassian administration in eastern
Asia	LOCATION	is made of no avail .

		And it was clearly to
Japan	LOCATION	's interest to strike now , or submit for ever .

		In a word , this is the beginnmg of a struggle for life and death on the part of the
Mikado	LOCATION	's people , a struggle having for its grand prize the hegemony of the yellow race .

		On
Eussia	LOCATION	's part success seems to prophecy the eventual control of all
Asia	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	's Indian Empire with the rest , by the flat-capped administrators of autocracy .

		The entire civil - 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ized world is profoundly implicated in the re - sult , and the recent embarkation of the
United States	LOCATION	in the doubtful role of a '' world power '' of physical rather than moral force has en - tangled the American people among others , exactly as
Washington	LOCATION	foresaw when he spoke the warning in his Farewell Address .

		And it may be added , though this is not within the purview of Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	's book , that final success in this battle of giants is likely to rest , not with the largest battalions or the heaviest artillery , but with the financiers of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		If the Jew , having in mind the atrocities which excited the wrath of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and of the world at large , should withhold his assistance from
Kussia	LOCATION	in the immediate future or place his coffers at the disposal of the
Mikado	LOCATION	, or should the newly-made millions of
America	LOCATION	step into the gap in the interests of commercial treaties which past experience has shown are likely to be granted more liberally by
Japan	LOCATION	than by
Eussia	LOCATION	, the island empire may place an effective stumbling-block in the path of '' Adam-zad , the bear that looks like a man . ''

		The
Latest Portrait of Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Words for words , the century and a quarter that has elapsed since
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's death has had its full and free say about the patriarch of
Ferney	LOCATION	; and the '' hundred volumes of Vol - taire '' are matched by the bibliography in his latest biography , which , curiously enough , con - tains just one hundred names , without claiming to be exhaustive .

		In spite of all the wealth of material collected by such writers as Desnoires - terres , and the biographies by
Condorcet	LOCATION	, Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, and
James Parton	PERSON	, Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	could say , twenty years ago , that no really good life of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, with complete examination of his works , existed in any lan - guage .

		If no biographer 's equipment is com - plete without the ability to make a critical estimate of his hero 's works , whether written or acted , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's remark is probably true ; and its truth will not be affected by this two-volume book of Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	's .

		For this is simply the story of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's life , told chronologically from his birth in
1694	DATE	to his apotheosis and death in
1778	DATE	.

		The un - broken succession of writings that came from his tireless pen are properly reckoned with as * Thb Life OF VOLTAiBB .

		causes of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's various flights , conceal - ments , imprisonments , or sudden bursts of fame , and hence as necessary factors in his life ; but there are almost no references or quotations , and the reader must go to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	himself for first-hand knowledge of his writings , and to the pages of Faguet ,
Van Laun	PERSON	, or Brunetiere for criticism .

		Of the critical spirit , indeed , there is not much in these two handsome volumes .

		Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	's flow of enthusiasm for Vol - taire 's unquestioned good qualities is not ma - terially checked by his honest recognition of the baser ones .

		For these latter , indeed , he is an apologist wherever possible ; and English readers will probably go back to their
Morley	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, or even
Macaulay	PERSON	, for a more un - biassed view of this wisest , brightest , -- trick - iest of mankind .

		With these reservations , the narrative is delightful reading .

		Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	has evi - dently digested his authorities thoroughly , from the valets
Collini	PERSON	and Wagniere down to
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	; and he gives us in a picturesque style his results and his own opinions in about seven hundred pages , undis - figured by footnotes .

		This latter feature is adopted on a principle thus defended by the author : '' If the public can not trust the ability or the honesty of the biographer , the sources of his information are not inaccessible , and the public with a little extra trouble can verify his facts , even though he does not assist it by cumbering his text with that annihilation of all interest , the perpetual footnote .

		If the subject is not considered worth the extra trouble , the reader may well take the biographer -- on faith ... The best biographer of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	is Voltaire himself .

		If any writer can lead his reader to throw away the biographies , even his own , and study Voltaire at first-hand -- his letters , the wittiest in the world , and his works , which in matchless adroitness can be compared to no other production of the human mind -- he will have done much and should be well satisfied . ''

		To many good people the name
Voltaire	PERSON	has been little more than a theological expression , or at most the designation of a claimant for the bad eminence of the eighteenth-century antichrist .

		Of the man
Francois Marie Arouet	PERSON	as an eager , striving , loving , hating member of society they have known little and cared to know less .

		This attitude has now been re - placed by the literary and historical interest which the most devout may safely feel in the most brilliant writer of his age and the prophet whose teachings , though not his life , helped to prepare the way for a mighty revolution .

		The twentieth-century reader may not approve of Voltaire any more after reading these volumes
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 than before ; but he will have a clear and even radiant picture of one of the most interesting men that ever lived .

		The glimpses of his precocious childhood are of course detached ; but we see the little `` Zo-Zo '' learning to `` lisp scoffings as other children lisp prayers , '' taught by the recreant abbe CLateauneuf to recite deistical poems , entering at ten the Jesuit school of
St. Louis le Grand	LOCATION	, where he posed his masters with hard questions in history and politics and wrote fluent bad verses , taken by his god - father at eleven to see Ninon de I ` Enclos , who was `` as charming at eighty as she had been at eighteen , '' and who was so taken by the child that she left him in her will
2000	DATE	francs to buy books .

		Leaving school at seventeen , young
Arouet	PERSON	announced that he desired no profession but literature , -- to the disgust of his father , who , as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	says , '' re - fused to consider literature a profession at all . ''

		For a while he dabbled in law , and even in diplomacy ; but was more of a scapegrace than a student , and the Regent Philippe d'Orleans found it desirable to put the brilliant young fellow in the
Bastille	LOCATION	, where , without pen or ink , he composed whole cantos of the '' Hen - riade , '' and , among other things , changed his name .

		The question whether the name `` Vol - taire '' is an anagram of `` Arouet 1 .

		j. -LRB- le jeuneV or an abbrevation of '' le petit volon - taire , '' one of his baby names , or a real name existing in his mother 's ancestry , is a vexed though not a vital one .

		The anagram has usually proved too tempting to be rejected ; but Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	assures us that the last answer is now generally accepted .

		Out of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's eighty-four years , three periods are salient as involving special activ - ities in different environments : his fifteen years of association with Mme. du Chatelet , chiefly spent at Cirey -LRB- 1733-1748 -RRB- , the fam - ous sojourn with
Frederick	PERSON	the Great at Ber - lin and
Potsdam	LOCATION	-LRB- 1750-1753 -RRB- , and the last twenty years at
Ferney	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1758-1778 -RRB- .

		Of that queer household at Cirey -- the poet spending his money to complete his mistress 's chateau , the lady herself -LRB- `` poor little lean brown woman , '' in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's phrase -RRB- filled with pas - sions for fine clothes , high play , and the New - tonian philosophy ; and a dim-shadowy com - plaisant husband who knew how to `` range himself , '' -- of all this Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	writes with much vivacity of manner and many illum - inating details .

		`` The respectable Emilie '' caressed , scolded , and was jealous of her lover -- until she deserted him for a younger man .

		In this unedifying French domestic drama of real life , the woman comes off with the least credit ; and one reverts with a sort of satisfac - tion to
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's description of Voltaire as `` hagridden . ''

		The visit to
Frederick the Great	PERSON	is the best - known epoch in
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		It lasted only three years , but was crowded with enough adventure , intrigue , spite , adoration , and hard work to fit out a lifetime .

		To English readers , long ago ,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's essay on
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, with his
Life of Frederick	ORGANIZATION	, and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's great essay , made the facts familiar , as they knew them .

		Neither of them did justice to
Voltaire	LOCATION	; and
Carlyle	PERSON	was too fond of his hero not to give him the benefit of every doubt in all this dubious business .

		Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	seems to see with clearer vision , and to hold the balance equit - ably between the French man of letters , `` thievish as a daw and mischievous as a monkey , '' and the Prussian king who was by fits and starts his pupil , his adorer , and his jailer .

		The story of how
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	made an enemy of old
Maupertuis	PERSON	, the president of
Frederick	PERSON	's ''
Berlin Academy	ORGANIZATION	, '' how Mau - pertuis , by the publication of his ridiculous '' Scientific Letters , '' exposed himself as fair game , and how
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	fairly smothered him with the delicious satire of `` Dr.
Akakia	PERSON	, '' is told anew , and with great fulness . ''

		Akakia means guilelessness ; and
Akakia	ORGANIZATION	is a phy - sician who takes the remarkable effusions of Maupertuis with a serious innocence , very deadly ; who asks the most simple questions in the world ; and turns upon the President 's theories the remorseless logic of the gayest and easiest common-sense .

		There could have been no stylfe better than
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's for making Pomposity mad .

		One can still see the * sublime Perpetual President * writhing under that pitiless mockery and that infectious laugh of malicious delight .

		The wickedest , cleverest , lit - tle picador in all the world goaded this great , lumbering , heavy-footed old bull to impotent frenzy .

		The lithe tiger , agile as a cat , sprang on his foe , showing all his teeth in his grin , and , grinning still , tore him limb from limb . ''

		Many of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's most famous inots are duly recorded ; and some of his most startling utterances are explained and defended .

		The popular belief that in his celebrated motto '' Ecrasez Vinfame '' he voiced his hatred of Christ is probably too deep-seated to be re - moved by the careful explanations of many wise men , assuredly right as they are .

		Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	is not the first who has sought to vindicate the great Deist from this reproach ; but his words are worth reproducing . ''

		To Voltaire it -LRB- Vinfame -RRB- , if it meant Christianity at all , meant that which was taught in
Rome	LOCATION	in the 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16 , eighteenth century	DATE	, and not by the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	in the first ... Uinfame was the religion which enforced its doctrines by the sword , the fire , and the prison ; which massacred on the night of
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	; and which , glossing lightly over royal sins , refused its last consola - tions to dying Jansenists who would not accept the
Bull Unigenitus	ORGANIZATION	.

		... And above all ,
Vinfdme	PERSON	was that spirit which was the natural enemy of all learning and advancement ; which loved darkness and hated light be - cause its deeds were evil ; which found the better knowl - edge of His works , treason to God ; and an exercise of the reason and the judgment He had given , an insult to the Giver ... Uinfame can not be translated by any single word .

		But if it must be , the best rendering of it is , intolerance . ''

		Voltaire 's last days were unquestionably his happiest .

		As the
Lord Bountiful of Ferney	ORGANIZATION	and Tournoy , with grateful friends around him , receiving visits from such dissociated pilgrims as
James Boswell	PERSON	of
Auchinleck	PERSON	, the young
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, and '' a solemn youth from

		readers .

		Hardly a year passes without the publication of a new volume on some topic or other dealing with the
United States	LOCATION	, -- '' La vie aux Etats-Unis , '' '' La femme aux Etats-Unis , '' '' Les trusts aux Etats-Unis , '' and what not .

		Nobody seems to tire of these '' Etats-Unis . ''

		There are two classes of publications on
America	LOCATION	.

		Some are studies of a special sub - ject by a specialist , like
Levasseur	PERSON	's book on `` I ` Ouvrier Americain , '' or de
Rousier	PERSON	's work on the Trusts .

		Most of them , however , are the general impressions of a traveller after a more or less hasty journey made under varying con - ditions .

		The interest of these impressions de - pends , of course , on the traveller 's intelligence , faculty of observation , and general aptitude as a writer .

		The two recent books which are treated here belong , one to the class of special studies , the other to the class of general impressions .

		Both are interesting , because written by men who have seen what they talk about and are inter - ested in their subject .


M. Bargy	PERSON	, who has been in this country for five years , is a university professor who became interested in the reli - gious side of American life .


M. Gohier	PERSON	, who travelled for five months all over the country , is a newspaper man , with a keen eye and a skilled pen , although not always with a very calm judgment .

		M. Bargy , having lived in a country which is mostly Catholic , with a rather limited relig - ious life , was surprised to find how great a part religious activity plays in American society , as well as pleased by the general spirit of true liberalism that seems to prevail .

		He had not been much in touch with Protestant ideas and Protestant life before finding them here .

		Therefore he ascribes to the American spirit many traits that may be due to Protestant in - fluence even in non - Protestant churches .

		All things that struck him as new and good in the religious conception and the religious method of the
United States	LOCATION	are to him American .

		He discovered what he calls the American religion , and characterizes it by two traits : it is a social religion , -- i. e. , more interested in society than in the individual ; and it is a positive religion , -- i. e. , it cares more for what is human in re - ligion than for what is supernatural .

		One of the main characteristics of American religion from the Puritans down , if we were to believe him , is indifference to dogma .

		M. Bargy lays down these two principles , and from them deduces his conception and description of the various forms of religious
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 activity , Presbyterian or Episcopalian , Con - gregational or Methodist , Hebrew or Roman Oatholic .

		In all , he finds the same spirit , which he traces back to colonial times , and which he considers the common heritage of all Americans .

		To him , religion in
America	LOCATION	ap - pears as '' a mutual aid society '' ; a church is ^ ' a cooperative organization and a club '' ; a pastor is '' a business man and sociologist , '' working for the material welfare of his flock AS well as for their moral betterment .

		A French critic ,
Edmond Scherer	PERSON	, once said that general ideas are always , to a certain extent , false .

		M.
Bargy	ORGANIZATION	's book supports this statement .

		His bold and over-hasty generalizations are in - teresting , to be sure , but far from convincing .

		Not all the traits of American character that he praises are specifically American ; and not all the praises he bestows are equally deserved .

		It is needless to say that there is no such close resemblance between denominations as he de - scribes so minutely .

		As to the indifference to dogma , it seems to be a fancy of his imagina - tion , as far as most sects are concerned .

		Never - theless , despite the somewhat artificial logic that pervades the book ,
M. Bargy	PERSON	has covered the ground in a very instructive and entertain - ing way .

		He has some excellent chapters , full of information .

		Most of his statements are accurate , even when the conclusions he draws from them are not .

		Information is always safer than theories .

		The chapter on Channing is very good ; and so are the chapters in which he describes some modern churches , like
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	's , and some modern pastors , like
Babcock	PERSON	and
Kainsford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American reader will relish this book , full of enthusiasm , in which the author is bent on seeing only what is flattering to American pride , and in accord - ance with his own theories .

		Perhaps it might be better if all the churches here really had all the qualities
M. Bargy	PERSON	discovers in them .

		But in that case they would be somewhat different from what they are .


M. Urbain Gohier	PERSON	has also some theories which he airs here and there in his book .

		But in the main his purpose is to describe
America	LOCATION	as he saw it a year ago
last summer	DATE	in a quick journey of five months , with stops in various large cities and university centres .

		He writes in an epigrammatic style , and his Parisian readers who are accustomed to his ways will take cum grano sails some of his statements which may puzzle the American reader .

		On the whole ,
M. Gohier	PERSON	was pleased with
America	LOCATION	.

		But he would not be the aggressive pamphleteer that he is if he had written a book of mere praise and flattery .

		He was pleased with the cleanliness , comfort , and general air of happiness of the American home .

		The American woman seemed to him one of the most interesting of his discoveries when he reached these shores .

		He found her as pretty as the Parisienne , though somewhat spoiled ; and he admired her freedom , her initiative , her taste and elegance .

		He praises the univer - sities , and all the institutions of learning and education generally , such as the social settle - ments and the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	Even the
Salva	PERSON	- tion
Army	ORGANIZATION	finds a sympathetic judge in this man , who in
France	LOCATION	has been , although a Cath - olic by birth , a rabid anti-clerical .

		The early freedom and self-reliance of the American boy struck our author as something quite novel .

		He could not imagine the sons of a French university president selling news - papers in the streets !

		He speaks enthusias - tically of the freedom of the individual in the family and in society .

		He enjoyed the luxury of the Pullman cars , admired the beautiful site of
Yellowstone Park	LOCATION	,
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	, the
Bay of San Francisco	LOCATION	, and the Grand Canon of the
Colorado River	LOCATION	.

		Everywhere he received the impression of something big , tremendously big .

		He regards the American people as an energetic , intelligent , quick-witted nation , and be lieves that they are the people of the twentieth century .

		But -- there is a but .


M. Gohier	PERSON	, who is known in
France	LOCATION	as one of the most destruc - tive and violent critics of the existing order of things , did not merely find things to admire .

		He observed the power and tyranny of the trusts and the labor-unions , between which , he pro- phesies , the consumer will be crushed .

		He discovered what he calls the '' military peril , '' the peril that will come some day from the growing strength of the army ; the '' clerical peril '' that will result for American li berty from the increasing influence of a numerous dis - ciplined and wealthy
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He reproaches President
Roosevelt	PERSON	for his sensational attitude , his strenuous ways , and his spread-eagleism .

		While amazed by the quantity of work done by the newspapers and the tremendous equipment they use , he crit - icises the waste of money , time , and paper involved in `` great '' journalism .

		As for American customs ,
M. Gohier	PERSON	fell of course into the usual errors of foreign obser - vers , and collected sensational items of love stories , crimes , and advertisements , from the popular journals .

		Yet at the same time he 118 THE DLAJL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, observed and noted down many things that the average American does not always have his attention called to .

		He visited
America	LOCATION	at the very time of the scandals of the
New York	LOCATION	police and of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	and
Minneapolis	LOCATION	aldermen , and he has a fearful chapter on American political corruption .

		He saw men of so many origins and races in the large cities of the East and West that he wondered whether this amalgamation of men whose only common ties are , in his words , '' the English language , the ice-cream soda , and chewing - gum '' really form an Anglo-Saxon nation .

		The craze for physical excercise seems to him to be pushed too far . ''

		The Americans judge men by their weight , as they do cattle in the stock-yards . ''

		He notes at the same time that this worship of muscle is accompanied by an undue development of the patent-medicine business .

		He saw buildings , fifteen stories high , filled with druggists and physicians ; and the papers were full of quack advertisements .

		At
Coney Island	LOCATION	he found a camp of palmists , and concludes that ''
America	LOCATION	is the chosen land of charlatans and bunco-steerers . ''

		Being a strong anti-militarist , he lectures Americans on their admiration for
Napoleon	PERSON	, '' the greatest bandit in history , '' who had not even the excuse of being an athlete .

		The book is thus full of statements and judgments that will astonish the reader , and sometimes make him throw it down with impa - tience ; full also of terse epigrams , and true and sound observations .

		Taken all in all , it shows a real sympathy for the spirit , the aims , and the character of the American nation and Amer - ican civilization .

		Recent Fiction .

		* Mrs.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	, in her preface to the first volume of the new Oxford edition of the Letters of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, states that 3,061 letters have been included , representing 150 correspondents .

		Of the 407 letters not included in
Cunningham	LOCATION	's edition .

		111 are now printed for the first time .

		It seems that a number of the letters , inter alia , to
Hannah More	PERSON	, have been tampered with , and disfigured by the cancelling of passages , the erasure of proper names , and , worse than all , by the insertion -LRB- apparently in the handwrit - ing of Hannah More herself -RRB- of words and phrases which
Walpole	LOCATION	never wrote .

		In one letter the name ''
Madame Piozzi	PERSON	'' has been erased , but is still legible through the erasure .

		Of the eleven portraits of

		Place aux dames !

		The most important books of fiction in our present selection are Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's '' Sanctuary '' and
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	's '' The Deliver - ance . ''

		Each of these novels is , in its ovin peculiar fashion , a masterpiece of conscientious workman - ship , vivid in its portrayal of a half-tragic situation , and powerful in its appeal to our human sympa - thies .

		Aside from their common quality of snc - cessf nl performance , the two books stand far apart from one another . ''

		Sanctuary '' is no more than a novelette , hardly more than a short story , while '' The Deliverance '' is a full-grown work of fiction , spanning many years of suffering and unachieved purpose , and provided with a great multiplicity of incident and detail .

		Bat both are works of art in a highly satisfactory sense .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's art is of subtler and more delicate quality than
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	's .

		She presents us with a case of conscience , studied in two generations .

		A young woman learns , on the eve of her marriage , that the man she loves is endowed with a radical weakness of character , that he has sinned , and is unwilling to make open confession to the world and face the consequences of his dereliction .

		At first her whole high-strung nature revolts , and she casts him off .

		Second thought reverses her decision ; she thinks of the moral weakness which must be the inheritance of the child of such a man ; she decides that she will be the mother of that child , and devote her life to its strengthening against the sort of temptation to which the father had succumbed .

		This is the brief prologue to the story .

		The longer second part opens some score of years later , and the moral problem quickly presents itself .

		The father has long since died , and the son has grown to man - hood .

		The father 's sin had taken the form of a suppression of evidence the disclosure of which would have led to scandal and the loss of fortune .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 The son 's temptation is to win a prize in his profes - sion by appropriating the work of a dead friend , and passing it off as his own .

		The winning of the prize will mean to him both professional advance - ment and the love of the woman upon whom his heart is set .

		The ensuing conflict between his warring impulses is revealed to us only by hints and suggestions ; it never comes to a dramatic issue , or even to direct discussion .

		The mother , trembling , stands aloof and awaits the outcome upon which depends the defeat or victory of a lifetime of con - secration to a single aim .

		Words will not avail ; the time has come when the man must save himself if he is to be saved at all .

		We approach the clos - ing scene in breathless suspense ; the situation is poignant to the extreme of endurance , and the relief is correspondingly great when the better nature of the young man triumphs , and he seeks the sanctu - ary of his mother 's arms , seeing at last as by a lightning flash all that she has done for him , and all the larger implications of the struggle from which he has in the end emerged victorious . ''

		I 'm not worcn the fight you 've put up for me .

		But I want you to know that it 's your doing -- that if you had let go an instant I should have gone under -- and that if I 'd gone under I should never have come up again alive . ''

		These are the last words of this deeply moving book , and they linger long in the memory . ''

		The Deliverance '' is the most important book thus far written by
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		It makes clear the fact that this novelist has '' come to stay , '' and that her work may be expected to go on broadening and deepening with the years .

		The scene of the story is
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the period is that covered by the
past quarter	DATE	- century .

		Tobacco provides its harmony with a sort of basso ostinato very much as hemp performs a similar function in one of the novels of Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	.

		We are con - scious of its presence everywhere as the ground - work of the structure , and made to realize that the entire scheme of life portrayed by the novelist rests upon that foundation .

		If this be a borrowing of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's idea , it is made quite legitimate by the original treatment it receives .

		More questionable , however , is the use of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	at a certain point in the narrative , for
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	takes the very pas - sage introduced with such striking effect in '' The Choir Invisible , '' and turns it to exactly the same emotional effect .

		One feature of '' The Deliverance '' is ingeniously contrived , but remains absolutely unconvincing .

		Old Mrs.
Blake	PERSON	has been blind since the middle of the Civil War , her family has lost its fortune , and moved from a colonial - mansion to an humble cottage ; yet through all these vicissitudes she has been made to believe that nothing is changed , that she still owns her hundreds of slaves , that the Confederacy has triumphed , and the South become a nation .

		This situation passes the bounds of all possible credulity , and , however tempting it was to the author , should not have been woven as it is into the very structure of her fabric .

		The love interest of the story is provided by
Christopher Blake	PERSON	, the dispossessed inheritor of the plantation , and
Maria Fletcher	PERSON	, the granddaughter of the ras - cal who has come into its ownership by fraud upon his former employer .

		The boy grows up to hate the Fletchers with all the passion of a strong and primitive nature ; the girl grows up in ignorance alike of the history of her grandfather 's fortune and of the feelings that rankle in the breast of the seeming peasant who is her neighbor .

		When they are first thrown together in their early adult years , each is instinctively attracted to the other , while assuming the mask of hatred or scorn .

		Not for many years is this instinctive feeling to ripen , and in the meanwhile
Christopher	PERSON	-LSB- goes on nursing his hate and planning revenge , while
Maria	ORGANIZATION	contracts a loveless marriage and disappears from the scene for a long time .

		It is by means of this leisurely devel - opment that the author achieves her largest effects .

		We know that the outcome is inevitable , but we approach it with such deliberation that all the sub - tle psychological processes of the years find room for analysis and exposition , and the figures of both characters become very completely human .

		The book has many minor features and characters de - serving of warm praise ; we have not space even for their mention , but trust that we have said enough to send our readers to one of the strongest and most vital productions of recent years .

		``
Judith	PERSON	of the Plains , '' by Miss
Marie Manning	PERSON	, is a story that starts out in much the same fashion as Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's '' Hesper . ''

		A young woman of education and refined associations is on her way to the strange world of the far West , and is , like Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's heroine , greatly bewildered by her expe - riences .

		Here , however , the resemblance ends , for the young woman is little more than a lay figure in the subsequent unfolding of the plot , and the real heroine appears in the character of the half-breed woman for whom the book is named .

		After we have stopped thinking about the likeness to ''
Hesper	PERSON	, '' we begin to discover points of resemblance to '' The Virginian , '' particularly in the reported speech of the
Wyoming	LOCATION	cowboys , which in its humorous aspect seems to us nearly as good as Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's best .

		The humor of this story is , indeed , its saving quality , for it is very badly constructed , and has no plot worth mentioning .

		Being a woman 's novel , it indulges in a good deal of rhapsodizing about the desert and mountains -- an element which a man would have minimized or omitted altogether .

		The writer cer - tainly has both style and imagination , and these qualities , together with her unfailing humor , make up in part for the lack of a definite plan , and keeps the story going in a fairly effective way .

		England in the latter half of the fourteenth century is the theme of '' Long Will , '' a historical romance by
Miss Florence Converse	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the
England of Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and
Gower	PERSON	, of
Langland	LOCATION	and Wyclif , of
John Ball	PERSON	and
Wat Tyler	PERSON	, of Richard II .

		and
John of Gaunt	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the
England	LOCATION	of rival claimants for the throne , of incipient questionings 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, of the established faith , of the profound social anrest resulting from the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	and the Statutes of Laborers .

		All of these men and matters are skilfully interwoven into a tapestry of patient literary workmanship having for its central figure the author of ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' and for its central theme the searchings of heart which that extraor - dinary poem occasioned among the dumb masses of the toilers .

		Charm is given to the narrative by the presence of an imagined daughter of
Langland	PERSON	and her courtly lover , attendant upon the youthful prince and king .

		The girl goes on a pilgrimage through rural
England	LOCATION	to preach her father 's gospel of true democracy and to bear the message of the coming uprising .

		The story reaches its climax with the peasant revolt , when
Wat Tyler	PERSON	and his fol - lowers take possession of
London	LOCATION	and spread terror in their train .

		The skill with which all this mate - rial is used deserves high praise , as does also the effective use made by the author of the text of ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	. ''

		The book is studded with fit - ting excerpts from the poem , applied in such a way as to make us understand the passion underlying its bald phrases far better than we can understand it from reading the histories of literature .

		Miss Converge has grappled in a fairly successful fashion with the chief difficulty of her task -- that of con - triving a mode of speech which shall be really in keeping with the age she depicts .

		What she has done may best be shown by an example .

		The words are Long Will 's , spoken in soliloquy . ''

		Pity me , God I I am a weak man !

		-- I did never no deeds but them I thought not to do ; -- never , all my life long !

		Count my deeds , O Qod , -- they are so few , -- and all of them have I condemned afore in other men .

		Now , I let my daughter go forth on a fool 's errand , and in a child 's plot that must fail ; mayhap she will meet worse than death on the road ; but I give her my blessing .

		Jesu , --
Mary	PERSON	, -- guard this my daughter that I have so weakly put forth upon the world !

		How may a man dare say nay to his child , if she be a better man than he , -- an actyf man , a doer o ' deeds ?

		How may a man dare forbid any soul to follow Conscience ?

		Oood Jesu , I am but a jongleur , -- a teller o ' tales , -- i am afeared o ' deeds .

		I see them on so many sides that I dare move nor hand nor foot .

		And if I do , I trip .

		Best never be doing .

		-- If a man might be all words , and no deeds ! ''

		The diction of which this is a typical illustration will at once be seen to embody not a little of the fourteenth century English fashion in its simple directness , its quaint naiveti , and its hint of the unassimilated French element in the language .

		It is sometimes too stiff , and the illusion is far from complete at many points , but how admirable it is in comparison with the conventional phrasing of the bastard jargon which serves the average historical romancer for a medium !

		Here , at least , is a seri - ous effort to achieve reality , and not a deliberate evasion of the whole problem .

		It must have taken a lively imagination to invent the character of
Babington	LOCATION	, the university president who is the central figure in '' The Torch , '' by Pro- fessor
Herbert M. Hopkins	PERSON	.

		Babington presides over a Western institution , and is a compound of bully and hypocrite , tuft-hunter and snob .

		When a member of the faculty incurs his dislike , he says , '' Off with his head ! ''

		like the Qaeen in ''
Alice	PERSON	, '' and off it goes .

		We have a fairly wide acquaintance among university presidents , but have never met with a specimen at all resembling this caricature .

		Now Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	, in writing the present book , had a very laudable design .

		It was his aim to protest against the autocratic character of the management of many of our universities , and to plead against the evils which naturally result from too great a concentration of power in the executive .

		These evils are manifest in many quarters , and such a protest is desirable .

		But the whole purpose of the argument is defeated by the grossly improbable account given us of this particular executive and his acts .

		Furthermore , Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	has committed something worse than an indiscretion in selecting certain happenings in the recent history of a great Western university , presenting them in a sensa - tional light , and basing upon them the very struc - ture of his story .

		No one can read the book with - out perceiving at once that a particular president of a particular university is aimed at , and no one acquainted with the institution and the man can fail to be shocked at the travesty .

		Unfortunately , the book will find many readers who are without the personal knowledge necessary for a corrective , and such readers will be influenced by an account which is distorted and discolored from beginning to end .

		The mischief will be the greater for the very fact that the story is strongly conceived , and , although misleading as a whole , embodies many fragments of undoubted truth .

		It is in vain to plead that the novelist takes his suggestions wher - ever he may find them ; in the present case he has done more than act upon a mere suggestion : he has seized upon a situation already made familiar to thousands of readers through the sensational newspaper press , and has so dealt with it as to ' create prejudices of the bitterest sort in the minds of readers not conversant with the facts in the case .

		There is no doubt that Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	's late novels have the very quintessence of charm .

		This charm results from a dainty style formed upon the best French models , a marked delicacy of poetic sentiment , and an exquisite sense of proportion and fitness .

		Yet the charm is absolutely superficial , and the depths of character have no existence as far as the figures which people his pages are concerned . ''

		My Friend Prospero '' is the gay and joyous love - story of an English nobleman and an Austrian princess , thrown together in an Italian castle and the surrounding landscape .

		Each remains ignorant of the rank , and even the name of the other , until the very end , when a fairy godmother reveals both secrets , and clears the way for a mutual under - standing .

		A story like this is no more amenable to serious criticism than a butterfly or a humming - bird , yet we are disposed to suggest two matters that come near to being defects .

		One of them is the introduction for one brief scene of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can friend of the hero , who plays no real part in
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		121 the story , and serves only to help the hero make - conversation when next he meets his heart 's desire .

		The other is a certain over-insistence upon the money motive , which clouds the bright romantic Atmosphere of the tale .

		Such lovers as these have nothing to do with such considerations ; they are not denizens of a material and mercenary world , and their fortunes are not bound up in the ordinary - concerns of an average prosaic humanity .

		Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	's new story , '' Mr.
Salt	PERSON	, '' offers us another picture of commercialism in a great - city , this time in vignette form , for the work is hardly more than a novelette .

		The hero -- if we may apply to him that useful term -- is a captain of industry , and the heroine one of his stenogra - phers .

		Since one of the first acts of the latter is to commit perjury in a court of justice , in the inter - - ests of her employer , we must be excused for a cer - tain inability to follow her career with complete - sympathy .

		The romance between the man and the woman grows apace , and ends in the usual way .

		The story is written from full knowledge of the sort of life with which it deals , and is not without touches of delicate human feeling .

		It certainly gives us life -- of a sort -- and it comes near to giving us literature -- of a minor order .

		The American railway is the real subject of Mr.
Frank Spearman	PERSON	's '' The Daughter of a Magnate , '' although a love-story is provided as a sort of sub - sidiary attraction , and as a concession to the con - ventions of fiction .

		The scene is the far West , the language is that spoken in those parts by men en - gaged in railway work .

		It is rather too technical for the comfort of the average reader . ''

		Even the porter of the dead car deserted his official corpse , and after Number One pulled out of Medicine Bend and stuck her slim , aristocratic nose fairly into the big ranges the
Lalla Rookh	PERSON	was left as dead as a stringer to herself and her reflections '' -- this is the sort of thing we find in every chapter .

		We have no doubt of its truth to life and to railroading , but too much of it wearisome .

		There is always some - thing fine in the spectacle of man struggling against nature and coming out triumphant ; we get this sort of satisfaction in two scenes particularly , one of which represents the hero at work repairing the damage done by a disastrous washout , while the other finds him bringing a train -LRB- and the heroine -RRB- safely through a perilous blizzard .

		The whole story is informed with a tense energy that at least keeps one in a state of breathless attention to its movement .

		A novel written even in part by the late
Stephen Crane	PERSON	comes to us at this late day as a surprise .

		The other part is the work of Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	, but whether by way of collaboration or the piecing-out of a fragment we are not informed .

		At all events , the book is not obviously composite , and proves to be much more of a story than any of the books of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	that were published during his lifetime .

		It is called `` The O'Ruddy , '' and is the tale of a roistering and dare-devil Irishman who comes to
England	LOCATION	after his father 's death on a mission to the Earl of
Westport	LOCATION	, falls in love with the earl 's daughter , and wins her by sheer audacity in the face of all sorts of obstacles .

		The depiction of this character and the account of his deeds seem to be intended as a satire upon this particular type of swashbuckling adventure , and the stock situations are outlined in a spirit of extravagant burlesque which is highly amusing .

		The book is a singularly racy one , and may be read with unflagging interest .

		When we reviewed '' The Bath Comedy , '' by Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	PERSON	, we remarked that we '' would gladly remain in such company for an in - definite period . ''

		It is to the same company of Mistress
Kitty	PERSON	and her satellites that we are again introduced by < ' Incomparable Bellairs , '' the sequel which the authors have kindly provided for the earlier book .

		Kitty is as capricious and bewitch - ing as ever , and her devoted Irish lover -LRB- who really wins her this time -RRB- is as audacious and reckless as when he made his first desperate siege of her affec - tions .

		Other figures appear , notably that of a gra - cious
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	maiden , who serves as an effective foil to the titular heroine .

		The book is a mixture of wit and tender sentiment , alternately sparkling with the one and melting with the other , and is fascinating from first to last .

		In '' The Shutters of Silence , '' Mr.
G. B. Burgin	PERSON	has made effective use of a Trappist monastery in the northern wilderness of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		In this estab - lishment a boy , abandoned by his mother and lost by his father , takes refuge , and grows to manhood in its peaceful and austere seclusion .

		He is of ille - gitimate birth and his unnatural mother has rid herself of him in order that she may marry and be safe from the discovery of her sin .

		When the boy has grown up , the father learns his whereabouts , and rescues him before he has taken his vows to the order .

		He is taken to
England	LOCATION	, introduced to society , and made to know something of the joys and sorrows of life .

		Next to the description of the monastic life itself , which is pictured with sombre and haunting fidelity , the study of his development under this startling change of conditions is the most interesting feature of the story , The young man falls in love , but the cup of happiness is dashed from his lips when he learns the secret of his birth , and he flees to the refuge of his earlier years .

		Here he is at last found by both father and mother , the former now a widow and the latter at the point of death ; a belated marriage ceremony takes place , and the youth goes back into the world with a name that he may now legitimately bear .

		Such is the out - line of a story which may lay claim to a fair degree of originality , and which is of more than ordinary interest .

		`` The Key of Paradise , '' by Mr.
Sidney Pickering	PERSON	, is an Italian romance of a hundred years ago , when the Napoleonic wars filled the world , and brought terror into the fairest of lands .

		The interest of the story , however , is private , and the history serves only for relief .

		There is an Italian princess , the husband who maltreats her , and the sympathetic English 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, soldier who seeks to win her love .

		The outcome is rather unexpected , for the princess , despite her wrongs , remains faithful to her marital obligations , and wins her husband 's devotion in the end .

		The work is carefully planned , and wrought out with such nicety of finish that , although the performance is slight , it is unusually satisfactory from every artistic point of view .

		Briefs ox New Books .

		Let no one suppose from the plain ^ ^ t ^ r / '' * '' ^ '' t ` tle `` Ferns , a Manual for the own book . '

		Northeastern States '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
Campbell E. Waters	PERSON	, that we have here simply a text-book , or at best a descriptive list of species , as manuals of plants and animals are wont to be .

		The work is this , and very much more .

		It is a very handsome volume , beautifully bound and printed , with ornate cover and gilt top , fit to lie upon the table among the latest and handsomest books of the year .

		Furthermore , text and illustrations alike are not designed primarily for the man of science , but for the amateur , for the men and women who love ferns , the most graceful and beautiful forms of all the green world about us , and , loving them , would fain be able to give appropriate name to each and every one .

		To such the volume will certainly make a strong appeal .

		The original feature in the pres - ent treatment of the ferns is the effort made to use stem-structure , revealed in cross-section , as a means of identification and so for the framing of an arti - ficial key .

		This may sometimes be helpful , and the facts so brought out may be at times confirmatory ; but after all , it would seem that anyone sufficiently skilful to use his lens to meet the requirements of this key should be able to study in the old-fashioned way the fruit-dots , indusia , pinnae , etc. , and would find the effort far more interesting .

		For some reason , several species described in the text are not named in this key .

		The illustrations are nearly all half-tones from photographs , and show well the advantages and disadvantages of the process .

		The views of the species in their native haunts are , many of them , very beautiful ; but the reproductions of the individual fronds are generally disappointing .

		The process is not adapted to the subject .

		The delicacy of these filmy things is lost .

		This is espe - cially the case where the illustration represents the object enlarged .

		Here the photograph reminds one of the pictures of plaster - casts taken from the faces of the dead .

		Photography can not , or at least does not , portray these things .

		One touch of
Gibson	PERSON	's pencil were worth it all .

		No doubt some of the illustrations , showing details , fructifications , sori , etc. , will be serviceable in identifying generic types ; but the camera is clearest only where it is less needed , as in the case of some of the shield-ferns and spleen - worts , and brings no help , or little , where illustra - tion should serve .

		Thus , the figure intended to illustrate the indusia of Cystopteris shows really nothing that can be so recognized .

		Our author wisely gives precedence in each case to the common name ; but he also presents the name by which each form is known in science , although without citing the name of the author of the binomial approved .

		While it is refreshing to be delivered from the cus - tomary inane discussions of questions of nomencla - ture , still no scientific name in natural history may be correctly written unless the name of the author accompanies it .

		It may be worth saying here that for appearance sake , if for no other reason , it were well to begin every specific name , no matter what its origin , with a small letter .

		But these are minor criticisms ; the book as a whole is a beautiful one , and likely to be widely useful .

		It is one of the few real nature-study books so far offered to the Amer - ican people .

		Here is no nonsense , no child 's - talk ; and ` if the author 's style be somewhat conversa - tional , and confidential at times , he nevertheless tells his story in an interesting and straightforward way .

		There is a fascination in any bio - a ^ # !

		^ HU '' ^ graphic material relating to the Roe - setti family .

		The readers of the new volume of ''
Rossetti Papers	ORGANIZATION	,
1862	DATE	to 1870 '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- will feel the charm of the subject , and will delight in subtle glimpses of char - acter and environment , but they will deplore the lack of chapters or similar divisions into which the material might have been more conveniently and effectively grouped .

		More than five hundred pages of consecutive letters and journal-extracts , with a few parenthetical notes , become wearisome when there is no break in structure and but meagre dramatic incident .

		This volume continues the twa earlier compilations entitled ''
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, Preraphaelitism '' and '' Preraphaelite Diaries and Letters . ''

		The latter volume ended with the death of
Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	's wife , and the burial of his poems in her casket ; the present book deals with the intervening events until
1870	DATE	, when the poems were resurrected and published .

		Much of the ma - terial here presented has been incorporated already , indirectly , into other books upon the
Rossetti	PERSON	family .

		With a revival of interest which comes from a perusal of the direct sources , however , one reads again of the estranged relations between
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	, of the brotherly interest of Gabriel in the publication of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	's poems , of
William Rossetti	PERSON	's appreciative studies of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Blake	PERSON	, and of the tragic blight upon the eyes of
Gabriel	PERSON	and his forced renun - ciation of art .

		The growth of the artist 's power and popularity , the submerged yet exquisite skill of the poet , are clearly portrayed in the letters of friendship and appreciative criticism from
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Hamerton	LOCATION	,
Madox Brown	PERSON	,
William Bell Scott	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	, and the American friends .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	and

Norton	PERSON	, then at
Florence	LOCATION	.

		In it , he refuses an invitation to join them , because of his troublesome eyes , but expresses the most cordial friendship in a tone of unwonted intimacy .

		Of the poems then just published he wrote : '' I hope that when you get my book you will agree with me as to the justness of my including all it contains .

		I say this because there are a few things -- and notably a poem called Jenny -- which will raise objections in some quarters .

		I only know that they have been written neither recklessly nor aggressively -LRB- moods which I think are sure to result in the ruin of Art -RRB- , but from a true impulse to deal with sub - jects which seem to me capable of being brought rightly within Art 's province .

		Of my own position I feel sure , and so wait the final result without apprehension . ''

		Practical essays * ' Lectures on Commerce '' -LRB- Univer - `` n commerce and sity of
Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of industry .

		^ volume edited by Mr.
Henry Rand Hatfield	PERSON	, and containing sixteen papers read before the students of the recently founded
College of Commerce and Administration	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the first of these papers , entitled `` Higher Commercial Education , '' Professor
J. Laurence Laughlin	PERSON	, dean of the new college , pre - sumably defines the scope of the undertaking .

		`` To the virile and enterprising spirits who are tempted by the great rewards of banking , railways , insur - ance , trade and industry , '' he observes , '' the uni - versities have -- at least not until very recently -- offered no inducements . ''

		Further on , he says : '' It is startling to think how little influence the universities of to-day have had in training the great men in the constituencies of banking , railways , in - surance , trade and industry , diplomacy , journalism , and politics . ''

		Only with reference to the older subjects , the '' humanities , '' does he accord ' * accu - racy of statement , precision , logic , the judicial spirit , the love of truth , and a sense of form , '' and he asks if it is not possible to extend these virtues into the actualities of commerce and administration .

		But the stress of his remarks seems still to be laid upon '' the great rewards , '' '' the great men , '' and not upon '' the love of truth . ''

		His lecture also illus - trates the prime diflficulties of the new education in a brief discussion of journalism , assuming as he does that the practical training of a newspaper office makes * ' hacks , '' and that '' the policy and influence of a newspaper depend upon whether or not it shows a masterly grasp of the political , economic , legal , and literary subjects which the public are thinking about . ''

		But it is not because of their editorial columns , where this '' masterly grasp '' may only be displayed , that modern news - papers are influential ; it is because of their news columns almost wholly .

		The real journalistic '' hacks '' are those with the training Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	intends giving in the college of which he is dean ; '' the great rewards '' come to those whom he thinks are made into '' hacks . ''

		The fact is , in the last analysis , that newspaper success depends mainly upon such a knowledge of contemporary life as is denied university faculties by the very terms of their being .

		The remaining lectures in the vol - ume are by railway men , merchants , manufacturers , and bankers well known in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	, few of them with any theoretical training , but all with achieved success gained by personal effort and practical work .

		These papers make most interest - ing and instructive reading ; but it can not be said that they lend themselves to proof of Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	's contentions for his new school .

		The mournful narrative of
England	LOCATION	's The wofui past seven centuries of oppression and misgovernment in
Ireland	LOCATION	has been retold in summarized form by Mr.
Thomas Addis Emmet	PERSON	, under the composite title of ``
Ireland	LOCATION	under English Rule , or A Pleaforthe Plaintiff '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		He tells his profoundly moving story in calm and dignified language , without outburst or objurgation .

		The only severity found in his relation inheres in the extraordinary character of the events re - cited , and throughout his work the historical spirit dominates .

		It does not , however , profess to be a history ; it is a historical summary , merely , but one susceptible of much use by students .

		Mr.
Emmet	PERSON	's `` plea '' consists largely of copious extracts from historical writings of past centuries .

		Naturally , these quotations are derived in great measure from Irish sources , yet enough of them appear from British and continental writers to relieve the book from any appearance of resting on a purely parti - san basis .

		The writers quoted are all in substan - tial accord as to the merits of
Ireland	LOCATION	's claims and the character of her wrongs .

		A running thread of judicious commentary by the author connects to - gether this summary of quotations from older writers .

		The sad history will appeal forcibly to American readers , for whom primarily Mr , Emmet writes .

		But one can read between the lines a calm and earnest address to the better sense of the British people , whose government it is , and not themselves , that is so severely indicted .

		While Mr.
Emmet	PERSON	confessedly '' holds a brief '' for the cause of
Ireland	LOCATION	, and has prepared his essay in some sense officially , as the President of the '' Irish Na - tional Federation of
America	LOCATION	, '' it is not merely nor even largely an oratorical effort .

		It is apparent from the character and style of the '' plea '' that the pleader feels a day of redemption for
Ireland	LOCATION	is at hand , and that his summary of the merits of the cause he loves is intended , not to increase nor even to perpetuate the past tension , but to lead toward and assist in establishing a better and a more harmo - nious understanding for the future as to the deserts of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		These two handsomely printed volumes are a worthy American contribution toward that de - sirable result , while at the same time furnishing much justification for the Irish contention of the past centuries .

		A bibliography of one hundred and seventy titles attests the extent of reading which has qualified Mr.
Emmet	PERSON	for the work he has undertaken of arousing in a new form , for the new century , in - terest in the welfare of '' the Emerald Isle . ''

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	,
Lord Ronald	PERSON	That a part is often better than the Stt/heriand-Oower whole is well illustrated by
Lord	ORGANIZATION	in abridgment .

		Ronald Sutherland-Gower ` fl `` Rec - ords and Reminiscences '' -LRB- inaported by Scribner -RRB- , a handsome and profusely illustrated octavo of 624 pages .

		It is at once an amalgamation and an abridg - ment of the author 's well-known '' Reminiscences '' and * ' Old Diaries , '' the curtailed one-volume form being prepared , we are told , by request .

		But even in abridgment the noble lord has in no wise slighted the claims due to himself and his family , fifty pages being devoted to the record of his birth and ances - try .

		Although a man 's progenitors , like his chil - dren , are more interesting to himself than to others , the author has succeeded in enlivening these open - ing chapters with anecdote and history of some - thing more than personal significance .

		Under his genial guidance we follow the fortunes of the
Sutherlands	ORGANIZATION	, the
Gowers	PERSON	, and the Levesons -- for all three are his family names , though he contents himself with the use of but two -- and find them in general prosperous even to the point of tameness .

		This tameness is occasionally relieved , however , as by the fatal poisoning of the eleventh earl of
Suther	PERSON	- land and his Countess , in
1567	DATE	, by Lady
Isabel Sinclair	PERSON	.

		The tragedy was attended by other thrill - ing events worthy to be embalmed by the historical novelist .

		On the
Gower	PERSON	side of the house , one of the family was all but immortalized , unenviably , by having his name inserted in Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary as a synonym for renegade ; bat the printer refused to humor the lexicographer .

		Such , at least , is the story .

		In the author 's account of
Cliveden House	ORGANIZATION	he takes unnecessary pains to quote from Pope that familiar but untruthful line which places the death of Buckingham '' in the worst inn 's worst room , '' whereas the Duke breathed his last in the farm - house of one of his tenants .

		As is already known , it is Lord
Sutherland-Gower	PERSON	's extended travels and his interviews with noted persons that give the chief value and interest to his pages .

		In this particular the new book has all the charm of its parent vol - umes , besides being freed from many of their superfluities .

		But the reviewer , to be true to his traditions , must note with regret the lack of an index .

		A great many besides those who dare A monograph ^ j ^ j ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ flattering title of connois - on mezzoltnit ... '' , • , , seur will rejoice in the series of luxu - riant monographs projected by Messrs.
G. F. Put	PERSON	- nam 's Sons , in connection with an English house , under the general title of ' ^ The Connoisseur 's Library . ''

		The series will comprise twenty volumes in all , covering exhaustively and authoritatively every form of objet d'art affected by the modern collector .

		The - editor of the series , Mr.
Cyril Davenport	PERSON	, is responsible for the initial volume , dealing with Mezzotints , the most interesting and beautiful , as well as the most difficult to produce , of all forms of artistic engraving .

		Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	knows his subject thoroughly , and though there is of necessity much technical matter in his pages , he is always lucid and intelligible even to the tyro .

		The first chapter has to do with the practical side of the subject , describing minutely the technical process of mezzotint engraving , both in monotone and color , and giving directions for the care , preservation , and identification of prints .

		The re - maining three chapters are largely historical and critical , dealing respectively with the best known seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth century engravers .

		It is interesting to know that , though engraving in mezzotint has not lacked for exponents on the continent , the greatest masters in this me - dium have been Englishmen , and mezzotinting may properly be called an English art .

		For the future of his subject Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	is not very hopeful .

		A few gifted mezzotinters are still working , but the recently improved methods in photogravure repro - duction have introduced a formidable rival to the art .

		Modern photogravure work has not yet been able to attain the depth and velvety lustre of pure mezzotinting ; and being almost entirely a mechan - ical process it may never hope for much favor in the eyes of collectors .

		But for all practical ends the photogravure fills the place of the mezzotint , and is of course infinitely less expensive , especially where large numbers of prints are required .

		The plates selected to illustrate Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	's text are excellent specimens of the best results in modern photogravure work .

		There are forty in all , exem - plifying the art of nearly every master in mezzotint engraving .

		The mechanical form of the present volume is dignified and excellent in every detail , as such a work should be .

		The binding especially , so often a deplorable feature in English book-making , is thoroughly serviceable , a minor point worthy of commendation being the method of mounting the plates on linen guards instead of flimsily sewing them in , as is almost invariably done .

		That the fashion of regarding his - Ameriean hittory ^ g ^ igj ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ viewpoint of and geography .

		, .

		, . '' '

		^ .

		, politics IS passing away , is evident from two books which have recently appeared .

		The first , by Miss
Ellen Churchill Semple	PERSON	, is entitled `` American History and its Geographic Conditions '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and presents an extremely careful and comprehensive arrangement of the successive events in American history , with a convincing argument to prove that the determinant factors in its develop - ment are geographical .

		The second book , by Mr.
Albert Perry Brigham	PERSON	, '' Geographical Influence in American History '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , is a shorter work , evi - dently designed to show what are the geographical and geological features of
America	LOCATION	, and to prove that these are real , but by no means the only , in - fluences in the country 's development .

		This author lays great stress on the fact that racial characteris - tics help to mould civilization ; herein differing from
Miss Semple	PERSON	, who declares their impotency , citing the comparison of
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	as an example .

		Both
Miss Semple	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Brigham	PERSON	.

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		125 give essentially the same descriptions of the purely geographical conditions of
America	LOCATION	: the various sections of the country , their topographical features and connecting waterways .

		But while Mr.
Brigham	PERSON	takes geology as his point of departure , and has a great deal to say of '' the background of ages of physical evolution , '' the '' glacial belt , '' and the `` ' ice-sheets , '' Miss
Semple	PERSON	confines herself to com - paratively modern conditions , -- i. e. , to those since the discovery of
America	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , although she treats such subjects as the Early Settlements , the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and the Civil War , in detail , yet she places her emphasis on the present and future .

		This is especially true of her chapters on the geographical distribution of cities and indus - tries , and of railroads .

		And aside from the differ - ent points of departure , the further treatments of the subject differ , -- that of Miss
Semple	PERSON	being the more detailed , that of Mr.
Brigham	PERSON	the more general .

		Miss
Semple	PERSON	states in the beginning her conclusion : '' The most important geographical fact in the past history of the
United States	LOCATION	has been their location on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	opposite
Europe	LOCATION	; and the most important geographical fact in lending a distinctive character to their future history will probably be their location on the
Pacific	LOCATION	opposite
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Brigham	PERSON	similarly gives as '' the one fact of overshadowing importance in the history of
America	LOCATION	, that a wide ocean separated an advanced civilization and a relatively dense population from a wide , rich , and almost unoccupied continent . ''

		Both books are of unusual interest , not only to the his - torian and geographer , but also to the general reader .

		In Miss
Lilian Pettengill	PERSON	's book en - The problem , 0 / jj ^ jg ^ j u Toilers of the Home '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , another attempt is made to throw light upon the question of domestic service .

		Believing that the opinions of the average mistress are not only vague but unfair , the author spent nearly a year in household service , that she might view the problem from all sides .

		It would perhaps be impertinent to suggest that experience as mistress might also be necessary to absolute fair - ness .

		But the author is evidently sincere in her intention , and the book might furnish a wealth of material for discussion in a woman 's club .

		She records , in five somewhat long chapters , her experi - ence in as many families .

		The book is full of details and personal gossip , and certainly presents all sorts and conditions of women , from the delightful '' spin - sters three '' to the would-be great lady and the all-too-rare good housekeeper .

		The conclusions , summed up in a final chapter , add nothing to facts already worn with much discussion ; their greatest interest is in their na'ivetS .

		The long and indefinite hours of service , the lack of home and social life , and the supposed disgrace of being a domestic ser - vant , are mentioned as the difficult factors in any satisfactory settlement of the problem .

		By way of solution .

		Miss
Pettengill	PERSON	suggests that servants should never live in the houses of their employers , but in homes of their own , or in little colonies by them - selves .

		In this way she thinks the work would be - come more definite , the grade of service demanded and rendered improved , and the loneliness of the position remedied .

		In all this , it is a question whether the remedy is not worse than the disease ; but we must heartily agree with the statement that '' the housekeeper 's problem is largely one of self - government . ''

		The sub-title of the book , '' A Col - lege Woman 's Experience as a Domestic Servant , '' leads one to wonder what college training resulted in the production of an English style so careless , would-be-sarcastic , and often obscure , as that con - stantly used by the author .

		This autobiography has been prepared for publication -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- by Professor
W. D. Armes	PERSON	, his pupil and colleague .

		LeConte was born of Huguenot and Puritan par - entage , in the
New England	LOCATION	community in
Liberty County	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, in a family noted for its intellect - ual brilliancy and scientific predilections .

		It is not strange , therefore , that he should have chosen med - icine as a career ; nor that he should have found its practice , as conducted in those days , very irksome .

		The early chapters of the autobiography , dealing with these years , give a charming picture of social life in ante-bellum days on Southern plantations .

		In
1850	DATE	LeConte went to
Cambridge	LOCATION	and became one of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's first pupils , graduating in the first class from the
Lawrence Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	.

		He at once began his busy career as educator , investigator , scientist , and philosopher , at first in his native South and after the war on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		His ac - count of an extended tour through the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and about the Great Lakes , in
1844	DATE	, and his por - trayal of conditions in the
South	LOCATION	during and after the war , are of historical value as faithful pictures of the times , and these , as well as the whole book , are written in charming style , simple and direct , so that the interest of the reader never flags .

		The greatest value of the book lies , however , in its par - tial self - revelation of the man whose intellectual virility and gentle unfailing courtesy made '' Pro- fessor Joe '' the idol of many generations of students , and still keep his memory green from the
Sierras	LOCATION	to the sea .

		, , , , given much serious thought ; but thus far the marvellous career of the great Protector and the tragic death of
Charles Stuart	PERSON	have received the greater share of this attention .


Charles II.	PERSON	, on the other hand , has not proved so attractive a subject either to the historian or to the novelist .

		Recently , however , that inglorious monarch has found an en - thusiastic biographer in Mr.
Allan Fea	PERSON	, who seems to have made the Restoration period his particular field of research .

		Not long ago he published an 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, account of Prince
Charles	PERSON	's escape across the Chan - nel after the battle of
Worcester	LOCATION	; this year he has given us a companion volume entitled '' After Wor - cester Fight '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In this new work he republishes the materials used in writing ^ ' The Flight of the
King	PERSON	, '' consisting of five tracts pro- duced either in printed or manuscript form during the reign of Charles II .

		Source materials are , as a rule , not very interesting reading , but in this case a work has been compiled which is singularly at - tractive .

		The book is beautifully printed and sup - plied with numerous illustrations of historic value .

		The editorial work has been done with considerable care ; the editor has added some information from tradition and state-papers , most of which is , how - ever , of the antiquarian order and has but slight value as history .

		Still , Mr.
Fea	PERSON	's zeal is to be com - mended , and anyone who has read his earlier work will be sure to appreciate this companion volume .

		Dangers of '' ^ ^ ^ popularization of the results of popularizing research in the various fields of the teitnce .

		physical and natural sciences is more and more demanded by the ever increasing class of readers whose previous information and training have opened to them the gates of science , but who still lack the technical information or the recourse to original sources which alone can give immediate access to her latest revelations .

		Our popular mag - azines have attempted to meet this demand , in some cases by contributions from specialists , in others , unfortunately , from less trustworthy sources .

		Not only readability , but reliability , is a prime requisite , if such papers are to command respect in scientific circles .

		Mr.
Carl Snyder	PERSON	's '' New Conceptions in Science '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- meets the first prerequisite , for here the latest news from the firing-line of research is given with the dash and abandon of the field cor - respondent , and with something also of his disre - gard for the petty details of fact .

		The author is not an authority in any field of science ; yet he essays what no single expert would dare , a `` clear and con - cise exposition of the newest conceptions in science in various fields . ''

		To an evident lack of informa - tion on the older and more fundamental conceptions and facts of science , the author adds his attitude of the special-pleader for a materialistic philosophy , and for fundamental changes in present social methods .

		The critical reader , though not informed in the technicalities of science , may readily detect fallacies in these parts of the book .

		Everyday life in Autlria-Hungary .

		If for no other reason , the dual king - dom known as
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	is of world-wide interest because of the strange assemblage of races occupying the domin - ions of Emperor
Francis Joseph	PERSON	.

		The Germanic Austrians and the Hungarians or Magyars , taken together , form less than half of the total popula - tion .

		The majority of Austro-Hungarian peoples belong to races which are neither `` Austrian '' nor Hungarian , '' properly so-called .

		Most of them are of Slavonic origin , -- Czechs , Croatians ,
Servians	PERSON	,
Ruthenes	LOCATION	, Poles , Slovaks , and Austrian Bulgarians , Others are of races nearly allied to the Latin group .

		-- Roumanians or Wallachians , and Italians .

		And of Jews , Greeks , Turks , and Gipsies , there are not a few .

		There are corresponding differences of lan - guage , religion , and habits of life , making it diffi - cult to describe in a single volume the characteris - tics of such a complex nationality .

		Yet we find this dual kingdom and its people not only intelli - gently , but most entertainingly , treated by Mr.
Francis H. E. Palmer	PERSON	, in `` Austro-Hungarian Life in Town and Country , '' issued as a volume in `` Our European Neighbours '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Possibly the author 's successful treatment of his difficult subject is due to his having already fur - nished a volume upon Russian life in the same series .

		With Russian life he repeatedly compares what he finds in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, and he gives us an insight into Austro-Hungarian affairs that it would be scarcely possible to obtain otherwise than through a long residence in the country .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mark Twain 's '' Jumping Frog '' in what may be called its tri-lingual form is made into a small volume of its own by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text comprises the original English of the tale , then the French version as published in the '' Revue des Deux Mondes , '' and finally the author 's painful reconstruc - tion of his pet story , `` clawed back into a civilized lan - guage once more by patient , unremunerated toil . ''

		This re - translation is one of the funniest things ever done by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and goes well with his commentary on the German language .

		Messrs.
Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish two com - panion volumes respectively entitled '' A Book of Amer - ican Prose Humor '' and '' A Book of American Humor - ous Verse . ''

		The editing is anonymous , but appears to be particularly well done in the case of the volume of verse .

		The other volume , representing only a baker 's dozen of authors , did not offer the same opportunity for skilful selection and combination .

		Both are noteworthy for the representation of very recent humorous writing .

		A recent addition to the `` Historic Lives '' series -LRB- Appletons -RRB- is a volume on
Champlain	LOCATION	, the founder of
New France	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Edwin Asa Dix	PERSON	.

		The various editions of
Champlain	LOCATION	's `` Voyages '' seem to have been followed closely in collecting the material for the sketch , and a number of
Champlain	ORGANIZATION	's drawings from the same source are reproduced .

		It is a modest and straight - forward narrative , devoid of either fulsome eulogy or a spirit of disputation .

		Professor
William MacDonald	PERSON	's '' Select Statutes and Other Documents Illustrative of the History of the
United States	LOCATION	, 1861-1898 , '' published by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, supplements the author 's volume of '' Select Documents , '' covering the earlier period , in a highly satisfactory way .

		The number of papers given is one hundred and thirty-one , beginning with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's first call for volunteers , and ending with the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Teachers of American history will find this collection an invaluable adjunct to their work .

		A WOT -LCB- p ABOUT THE SPECIAL LIMITET -RRB- ETilTIONS nr P1 -LCB- INTET -RRB- BT THE 1 HE success achieved by the 7 -LCB- jverside Press Editions during the past four years has been so gratifyingjhat the Publishers have decided to enlarge the scope of the department .

		In doing so , they hope to meet the wishes of a great number of book-lovers by dividing these pub - lications into two classes .

		This was suggested by the fact that in sele ^ ing titles to appear in their I ^ verside Press Editions , they were fre - quently obliged to reject books because the sub - jects did not properly allow of an individual style of typographical treatment .

		Among the books thus passed over , however , are many of unusual interest , either bibliographical , his - torical , or occasional , whose contents deserve preservation in a fitting form .

		They will endeavor to give the further volumes of the I -LCB- iverside Press Editions that distinctive indi - TIIFERSIDE PRESS .

		viduality of format and that permanent value as examples of excellence in design and work - manship which book-lovers have appreciated in the books already issued .

		For the reprints of rare Americana , for bib - liographical volumes , and for those original works which may commend themselves for special publication , a treatment is proposed somewhat different from that of the I ^ iverside Press Editions .

		To these books , to be known as Special Limited Editions , the same expert su - pervision of make-up and manufacture will be given that I -LCB- iverside Press Editions receive .

		There will be but one edition of each work , strictly limited , of which the plates will be destroyed when the printing is completed .

		It is expected , furthermore , that the books will be offered at a comparatively moderate price .

		The public university supported by taxation , and forming the keystone in the educational arch of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, offers one of the most familiar , and at the same time one of the most distinctive features of the American sys - tem .

		In our Western and
Southern States	LOCATION	, indeed , this part of the educational machinery is so taken for granted as both necessary and logical that we should find much difficulty in dismissing it from the terms of our thinking about educational matters .

		That the
State	ORGANIZATION	uni - versity is the logical outcome of our national attitude toward education will be admitted with - out much argument .

		We believe it a para - mount duty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to provide for the free education of its citizens , and that principle once accepted , the question of how far public education shall be carried becomes one of mere expediency , of ways and means only , involving no fundamental principle whatever .

		It is ob - vious that the education provided at the publio charge should be the best that is demanded by intelligent opinion , the best that is justified by economic conditions .

		On the other hand , it is equally evident from our educational history that the public univer - sity is not necessary in the sense that we should have no higher education at all without it .

		That agency failing us , we should still have private institutions of learning , and these , if in unrestricted occupancy of the field , would undoubtedly be much more numerous than they now are , possibly numerous enough to make up fully for the failure of the community to recog - nize its higher responsibilities .

		The fact that a national ideal which leaves to private initia - tive so many matters fostered by government support in other countries has not been willing to leave this matter also to take care of itself offers convincing evidence of the seriousness with which we confront our duties in the edu - cational field .

		Hardly any other nation even now confronts those duties as seriously as we do ; no other nation has a record as long and consistent as ours for recognition of this solemn educational obligation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The early history of college education in 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	,
America	LOCATION	is not only interesting in itself , and even romantic at times , but it is also singularly instructive in the light which it throws upon the persistency of the national attitude toward education .

		Mr.
Elmer Ellsworth Brown	PERSON	, the author of a recent publication of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
California	LOCATION	, entitled '' The Origin of
American State Universities	ORGANIZATION	, '' has made an interesting study of the conditions surrounding the higher education in our early history , the influences that shaped our pioneer colleges , and the tendencies that at last resulted in the type of institution now known as the
State	ORGANIZATION	university .

		It is the case with nations as well as individuals that ideals which eventually become distinctly defined originate in some semi-conscious impulse , and grope their way toward complete realization .

		This is notably the case with the American ideal of the higher public education , as Mr.
Brown	PERSON	makes clear in the course of his investigation .

		That all education , the highest no less than the lowest , must be a matter of public concern , is a cor - ollary from the very principle of democracy , and the gradual establishment of this view in our polity is the subject of an important chapter in the history of our institutional evo - lution .

		The colonial period in
America	LOCATION	witnessed the foundation of nine colleges , of which the list is as follows : Harvard -LRB-
1636	DATE	-RRB- ,
William	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	-LRB- 1693 -RRB- ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1701 -RRB- , Princeton -LRB- 1746 -RRB- ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-LRB- 1753 -RRB- ,
King	PERSON	's , afterwards Co - lumbia -LRB- 1754 -RRB- ,
Brown	PERSON	-LRB- 1764 -RRB- ,
Queens	LOCATION	, after - wards Rutgers -LRB- 1766 -RRB- , and
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1769 -RRB- .

		All were established primarily for the purpose of religious instruction ; but all showed early tendencies to escape from that limitation .

		Gen - erally speaking , these colleges , whatever the ecclesiastical organization for which they stood , were tolerant enough in their conditions of membership .

		Also generally speaking , they received from the
State	ORGANIZATION	some measure of sup - port , either directly or indirectly -- by money appropriations , land grants , exemption from taxation or permissive legislation in the matter of lotteries -- and in return for these favors , the
State	ORGANIZATION	claimed a certain degree of control over the colleges .

		As the period of the Rev - olution drew near , there came to be a growing consciousness on the part of the public that the colleges were somehow failing to respond to the needs of the commonwealth .

		They remained sectarian in management , and their close-corporation type of government prevented them from serving as representative agencies of a plastic society tending to shape itself upon lines more and more democratic .

		We conse - quently find that resolute attempts were made , beginning some time before the Revolution and extending many years beyond it , to enlarge the scope of governmental control , and to con - vert these essentially private corporations into quasi-public institutions .

		These attempts failed all along the line .

		They were particularly persistent , before the Revolution , in the cases of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	and
King	PERSON	's ; after the Revolution they were continued in these cases and several others , the movement receiving its couiJ de grace in
1819	DATE	, when the adjudication of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, in the leading case of
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	, forever settled the long-vexed question .

		This case is chiefly famous because of its wide bearings , and because it enforced in unmistakable terms the Constitutional provision prohibiting a State from making any law impairing the obligation of contracts .

		In its educational significance , which alone concerns us here , it meant that the charters of the colonial colleges were not sub - ject to revison , in the sense of enlarged State control , by legislative enactment .


Webster	PERSON	's masterly argument disposed of that question for good , and thus transformed the whole movement for making public institutions out of the existing colleges into a movement for the establishment of new institutions under the complete control of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The nearest colonial approach to a
State	ORGANIZATION	university as we understand the expression was probably offered by
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in its earliest days .

		`` Up to 1650 , '' says Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, `` it was as nearly like a state university as the colony was like a modern state . ''

		But it lost much of this character after an amendment to the charter enlarged the powers of the Corpo - ration .

		We have seen how the attempts to make state institutions out of the other col - leges were marked by failure , although
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania ,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	'' had each its brief term of service as a State institu - tion . ''

		Soon after the Revolution the movement for permanent State universities took definite shape , and the
Southern States	LOCATION	were the first to make such establishments .

		The legislature of
North Carolina	LOCATION	erected a
State	ORGANIZATION	university in
1789	DATE	, and the legislature of
South Carolina	LOCATION	in
1801	DATE	followed the example thus set by its neighbors .

		In the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, after re - peated attempts to transform the ancient foun -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 139 dation of
William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	bad been thwarted , the efforts of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	to establish a true
State	ORGANIZATION	institution came to fruition , and in
1819	DATE	, the year of the
Dartmouth College de	ORGANIZATION	- cision ,
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	entered upon its honorable and influential career .

		The chief opportunity , however , for the ex - ercise of this new governmental function first clearly recognized in the South was to be found in the new
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here was a field free for experiment , and unhampered by any insti - tutional inheritance .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	had already prepared the way by providing the Territory with a fundamental law in the form of that great Ordinance which has been the Magna Charta of the liberties of five great common - wealths .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	had also , in its character as universal landed proprietor , devoted to the educational purposes of the future a not incon - siderable fraction of the national domain .

		The history of
State	ORGANIZATION	universities in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	is not easy to present in simple outline , because of the gradual stages by which the several in - stitutions have come to their full growth .


Ohio University	ORGANIZATION	was chartered in
1804	DATE	, the year after the admission of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, but it re - ceived no public support except from the Con - gressional grants of land .

		Ohio is thus in a way descredited educationally , in spite of its forty colleges -LRB- mostly small and sectarian -RRB- , and in spite of the fact that in the
University of Cincinnati	ORGANIZATION	it offers a pioneer example of the public city university which is bound to be one of the general educational developments of the future .


Indiana	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	, which come next in the order of statehood , have done better .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	of the former commonwealth has a history beginning with the
Indiana	LOCATION	Seminary of
1820	DATE	, and the Uni - versity of the sister
State	ORGANIZATION	, growing out of the
Industrial University	ORGANIZATION	chartered in
1867	DATE	, has made up for its youth by its rapid recent de - velopment .

		It is to
Michigan	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, however , the last two States organized in the North - western Territory , that we must look for ex - amples of the
American State	ORGANIZATION	university in its most typical form .

		These strongly - manned and generously-supported institutions , making their influence felt in every county and town of their respective States , have for the first time shown what higher education at the public charge may mean , and have thus set examples and served as models , not only for their less progressive neighbor-commonwealths , but also for nearly all the newer States of the West and
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, the States made out of the
Louis	LOCATION	- iana Purchase , the territory wrested from
Mexico	LOCATION	, and the
Oregon	LOCATION	country .

		Both
Mich	ORGANIZATION	- igan and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	took the lead at the very start in the matter of public higher education , and have never had to contend against import - ant or richly-endowed private foundations .

		It was as early as
1817	DATE	, long before
Michigan	LOCATION	became a
State	ORGANIZATION	, that the territorial legislature called into being the '' Catholepistemiad or
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, '' although the institu - tion , under its more chastened modern desig - nation , was not opened for students until a quarter of a century later .

		The founding of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	dates from
1848	DATE	, having been coincident with the creation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		The influence of these two great institutions upon the educational development of the West has been very marked .

		They have set the pace , as it were , for the institutions of similar type that have been organized during the last fifty years in a score or more of the
Western and Southern States	ORGANIZATION	.

		They have also shown , for the first time , that the State univer - sity may be so liberally planned , and brought to so high a degree of efficiency , as fairly to rival the rich private foundations of an earlier day .

		The large endowments of the great private university corporations are doubtless imposing , but the potential endowment of a flourishing
State	ORGANIZATION	university , backed by the public opinion of a populous commonwealth , should be found even more so .

		Not only does the '' plant '' exhibited at such places as
Madison	PERSON	and
Ann Arbor	PERSON	compare favorably in impressiveness with what may be seen at
Ithaca	LOCATION	or
New Haven	LOCATION	, but their regular annual appropriations , if capitalized , would represent totals of the same order of magnitude as those represented by the invested funds of the private corporations concerned in this comparison .

		And the pos - sibilities of growth , in the case of the
State	ORGANIZATION	university , are not limited by the generosity of a few wealthy individuals , but are as bound - less as the wealth of the whole community .

		And even , as
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	has recently shown us , the
State	ORGANIZATION	institution may become the mark for private philanthropy as well as the object of public expenditure , thus uniting both sources of supply in a common beneficent aim .

		We have no idea that public competition in the matter of university education will ever 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, force the private institutions out of existence .

		The experience of the last thirty years , marked as it is by such foundations as
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
Clark	PERSON	,
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, makes it fairly evident that we shall have new private universities in increasing numbers .

		But the
State	ORGANIZATION	establishments must henceforth be counted as worthy competitors in this field • of generous rivalry .

		In the course of time we `` hall also have tax-supported colleges in our larger cities , for this must be the natural course of development of our city high schools .

		And all these institutions , public and private , will tend more and more to offer public service in the broadest sense , and to discourage all nar - row aims and antiquated methods .

		The only sufferers in this competition will be the insti - tutions that ought to suffer -- those that offer an indignity to the very spirit of education by setting some form of sectarian teaching in the foreground of their activities , those that do not encourage the most absolute freedom of teach - ing and investigation , those that remain so hide - bound in tradition as to be unable to adapt themselves to the ever-changing and ever-broad - ening demands of an advancing civilization .

		In this light , we may await without alarm the survival of the fittest among educational types , and view without a pang the disappearance of those that are based upon prejudice and con - secrated to outworn creeds .

		There is evidence upon every hand that we are now in a - fair way of approach toward the realization of the principle '' that no sort of higher education can possibly be a merely private concern , '' that all the types of univer - sity management '' are leading up to the one type of American university , which is that of an institution ministering liberally and con - stantly to the higher life of the people and of all the people . ''

		These words of our author are enforced by a series of striking quotations from Governor
Livingston	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, one of the most enlightened educational thinkers of the eighteenth century .

		It would not be easy to improve upon the following programme , which was framed by
Livingston	PERSON	exactly a cen - tury and a half ago : '' The true use of education is to qualify men for the different employments of life to which it may please God to call them .

		'T is to improve their hearts and understandings , to infuse a public spirit and love of their Country ; to inspire them with the principles of honor and probity ; with a fervent zeal for liberty , and a diffusive benevolence for mankind ; and in a word , to make them more extensively serviceable to the Com - monwealth . ''

		WALTER PATER IN PERSPECTIVE .

		In these days of abbreviations and brusqueness , when the diction and manners of shop-girls and political rings penetrate even college circles , when f eve people take time for the formalities and graces that dignify and beautify social intercourse , vre rejoice that a new biography , a reprint of his here - tofore uncollected essays , and another edition of ''
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean , '' turn our attention once more to
Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		He appears like a courte - ous gentleman of the old school .

		Coarseness and slanginess did not seem to him necessary concom - itants of virility .

		He is not a mere stylist : most , of the critical judgments in his works on `` The Renaissance '' and `` Plato and Platonism '' are sound , and the scholarship evinced in ''
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean '' is genuine and broad ; yet nothing of haste or shoddiness mars his thought or its expres - sion .

		That he lived `` unspotted from the world , '' his life , his love of truth and beauty , and his per - sonal charm , all indicate .

		We know
Pater	PERSON	, not from outward life and posi - tion , but from his inward experiences , embodied in pages where thoughtful heroes --
Marius	PERSON	,
Gaston	PERSON	,
Sabastian	PERSON	,
Emerald Uthwart	PERSON	, and the rest -- pace with stately mein .

		Still , it may be interesting to recall that , born in
London	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	, of Catholic parents , he was descended from
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	's pupil Pater , -- for , as one stands before the small pictures of Pater , the eighteenth-century French artist in the collection La
Caze	PERSON	in the
Louvre	LOCATION	to-day , he sees the origin of some of the English critic 's love of delicate colors and restful charm .

		When twenty - two years old .

		Pater was graduated from Queen 's College ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and placed by the examiners in the second class , where
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's name stood eighteen years before .

		After becoming Fel - low of Brasenose in
1865	DATE	, he never severed his con - nection with that college , being always a lecturer , and eventually dean .

		But even if the setting of his life plays little part in our knowledge of him , we are glad to hear from Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	and Mr.
Sharpe	PERSON	that he was a pale-faced , thick-set man , walking heavUy , almost as if lame , fond of young people as well as of golden light , -- though we almost knew beforehand that his rooms , furnished in blue , were characterized by `` delicate austerity , '' and feel as though we had already seen the
Wedgewood	ORGANIZATION	vase full of flowers standing against the soft yellow wall - paper , the two bronze ornaments of fine Italian work - manship , and the
Lucca	LOCATION	della
Robbia Madonna	PERSON	on his walls .

		Nor are we surprised that the creator of the sensitive
Marius	PERSON	did not enjoy walking under an overhanging rock , that snakes disturbed his calm , that the fragrance of white jonquil and syringa almost gave him pain , while meadow-sweet brought a sudden `` fugitive sense of distant pastures and twilight eves and remote scattered hamlets . ''

		Yet , well as we know this quiet
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	writer , we are ahnost at a loss with whom to compare him .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 141 In English letters , his eight volumes of criticism and imaginary portraits stand alone , suggesting neither predecessor nor contempoi'ary .

		Still , it may not .

		be too strained to discover resemblances between his spirit and that of the fifteenth century Florentine painter ,
Sandro Botticelli	PERSON	.

		Perhaps in comparing the two we must eliminate from
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	something of his quaintness .

		Yet , as
Bacon	PERSON	says , `` There is no excellent art that hath not some strangeness in the proportion , '' and our sense of meeting an old - fashioned gentleman , when we see Pater , may be a lesser degree of the feeling with which we survey the figured gowns and oddly imagined flowers in
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's pictures .

		Naturally , they share those primal attributes , the final test of an artist 's genu - ineness , -- reverence for truth , and supreme care for beauty as its only complete expression ; attributes so mixed that each was both philosopher , grasping firmly fundamental principles , and artist , infinitely interested in details of form .

		Botticelli writes a commentary on the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, yet rarely fails to wreathe the roses or coil the silken scarfs about his angels ' heads .

		And
Pater	PERSON	, interpreter of Plato , so demands beautiful words that his caricature is the heartless Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, cold devotee of art for art 's sake , walking through the pages of
Mallock	ORGANIZATION	's `` New Republic . ''

		So united in both men is the love of ideas and a sense of concrete images , that each is kin to
Pater	PERSON	's contemplative
Marius	PERSON	, to whom , with all his abstract speculation , the word '' home '' must always have presented a pale red-and-yellow marble house , '' with two centuries of sea-wind in the velvet of the mosses , along its inaccessible ledges , '' where the small glazed windows framed '' the pallid crags of
Carrara	PERSON	like wildly twisted snow-drifts above the purple heaths . ''

		Moreover , because of their devo - tion to truth and beauty , both take unusual pains in their task of pressing thought and feeling into form , -- as a result of which carefulness , the work exhibits singular freedom from exaggeration , a kind of disciplined restraint .

		That this seeming passivity expresses reserve power and not weakness ,
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's '' Calumny , '' -- so full of vehement im - petuosity that even the statues in their niches join the action , -- and the strong human tragedy of
Emerald Uthwart	ORGANIZATION	, testify .

		However , not simply the common property of artists , but more special individual traits , do Pater and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	hold in common .

		Like his hero
Marius	PERSON	, Pater 's '' first boyish sense of priesthood , the sense of dedication , '' survived , and so strength - ened that at the time of his death he contemplated taking orders ; and we read that
Botticelli	PERSON	, turning from his painting , became a follower of
Savonarola	LOCATION	, although the stern
Monk of San Marco	ORGANIZATION	doubtless thought the artist 's Venus only fit for burning on the
Pile of Vanities	ORGANIZATION	.

		The world of neither reveals the child 's certain God , at hand to ward off evil giants in the dark .

		But if theirs is the maturer insight that knows the difference between faith and knowledge , they respond no less fully to the divine suggestiveness of common things , -- the faint shadows of pigeons against a white wall , moving heads of golden grain beneath the wind , the curve of the green wave be - fore it breaks .

		For each , too , the world had lost something of its careless , primitive blitheness .

		As a rule , the Greeks emphasized the type , and rested happy in their sense of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's stability .

		Did not the Homeric sea forever wash the bases of moun - tains , the purple clusters and green olives return each year ?

		and were not the soft cream Doric columns prominent against the sky 's deep blue , friendly to the laws of Zeus , and to be depended upon as Mother Demeter herself ?

		Not permanent types , but changing individuals , compose the world of Pater and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	; men and women wounded , like
Amf	ORGANIZATION	ortas with the
Saviour	ORGANIZATION	's spear , from which they blindly shrink .

		The fleetingness of life , its wistful vistas and sad mysteries , are a large part of their conception ; and whether it be the '' cer - tain fresh way '' the leaves of Florian 's poplar have of '' dealing with the wind , making it sound in never so slight a stirring of the air like rvm - ning water , '' or
Marius	PERSON	's '' upright stone , still with mouldering garlands about it , '' marking the heaven - touched spot where the lightning had struck dead the ancient laborer , whether it be the limpness of the
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	's hold upon her baby , or the droop - ing head of the
Spring Goddess	ORGANIZATION	, their lovely images usually border the fountains of tears .

		Born of their conception of individuals , in ever - changing relations , a sensitiveness to the compro - mises that knit the universe together distinguishes both men .

		Botticelli , as Pater himself suggests , is interested neither in Paradise nor Inferno , but in the great middle-world between the two .

		All of his angels have a human look .

		On every page of Pater lie subtle distinctions , the blending shades always spanning the spaces between black and white .

		It is the modern relative spirit .

		No tinge of the coldness of the partisan toward all but the favorite truth lingers in him , none of the bitter - ness of the cynic , no trace of the metallic imper - viousness of the dogmatist to whatever contradicts his theory .

		Whether we read his delineation of
Gaston de Latour	PERSON	, perceptibly incorporating the form and color of the
Chartres	LOCATION	Cathedral ; or of
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	, the court painter , cherishing his lovely dreams amid sordid actualities ; whether he tells us that we come to
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's figures in the
Sacristy of San Lorenzo	LOCATION	, `` for solemnity , for dignity of impression perhaps , but not for consolation , '' or defines the qualities of style as mind and soul , `` reasonable structure '' and '' color and mystic per - fume , '' we feel his to be the '' intellectual finesse '' and `` tender and delicate justice in the criticism of human life '' of which he writes .

		Indeed ,
Pater	PERSON	and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	always possess to a large degree that of which they treat .

		That is , both men illustrate
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's saying , `` nothing be - falls us that is not of the nature of ourselves . ''

		The subjectivity of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's ideal of beauty makes his
Madonna	PERSON	and his Venus twin sisters .

		And in spite tm THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's singular catholicity of sympathy , furnish - ing him insight into lives dissimilar as
Winkelman	PERSON	's and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's and
Lucca	LOCATION	della
Rohbia	ORGANIZATION	's , he usually detects in his object certain qualities of feeling his own soul knows : in
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	, a dis - interested practice of literature , treatment of prose style as an art , and criticism as appreciation ; in
Rossetti	LOCATION	, a `` sustained impressibility toward the mys - terious conditions of man 's everyday life , '' giving `` a singular gravity to all his work '' ; in
Raphael	PERSON	, a power of painstaking and joining of the philoso - pher 's mind to the artist 's hand .

		In his `` Imaginary Portraits '' this subjectivity is even more conscious .

		Pater is our comrade , whatever the time or place , -- whether we enter with
Marius	PERSON	the presence of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, skate with
Sabastian Van Stork	ORGANIZATION	in an Ostade landscape , or , enclosed by bare white walls , dream with
Emerald Uthwart	PERSON	of the rose per - fumes of his mother 's garden .

		But
Pater	PERSON	and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	resemble one another not merely in their union of philosophic and ar - tistic susceptibilities , in their sense of the shadow of change upon men 's faces , in their belief in the relativity of truth , and in their subjective tempera - ment ; nor is it these characteristics chiefly that endear them to the hearts of their lovers .

		There is also that ever midefined quality which we call `` charm , '' for they both belong to that group of artists who , as
Pater	PERSON	says , '' have a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to us a peculiar quality of pleasure . ''

		In each we find a `` profound expressiveness , '' that '' seal '' upon his work '' of what is most inward and peculiar in his moods and manner of apprehension . ''

		This charm , this per - sonality , sounding gently through the mask of form , lives in the lines of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's angels ' feet , his fluted shells and spiral candles , the curved limbs of his Graces beneath their diaphanous draperies , the leafy decorations of his PaUas .

		And hardly less is it visible in the turns of Pater 's sinuous sentences , his favorite images , his delight in participles and words in `` ness , '' touching with strangeness and wistfulness , loveliness and expressiveness , his style , marking it ever with the '' intimate impress of an indwelling soul . ''

		Nevertheless , for all his charm ,
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's genuine audience never wUl be large .

		He has neither ex - horted men to act , nor chosen themes of universal interest .

		The very delicacy of his discernment and the exquisite nicety of his expression involve a want of incisiveness in his style , so that his thoughts slide smoothly over inattentive , weary , or unsympathetic readers , leaving little mark .

		In addition to this de - ficiency of emphasis , his style lacks that most pop - ular literary excellence , -- the chief nerve of epic , novel , and drama , -- motion .

		It is the smooth - surfaced lake reflecting perfectly calm trees , shining reeds , and cloud-crossed sky , not the on-rushing stream sweeping aU before it ; and so dull and rest - less is the human mind that placidity , however beautiful , soon wearies most men .

		Yet such is the law of compensation , that to some writers , of genius neither the greatest nor the most popular , is meeded by their comparatively few intimates a share of love inordinately large .

		So , although
Pater	PERSON	's are neither the unmeasured heights of the Shakespeares and Mil - tons , nor the foot-hills of the Macaulays and Longf el - lows peopled with crowds , perhaps a few , untempted by the loftiest peaks , and shunning the swarming lesser ridges , always maybe found on his unassuming summit , calmed by the charming vistas of his broad and quiet view .

		BRYANT 'S INDEX EXPURQATORIUS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The list of forbidden words and phrases prepared by
William CuUen Bryant	PERSON	for the guidance of his subor - dinates on the
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	has often been reprinted as law and gospel for those that would speak and write correctly .

		A few itenas have been dropped , having passed into good usage since
Bryant	PERSON	's time , I wish to draw my pen through a few more , hoping others will follow my example , until the cancellation becomes too broad and black to be erased .

		First , the prepositions '' over '' and '' above '' are for - bidden in the sense of '' more than . ''

		I may , it appears , call myself under ninety , but not over eighty ; I may count from one up to one hundred ; I may speak of the higher numbers and the lower numbers ; but I must not , 80 far as the interdicted prepositions are concerned , conceive of my numeration as ascending .

		I rebel .

		The usage is convenient and time-saving .

		In case of any possible ambiguity , I will cheerfully use the circum - locution `` more than '' ; but where no such misunder - standing is possible I choose the shorter form .

		The Germans have adopted an exactly analagous usage with - out fear and without reproach .

		Furthermore , see I. Cor .

		XV .

		6 . ''

		He was seen of above five hundred brethren . ''

		More briefly , I wish to defend the use of '' reliable . ''

		Its formation is illogical , it is true ; but so is that of some words similarly formed and now in good and regular standing , as laughable , indispensable , unaccount - able , available , objectionable , perishable , marriageable .

		The purist must yield here to the claims of convenience and custom .

		Again , why such an outcry against the word '' deceased '' ?

		Used both participially and sub - stantively , it fills a gap .

		Shakespeare did not scruple to write , '' this gentleman ... deceased as he was born . ''

		Another forbidden word is '' standpoint . ''

		But we now have good authority for its use .

		If our Teu - tonic cousins may regard a thing from their standpunct , why may not we from ours ? ''

		Endorse , '' in the sense of '' approve '' is also on the list .

		Is it because of its too vivid suggestions of commerce and bill-brokerage ?

		Yet all terms , however abstract , had once their concrete meaning .

		Moreover , we find the word in this derived sense as far back as Sir Thomas More . ''

		Day before yesterday '' is put under the ban .

		We are told to say `` the day before yesterday . ''

		This is finical .

		The article was made for man , not man for the article .

		Finally , Mr.
Editor	PERSON	, with all due respect for the de - ceased , I hope over ten thousand of your readers will endorse my opinion and adopt my standpoiat in regard - ing
Bryant	PERSON	's strictures as no longer wholly reliable .

Hampton School	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The race question , like poverty , we have always with us ; but never has so much and 80 intelligent thought been given to it as now .

		Dealing historically and practically with our negro problem , and more briefly with the In - dian question , Mrs.
Talbot	PERSON	's life of her father ,
General Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	, is instructive as well as interesting .

		From
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	himself , and later from his distinguished pupil at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, we have learned the only hopeful method of dealing with our inferior races ; and this book emphasizes and illustrates the doctrines held by these men .

		But , turning a little aside from such weighty matters , let us direct our atten - tion more especially to the inspiring person - ality of the founder of the
Hampton	LOCATION	school .

		The tardy appearance of his biography , eleven years after his death , is probably owing to his express request that no life of him should be written .

		Yet the author thinks now , in view of the good influence such a book can not fail to exert , that he would not raise unreasonable ob - jections to its publication .


Samuel Chapman Armstrong	PERSON	was fortunate in his parentage and in the scene of his birth .

		His father was of Scotch-Irish extraction , his mother a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	woman , and he was born on the island of
Maui	LOCATION	,
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	, where his father was settled as a missionary .

		The fine climate and noble scenery of that beautiful archipelago , together with the best of home influences , were favorable to healthy physical , mental , and moral development ; and when the young man made his way to
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	and the lecture room of
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	, he was well equipped for the position of leader - ship he so easily and naturally assumed .

		Gen - ius , as Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	has defined it , is the power to be a boy again at will .

		Armstrong never outgrew or wished to outgrow the boy that was in him , and it was the rollicking effervescence of youthful spirits that carried him triumph - antly over obstacles which others called insur - mountable .

		But before coming to these a few words of his descriptive of Hawaiian life must be given .

		He was one of eight children , the family resources were small , and he early learned the meaning of hard work .

		-- the
Royal School	ORGANIZATION	at
Punahou	LOCATION	-- Kalakaua and
Liliuokalani	PERSON	, afterward king and queen , were among his playmates .

		Here is his de - scription of the
Kawaiahao	LOCATION	church , where his father preached to 2600 people who swarmed to hear him from miles around .

		`` Outside it was like an encampment ; inside it was a sea of dusky faces .

		On one side was the
King	PERSON	's pew , with scarlet hangings ; the royal family always distinguishing themselves by coming in very late , with the loudest of squeaking shoes .

		The more the shoes squeaked the better was the wearer pleased , and often a man , after walking noisily in , would sit down and pass his shoes through the window for his wife to wear in , thus doubling the family glory .

		Non-musical shoes were hardly salable . ''

		So well did the youth profit by such school - ing as was available that he was able at twenty - one to enter the junior class -LRB- the class of
1862	DATE	-RRB- at
Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		For to this college , the birth - place of the foreign mission movement , his father naturally sent him .

		After a few months of dormitory experience in old
East College	LOCATION	, he was invited to share a room with the president 's son Archibald .

		This admission to Dr.
Hopkins	PERSON	's family circle was of advantage to the young man in more ways than one .

		En - joying the best of social influences , he kept clear of secret societies , relying on his own un - aided merits for making friends . ''

		When one joins a secret society , '' he writes in one of his letters home , '' all in it are his sworn friends , right or wrong ; this is childish . ''

		It was the influence and teaching of Dr.
Hopkins	PERSON	, the recognized leader in his department of instruc - tion , that young
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	valued most in his college course .

		Years afterward we find him teaching mental and moral philosophy to his dark-skinned pupils at
Hampton	LOCATION	, and using his old teacher 's '' Outline Study of Man '' for a textbook .

		As soon as he was out of college , in the
summer of 1862	DATE	, he joined the army as a vol - unteer , raising a company at Troy for
Colonel Willard	ORGANIZATION	's regiment , the 125th
New York	LOCATION	.

		Being , however , an alien by birth , he did not heartily espouse the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause until the Emancipation Proclamation brought home to him what he was really fighting for .

		But even as an abolitionist he was at first rather luke - warm .

		As he expressed it at the time , -- `` I am a sort of abolitionist , but I hav n't learned to love the Negro .

		I believe in universal freedom , I be - lieve the whole world can not buy a single soul .

		The Almighty has set , or rather limited , the price of one man , and until worlds can be paid for a single Negro I do n't believe in selling or buying them .

The Union	ORGANIZATION	is to me little or nothing .

		I see no great principle necessarily involved in it .

		I see only the 4,000,000 slaves , and for and with them I fight . ''

		It was not until he became lieutenant-colonel , and afterward colonel , of a colored regiment , that he thoroughly warmed to his work , though from the first he was conspicuous for his brav - ery , his command of his men , and his bold ini - tiative .


Gettysburg	LOCATION	was the only great battle • he had the good fortune to take part in , and • here he rendered brilliant service at a most • critical moment .

		But the war ended before he had found the opportunity he longed for to iprove beyond question the valor and effect - iveness of negro soldiers .

		With the title of brevet brigadier-general ,
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	retired to private life at the age of twenty-seven .

		But he was not long to remain in idleness .

		Seeking work in the newly-established Freed - men 's Bureau , he was appointed agent for ten counties in
Virginia	LOCATION	and school superintendent of a large and loosely defined area .

		The educa - tional needs of the negro soon engrossed his attention , and , with the support and encourage - ment of the
American Missionary Association	ORGANIZATION	in the
spring of 1868	DATE	, he started his school at
Hampton	LOCATION	, the first vigorous and successful attempt at industrial training in the country .

		This , too , was in the face of the discouraging results attained at
Oberlin	LOCATION	in combining agri - culture with book-learning .

		The story of the long fight for success at
Hampton	LOCATION	, the repeated begging excursions to the north and west , the concert tours of negro students to '' sing up '' some needed school building , the reception of a squad of Indian pupils in
1878	DATE	, and the mas - terly methods employed for making the red - skins learn industry from their African asso - ciates , -- all this must be got from the book itself .

		At intervals we catch a characteristic glimpse of the man
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	in his most pleasingly human aspect .

		He had early been led to look forward to the ministry as his destined calling , but something in him pro- tested against pulpit-pounding for a life-work .

		It was peculiarly distasteful to him to pray in public .

		A scrap here and there from his let - ters reveals his state of mind .

		In
1865	DATE	he writes : '' When a meeting-house burns up I care very little ; under the trees it is better -- under the
evening	TIME	sky as the sun goes down in glory -LRB- as we worship -RRB- is the grandest time and place for it .

		I am terribly down on two sermons every
Sunday	DATE	.

		The drawing-out process is the best and truest .

		Set the people to work and the ministers to chewing tobacco if necessary to make them like other men , not still and mannerish , but open , free , hearty and happy .

		A good hearty , healthy laugh is as bad for the devil as some of the long nasal prayers I have heard -- yes , worse .

		There is religion in music , in the opera ... Ministers say the opera is bad ; I find religion there .

		They say to walk or ride out on
Sunday	DATE	is wicked .

		My bethel is by the seashore ; there the natural language of my heart is prayer .

		So of the mountains . ''

		Strictly orthodox himself in the essentials of creed , and insisting that his school should be known as unswervingly orthodox , he yet was broad-minded enough to see that no church has a monopoly of truth .

		The
American Mis	ORGANIZATION	- sionary Association was troubled with scruples about receiving aid for the
Hampton	LOCATION	school from unorthodox sources .

		But
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	let no such considerations disturb him ; and , as a matter of fact , a large part of his revenue for many years came from philanthropic
Unitari	PERSON	- ans . ''

		When it comes to the scratch , '' he declares in his outspoken way , '' I believe in the prayers of the unorthodox -- why are they not as effectual as any ? ''

		In truth he was forced to neglect no possible means of raising money in his life-and-death struggle for pecun - iary support .

		This was of course a ruinously expensive method of carrying on his work ; it so sapped his vitality that he died when he should have been in the prime of life , at the age of fifty-four .

		Listen to his own account of the way he `` drove things , '' under highest pressure , as long as strength was left him : '' It is hard -- this begging ; it takes all one 's nervous and physical strength , even when people are kind and polite , as they generally are .

		It is never and never can be easy , and I have always to use all my strength , fire every gun in order to bring to the hurried , worried busi - ness men that powerful influence that alone can secure money in a place like
Boston	LOCATION	, where for every dollar that even the richest are able to give there are ten chances to put it to good use and twenty demands for it from one source or another .

		It is amazing how hard is the pressure of appeal and yet how polite and good - natured most people are , how patiently they listen and how many give up their last spare dollar not needed for personal comfort .


Boston	LOCATION	has been educated to giving and gives splendidly .

		But thousands are turned away -- few succeed , many fail who try for money , just as in the business world .

		In all this howling appeal and fearful competition of charities I have been making the best fight I could . ''

		It is worthy of note that he found hard times to have little effect on men when appeal was made for charity .

		In seasons of prosperity their hearts were hardened rather than moved to benevolence .

		The pinch of poverty seemed necessary to generate sympathy for others ' needs .

		Among the cheering notes of the book is the expressed conviction of this educator of

		THE DIAL 146 negroes that the granting of suffrage to the colored man has not been a mistake .

		Had we first waited for the negro 's education and eleva - tion , we should have waited indefinitely ; the Southern whites would have blocked his way to the schoolhouse .

		The consciousness of being entitled to vote is a stimulus to the voter to make himself worthy of his citizenship .

		Dwelling a moment on the man as seen by his friends , let us take a look at General Arm - strong through the eyes of one at whose hearth he felt most at home . ''

		He talked little of his work unless asked directly about it .

		He caught up any topic that was touched upon and tossed the ball of conversation most nimbly to and fro .

		A delightful gaiety is my most general recollection .

		There were serious moments when he rose to very great heights of simplicity and insight ... One felt the whole striving of the man toward a goal he revered .

		But geniality , wit , humanity , all these showed in his speech , and when he came in it was always as if a wind of strength and healing blew .

		I never saw him discouraged or downcast , even when things seemed very doubtful .

		I remember his telling me once about a college mate he had just seen who had grown sud - denly very rich , and spreading his hands , he said , * These are all there is between my little girls and the world , ' and then he threw back his head and gave a most boyish laugh .

		` And that 's the way I like it !

		* He was often brilliant , always delightful , even when we knew he was tired and suffering ... He told delight - ful stories to my children , and no one ever went away from him without strength and fresh hope . ''

		Bravely he lived and bravely died , sticking to his post of duty to the last .

		He was buried at his own request '' in the school graveyard , among the students , where one of them would have been put had he died next . ''

		His por - traits -- ten of them are in this book -- are especially interesting as showing how truly in his case the child was father of the man .

		Of him , if of anyone , it can aptly be said that his days were `` bound each to each by natural piety . ''

		his best when he recognizes and reveals nature 's artistry in her foreground pictures of grass and flower and tree , in her architectures of moun - tain , in her floating poems of cloud .

		Yet
Kuskin	PERSON	's very great and minute knowledge of what would ordinarily be classed as scientific facts did not impede or imperil his poetic sense .

		Rather it was fuel that fed his fire of creative criticism .

		One of the first of American geologists has now come forward with a theory and a proof that the scientific instinct and training are not opposed to poetic feeling and power -- that they are rather allied and
spring	DATE	from one root .

		In a modest and ingenuous preface to his immense dramatic romance , ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	states that he began the work as an experiment to see how far he had retained his early feeling for literature after many years of absorption in science .

		He regrets that science should make its votaries indifferent to the higher forms of literature , and denies the necessity for it .

		He goes further , and claims that the scien - tific and the poetic mind work with the same materials and largely with the same methods .

		And in testimony thereof he lays before us his five-volumed poem .

		This is well I This is very well !

		The loss which poetry has sustained in modern times has not been the loss of the world -- its hold upon that was always precarious ; it has been the loss of the great minds of thd age , so many of whom have withdrawn into science and have treated the claims of literature with bitter skep - ticism .

		If poetry can win them back it will win the world readily enough .

		Poets have always been willing to claim all knowledge for their share .

		Plato , the most poetical of philos - ophers , placed over his school the inscription that only through mathematics could anyone enter there .

		Dante knew the whole science of his age as did Goethe of his .

		The antagonism has been on the side of the men of science .

		Their supposed facts , their supposed laws , their supposed exact knowledge have made them deaf and blind to the music and the picture which body forth the real meanings of the world .

		Just at present , when many of their supposi - tions are beginning to crumble beneath them , literature , which builds more truthfully and permanently than science , may have a chance to come into its own .

		So much for the thesis of faith which Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has nailed to the door of his huge cathe - dral of verse .

		Important as this declaration is , it must not detain us , for we have the poem 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	^ itself to deal with , and that can hardly be done in a brief critical article .

		We may say at once that it seems to us one of the largest and noblest works in pure literature which has appeared in many a day .

		Throwing historic accuracy aside , Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has recreated and interpreted a great historic epoch .

		He treats history as the best of the romance writers ,
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	, have done .

		But as far as his main figure and motive are concerned he is more delicate in insight , more profound in conception than they , -- and his instrument of expression , his ringing , manly verse , yields him effects which stir the blood and rouse the emotions of the reader beyond anything that prose can do .

		The central idea of Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's whole work is
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's devotion to
England	LOCATION	.

		In the first play she betroths herself to her people , takes as a lover and a spouse the realm she is to rule .

		In the latter plays she is shown brooding like a mother over her subjects -- nobles , knights , and common men .

		Nothing is allowed to interfere with her task in shaping their destinies .

		Courtiers , counsellors , lovers come to her and she tests them all , and rewards or sends them to the Tower or the block , -- solely as they show their ability and willingness to aid her in making
England	LOCATION	great .

		Eliza - beth and
England	LOCATION	-- these are the two person - ages of this epic drama .

		The many figures who fill in the scenes and who are drawn in many differing planes of reality and unreality , are merely the go-betweens , abettors or oppo - nents of that mighty passion .

		It is obvious that Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	is one of those poets who work from within outwards , whose poems are moulded by the idea -- not allowed to spring up from the life of the world .

		He is a
Schiller	PERSON	rather than a
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		A slight comparison of his
Elizabeth	PERSON	with the Queen
Bess	PERSON	of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	will suffice to show this .

		Scott 's
Elizabeth	PERSON	is a daylight
Elizabeth	PERSON	, the stout-hearted but very worldly-minded daughter of
Bluff King Hal	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's Queen is an
Elizabeth	PERSON	of the dark and the depths .

		She is always keyed to tragic intensity of purpose , or hovering on the verge of hyster - ical breakdown .

		She is never vulgar and never scandalous .

		The crimes she commits are for the good of
England	LOCATION	, and she pays for them with an agony of remorse which the real Queen would have scoffed at .

		She is a morbid
Eliza	PERSON	- beth , an Elizabeth with nerves , who ought to go under treatment to a modern specialist .

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	represents her always at concert pitch of emotion , always as planning by herself or with
Cecil	PERSON	to save or shape
England	LOCATION	.

		May we be forgiven the comparison , but as scene after scene , play after play unfolds the same situation ,
England	LOCATION	in danger and
Elizabeth	PERSON	to the rescue , we are a little reminded of Mr.
Micawber	PERSON	and his wife rushing into each other 's arms and swearing eternal fidelity .

		The mas - ters are not thus monotonous .

		Achilles is not always shouting in the trench .

		He takes his ease in his tent with his friends and his female captives , and consumes huge shins of beef at banquet with the other chiefs .

		Hamlet is not always brooding on the infinite .

		He talks to the players , chaffs Polonius , and wooes
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	seems to have been conscious of the want of relief , which , in his first four plays makes for us such a gloomy picture of
Merry England	LOCATION	, and in the final drama of the series he tries to set this to rights by bringing before us a long succession of pastoral pictures of the realm that
Elizabeth	PERSON	has saved .

		The intention at least is admirable , but the tragic note re - turns and the scene closes with
Elizabeth the Woman	ORGANIZATION	going down in utter wreck , destroyed by
Elizabeth the Queen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Granting Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's right to use his ma - terials as he pleases , there can be no questioning the artistic effect of his picture of the epoch or the power in his presentation of its central figure .

		On the first reading , his book is com - pelling , almost overwhelming .

		He sweeps us along much as he wills .

		His own sympathy with nobleness is so great that again and again he brings us to tears by his presentation of utter loftiness of purpose or utter heroism of act .

		It is only when we begin to reflect and criticize that we feel the lack of flesh and blood in his creations .

		The form in which Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has cast his work raises the old question of the legiti - macy of the epic drama as a form of art .

		As
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	pointed out , the categories of art forms which the Greeks left us -- epic , , tragedy , comedy , lyric , and the like -- can not easily be bettered .

		To mix two of them is to produce a bastard form which will probably be weaker than either of the originals .

		Mr ''
Shaler	PERSON	's dramas are hardly plays , the whole work is hardly an epic , and the mixture results in weakness in the scenic arrangement and the characters themselves .

		Take the figure of Essex in the fourth play of the series .

		It is splendidly conceived , but it is not realized in either an epic or dramatic way .

		He is de - scribed infinitely , everybody talks about him ^
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 he talks about himself , but he is not set on his legs to do anything , at least until the very last .

		Or take the scenes where the Queen views from the ramparts of
Dover Castle	LOCATION	the de - struction of the Armada .

		It is a fine epic situation , finer than
Helen	PERSON	's view of the hosts from the walls of Troy .

		But Homer soon sends his heroine away and plunges into the real busi - ness of the poem , the hand-to-hand fighting .

		There is nothing but reflex action in Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's piece .

		The light of the burning Span - ish ships is reflected on
Elizabeth	PERSON	's face , and the heroism of her fleets and of Gait , in whom is , for the moment , embodied the might of En - gland , are merely described to her by messen - gers .

		However , the question whether all this is not right enough and good enough , whether the epic drama has not won its place as a new art genre ^ is still open .

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has plenty of modern precedents -- the works of
Charles Wells	PERSON	, Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and others .

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's first piece , `` The Coronation , '' comes nearer to being a true play than any of the others .

		It has a central motive , fantastic indeed , but beautiful , to which everything else is related , and it has a scenic arrangement which is in some measure theatrical .

		The early scene where
Elizabeth	PERSON	, bidden to
Mary	PERSON	's fes - tivity , appears before her robed in black and uttering
Cassandra	PERSON	cries of woe , shows the touch of the born dramatist .

		The scene with
Wyatt	PERSON	and his followers is powerfully drama - tic , as are the scenes in the Tower , though these last are too scattered .

		Elizabeth 's flight or pas - sage to
Woodstock	LOCATION	with
Beddingfield	PERSON	and his knights , while
Robin	PERSON	of the wildwood with his yeoman march unseen around her to ward off hostile strokes , is vividly portrayed .

		The shadowy creation of
Robin	PERSON	, who is simply En - gland 's love incarnate , is Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's triumph as an allegorizing poet .

		The second play , '' The Rival Queens , '' has also a motive highly poetic if not theatrically effective .

		The gloomy , silent tower in the
North where Mary of Scotland	LOCATION	is imprisoned stands out threateningly against
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's busy , bustling court .

		But the contrast is hardly carried out dramatically , there is no collision of the
Queens	LOCATION	as in
Schiller	PERSON	's great piece for the theatre , and the play falls apart at the close .

		There is one figure in this play ,
Petrie	PERSON	, the odd , loyal traitor , who is the most human and the best dramatically realized character in the whole work .

		He is new in kind and he does something .

		In '' Armada Days '' all pretense indeed of a drama is cast aside .

		It is a great sweeping ode of
England	LOCATION	's might .

		As far as we know , the passion , the exaltation , the greatness of those days has nowhere else found such utterance .

		England owes Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	a debt for summing up the splendor of that , its greatest day , as no historian or poet has done before .

		In '' The Death of Essex , '' Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has a really dramatic theme , but his curious fault of painting mainly by reflex action , of keeping his principals apart and letting intermediaries do the work they should be at themselves , destroys it as a play .

		It is a noble poem , however , and the conflicting emotions of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	as woman and Queen are depicted with consummate skill .

		The last play , '' The Passing of the Queen , '' is little more than a series of pictures of En - gland in its glory and of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	in her dis - contented old age .

		Like Shakespeare in the final scenes of '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' and '' The Tempest , '' Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has tried to present us with a vision of peace and beauty to calm our spirits after the storm and stress of the previous action .

		We wish we could say that he succeeds ; but his pastoral scenes are far less effective than his heroic ones .

		Never for a moment , with all his elaborated pictures of manor house and cottage , of wood and meadow and hill , does he recall the charm that resides in the moon-glimpsed gardens of Bel - mont or Prospero 's airy pageant in the en - chanted isle .

		There must be fifteen thousand lines of blank verse in Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's work , certainly a gigantic experiment .

		It is more than that , -- it is an achievement .

		The blank verse is really individual .

		It does not recall any modern mas - ter at all .

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	, in his preface , says he has been told that it is in the manner of the Elizabethans , but he does not know why .

		It is easy to tell him .

		It is so crowded with meta - phors , so compact of similes , that it can recall nothing else but the rank growths of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan dramatic verse .

		Open at random and the style stares us in the face . '

		`` And now they tramp Over this realm they hold with sheathed blades And make our fields to wonder how they lack Our bones within their earth . ''

		That is concentrated .

		In many of the quieter scenes the actors seem to be handing each other borquets of posies of speech , tied up with pink ribbons .

		Yet Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's verse is hardly the verse of the great artificers .

		It lacks their 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, sonority , their variety of cadence , most of all it lacks their sensuousness .

		It is not sensuous at all .

		We can not indeed think of a single page in the five volumes which has the carven form , the blazing or sober color , habitual with the great users of English blank verse .

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	's instrument is at its best in passages of emotion , good in a lower way in passages of thought , and not good at all in passages of desciiption .

		As he lacks , in the main , the faculty of scenic composition , so he lacks the gift of felicitous sensuous phrase .

		He strikes out fine lines again and again .

		`` How hard to rule , '' says
Elizabeth	PERSON	, ' ■ Men who are born with scepters in their hearts . ''

		But that is intellectualized .

		In his last play Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	brings Shakespeare into the busi - ness , and for scene after scene he walks be - side
Elizabeth	PERSON	and discourses with her on the large subjects of life and death .

		We can not say that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's moralities and philos - ophy , which the Queen accepts as oracles , strike us as being very profound ; and there are few passages which would seem fitting utter - ances of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's golden mouth .

		Here is perhaps the speech that comes nearest to it .

		Elizabeth has practically asked Shakespeare to record her life , and he answers : '' My Queen , were you our hearer , that we 'd do , And count all time and men our audience For perfect understanding of the part .

		But they who wait us can not see the play That lives in splendor by them , for they feel The soul that is beside them like their own , -- Fouled with the fellow earth they know too well ; So we must seek the shadow land to find Brave empured names of other time and realm To bear the garb we fashion from the web Our common lives here weave .

		Ay , the far orbs Are as the earth , mere clods j yet they are stars For they are far : but had we dwelt on them , Trod in their mire and bitten of their dust We should not see their glory . ''

		Mr.
Shaler	PERSON	has indeed made good the argu - ment of his preface .

		The scientist who can do such work as '' Elizabeth of
England	LOCATION	'' may confidently claim his place among the first poetic artists of his clime and time .

		Man as the Centre of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Under the general title of '' The Belles Lettres Se - ries , '' Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce an extensive series of reprints , covering nearly the whole field of English literature .

		The characteristic note of the series is `` ' literature for literature 's sake . ''

		The list of editors announced includes some of the most eminent scholars and litterateurs in this country and abroad .

		Several volumes will be published immediately .

		The books will be attractively bound , and sold at a very low price .

		Nearly a year ago there appeared in the '' Fortnightly Review '' an article on '' Man 's Place in the Universe , '' from the pen of Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, whose name is a house - hold word among men of science the world over .

		The views set forth in this essay were so diver - gent from those usually advocated by writers on the plurality of worlds , that much discussion was aroused .

		Some astronomers , in particular , attacked the soundness of Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	's ideas with considerable vigor .

		But he was in nowise disheartened , and determined to explain his theories in greater detail .

		Thus was born a substantial book bearing the title of the original article , and following the same general course of thought .

		Most writers on the plurality of habitable worlds have given free rein to the imagination , and have peopled the star depths with intelligent beings , many of whom may be vastly superior to mankind in mental power .

		They are not even content to leave the other bodies in our solar system tenantless .

		The remaining plan - ets , especially Mars , have been made to support sentient life , and the sun itself has been sup - posed to shelter inhabitants who were more or less content beneath its shining surface , being protected from the intense heat by a heavy layer of black cloud .

		With imaginings of this sort Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	has no sympathy .

		His field of inquiry is restricted to a consideration of the evidence for or against the probable exist - ence on other worlds of such organic life , especially human , as is found upon the earth .

		Such an inquiry at once leads into the field of astronomy .

		So rapid has been the march of this science during the past few years , especially with reference to our knowledge of the sidereal universe , that Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	considers it best to explain at length the processes employed by astronomers in this particular branch of re - search , and the substantial results won by their diligence .

		Therefore , after devoting a couple of chapters to a description of the main trend of thought pursued by former writers on the plurality of worlds , he discusses such topics as the distance and distribution of the stars , and their evolution , in the light of the '' New Astronomy . ''

		To this discussion one-third of the book is devoted .

		THE DIAL .

		149 is drawn from a wide range of the best astro - nomical authorities , and is substantially accu - rate and up-to-date .

		He frequently refers to the writings of Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	, who is regarded by many as the foremost living astronomer , and to those of Miss
Agnes Gierke	PERSON	, whose explanations of the results won by mod - ern astronomy are regarded by astronomers as complete , trustworthy , and altogether admir - able .

		Here and there Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	makes remarks which show his lack of acquaintance with prac - tical astronomy , but these little slips do not affect the general trend of his writing .

		For example , on p. 38 he gives numerical values of the mean errors of spectroscopic observations of the velocities of stars in the line of sight , not realizing that the accuracy of such work has vastly increased since the observations which he mentions were made .

		On p. 79 it is stated that the time taken by light to pass from the sun to the earth is eight minutes thirteen and one-third seconds .

		It is several seconds greater than this .

		On p. 106 we read that '' violent commotions in the sun , indicated by the sudden appearance of faculse , sun-spots , or prominences on the sun 's limb , are always accompanied by magnetic disturbances on the earth '' ; this is not in accord with astronomical records .

		On p. 113 the ignition of meteors is attributed to '' friction , '' instead of to the dim - inution of their energy by the pressure of the condensed air in front of them .

		On p. 128 one finds the astonishing statement that '' of course all the variable stars are to be found among the spectroscopic binaries , '' an item of information which will be news to those astronomers who are busied with researches on variables .

		But , as we have remarked , slips of this sort do not affect the author 's main argument , which begins in the seventh chapter of his book .

		The conclusion toward which he works , and which he endeavors to render probable by a series of arguments which are drawn from the universe about us , and also from the phy - sical , chemical , and biological conditions which now obtain on the earth , is `` that man , the cul - mination of conscious organic life , has been developed here only in the whole vast material universe we see around us . ''

		The foundation of the argument is as fol - lows .

		The stellar universe is not infinite in extent , but limited .

		The Milky Way , which contains the vast majority of the stars , is a huge ring surrounding us .

		Its component stars are made up of the chemical elements which we find on the earth and in our sun ^ and these elements , together with the bodies which they form , are subject to the physical laws with which we are familiar .

		Near the centre of the Milky Way the sun , with its planetary family , is situated .

		This foundation ^ or series of premises , is derived by Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	from the writings of prominent astronomers , and may be said to represent , in general , the opinions prevailing among those who have looked into the subject particularly .

		Upon this substructure the author , availing himself con - tinually of the best current ideas in astronomy , geology , physiology , etc. , erects his superstruc - ture .

		The train of reasoning is cumulative , and the method of presentation rouses the reader 's interest , and puts him in sympathy with the author 's contentions .

		The mysteries of organic life , its close adjustment to its ma - terial terrestrial environment , the changes in air , water , extent and elevation of land surface , atmospheric dust , etc. , which would seriously modify or destroy man 's existence , are set forth in fascinating fashion .

		The other planets of our system are examined and pronounced un - fit for habitation ; the existence of planetary systems about other stars is discussed , and its improbability asserted .

		The prevalent ideas of the evolution of man 's body require that climatic conditions on the earth 's surface shall have been substantially stable for ages past .

		Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	claims that the sun has probably been near the centre of our universe for ages , and that this central position for a long period of time has been '' specially favourable , perhaps absolutely essential , to life - development on the earth . ''

		But how shall we keep the sun near the centre of the universe , during millions of years , in the face of the fact that astronomers are well-nigh unanimous in asserting that it is moving approximately to - ward the star Vega ?

		To this the author replies that it is wholly improbable that the sun moves in a straight line , when all celestial movements known to us are in curves , and that it is `` far more probable that we are moving in an orbit of some kind around the centre of gravity of a vast cluster , as determined by the investiga - tions of Kapteyn ,
Newcomb	PERSON	, and other astron - omers ; and , consequently , that the nearly central position we now occupy may be a per - manent one . ''

		On this point it must be said that astronomers generally think that the evi - dence now at command does not indicate that there is a centre about which the sun revolves .

		150 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	, However , this evidence does not exclude such an hypothesis , and
Andi ^	PERSON	in his recent and highly praised work on stellar astronomy shows that such a theory of revolution conforms to certain facts about the observed proper motions of stars , and even deduces -- by making cer - tain assumptions -- a period of twenty-two mil - lion years for a single revolution .

		But , after all , what shall we say of a specu - lation which suggests the startling thought that man is perchance the designed outcome and crown of the workings of a universe which is so extensive and magnificent that the human mind is smitten with awe in contemplating its vastness , complexity , and splendor ?

		Is it pos - sible that the Creator has employed means so stupendous for the development of a creature seemingly so insignificant as man ?

		Let us remember that the apparent immensity of the circuit of the
Milky Way	ORGANIZATION	is due to the short - ness of the measuring rod which we apply to it , and that the shortness of the measuring rod is due to the fact that our physical forms are small and move slowly about the earth 's sur - face , chained thereto by gravity .

		If we were to believe that the soul of man , when once it has laid aside '' this muddy vesture of decay , '' can fly to Arcturus as quickly as it can now think itself there , how celestial distances which now appall us by their magnitude would shrink to hand-breadths !

		If we were to take the dis - tance from the sun to some star in the
Milky Way	LOCATION	as a unit of measure , how moderate would its vast circumference appear !

		Perhaps we should be willing to say with Milton '' that great Or bright infers not excellence ; the earth , Though in comparison of Heaven so small , Nor glistering , may of solid good contain More plenty than the sun that barren shines , Whose virtue in itself works no effect .

		But in the fruitful earth ; there first received His beams , unactive else , their vigor find . ''

		Let our conceptions of the potency , the pos - sible future magnificence , and the splendid powers of the human spirit become sufficiently exalted .

		Perchance we may reach some sum - mit of thought where we shall be ready to declare that the Almighty is not limited by our feeble and inadequate conceptions ; that He -- with whom a thousand years are as '' a watch in the night '' -- knows no bounds of time or space ; that He is not parsimonious amid infinite resources ; that He may have brought into being our wonderful universe , and have watched over and directed its devel - opment in order that it might become a school in which men , now in the feeble beginnings of a deathless life , might be trained for ends at present dimly perceived by them , but embraced in the all-sufficient phrase , '' for the glory of Crod .

Herbert A. Howe	PERSON	.

		Sculpture in
America	LOCATION	.

		* Sculpture is an austere muse -- austere save when some rare genius discovers that artifice by which marble , or stone , is made suggestive of the morbidezza of painting .

		Art has been described as '' the harmonic expression of human emotion '' ; of the plastic art one might have a prima facie right to say that it is the expression , through the emotions , of the character of the artist , it is the outcome of his idiosyncrasy , the expression of his manner of feeling in the presence of the visible world .

		Sculpture has its graces , but they are those of no other art ; it seldom gives rise to any rev - erie ; it awakens less than any other art the sentiment of the infinite , because it is never vague , obscure , indeterminate in its effects -- everything is fixed with the last degree of pre - cision .

		As a nation , we are a practical and a cynical people , and the sculptors that appeal to us -- appeal to the mind , to the soul , and bear thither a thought , a sentiment , capable of touching or elevating it -- are few .

		In the comprehensive introduction to his '' History of American Sculpture , '' Mr.
Lorado Taft	PERSON	, himself a sculptor of no mean achieve - ment , points out that if British painting was unimportant in
England	LOCATION	at the time when the American colonies were in process of making , it may be said that British sculpture did not exist at all , in consequence of which our ances - tors here in
America	LOCATION	were without sculptural tradition .

		`` The Pilgrim Fathers were the elder brothers of those men who decapitated the cathedral statuary , who burned paintings and tabooed the drama .

		This world to them was a vale of tears , and art was a temptation to be strenuously resisted ... The Quakers who fol - lowed in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	were hardly more favorable to the fine arts than their brothers in
New England	LOCATION	... The early Dutch settlers of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	came direct from the land where Rembrandt and
Franz Hals	PERSON	were even then producing their masterpieces ; but there was neither a Rembrandt or a Hals among them , nor by any possibility a sculptor , since the artistic expression of the Hollanders has always been pictorial rather than plastic .

		151 were made up of different material ; that the cavaliers who founded
Jamestown	LOCATION	were to some extent men of culture and luxury .

		To this fact may be attributed the earliest patronage of sculpture in
America	LOCATION	-- the com - missions given by
Virginia	LOCATION	to
Houdon	LOCATION	in
1781	DATE	and
1785	DATE	for representations of
Lafayette	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	; but beyond this we find no appreciable results , since native production in the South came even later than in the North .

		... So this broad land lay in the sun and waited -- waited without knowing it for the day of art to appear . ''

		Though any attempt at classification is admit - ted to be more or less arbitrary , the space of time covered in Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's book is divided in a general way into three periods : the first ,
1750	DATE	to
1850	DATE	, bringing to notice '' the faint foreshadowings of our coming achievements '' -- evidencing out of what unpromising material present conditions have been wrought and tell - ing , at the same time , with practical succinct - ness , a story of struggles and successes of the < leepe8t significance to American art ; the second period ,
1850	DATE	to
1876	DATE	, was characterized by a few sturdy men who made the succeeding period possible ; the third period ,
1876	DATE	to
1903	DATE	, sig - nalizes , in reality , the birth of sculpture in
America	LOCATION	-- a period in which the art for the first time reached the dignity of a national expression -- `` something neither Anglo-Saxon nor Italian nor French ; but a fusing of all these elements into an art which is vital and significant -- the true product of the country and the age which have given it birth . ''

		The opening chapters are concerned with the early history of the glyptic art in the
United States	LOCATION	, the first worker of whom there is record being Mrs.
Patience Wright	PERSON	, who attained a wide reputation for clever portraits in wax long before the Revolution .

		Then followed the wood - carving of
William Rush	PERSON	and the unrelated efforts of
Hezekiah Augur	PERSON	.

		With the opening years of the last century came the first Amer - cans destined to make sculpture a profession , --
Greenough	PERSON	in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Crawford	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	, Powers in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	. ''

		It is difficult to real - ize , '' says Mr.
Taft	PERSON	, '' that our actual achieve - ment from the very kindergarten stage of an unknown art to the proud position held by American sculpture in the
Paris	LOCATION	Exposition of
1900	DATE	has been the work of three score years and ten -- has been in its entirety by not a few men now living . ''

		No previous work has ever covered the ground referred to as the first period so concisely as the present volume .

		The chapters on minor sculp - tors of the early days include many names hitherto omitted .

		A chapter devoted , to the native element in early American sculpture deserves careful perusal ; in it special stress is laid upon the work of
Clark Mills	PERSON	, who first taught our forefathers the meaning of the words '' equestrian statue . ''

		As their own country afforded neither sculp - tural instruction nor examples , almost all Amer - ican sculptors of the first half of the century were animated by a single desire -- to get to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		American colonies existed at
Rome	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	, where the student adopted theCanova tradition of sweetened classicism and worked in an atmosphere tainted with artistic and political decadence .

		In his `` American Masters of Sculpture , '' Mr.
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	contends that it is not surprising that much of the sculp - ture of this period , though considerably admired in its day , strikes us now as coldly and pedantic - ally null , unconvincing , and grandiloquent , or , at best , innocuously sentimental .

		It was
Emer	PERSON	- son who said in the presence of these uninspired works , '' the art of sculpture has long ago per - ished to any real effect . ''

		The succeeding phase of
Italo	PERSON	- American art -- '' this universal pretti - ness , which seems to be the highest conception of the crowd of modern sculptor8 , `` as
Hawthorne	LOCATION	lamented , -- gained for this cotorie the name of executants , not composers .

		Then followed a reaction against self-expatriation .


Henry Kirke Brown	PERSON	, of whose work the equestrian statue of
General Scott	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	is a conspicuous example , studied in
Italy	LOCATION	, but with the conviction that American sculptors should occupy themselves with American subjects upon American soil .

		Goethe used to say that no man can discern the heart of a movement or of a work of art , who does not put himself into heart relations with that which he is trying to understand .

		Very few of that self-expatriated school of American sculptors escaped the level - ing influence of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The man who reads the Iliad and the Odyssey with his heart as well as his intelligence must measurably enter into the life which these poems describe and interpret ; he must identify himself for the time with the race whose soul and historic character are revealed in epic form as in a great mirror ; he must see life from the Greek point of view , and feel life as the Greek felt it .

		It is little wonder that the few Americans who accepted commissions for American sub - jects and chiselled these works in their foreign studios failed to achieve success .

		It was at the Centennial Exhibition that this country first beheld the wonders of foreign art .

		Parisian-trained sculptors rose into a prom - inence which , within a short time , became 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, domination .

		With only a few exceptions all our sculptors of the present generation have acquired their training , either wholly or in part , in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But our art is not now French as it was once Italian .

		With the advent of
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	there came a notable change in the spirit of American sculpture , --
Paris	LOCATION	merely vitalized the dormant tastes and ener - gies of
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	has this to say : ''
France	LOCATION	, ever since the middle ages , has never been without a succession of great sculptors .

		When the Gothic spirit had spent itself , that of the late Italian Renaissance was imported ; and the art , continually adjusting itself to the changing conditions of national life , has been held in uninterrupted honour to the present time .

		It is in this branch of the fine arts that the French genius has found its most individual expression .

		Corresponding with the maintenance of fine traditions is the excellence of the system of teaching .

		The Institute and the
Ecole	ORGANIZATION	des Beaux Arts perpetuate a standard , characterized by technical perfection and elegance of style , while the tendency to academic narrowness is offset by the influ - ence of independent sculptors ; for there is not a thought wave in modern art that does not emanate from or finally reach
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is the world 's clearing-house of artistic currency . ''

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's reasoning , along these same lines , on the subject of Franco-American training is interesting .

		He says : '' While the men of the new generation have acquired such mastery of the ' mechanics ' of thi profession as wins the praise of their foreign instructors , their lan - guage is not always understood at home .

		Our people have no intuitive grasp of its meaning .

		In spite of the oft-repeated assurance that we know what we like , we do not even know what we are saying when we say it .

		It is true that we recognize what we like , and that we like it well , for the time at least .

		On the other hand , we do not have a ` grand passion ' for sculpture , taking it to heart like the modern French .

		Our feelings are not outraged by bad work , nor by transgressions of venerated laws of style , of balance , of movement , and of other sacred traditions .

		Likewise are we insensible , in large measure , to the charm of these fundamental virtues .

		Unless a work of sculpture shows something more , unless it makes a special appeal by its significance , its emotion , or its insistent beauty of face or form , we are as indifferent to it as though it were not ; we do not , perhaps , even see it .

		We lose much , of course , but there is after all something rather fine in this sturdy independence .

		It may , indeed it must , result in an art of greater meaning and intensity than we have hereto - fore known .

		We say to the artist , as it were : * Put in all the '' composition , '' all the '' technic '' you please ; we have nothing against them ; but first of all give us some - thing we can understand and sympathize with . '

		Hence it follows that the mere ' Beaux - Arts figure , * so closely allied with the ohjet de
Paris	LOCATION	, has already had its day with a considerable portion of our community .

		It has followed the Graces and the Cupids of our Italian age . ''

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	's volume and the closing portion of Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's work are both descriptive of the
last quarter	DATE	of a century 's history of our sculpture .

		Space will not permit us to draw comparisons of the critical treatment of con - temporary artists by the two authors .

		Both concede that the position of
Augustus Saint	PERSON	-
Gaudens	PERSON	is one of preeminence -- that no other sculptor of our time has so attuned the tradi - tions of his art to the key of the modern spirit for the expression of grand con ceptions .

		A mongr other sculptors treated in special chapters by both writers are
Macmonnies	ORGANIZATION	,
Ward	PERSON	,
Bartlett	PERSON	, French ,
Adams	PERSON	,
Brenner	PERSON	,
Niehaus	PERSON	, and Bar - nard .

		In conclusion Mr.
Taft	PERSON	argues that in this bewildering period of American history , elements new , varied , and contradictory are pouring into the national crucible ; doubtless the solvent will be adequate to reduce all these to a condition of homogeneity , but no man can say just what the ultimate product will be .

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	has written with notable clear - ness of the great American figures in this art .

		The distinguishing feature of his book is that it is a critical review , constantly illuminating facts by principles .

		The earnest and animated style in which it is written grows out of the subject and is supported by it , always rising naturally to the requirements of the occasion .

		That Mr.
Taft	PERSON	clears away a great deal of dead wood from the obscure records of early American sculpture is a thing to be thankful for .

		Of the value of his book as a history for general reference , it would be hard to say too much .

		It is true that probably no one person will agree with all his statements , but , on the other hand , there are few who will not approve of the general tendency of his remarks .

		That he should now and then arouse contradiction is not surprising , for there are many points in the subject he has chosen in regard to which authority and reason may justly differ .

		Both volumes are attractively printed and bound , and both contain numerous illustrations - helpful to the text .

		Born at

		His shrewd - ness , activity , and tact made him a useful party man to the Whigs , especially the Radical wing of that party ; while his good-humor , his fund of anecdote , and his willingness to fit in any - where , made him a frequent guest at number - less dinner-tables in town and country .

Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	's custom to come over every year from
Arundel	LOCATION	to pay his respects to the Prince and to stay two days at
Brighton	LOCATION	, both of which he always dined at the
Pavilion	LOCATION	.

		In the
year 1804	DATE	, upon this annual visit , the Prince had drunk so much as to be made very seriously ill by it , so that in
1805	DATE	-LRB- the year that I was there -RRB- , when the Duke came , Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	, who was always the
Prince	ORGANIZATION	's best friend , was very much afraid of his being again made ill , and she persuaded the Prince to adopt different stratagems to avoid drinking with the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	.

		I dined there on both days , and letters were brought in each day after din - ner to the Prince , which he affected to consider of great importance , and so went out to answer them , while the Duke of Clarence went on drinking with the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	.

		But on the second day this joke was carried too far , and in the evening the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	showed he was affronted .

		The Prince took me aside and said -- * Stay after every one is gone to-night .

		The Jockey 's got sulky , and I must give him a broiled bone to get him in good humor again . '

		So of course I stayed , and about one o'clock the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	and the
Duke of Clarence	ORGANIZATION	, the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	and myself sat down to a supper of broiled bones , the result of which was that , having fallen asleep myself , I was awoke by the sound of the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	's snoring .

		I found the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	and the
Duke of Clarence	ORGANIZATION	in a very animated discussion as to the particular shape and make of the wig worn by
George II	PERSON	. ''

		Creevey 's intimacy with the Prince ended when the latter became Regent ; and from this time on , the letters have plenty of robust crit - icism of the Defender of the Faith , who is gen - erally referred to as `` Prinney . ''

		When the famous suit for divorce against Queen
Caroline	PERSON	was underway in the
autumn of 1820	DATE	,
Creevey	PERSON	was an eager listener to all the proceedings .

		He sent off to his step-daughter hourly notes of the trial 's progress , and joined lustily in the general rejoicings when the
Government	ORGANIZATION	's attack upon the Queen had broken down . ''

		Three times three I if you please , before you read a word further .

		The Bill is gone , thank God !

		to the devil .

		Their majority was brought down to nine -- 108 to 99 ; and then the dolorous Liverpool came forward 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, and struck .

		He moved that his own bill be read this day six months .

		You may well suppose the state we are all in .

		The Queen was in the house at the time , but
Brougham	PERSON	sent her off instantly ... The state of the town is beyond everything .

		I wish to God you could see Western .

		He is close by my side , but has not uttered yet -- such is his surprise . ''

		In the
autumn of 1814	DATE	, Mrs.
Creevey	PERSON	's health beginning to fail , her husband took her to
Brussels	LOCATION	.

		Considering the date , it turned out a singularly inappropriate place for an in - valid needing rest and tranquility ; for the Creeveys were still there when the return of Napoleon from Elba brought on the Hundred Days and
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		As Mr.
Creevey	PERSON	kept quite a full diary during those eventful times , and as he was honored with a good deal of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	of
Wellington	LOCATION	's confidence , we get some new and vivid glimpses of the great soldier .

		When the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	returned to
Brussels	LOCATION	after the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	,
Creevey	PERSON	visited him at his lodgings . ''

		As I approached , I saw people collected in the street about the house ; and when I got amongst them , the first thing I saw was the Duke upstairs alone at his window .

		Upon his recognizing me , he immediately beckoned to me with his finger to come up ... The first thing I did , of course , was to put out my hand and congratu - late him upon his victory .

		He made a variety of obser - vations in his short , natural , blunt way , but with the greatest gravity all the time , and-without the least ap - proach to anything like triumph or joy .

		`` It has been a damned serious business , ' he said . '

		Blficber and I have lost 30,000 men .

		It has been a damned nice thing -- the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life .

		Bliicher lost 14,000 on
Friday	DATE
night	TIME	, and got so dam - nably licked I could not find him on
Saturday	DATE
morning	TIME	; so I was obliged to fall back to keep up -LRB- regain ? -RRB-

		my communications with him . '

		Then , as he walked about , he greatly praised those Guards who kept the farm -LRB- meaning Hougomont -RRB- against the repeated attacks of the French ; and then he praised all our troops , uttering repeated expressions of astonishment at our men 's cour - age .

		He repeated so often its being so nice a thing -- so nearly run a thing , that I asked him if the French had fought better than he had ever seen them do before .

		-- ` No , ' he said , `` they have always fought the same since I first saw them at Vimeira . '

		... Now that seven years have elapsed since that battle , and tho ' the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	has become -- very foolishly , in my opinion -- a poli - tician , and has done many wrong and foolish things since that time , yet I think of his conversation and whole conduct on the
19th	DATE	-- the day after the battle -- exactly the same as I did then ; namely , that nothing could do a conqueror more honor than his gravity and seriousness at the loss of life he had sustained , his ad - mission of his great danger , and the justice he did the enemy . ''

		For so good a Kadical ,
Creevey	PERSON	could be a stout opponent of progress when it took the form of railways , the introduction of which was bitterly fought by his friends the landed proprietors .

		He submitted , however , like everybody else , to the inevitable ; and his de - scription of his `` first ride on the cars '' -LRB- which in his case was '' a ride on the first cars , '' -RRB- has a curious interest to-day . ''

		14th -LRB-
November , 1829	DATE	-RRB- .

		To-day we have had a lark of a very high order .

		Lady
Wilton	PERSON	sent over yester - day from
Knowsley	LOCATION	to say that the Loco Motive ma - chine was to be at such a place upon the railway at 12 o'clock for the
Knowsley	ORGANIZATION	party to ride in if they liked , and inviting this house to be of the party .

		So of course we were at our post in 3 carriages and some horsemen at the hour appointed .

		I had the satisfac - tion , for I ca n't call it pleasure , of taking a trip of five miles in it , which we did in just a quarter of an hour .

		As accuracy upon this subject was my great object , I held my watch in my hand at starting , and all the time ; and as it has a second hand , I knew I could not be de - ceived ; and it so turned out there was not the differ - ence of a second between the coachee or conductor and myself .

		But observe , during those five miles , the ma - chine was occasionally made to put itself out , or go itj and then we went at the rate of 23 miles an hour , and just with the same ease as to motion or absence of friction as the other reduced pace .

		But the quickest motion is to me frightful ; it is really flying , and it is impossible to divest yourself of the notion of instant death to all upon the least accident happening .

		It gave me a headache which has not left me yet .

		Sefton is convinced that some damnable thing must come of it ; but he and I seem more struck with such apprehension than others ... The smoke is very inconsiderable indeed , but sparks of fire are abroad in some quan - tity ; one burnt Miss de Ros 's cheek , another a hole in
Lady Maria	LOCATION	's silk pelisse , and a third a hole in some one else 's gown .

		Altogether , I am extremely glad in - deed to have seen this miracle , and to have travelled in it .

		Had I thought worse of it than I do , I should have had the curiosity to try it ; but , having done so , I am quite satisfied with my frst achievement being my last '' The free and easy atmosphere pervading these letters precludes any literary finish ; the tone is colloquial and at times low ; slang is not eschewed ; and every eminent person of the day is regularly nicknamed .

		George the Third is '' Old Nobs '' ; George the Fourth '' Prinney '' ; his consort is `` Mrs. P. '' ; and
William the Fourth	PERSON	is `` Our Billy . ''

		To call the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	`` The Jockey '' is only historical ; less obvious are such names as `` Slice '' for the Duke of
Gloucester	LOCATION	, '' The Pop '' for the Duchess of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and ''
Madagascar	LOCATION	'' for Lady Hol - land ; while
Creevey	PERSON	's distrust of the brilliant Lord
Brougham	PERSON	shows itself in a variety of epithets -- '' Beelzebub , '' '' The Archfiend , '' and '' Wickedshifts . ''

		We have only passing glimpses of some of the wits and men of letters whom
Creevey	PERSON	was continually meeting and dining with , such as
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Sydney Smith	PERSON	,
Luttrell	PERSON	, ''
Tommy '' Moore	PERSON	, and
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	-- whose deathly appearance is rather heavily satirized by speak - ing of him as `` the deceased poet . ''

		Creevey
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 166 must have heard a great many mots with which he might have brightened his pages .

		He loy - ally records a gallant saying of the sailor
King	PERSON	,
William the Fourth	ORGANIZATION	, about Lady
Wellesley	LOCATION	-LRB- who was a daughter of Mr.
Caton	PERSON	, of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia -RRB- . ''

		When she was in waiting at
Windsor	LOCATION	, some one , in talking of Mrs.
TroUope	PERSON	's book , said , < Do you come from that part of
America	LOCATION	where they '' guess '' and where they '' calculate '' ?

		* King
Billy	PERSON	said , * Lady
Wellesley	LOCATION	comes from where ihej fascinate . ' ''

		Creevey lived long enough to see the acces - sion of
Victoria	LOCATION	, whose fresh young purity and decision of character brought a great sigh of relief and hope from a long-burdened nation .

		The veteran politician did ready homage to her charm , but coolly and perhaps maliciously thus touches up her personality : '' Here comes in the Queen , the Duchess of Kent the least bit in the world behind her , all her ladies in a row still more behind ; Lord
Conyngham	PERSON	and
Cavendish	PERSON	on each flank of the Queen ... She was told by Lord
Conyngham	PERSON	that I bad not been presented , upon which a scene took place that to me was truly distressing .

		The poor little thing could not get her glove off .

		I never was so annoyed in my life ; yet what could I do ?

		but she blushed and laughed and pulled , till the thing was done , and I kissed her hand ... Then to dinner .

		... The Duchess of Kent was agreeable and chatty , and she said , ` Shall we drink some wine ? '

		My eyes , however , were all the while fixed upon
Vic	PERSON	.

		To miti - gate the harshness of any criticism I may pronounce upon her manners , let me express my conviction that she and her mother are one .

		I never saw a more pretty or natural devotion than she shows to her mother in everything , and I reckon this as by far the most ami - able , as well as valuable , disposition to start with in the fearful struggle she has in life before her .

		Now for her appearance -- but all in the strictest confidence .

		A more homely little being you never beheld , when she is at her ease , and she is evidently dying to be always more so .

		She laughs in real earnest , opening her mouth as wide as it can go , showing not very pretty gums ... She eats as heartily as she laughs , I think I may say she gobbles ... She blushes and laughs every instant in so natural a way as to disarm everybody .

		Her voice is perfect , and so is the expression of her face when she means to say or do a pretty thing .

		... At night I played two rubbers of whist , one against the Duchess of Kent , and one as her partner ... The Queen , in leav - ing the room at night , came across quite up to me , and said , • How long do you stay at
Brighton	LOCATION	, Mr.
Creevey	PERSON	? '

		Which I presume could mean nothing else than another rubber for her mother .

		So it 's all mighty well . ''

		We have spoken of these volumes as a book by Mr.
Creevey	PERSON	.

		So they are ; but we owe their appearance in this form to the industry and good taste of Sir
Herbert Maxwell	PERSON	, who has edited them from the mass of papers placed at his disposal by Mrs.
Blackett Ord	PERSON	, whose husband was the grandson of Mr.
Creevey	PERSON	's eldest step-daughter .

		Sir
Herbert	PERSON	has con - nected the extracts by explanatory paragraphs and has supplied plenty of personal footnotes telling us '' who 's who . ''

		His task must have been , even at
this late day	TIME	, a delicate one .

		Bat it has probably been done with discrimination , and what few comments the editor has allowed himself have made us wish for more .

		The portraits , of which there are twenty-one , are beautifully reproduced in photogravure from pictures by
Lawrence	LOCATION	,
Landseer	PERSON	, and others ; and the indispensable index is not wanting .

		* The decadence of travel on American rivers , the rise of the Pullman car , and the decline of the pas - senger steamboat have left the present generation in gross ignorance of some of the finest of nature 's panoramas , and have made unfamiliar to modern eyes the paths of early explorers and navigators , mission - aries and soldiers , traders and naturalists .

		Not the least important among these highways of pioneer days is the

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, subject , interesting as a tale of travel and adven - ture , and especially valuable on account of its very full historical setting .

		Though the
Canadian Pacific Railvray	ORGANIZATION	has drawn public attention to their accessibility in recent years , and tourists make short excursions among them from
Banff	LOCATION	and Glacier , the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	are but little known .

		The disappearance of trails over the passes following the decline of the fur trade has 80 hindered exploration that
Mounts Brown	PERSON	and
Hooker	PERSON	, guardians of the Athabascan pass , have stood unchallenged since they were named by the botanist
David Douglass	PERSON	in
1827	DATE	.

		They were re - duced from their high estate in
1900	DATE	by Messrs. CoUid and
Stutfield	PERSON	, and
Mounts Forbes	PERSON	,
Colum	PERSON	- bia , and
Alberta	LOCATION	were raised to reign in their stead as monarchs of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although members of the
Appalachian Club	ORGANIZATION	have done much of late to bring these Canadian peaks and glaciers to the atten - tion of lovers of mountain climbing , it is to the enterprise of two English sportsmen -LRB- not of the sanguinary sort -RRB- that we are indebted for the fullest account yet published of that region .

		Mr.
Hugh E. M. Stutfield	PERSON	, noted for his travels in
Morocco	LOCATION	, and Mr.
J. Norman Collie	PERSON	, the veteran climber of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, have made extended exploring trips among the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, climbed many of the hitherto unsealed peaks , discovered glaciers and snow fields exceeding in extent those of the Alps , and completed a number of surveys of uncharted territory .

		A well-illustrated account of their ex - ploits is presented in `` Climbing and Exploration in the Canadian Rockies , '' a work which gives not only the personal experiences of the authors , but in an historical rSsumS tells what is known from past explorations of surveyors , trappers , and guides .

		The recent writings of other enthusiasts are also quoted , so that the volume is an epitome of all that is known at present concerning this
Switzerland	LOCATION	of
America	LOCATION	.

		A carefully prepared map gives the results of the writers ' explorations and the elevations thus far de - termined , while a chapter on sport and game is in - tended for the hunter .

		Near the
Kootenay Plains	LOCATION	, an old Indian gathering-place , where the tributaries of the
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	draining the largest icefields of these mountains unite to form the main stream , is the place which seems to the authors an ideal one for a tourist centre . ''

		We may fairly anticipate that at the mouth of Bear Creek will be the
Chamonix	LOCATION	or
Grindelwald	LOCATION	of the Canadian Alps in days to come , when the remoter peaks and valleys of this beautiful region are more accessible to the outside world , and the new mountain playground of the American continent becomes no longer a dream but a reality . ''

		Mountain climbing in
Switzerland	LOCATION	presents a very different aspect to the novice than in the region described in the book just dealt with .

		In
Switzerland	LOCATION	experienced guides know the various routes and are aware of the dangers which beset them .

		A maximum of accomplishment with a mini - mum of effort is , barring hostile weather , assured to the tourist .

		The charms and terrors of the
Jungfrau	LOCATION	and the Wetterhorn are revealed in Mr.
Daniel P. Rhodes	PERSON	's '' A Pleasure Book of
Grindel	PERSON	- wald , '' a work in which holiday travellers to the
Oberland	ORGANIZATION	will find much of interest '' outside of the province of the regular guide-books . ''

		The read - able text and fine illustrations in Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's volume afford an excellent portrayal of the charms of this famous valley and its environs , and an in - sight into the life of the villagers of the Bernese Alps .

		A novel account is given of
Grindelwald	LOCATION	in
winter	DATE	and the sports at the rink .

		Those who have been , or intend to go , to
Switzerland	LOCATION	, or who plan or practise mountain climbing elsewhere , will find Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's book rewarding .

		The reader who enjoys a running tale of travel , full of incident and illumined by conversation and small talk on topics more or less pertinent to the place and scene , will find his account in Mr.
Charles W. Wood	PERSON	's '' Norwegian By-Ways . ''

		The author is a veteran traveller well known through his books in similar vein on
Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		The present volume is not a collection of classified or assorted information , or even a work dominated by any par - ticular aim or revealing any characteristic point of view .

		The passing incident , the chance acquain - tance , the skydsgut , the snowfield , -- mayhap the marmalade , serve as links in the chain of smoothly - flowing conversations which make up the greater part of the book .

		Withal it gives a pleasing pic - ture of the rugged land and sturdy folk of
Norway	LOCATION	.

		The story of a quiet
summer	DATE	spent in a quaint German castle at Staufenberg in
Hessia	LOCATION	is told , in a manner which brings to the reader much of the charm of village life in rural
Germany	LOCATION	, by Profes - sor
James Taf t Hatfield	PERSON	, in his book entitled '' From Broom to
Heather	PERSON	. ''

		With its abundant illustra - tions the volume affords an excellent picture of tourist experiences among Hessian villages and vil - lage folk and in the mediaeval town of
Rothenberg	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is an account of the water cure at
Salzscblirf	LOCATION	, and an interesting chapter on
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Regarding the latter city , the author says that '' a new spirit has come into its architecture , a spirit which ex - presses itself in a joyous display of power and super - abundant luxury , but which at the same time brings to its service a cultured and discriminating taste . ''

		He notes in
Berlin	LOCATION	, also , the new movement in decorative art , '' a long delayed manifesto against the heaviness and dulness of traditional styles and conventions . ''

		From the point of view of the Quartier Latin , the artist Mr.
F. Berkeley Smith	PERSON	writes most enter - tainingly of ''
Budapest	LOCATION	, the City of the Magyars , '' -- of Pest , the miracle of modernity , with its broad streets , fine buildings , up-to-date tramways and underground railway , superb opera-house , parks , museums , and magnificent Parliament buildings , and of
Buda	LOCATION	with its palace .

		That this splendid city is not better known by the average traveller is due , says the author , to the fact that tourists are systematically discouraged from stopping at Pest
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 by the Viennese , owing to the enmity existing be - tween the Austrians and the Hungarians .

		The au - thor is a clever raconteur , and he gives his readers a spicy account of his visit to a Magyar nobleman 's estate , of the theatres , music halls , baths , and clubs of the city , and of the gipsy camps and their fa - mous music .

		The work is lavishly supplied with illustrations , notable for their excellence and fitness , from scenes painted , drawn , or photographed by the author .

		In sharp contrast with the cleanliness and en - terprise of this
Magyar	ORGANIZATION	city on the verge of the Orient are the filth , antiquated facilities for travel and comfort , and the social and political instability of ''
Syria	LOCATION	and Palestine of To-day , '' as described by Mr.
W. E. Curtis	PERSON	, the veteran newspaper corre - spondent .

		The author makes very apparent the inadequacy of Turkish rule and the apathy of the people toward the Sultan , and he cites the evidence of the profound impression which the visit of the German Emperor made upon the country .

		The account of the changes wrought by the five German Lutheran colonies , which are made up largely from American sources , is of special interest .

		These col - onies are industrial communities which seek to regenerate the people of Palestine by offering an example of modern civilization and honest industry to Gentiles and Jews .

		Incidentally , their clean beds and fair charges are a godsend to travellers in a land where filth and extortion abound .

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's book , though made up of newspaper `` copy , '' is comprehensive , modern , and apparently unbiased -- except possibly as regards the Turk .

		In his volume entitled '' Toward the Rising Sun , '' Mr.
Sigmund Krausz	PERSON	takes his readers over a much greater extent of territory than do the two previous writers , his route lying from
Constanti	PERSON	- nople , the ports of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, through
Egypt	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Krausz	PERSON	follows the beaten path of tourists , recording his personal impressions of the sights along the way and freely expressing his opinions of the people with whom he comes in contact .

		His point of view appears to be that of a matter-of-fact commercial traveller , and his com - ments , while interesting and often entertaining , are devoid of any historical , sociological , or artistic perspective .

		The illustrations are abundant , but not always in good taste or of the best quality .

		A story of personal adventure among the Indians of the
Mosquito Coast	ORGANIZATION	and with the
Talamanca	LOCATION	tribe in
Costa Rica	LOCATION	, and an account of extended travel in the coastal country of the
United States of Columbia	LOCATION	, across the mountains to
Bogota	LOCATION	, and on the Isthmus between
Colon	ORGANIZATION	and
Panama	LOCATION	, is con - tained in Dr.
Francis C Nicholas	PERSON	's `` Around the
Caribbean	LOCATION	and across
Panama	LOCATION	. ''

		The author visited these countries in the interests of mining and com - mercial enterprises , and also in the service of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		His commissions led him far from the few main lines of travel into the wilderness of tropical forest and waterways , where torrential rains , floods , fever , tropical vermin , savage beasts , and treacherous natives insure variety and interest , if not comfort and safety , to the traveller .

		Dr.
Nicholas	PERSON	favors the
Panama	LOCATION	route for the Isthmian canal , and his book contains some interesting , though poorly - reproduced , photographs of the proposed route .

		The volume is interesting and timely , though not as illuminating on matters of present-day interest as many readers might wish .

		Mr.
Leonard Williams	PERSON	, author of '' The Land of the Dons , '' is an Englishman , whose long residence in
Spain	LOCATION	, together with a facile pen and ability at investigation , make him competent to wiite a book which covers with some degree of thoroughness not only the physical features of the country and the characteristics of the inhabitants , but also something of its literature , its political and social history , and the present national situation .

		One feels after read - ing the volume that much has been learnt about the country .

		Suggestive and interesting is the historical sketch to which the
last quarter	DATE	of the book is de - voted , under the novel captions , '' The Past of the Present , '' `` The Present of the Present , '' `` The Future of the Present . ''

		Here are given a statement and summing-up of past mistakes in Spanish policy , foreign and internal , and an analysis of the defects in the nation 's political and social life .

		The author outlines various reforms which a kindly feeling to - wards
Spain	LOCATION	and a belief in her future leads him to expect .

		The book is made delightful by the per - sonality of the writer .

		It is a charmingly humorous and upright mind that is here revealed , with a poetic temperament occasionally showing itself in some bit of perhaps too consciously fine writing .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is also the author of a new volume entitled `` Toledo and
Madrid	LOCATION	, their Records and Romances . ''

		With light and vivid touch the writer takes us through scenes connected with
Toledo	PERSON	's past and present .

		We visit Pedro the Armourer 's work-shop , and see the famous blade in process of construction .

		We roam about the city , visiting the streets of the various crafts , and the ancient market with its cheaper stalls set apart for the poor .

		We visit the Jew 's quarter , and watch a famous duel .

		It is all a dream that might easily come to one where every object so speaks of the past that the traveller and the present-day tenant seem anachron - isms .

		The intimate connection of
Toledo	LOCATION	with the ecclesiastical history of
Spain	LOCATION	, and the overshadow - ing of State by Church to the detriment of the country , is vividly set forth , and in the author 's summary of
Toledo	LOCATION	of to-day is furnished an epitome of
Spain	LOCATION	's decline .

		The chapters on
Madrid	LOCATION	are devoted largely to historical matters , chiefly to an account of the manners and customs of the long reign of
Philip IV.	PERSON	, who came to the throne in
1621	DATE	.

		The elaborate costumes of man and maid , the ex - travagant pastimes , and the vice and crime which everywhere flourished are described at length .

		The topography and economic and moral standing of ''
New Madrid	LOCATION	'' are dwelt on , but little is said con - cerning its art or architecture .

		The volume closes 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, with an historical sketch of the Escorial , and an account of a visit to the hirthplace of Cervantes , ' * the Shakespeare of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' where one naay visit the rains of the university he attended and see in the church his baptismal certificate .

		and IV .

		of `` English record oj Literature : An Illustrated Record '' English liierature .

		^ aye now been published in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the monumental work stands complete in its four volumes .

		What we said of it when the first volumes appeared need not now be repeated ; we are as glad to have these sections as we were to have the earlier ones , and the work as a whole is highly satisfactory in all respects save that of its inordinate weight , the consequence of printing it upon unnecessarily thick paper .

		Two volumes of this size might easily have sufficed for the whole , instead of four .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	, to our pleasant surprise , is the au - thor of about two-thirds of the second volume , carrying the record down to the death of Shake - speare , and leaving Dr.
Gosse	PERSON	to begin his share of the task with the Jacobean writers .

		We say this because , on the whole , the work of the senior author has a better balance , a surer judgment , and a greater degree of accuracy than that of his colleague .

		In his treatment of Shakespeare Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	, in our opinion , has too much dignified the Baconian lunacy by the amount of attention he pays to that most amazing of mare 's nests .

		What he says is , of course , wholly by way of refutation , but we doubt if it was advisable to allude to it at all .

		And on still other grounds we may indulge in a little fault-finding when we come upon such an unpunctuated sentence as the following : ''
Bacon	PERSON	might be deemed capable of composing the speeches of Ulysses but these wood notes wild ! ''

		But the treatment of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and his group is on the whole admirable : popular in the best sense , yet the product of an exacting scholar - ship , and beyond all praise in the wealth of its illus - trative matter .

		The illustrations are , of course , the essential raison d'Ure of the whole work , and it is not easy to say enough in commendation of this feature of the record .

		So rich a collection of por - traits , places , autographs , and illuminations has never before been made -- could hardly have been imagined -- in connection with the subject of En - glish literature , before the appearance of these four volumes .

		Volume IV. , if anything a trifle thicker and heavier than its predecessors , is entirely the work of Dr.
Gosse	PERSON	.

		The illustrations , as the author admits , '' descend through grades of picturesque decline to the period , not merely of the frock-coat and of the top-hat , but of that most insesthetic instrument , the photographer 's lens . ''

		However , they remain quite as numerous as before , and be - come perhaps more varied in their interest .

		The treatment comprises four << Ages , '' that of Words - worth , to

Irene Grosvenor Wheelock	PERSON	has shown herself possessed of prime qualities as a stu - dent of nature .

		She has enthusiasm , patience , an instinct for close observation , and a capacity for arduous labor .

		Added to these qualities she has an easy and picturesque habit of narration which allows the interest of her readers no opportunity for flagging .

		Often as she has to relate the indi - vidual story of a group of beings with marked dis - similarity in traits and manners , she escapes the peril of monotony by admirable tact in the man - agement of incident and in the choice of felicitous phraseology .

		It was a somewhat daring venture to follow in a special field of research so recently and ably covered by Mrs.
Florence M. Bailey	PERSON	, whose '' Manual of Birds of the
Western United States	LOCATION	'' is accepted as a standard in this department of American ornithology .

		Yet the present writer has not imitated or duplicated the achievement of her predecessor .

		She has produced a distinctly original work , which proves its raison d'etre by the amount of novel information it presents .

		In this , as in her previous popular book on `` Nestlings of Forest and
Marsh	PERSON	, '' Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	pays particular attention to the babies in the bird world .

		It is with refer - ence to them rather than to the adult that she di - rects her investigations , intent upon observing the entire course of their development under the care and tutelage of the parent .

		It is a wonder how she comes upon so many intimate domestic scenes in the life of the birds , how she finds so many skilfully hidden homes and guarded secrets in their careful keeping .

		Her book is ^ the reward of a faithful watcher , up with the dawn and out all day long , in the fields and the forests , on the water and the mountain tops , never stopping for any obstacle that a woman 's wit and will can overcome .

		There is little mention made of the difficulty and fatigue en - countered , but this may be read between the lines .

		It is pleasant to note that so much fruitful work was accomplished without the use of a gun .

		There was not a single instance , among the three hundred species described , of the murder of a bird or the ravage of a nest .

		Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	adds substantial testimony to the theory that the school is a regular institution among wild animals , and that their young
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 159 are trained by persistent discipline to walk in the way they should go .

		She was a frequent witness of the lessons in swimming , feeding , flying , and singing which the parent bird deems essential to the proper education of the fledgling .

		She like - wise furnishes considerable support to the lately - discovered fact that many young birds in the nest are fed by regurgitation for a length of time vary - ing with the species .

		She records a hundred and eighty cases in which the young hatched in a naked or semi-naked condition were fed in this manner for at least three days .

		Vultures were so fed for ten days , and a few , such as humming-birds and swallows , as long as they remained in the nest .

		Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	has secured in Mr.
Bruce Horsfall	PERSON	the help of a competent artist for the illustrations accompanying her narrative .

		These number ten full-page plates and seventy-eight text-drawings .

		The publishers have earned a full share of com - mendation by the rich and handsome dress in which they have clothed the book .

		A judiciously selected group of the ^ PZlZt masterpieces of English and Amer - ican legal literature , including fo - rensic arguments and judicial and professional - opinions presented during the nineteenth century and the closing half of the eighteenth , has been arranged and edited by Mr.
Van Vechten Veeder	PERSON	, and published under the title of '' Legal Master - pieces '' -LRB-
Keefe	PERSON	-
Davidson Company	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The purpose of the collection , as expressed by the editor , '' is to bring together , from the whole field of legal literature , specimens of the best models of the va - rious forms of discourse and composition in which the lawyer 's work is embodied . ''

		This purpose , of illustrating precisely how great jurists have argued great questions , has been well attained in these two volumes of upwards of
1300	DATE	pages .

		The forensic efforts selected are worthy of being gathered into such an anthology .

		Though it is not an exhaustive collection , and one misses some favorites and notes the absence from the group of such orators and advocates as
Seward	ORGANIZATION	and
Garfield	PERSON	and
Prentiss	PERSON	, yet - it would not be easy to exclude any whom the editor has admitted into bis circle .

		Selections are made from the leading efforts of seven of the foremost British jurists of the period indicated , among whom are
Erskine	PERSON	,
Curran	PERSON	, and
Brougham	LOCATION	.

		Erskine is represented in five great arguments , first of which , in more than one respect , is that in defense of Lord
George Gordon	PERSON	against the charge of treason .


Hamilton	PERSON	,
Marshall	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	, and
Curtis	PERSON	are prom - inent among the twelve American jurists whose forensic work is here accorded place .

		The selections are by no means averaged in number among the speakers represented .

		Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	and Lord
Bowen	PERSON	each contribute four judicial opinions , and
Webster	PERSON	,
O'Conor	PERSON	, and
Evarts	PERSON	each three legal arguments ; while
Erskine	PERSON	is drawn upon for five similar efforts , and
Curtis	PERSON	furnishes three arguments at the bar , one opinion as judge , and one charge to the jury -- five contributions in all .

		In the selec - tions made from this class of professional work , the subjects of Constitutional Law and International Law are naturally favorites .


Webster	PERSON	's persuasive addresses in the
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	case and the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	controversy of
Luther vs. Borden	ORGANIZATION	,
Hamilton	PERSON	's convincing opinion in favor of the char - ter of the Bank of the
United States	LOCATION	, and
David Dudley Field	PERSON	's earnest argument in the
McCardle	PERSON	case , present worthily the possibilities of
American Constitutional Jurisprudence	ORGANIZATION	.

		Evarts 's argument in behalf of the
United States	LOCATION	before the
Geneva Arbitration Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	recalls a notable episode in modern International Law .

		This great subject is the one with which Mr.
Veeder	PERSON	's collection appro - priately opens , in Lord
Mansfield	PERSON	's answer to the Prussian Memorial -LRB- anno
1753	DATE	-RRB- , and with which it closes in
James C. Carter	PERSON	's argument before the
Bering Sea Fur Seal Commission	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- anno 1893 -RRB- .

		Students will welcome the opportunity to secure and preserve , in this form , these masterpieces of legal literature , most of which have heretofore been ac - cessible only in the dry and dusty '' reports . ''

		The collection is rounded out and made symmetrical by brief biographical sketches of these masters of fo - rensic oratory , in which the reader is made easily acquainted with the personality of each of the au - thors , and with the leading facts of his career and his labors and achievements as a jurist .

		A

		The '' Life and Letters of
Margaret Preston	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will find many sympathetic readers .


Margaret Preston	PERSON	is known as the author of some stirring war-lyrics , and as a contributor to various magazines ; and her life was one of unusual interest .

		Of Northern parentage and association in early life , she married Colonel
John Preston	PERSON	, who was sub - sequently on
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's staff .

		As the wife of Colonel
Preston	PERSON	, the sister-in-law of General
Jackson	PERSON	, and the daughter of a stanch Abolitionist clergyman ,
Margaret Preston	PERSON	was tried between loyalty to her father and to her husband , to her native and her adopted
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		With courageous strength and gentle pride , she stood by her hus - band and his cause in the hour of their greatest trial .

		And herein lies the chief value of her pub - lished biography , -- that although in manners and customs she was thoroughly Southern , she saw the strenuous life of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women in war-time from a sympathetic Northern woman 's point of view .

		While one can speak , not unappreciatively , of her biographer 's '' magnified epitaph , '' one can read only with keen delight the almost wholly auto - biographic chapters entitled `` A Journal of War Times '' and '' Post-Bellum Days . ''

		In these chap - ters are a gentle woman 's thoughts of the suffering innocent ; of woman 's hand at man 's work ; and of the weariness and cruelty of war .

		These chapters 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, have other attractions : pictures of
Jackson	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	,
Maury	PERSON	; the prices of household stuffs ; accounts of the occupation of the home tovrn hy Federal troops ; the shifts to which the women were driven to make life hearahle , -- all making an interesting and instructive commentary on woman 's life in the
South	LOCATION	during the days of war and reconstruction .

		If the author and editor of the volume had given more of the Journal , and fewer letters , omitting even the correspondence with
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Burroughs	PERSON	, and Jean Ingelow , she would have added to the interest of the book .

		The correspondence between
Paul Hayne	PERSON	and Mrs.
Preston	PERSON	is of inter - est only so far as it adds to our information of the struggles of Southern literary men , -- a struggle only too well known in the cases of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Timrod	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lanier	PERSON	.

		The Life and Letters of Mrs.
Preston	PERSON	are prepared for publication by her step-daughter ,
Elizabeth Preston Allan	PERSON	.

		Another Southerner , Professor
James A. Harrison	PERSON	, has written a thirty - seven page appendix in praise of Mrs.
Preston	PERSON	as a woman and as a poet .

		As to her womanly quali - ties , there can be no dispute ; but of her poetry there can hardly as yet be a final decision .

		If any of her poems are to live , it seems likely that they will be those written in the white-heat of her `` Journal of War Times . ''

		The Catholic revival in
England	LOCATION	.

		A glance at the table of contents of Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	's '' Problems and Persons '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- promises more of general interest than the book itself fulfils , for the simple reason that most of the essays reprinted here are now several years behind the times .

		And yet this very fact , coupled with the knowledge that at the time of their writing -- in no case more than eight years ago -- Mr.
Ward	PERSON	was well abreast of the age , adds weight to the author 's main argument , that theology , the most nearly changeless of the sciences , has fallen into line with the other sciences in a gradual process of evolution .

		Of the eleven essays that compose the volume , the majority deal with this problem in its various phases , -- '' The
Time Spirit	ORGANIZATION	of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The Rigidity of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' `` Unchanging Dogma and Changeful Man , '' and `` The Foundations of Belief , '' these abstract discussions being supplemented by the more concrete illustrations of the life-work of
Cardinals Newman	ORGANIZATION	and
Wiseman	PERSON	.

		The book is essentially a history of the Catholic revival in En - gland , its causes and its leaders .

		But to-day we take for granted what seemed like a new revela - tion , even to progressive theologians , at the time when Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's essays were written , -- namely , that the Semper eadem of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	is not identical with nnplastic rigidity , but is thor - oughly compatible with the assimilation of contem - porary scientific principles . ''

		The evolutionary view , which broke up the old supposition as to the fixity of theology , brings its own compensation .

		A fixed theology , viewed as final , was the analogue to a view of the universe which failed in other depart - ments to grasp evolution as a fact .

		An avowedly living and developing theology , on the other hand , -- a theology viewed as consisting of ideas capable of organic growth , the symbolic expression of a living and lasting Divine truth , -- is the analogue to a sci - ence which contemplates and investigates the laws of evolution in all other departments . ''

		But we no longer recognize any other than the evolutionary theology ; and while the history is interesting , the argument is wasted .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	and Car - dinal
Wiseman	PERSON	have done their work so well that many of their most advanced and radical theories are accepted , and even enlarged , by those for whom the great men hoped only to prepare the way to - ward a future understanding .

		So rapidly all sci - ence , even the science of theology , has moved in the last generation .

		The essay devoted to the life - work of Cardinal
Wiseman	PERSON	and his personal char - acterization is easily the most interesting and the most vital in the book , -- the other essays concerning Persons , including the
Tennyson	PERSON	and Huxley re - miniscences , seeming somewhat out of place , and adding nothing definite to our knowledge of the men beyond some interesting personal anecdotes .

		mu , volumes in The latest issues of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	the ``
Hisiorie Butler Hulbert	PERSON	's series of '' Historic Highway * '' series .

		Highways '' -LRB-
Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	-RRB- are volumes seven and nine , -- the pub - lication of an omitted volume , relating to Military Roads , having been postponed for further in - vestigation .

		Volume seven relates to ''
Portage	LOCATION	Paths , '' which are strikingly characterized as `` The Keys of the Continent . ''

		It is divided into two parts .

		Part I. gives a description of portages ^ those between the headwaters of rivers and those around obstructions in rivers , and a history of portages , their use by Indians and the early ex plorers , their strategic importance in the struggle between the red and white man and their later em - ployment for roads and canals .

		Part II .

		gives a list of twenty-nine portages , with particular descrip - tions of some of them .

		The first , connecting the St.
John	PERSON	with the
Bay of Chaleur	LOCATION	, is not so de - scribed ; and the last , connecting Lake Superior with
Hudson 's Bay	ORGANIZATION	by way of the Lake of the
Woods	PERSON	, has apparently been `` pied '' by the printer .

		The intervening portages , except for those around
Niagara Falls	LOCATION	, consist of two classes , -- those between the St.
Lawrence	PERSON	or the Lakes and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	rivers , and those connecting the Lakes with the tributaries of the
Ohio	LOCATION	and the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		There is a good account of the
Oneida portage	LOCATION	, but many of the other descriptions are very meagre .

		-- Volume nine , entitled `` Waterways of Western Expansion , '' is entirely devoted to the
Ohio	LOCATION	and its tributaries .

		It treats of the expedition of C ^ loron de
Bienville	LOCATION	, the extinction of Indian title in
Ohio	LOCATION	, the diflficulties of river navigation , the evolution of river craft from the canoe and pirogue to the flat - boat , keel-boat , and steam-boat , the character of suc - cessive generations of rivermen , and the expenditures
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 of the federal government for the improvement of the navigation of the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The title `` Our First Glimpse of the
Ohio	LOCATION	, '' which the Cdloron chapter bears , conveys the erroneous impression that
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean knowledge of the river began with that expe - dition .

		The Indian treaties of
1785	DATE	and
1786	DATE	, recounted in the second chapter , were never carried into effect , but were superseded by the treaty of
Greenville	LOCATION	.

		The extracts from '' The Navigator '' suggest some account of that publication , and of other river-guides ; but none is given .

		We natur - ally look for narratives of pioneer voyages down the river , but do not find them .

		Both of the vol - umes exhibit the merits and the faults of the earlier ones .

		They are entertaining and suggestive , but are so far from complete that the reader can not resist the conclusion that the work has been pushed too rapidly .

		The publishers have decided to break a hundred sets of the series , so that , for a time at least , the volumes may be had separately .

		The second volume of Mr.
Charles HUtoryofthe Qman	PERSON	's '' History of the Peninsular Peninsular War .

		- rrr , > ^ r \ r • , tt • • - n \ • War -LRB-
Oxford University Fress	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is of even larger bulk than was the first .

		This is due mainly to the existence of much more original ma - terial for the campaigns of
1809	DATE	than was found for
1808	DATE	, and to the fact that the unity of treatment hitherto permissible is prohibited in
1809	DATE	by the multiplication of the centres of military activity .

		In the later year the campaigns in some degree ceased to be national , and became local and isolated .

		Each of these local campaigns have been treated with infinite pains in exact statement , and with the same genius for military detail evinced in the first volume .

		The cordial reception given that first vol - ume has evidently encouraged Mr.
Oman	PERSON	to criticise more directly and specifically the work of
Napier	PERSON	as a historian , and such criticism is less apologetic - ally stated .

		Thus , he shows us that
Napier	PERSON	's de - scription and plan of
Wellesley	LOCATION	's passage of the
Douro	LOCATION	, in the face of a French army , are wholly untrustworthy , and that
Napier	PERSON	'' had either never seen the ground , or had forgotten its aspect after the lapse of years . ''

		In the case also of the famous second siege of
Saragossa	LOCATION	,
Napier	PERSON	's denunciation of the incapacity of Palafox is largely disproved by Mr.
Oman	PERSON	.

		Palafox , he says , was no doubt ineffi - cient in certain details of military engineering , but nevertheless had made magnificent preparations for the provisioning of the beleaguered city , had created , largely by his personal enthusiasm , an intense fanat - ical patriotism in the breasts of soldiers and citizens , and was , at every critical stage of the siege , the very soul of the defense .

		In the end ,
Saragossa	LOCATION	was conquered by typhus , much more than by the as - saults of the French .

		Even in such dramatic in - cidents as this siege , it is evident that Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's principal genius lies in the depiction of purely mili - tary movements ; and it is for this that his present work must take high rank .

		Extreme technical detail , involving the movements not only of main divisions of an army but of mere fragments of a division as well , results in somewhat wearisome reading at times .

		But this is inevitable , if one be not deeply interested in military technique ; and in any event the omission of detail would have deprived the author alike of his own chief interest and of his distinct service to history .

		Journalism as a profession .

		Few men have been better qualified to write of the trials and tribulations of journalism as a profession than was Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	.

		A quarter of a century of active experience in the newspaper business in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, not to mention magazine work in the lines of travel and descriptive work -- << which is closer than a cousinship to newspaper work '' -- has given him an intimate knowledge of this field of endeavor .

		In '' The Making of a Journalist '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- he has shown us that news - paper life is '' not a little subject , '' and has pointed out how widely one can stray without losing touch of it .

		* '
Napoleon	PERSON	not only depended upon the press to prepare
France	LOCATION	for his plans and to execute many of them , but he directed and worked the newspapers in a way which was instinct with the spirit and genius of journalism .

		Bismarck 's death leaves him revealed to us as an editorial manipulator of news - papers in a way and to a degree which assures us that the spirit of the newspaper man , as well as a correct view of the power and processes of the press , were his . ''

		The author has devoted interesting chap - ters to newspaper interviewing , criminal reporting , war correspondence , gathering of election returns , the mysterious '' sixth sense '' in journalism , the reporter 's power in state and national politics , etc. , illustrating each with incidents and examples from his individual experience .

		The work has just that amount of personal interest which makes us feel that we are taken into the confidence of the writer , and does not assume that ex cathedra tone which one frequently encounters in the writings of a spe - cialist on any subject .

		Elements of architectural criticism .

		Architecture is the youngest of the arts in
America	LOCATION	, and a popular knowl - edge and appreciation of it are as yet undeveloped among us .

		Hence a book written in popular language , giving some of the principles of architectural criticism , is timely and should prove useful .

		Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	is not only the leading critic of architecture in this country , but he has , through his `` Dictionary of Architecture , '' made himself an acknowledged authority upon all archi - tectural subjects .

		His essays in elementary archi - tectural criticism , in '' How to Judge Architecture '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are entitled to a wide read - ing ; and the book , with its admirable illustrations , numbering more than eighty , is a valuable contri - bution to the rapidly growing number of hand - books of art education .

		It is just possible that Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	is too fine a critic , and too much of an expositor of his art , to treat the subject in a popu - 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, lar manner ; and though he seeks , by foot-note definitions of every technical term he uses , to make his meaning perfectly clear , he may yet fail to bring to the gentle art of criticism many followers from the ranks of the laity .

		Perhaps , however , this is only to be said after a comparison of his work with such a book as
Statham	PERSON	's `` Architecture for General Readers , '' which must hold its own as a popular educator wherever it is known .

		But Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	's book is entitled to high praise , and will tend to a more general understanding of the subject .

		The material for the composition has been collected , it is claimed , from the papers and order-book of General
Schuyler	PERSON	, from the Gates papers in the
New York Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and from the archives of the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The early part of
Schuyler	PERSON	's life has a just proportion , but his military services in the old French and the Revolutionary wars make up the bulk of the volume .

		His civic services in later life are reduced to a minimum .

		The Gates-Schuyler rivalry occupies many pages , the substitution of the former for the latter in the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	command being attributed to the unwillingness of the
New England	LOCATION	troops to serve under '' the Dutchman , '' with his strict discipline and military order , and to the persistent intrigue of Gates himself .

		Washing - ton is represented as listening to '' one-sided ac - counts '' in certain instances where
Schuyler	PERSON	was concerned .

		The writer confesses that
Schuyler	PERSON	lacked genius or extraordinary talent of any kind , but finds a praiseworthy motive of genuine love of country in his actions .

		q power of
RichcHeu	ORGANIZATION	is singularly devoid of general interest .

		But for the fact that the session of the States General in
1614	DATE	was the last meeting of that body before the Revo - lution , there is hardly anything that rises above the level of personal intrigues .

		Dr.
A. P. Lord	PERSON	, who presents in his '' Regency of Marie de M ^ dicis '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- a study of the years 1610-1616 , has evi - dently felt this narrowing of interest , and his book is mainly concerned with the schemes of the princes .

		He has also tried to throw light upon the exact cir - cumstances under which Sully was forced to retire .

		His chapters are based upon a careful study of the sources and of the work of the late Professor Ber - thold Zelbr .

		One may venture to ask why he has made no apparent use of the two remarkable vol - umes of Hanotaux upon the earlier years of
Riche	LOCATION	- lieu , for they contain an important interpretation of the period .

		The volume is enriched by several portraits taken from the collection in the
Louvre	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A group of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets , nine in number , together with one canzone , has been translated into - English with singular success by Miss
Agnes Tobin	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
Howard Wilford Bell	PERSON	in an exquisite and luxurious vellum-bound volume called `` Love 's Crucifix . ''

		Miss
Tobin	PERSON	's versions are good as reproductions and good also as English poems -- a twofold excellence which translators rarely achieve .

		A series of black and white drawings by Mr.
Graham Robertson	PERSON	adorn the volume , and are in keeping with the charm of the verse .

		The edition is limited , and only one hundred copies are offered for sale in this country .

		Two new volumes have just been added to '' The Musician 's Library '' by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' Forty Songs by
Johannes Brahms	PERSON	'' is edited by Mr.
Jamea Huneker	PERSON	, and provides a typical representation of the work of the composer in all the stages of its develop - ment .

		Mr.
August Spanuth	PERSON	is the editor of '' Twenty Piano Transcriptions by
Franz Liszt	PERSON	, '' which includes examples from eleven composers .

		Among the pieces are
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Campanella	PERSON	, ''
Schubert	PERSON	's `` Da Bist die
Ruh	PERSON	, ''
Verdi	PERSON	's '' Rigoletto , '' and three of the
Wagner	PERSON	arrangements .

		Each of these volumes has the usual portrait of the composer and a prefatory critical essay .

		It is so long since we have had a new volume in the `` Cranford Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that the appearance of
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	's '' Evelina '' in this charming setting is a pleasure the more to be appreciated because unex - pected .

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	as editor and Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	as illustrator have rarely had a more con - genial subject than is afforded them here , and it is needless to say that the Introduction of the one and the pen-and-ink drawings of the other are thoroughly delightful .

		Often as we may have read '' Evelina '' be - fore , it will be impossible to resist a fresh perusal in this latest and best of all editions .

		A '' Recueil de Locutions FranQaises , '' by
M. Armand	PERSON	-
Georges Billaudeau	PERSON	, is published in
Paris	LOCATION	by MM .

		Boyveau and Chevillet , and supplied to the American market by Mr.
G. E. Stechert	PERSON	.

		The work contains about fifty thousand French phrases , proverbial , famil - iar , or figurative , for which English equivalents are provided -- a matter of much ingenuity in many of the eases .

		We are bound to say that a good many of the English idioms here given have been invented for the occasion , but the book , taken with judgment , ought to be found exceedingly useful by translators from French into English .

		Professor
Charles Gide	PERSON	's '' Principles of Political Economy '' was first translated for the use of American students about twelve years ago .

		The work has to a singular degree the qualities of lucidity and interest in which the French are the masters of the rest of man - kind , and at once took its place as one of the very best of general treatises upon its subject .

		A revised Amer - ican edition of this book has just been published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, having been retranslated by Dr.
C. William A. Veditz	PERSON	from the latest form of the original , and adapted for our use -LRB- with the author 's sanction -RRB- by the substitution of American illustrative material for the French material employed by the author .

		It is a book of singular interest and value , and most successfully redeems the subject of economics from the charge of being a '' dismal '' science .

		Mr. the

		It begins very early in the book , and until almost the end there seems no way of establishing the identity of the illusive fig - ure which
Wayland	LOCATION	has always before him , but never quite within his grasp .

		It seems to me to exceed any of his former works in interest and practical value ; and I have been a constant reader of his writings from their first publication in this country .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's supreme loyalty to truth and his native frankness have made his account of his life very open and unreserved .

		Lest he might err in this direction he got the advice of confidential friends .

		After reading it and approving it entirely , Huxley remarked that it reminded him of the ' Confessions ' of
Rousseau	PERSON	, without any of the objectionable features of that work . ''

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	knew intimately some of the leading people of his time , '' and where the interest warranted it he has given his impressions of them .

		There are several pages of absorbing interest concerning
George Eliot	PERSON	, whom he knew for years before she became so eminent as an author , and for whom he had the highest appreciation .

		The estimate of her character and ability from one so capable of judging , and one who knew her so well , is a distinct gain to the world .

		His intimates of the club , and especially Huxley and
Tyndall	PERSON	, receive his friendly attention .

		The chapters upon Huxley and
Tyndall	PERSON	will be read with deep interest .

		His analysis of their qualities is a fine example of that kind of work . ''

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 217 THE THEATRE AND THE DRAMA .


Gotthold Lessing	PERSON	gave the best of his life 's energies , critical and creative , to upbuilding the German stage .

		Yet towards the close of his career , when anyone mentioned the thea - tre to him , he would say , '' You bore me , '' and would shut his eyes and go to sleep .

		Some of us , who , though without
Lessing	PERSON	's claim and authority , have thought and wrought for the American stage , feel like echoing his behavior .

		What are the causes of the unquestioned feebleness and futility of the American theatre .

		Abroad , in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, -- even in
England	LOCATION	, -- there is a dramatic and theatric renaissance .

		The Scandinavian countries have been for nearly a century , indeed since the great Danish outburst in
Oehlenschlager	LOCATION	, the homes of a flourishing and splendid drama .

		Only in
America	LOCATION	the to-day of the stage seems barren , the to-morrow blank .

		There are , of course , general causes at work to account for our weakness in the drama , as in every other high field of thought and work .

		The dramatic art is particularly and above all others the imaginative art .

		It shows the real world the door , and welcomes with outstretched arms the fancy-created universe of our hopes and fears . ''

		A poor gentleman , '' says
Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' who lacks a guinea may best make up for his want by a half crown seat at the theatre . ''

		An American would rather have the guinea in his breeches pocket than the gilded vision in his brain .

		We are in truth a prosaic people , the pupils or victims of our philosopher and law - giver
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	.

		To me
Franklin	PERSON	seems the modern embodiment of
Milton	LOCATION	's Mammon -- `` the least erected spirit that fell . ''

		Or perhaps his better prototype could be found in Sixteen String
Jack	PERSON	.

		Another cause of our failure in the drama is our want of a central seat of opinion , where those capable of the best effort could gather and win recognition and reward .

		Every great drama of the past , I think , has risen in a cap - ital -- a capital of wit if not of rule .

		But
America	LOCATION	is like a man who has seven or eight heads growing out of his body , each one of them wishing to go its own way and to do its own will .

		It is possible , I should say , that if some American town , which has resigned , or 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, does not care for , supremacy in commerce , manufactures , or wealth , would set up and sup - port a theatrical establishment , where the best only of new and old plays should be presented , it might lift its head above the other cities of our realm and make the American people walk its way .

		Concentration and direction are the first requisites of success in any field of effort .

		Direction !

		That indeed is the knot of the difficulty .

		Who is to direct the work that must be done to build up a great drama and stage in our country ?

		There is a story in Le Sage which is so apropos here that it is worth retelling .


Gil Bias	PERSON	and his friend Fabrieius have attended the very successful first night of a new play , and after the performance are in - vited by the actors to take supper with them .

		As they are sitting at the table there comes a gentle knock on the door .

		The leading actor gets up and opens it and admits a timid , cring - ing , shabby person who has a roll under his arm .

		The actor takes the roll , dismisses the intruder with a few frowning words , and sits down again . ''

		Who was that ? ''

		asks Fabrieius . ''

		Oh , '' says the actor , '' that was the poor devil whose play we performed to-night . ''

		Human nature never alters .

		As long as it is popular favor which gives the wreaths and rewards , it is the executant who will gather these in and assume the authority .

		As long as the movable booths of wandering players were the only platforms for the Spanish playwright ,
Cervantes	PERSON	, with his marvellous dramatic power , had to starve .

		But the moment the Court and Inquisition found they needed a theatre , it was possible for Lope and
Calderon	PERSON	to take the port of princes .

		As long as the cart of Thespis was the vehicle of the drama , we hear nothing of poets .

		But when the Athenians dedicated a great free theatre , and made it an institution of the state , JBschylus and his successors took their place of highest citizen - ship .

		As long as the Elizabethan dramatists depended solely on popular favor ,
Greene	PERSON	,
Peele	PERSON	,
Marlowe	PERSON	, and others were the poor and unregarded servants of the actors .

		But when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	succeeded , as undoubtedly he must have done , in gaining for his '' back '' a clique of powerful nobles , he could make himself respected and wealthy .

		Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	might have been compelled to write Robber Dramas or Domestic Comedies all their lives to gain a few thalers , had not the support of the
Weimar Court	ORGANIZATION	given them a theatre through which they could dominate
Germany	LOCATION	.


Wagner	PERSON	had to freeze in isolation .

		unacted and unsung , the mock of managers and singers , until
Ludwig	PERSON	of
Bavaria	LOCATION	gave him his opportunity to enchant the world .

		It is perfectly natural that when the acclaim of the crowd throws the sceptre into the actor 's hand , he should wield it as if it belonged to him of right ; and he should dominate the sit - uation .

		But that it is bad for him in the end to .

		be the master of the theatre is certain .

		He can not create , in any real sense ; he can but execute .

		Yet , being at the top of fortune , it is only human instinct in him which makes him refuse to be ordered and lessoned by a superior .

		Yet he depends on the dramatic poet for his opportunities .

		He can not shine in his bor - rowed brilliancy unless the dramatist gives him a role .

		It is as though the moon should de - cide that the headship of the sky belonged to it , and should succeed in putting the sun Into obscurity .

		To take one instance of the suprem - acy of the poet : -- How many theatres has
Wagner	PERSON	opened ?

		how many players and sing - ers has he made famous ?

		what a huge train of people has he given employment to ?

		If the American stage is to be reformed , it Is neces - sary that the actor should realize that he is mainly an Instrument ; that the breath which fills him , the life to which he is lifted , comes from another .

		I have said that the actor does not create .

		It might be interesting to try to draw out a little just what he does do , what his services to the author are .

		In the first place he pub - lishes the play : prints it on the general mind not by the use of little , wriggling , black marks on a piece of paper , but by means of the human voice , by the embodiment in stately or beauti - ful human figures , by the accompaniment of appropriate scenery .

		The most imaginative minds will , perhaps , always prefer the printed page as giving the most scope for perfected visions .

		But to the mass of mankind the theatrical ensemble is the more vivid realiza - tion .

		So far , however , no great credit is due to the actor .

		He is engaged to recite certain lines and give them the benefit of his action and elocution .

		In the degree to which his action and elocution interpret or improve his part he may claim partnership with the poet .

		The first stage is where he merely fills out his role with his own passion and emotion .

		This is the stage of training and temperament , and is so engaging and satisfying that few actors rise above it .

		When
Kean	PERSON	put an indescribable fire and fury into
Richard	PERSON	's exclamations '' What do they in the North '' ;
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 or when he leaped upon the stage in the quarrel scene of '' Othello '' and silenced the angry combatants by the mere majesty of his pres - ence ; or when Booth recited the last speeches of Macbeth with such haunting melody of elo - cution that each word seemed falling from Fate 's very lips ; -- in these cases there was practically nothing original added to the poet 's work .

		He might reasonably claim such inter - pretation , and the mere imagination of the pri - vate reader might give him as much or more .

		But there is a second stage of theatrical effort where the artist on the boards does add to and does improve upon his author .

		In a certain scene of '' Coriolanus , '' Volumnia has nothing to do but to walk across the stage .

		But she has just heard of her son 's victory over the Volscians , and Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	, in play - ing the part , came floating across the back - ground as if transported with exultant pride -- her head triumphant , her bosom swelling , and her step like goddess on the clouds .

		Again , in the last scene of '' Measure for Measure , '' when justice has been done and the judgments meted out ,
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	as Isabella gradually retires into the background and seeks to steal away .

		Her work is over , and she claims no reward .

		This is as good as a new speech by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again ,
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	, in the balcony scene of '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' suddenly seized the roses growing on the trellis below her and , pressing them first to her bosom , flung them down to Romeo .

		Again , when
Charlotte	LOCATION	Cushman in '' Macbeth '' came forth to meet
Duncan	PERSON	before the gates of her cas - tle her body had the sinuous grace of a serpent and her eyes were unutterable , fiilled seemingly with visions of hell .

		In all these cases the mind of the player cooperated with the dramatist .

		The player was an illustrator who had flashed a new picture forth which must henceforward be bound up with the book .

		He , or she , was a critic who had made a new study of his author , which must be accepted as admirable and true .

		Yet even in these cases of lofty effort put forth by the actor , his work remains a commentary , a gloss , a realization , of some - thing which can again be commented upon , glossed , or realized .

		The player , then , on the whole , must be ac - counted the dramatist 's shadow .

		We see this plainly enough in his relations with authors of the past , but in the matter of playwrights of to-day we are content to crown the shadow in the foreground and let it dominate the real being behind .

		I have said nothing as to the part of the Manager in working for or against dramatic literature .

		I think there is very little to say .

		The Manager under our American system is hardly more than the agent of the player .

		An actor or actress who is known or famous can practically dictate what plays he or she will appear in .

		The results of our American system of theatrical management are threefold .

		In the first place we have no dramatic literature ; whereas nearly every country in
Europe	LOCATION	has a mass of splendid art in this kind , -- art which will be remembered when our tariff - built fortunes have taken themselves wings , and when our strenuous politics are forgotten save in the memories of hate which they have aroused .

		In the second place the intelligence of
America	LOCATION	has largely abandoned the theatre .

		The intelligence of
America	LOCATION	knows the old plays by heart , and its actors refuse to produce any new ones which have a suspicion of intel - lect in them .

		In the third place , the decadence has affected the players themselves .

		Many good ones have had to sink to the vaudeville stage , and the greater ones -- who , in a meas - ure , have tried to uphold the traditions and dignity of their art -- do not get the proper support .

		But their own determination to put the cart before the horse , to place the servant in the master 's seat , has very largely contrib - uted to such results .

		What is the remedy ?

		There is only one an - swer , -- the
State	ORGANIZATION	organization of the theatre .

		Theory !

		Idealism !

		A democracy will never consent to such a project !

		Well , then , a de - mocracy will have to do without a dramatic lit - erature or a decent stage .

		Democracies have organized the theatre before -- in
Greece	LOCATION	, in
France	LOCATION	.

		Our own Democracy is just now en - gaged in organizing a Free Library service all over our country .

		The theatre is hardly less important .

		It is absolutely certain that good dramatic literature -- literature which tells and will live -- can not be made to pay on a basis of popular support .

		It is also certain , and very natural , that actors have more concern to make their own livings and fortunes and fames than to produce plays and impersonate characters which are for the public good .

		The direction of their efforts must be from above .

		They must be assured of adequate support , and dramatists must be encouraged to produce , if the nation is to have any real use of the mighty powers which lie latent in the theatre .

		President
Roosevblt	PERSON	as a Hero .

		* The two recent books devoted to the charac - ter and career of
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, presi - dent of the
United States	LOCATION	through the lamen - table taking off of
William McKinley	PERSON	and candidate for election to that exalted office , can not be said to be authentic history or even biography , nor do they disclose any facts of importance not previously known .

		All that Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	and Mr.
Francis E. Leupp	PERSON	have demonstrated in their readable volumes is Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's ability to make and hold his friends , -- among them the authors of these two books , both men of integrity who are also ac - complished writers .

		Both profess the utmost admiration for Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, both plead their friendship and even intimacy , and their vol - umes may be taken as in a real sense official and inspired .

		By curious chance the titles of the two could be exchanged to advantage in the interests of accuracy , since Mr.
Riis	PERSON	deals much more with Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as a man , and Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	rather with his career as a citizen .

		Mr.
Riis	PERSON	is a veritable
Boswell	PERSON	, but with a difference .

		The
Scot	PERSON	, however sycophantic , took pains to present a complete portrait , showing a man with many of the characteristics of great - ness , but still fully human and with human frailties and liabilities to err ; Mr.
Riis	PERSON	calls Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	'' my hero , '' he discloses perfec - tions only , and in his partisanship does not scruple to condemn those who see with eyes less blinded by devotion .

		No occupant of the Holy See sitting ex cathedra is more infallible than his hero ; and , unlike the successors of Saint
Peter	PERSON	, he brings him out impeccable as well .

		For all Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's Americanism , -- and in other respects it is hardly to be called in question , -- this adopted citizen seems to have ingrained in his character a feudal devotion to princes .

		The inference is not forced , as may lae seen in the following bit of interpretation of childish notions , describing an incident of a re - ception in a little
Kansas	LOCATION	town : `` The little fellow squirmed and squirmed in the grasp of the President 's hand , twisting this way and that , in desperate search of something , until Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	asked him whom he was looking for . ''

		get away , for fear he would lose his chance .

		And then the look of amazed incredulity that came into his face when the man who still bad him by the hand said that he was the President .

		He must have felt as I did when I first met
King Christian	ORGANIZATION	in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, and learned who the man in the blue overcoat was , with whom I had such a good time telling him all about my boyish am - bitions and my father and home , while we climbed the stairs to the picture exhibition in the palace of Cbar - lottenburg .

		The idea of a real king in an overcoat and a plain hat !

		I had my doubts about whether he took off his crown when he went to bed at night . ''

		In pleasing contrast to Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's thorough - going acceptance of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as the wisest and best of mankind is Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's prelimi - nary declaration , after noting the element in him which has been able to turn circumstances seemingly adverse to his own advantage , in the following paragraph : '' President
Roosevelt	PERSON	is not a genius .

		He is a man of no extraordinary natural capacity .

		As author , law - maker , administrator , huntsman , athlete , soldier , what you will , bis record contains nothing that might not have been accomplished by any man of sound physique and good intelligence .

		Such prestige as he enjoys above his fellows he has acquired partly by hard work and partly by using his mother wit in his choice of tasks and his method of tackling them .

		He has simply taken up and completed what others have dropped in discouragement , sought better ways of doing what others have done before , labored always in the open , and remembered that the world moves . ''

		It is still to be observed , notwithstanding this , that Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	allows little or nothing to appear in his pages that would not fully jus - tify his readers , if uninformed otherwise , in bestowing upon Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	the full wreath of genius .

		But his arguments toward that end are directed to the intelligence for the most part , and not , like Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's , to the pre - judices and sentiments .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	is still an American in his attitude .

		As might be expected , Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's prejudices lead him into statements easily challenged and some comparisons that must be odious .

		He tells for example of a German who saw some of the horrors of the Spanish attempts to '' pacify ''
Cuba	LOCATION	. ''

		He could not eat , he could not sleep until he had gone straight to
Washington	LOCATION	to tell there what he had witnessed .

		I can see the black look come into
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's face and hear him muttering under his breath , for he , too , had little children that he loved .

		And the old anger wells up in me at the thought of those who would have stayed our hand .

		Better a thousand times war with all its horrors than a hell like that .

		That was mur - der , and of women and innocent children .

		The war that avenges such infamy I hail as the messenger of wrath of an outraged God . ''

		Fine language that , and fully humane .

		But where is '' the black look in
Roosevelt	LOCATION	's face ''
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL .

		191 when he reads in the reports from the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines of similar and less excusable outrages committed upon innocent women and children in
Batangas	LOCATION	by troops under his own command ?

		And why has not Mr.
Riis	PERSON	hailed the attempt of the feeble Filipinos to prevent and avenge these infamies '' as the messenger of wrath of an outraged God '' ?

		But where Mr.
Riis	PERSON	seems most blind to the '' other side '' of the story is in his unqualified praise of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as a civil service re - former .

		He quotes him again and again on differing phases of the question , to prove that the man who disbelieves in this sensible and righteous measure has not a leg to stand on , and is an enemy of his country and his kind .

		He sums it up thus : '' The outcome of it all ?

		Figures convey no idea of it .

		To say that he fouud 14,000 governmental officers under the civil service rules , and left 40,000 , does not tell the story ; not even in its own poor way , for there are 125,000 now , and when the ransomed number 200 , - 000 it will still be
Roosevelt	PERSON	's work . ''

		For Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's attitude as
Civil Service Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	, as for that of his colleagues , there is little but praise .

		It should be said , however , that his predecessor in the presiden - tial office lessened the number of governmental employees materially , departing from the ad - mirable precedents established by Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	during both his terms of office and by
Harrison	PERSON	as well .

		But it was reserved for Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	to deal this reform a more desperate blow , by striking at its heart .

		Under section eight of civil service rule number eleven , which rule prohibits removals for political or religious opinions or affiliations , it is specified that no removal from the classified civil service of the nation shall be made except for just cause , upon written charges , and after full notice and opportunity to defend .

		On
May 27 , 1902	DATE	, President
Roosevelt	PERSON	issued an order , of which the essential portion follows : '' The term < just cause ' as used in section 8 , civil service rule 11 , is intended to mean any cause other than merely political or religious which will promote the efficiency of the service , and nothing contained in said rule shall be construed to require the examination of witnesses or any trial or hearing except in the dis - cretion of the officer making the removal . ''

		It need not be stated that such a construc - tion leaves the administration free to dismiss any civil servant with or without cause in the sole discretion of '' the officer making the re - moval , '' and throws down all the barriers so painfully erected against spoilsmen and partis - anship .

		What is worse , it leaves Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	the man open to the charge of standing on both sides of a vital question of reform , and turning now one way and now the other to his personal advantage .

		Nor is this the sole instance , did space avail or the occasion demand .

		After this one may read with a certain amusement Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's chapter on Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as the `` Knight-Errant of Civil Service Reform , '' and his enlightening observation that ```` Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's belief in the reformed civil service was never the blind faith of a faddist , but always tem - pered with practical sense . ''

		It is significant that both books are largely apologies -- in the newer sense .

		Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's somewhat fatuous statement that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	should be the unanimous choice of the people of the
United States	LOCATION	for any office he may wish to hold is made nugatory by his eagerness to anticipate adverse criticism in many particu - lars .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	defends the attitude of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as president again and again with a newspaper man 's keener sense of the attacks that have been made or are still in the making .

		While a large amount of material is held in common by the two , they are still complemen - tary to a degree .

		But it must not be thought that because they have neither of them at - tempted to tell the whole truth , they are any - where intentionally subversive of the truth .

		The real point is that they are writers accus - tomed to take one side of a question and push it with all the force of their own virile person - alities and all the skill of pens long trained to controversy .

		Both frankly admit their prepos - sessions , their f -RSB- ; iendship , their affection ; and it will readily be granted that the very fact that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	holds two such men in rela - tions so close is no small evidence of his own worth .

		Nor is it intended to suggest that the Amer - ican people are not adequately represented at this time by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his opportun - istic ideas , and that his volunteer biographers here are writing for the larger audience in meting out praise -- unmitigated in the case of Mr.
Riis	PERSON	, somewhat tempered by wider knowl - edge in the case of Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	.

		It is , per - haps , too much to expect that personal friends should remain silent , or that they should speak the whole truth as distinguished from the truth as they prefer to contemplate it .

		This latter is the work , as it will become the duty , of the historian of the future , and no small share of the material in these two interesting , even fascinating , volumes will be available for his purposes .

		But it is dangerous to set up an 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, American who has made mistakes and will con - tinue to make them , by reason of the humanity that is common to all of us , as a person who can think , speak , and do nothing inexpedient , unwise , or wrong , or to exalt his office into one too high and too remote for the sternest criti - cism when criticism is needed .

		And of these faults both Mr.
Riis	PERSON	and Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	are guilty .

		The Beginnings of Spanish Rule in
THE Philippine Islands	LOCATION	.

		* The publishers of '' The Philippine Islands , 1493-1898 '' have taken occasion by the fore - lock , and while the popular interest in our new Oriental possessions still holds out they have launched this ambitious collection of historical material .

		The great usefulness of the work can not be disputed .

		It will make easily ac - cessible to students and investigators the prin - cipal documents and contemporary accounts upon which our views of Philippine conditions and development must be founded .

		A collec - tion of this kind must avoid every appearance of trying to establish definitive conclusions , for valid inferences can be drawn only after all the material has been collected and carefully scanned .

		Nor can the mass of relevant ma - terial itself be presented in its entirety in a collection like this .

		The work must , therefore , be judged by the carefulness and justice of the methods of selection , the faithfulness of repro - duction and translation , and the sufficiency of the apparatus of critical and explanatory notes .

		It is evident that an approach to perfection in a work of this kind can be obtained only by a prodigious amount of labor extending over a long time .

		The complete mastery of the doc - umentary material by the editors would alone require decades of work .

		Critical comment and historical elucidations of the text call for minute and painstaking elaboration on the part of experts .

		A standard such as this can not , however , justly be exacted in the case of a work carried on by private enterprise and un - der press of the necessity of publishing while public interest is alert .

		If the work could have been undertaken with larger resources and with more leisure for preparation , it would be easy to frame higher requirements ; but , tak - *

		ing conditions as they are , every student and reader of history will be thankful to the edi - tors and publishers for having undertaken this almost heroic work .

		The ten volumes now published cover the
first quarter century	DATE	of actual Spanish occupation .

		Documents connected with the demarcation by the Pope of the Spanish and Portuguese claims , together with the accounts of earlier voyages of discovery , take up the bulk of the first two volumes .

		In the succeeding , there are laid before us the accounts of missionaries and explorers , the reports of governors , the remonstrances and memorials of ecclesiastics , and the ordinances and letters of instruction emanating from the home government .

		Among the most important and interesting of these documents are
Legaspi	ORGANIZATION	's relation of the con - quest ; the accounts of the geographical and ethnological features of the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	by
Artieda	LOCATION	,
Riquel	PERSON	,
Laorca	LOCATION	, De Sande , and De Plasencia ; the administrative report of De Vera and
Desmarinas	LOCATION	; the remonstrances of De
Rada	PERSON	and De
Salazar	PERSON	against the cruel - ties and abuses of the Spanish conquest ; the general petition of
1586	DATE	; and the royal in - structions to Governor
Tello	PERSON	.

		The picture pre - sented in these volumes contains in miniature almost all the features of later Philippine de - velopment , and it even affords us a glimpse of the impending conflict between
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western nations which has even now not ap - proached its final settlement .

		The soldiers of the conquest have little regard for the rights of the natives ; their cruelties impress them - selves upon the minds of the latter so forcibly that they hesitate to accept the joys of the Christian heaven , '' where there may be some Spanish soldiers . ''

		The leading missionaries and ecclesiastics , from the very first , take up the position of protectors of the natives ; De Rada protests against the methods of conquest and Bishop De
Salazar	PERSON	is bitter in his com - plaints about the tyranny of Spanish officials .

		The missionaries consider the Philippine col - ony as their province , and the mediaeval battle between ecclesiastical and secular jurisdiction is fought over again on a lesser scale but with no abatement of bitterness .

		The natives of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, whose customs and general civ - ilization are in these '' relations '' usually de - scribed from the point of view of the man who has come to redeem them from sinfulness , in large numbers accept the new faith and place themselves under the guidance of the mission - aries .

		The commercial relations of the islands
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 193 are at the earliest date made the subject of re - strictive regulations in order to obtain for the Spanish conquerors the easy profits of a monop - oly of trade .

		During the first decades of the Spanish occupation numerous Chinese come to live in
Manila	LOCATION	, the newly founded capital ; they form a community of their own , but many among them are inclined to an at least temporary ac - ceptance of Christianity .

		The encomienda system of
New Spain	LOCATION	is transferred to the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines , and the principal question in political discussions is the tribute paid by the natives and the tithes demanded of the encomenderos .

		As far as it is possible to form a judgment on the basis of the documents presented in these early volumes , it seems apparent that the conquest was not so cruel and was also far less difficult than that of Spanish-America .

		The documents also show that the missionaries fully realized the possibilities before them , that they were filled with a generous enthusiasm engen - dered by great opportunities and with a feeling of responsibility for the welfare of the natives .

		The royal instructions to Governor
Tello	PERSON	, of the year
1696	DATE	, form a most instructive docu - ment .

		They enjoined upon the governor the fostering of religious work , the construction of a dignified cathedral , and respect for ecclesias - tical jurisdiction ; the administrative recom - mendations deal chiefly with the collection of tribute and with the monopoly of trade .

		But no matter how favorable our judgment may be concerning the motives of the leading men in these earlier years and concerning the fruits of their efforts , it can hardly be as un - qualified as that pronounced by the editors in their introduction and the prefaces .

		It is to be regretted that they should have seen fit to accept the view of one of the parties in the in - terminable controversy in
Philippine	LOCATION	history , and to have anticipated a judgment that can be founded only upon a very careful examina - tion of all the documentary material .

		Indeed , it may be questioned whether this controversy can ever be settled satisfactorily at all .

		The witnesses whose testimony we have were mostly themselves in the thick of the struggle , and their accounts are full of unconscious prejudice .

		Impartial governmental material as well as ac - counts of unbiased observers are very scarce , and the recorded forms of laws and institutions are very often misleading , as they did not al - ways correspond to the real facts of the public administration .

		It will therefore undoubtedly be necessary to suspend judgment for some time to come .

		The more surprising must be the superlative and unqualified statements made in the historical introduction .

		The state - ments that
Legaspi	LOCATION	has no rival as a colonial pioneer ; that '' the work of the conversion and civilization of
the Philippines	LOCATION	must be pro- nounced as an achievement without a parallel in history '' ; that the existence of the Filipinos under Spanish rule was '' on as high a plane as has yet been obtained by any people of color anywhere in the world , or by any Orientals for any such length of time '' ; and , finally , that '' the position of women was fully as good among the Christian Indians as among the Christian peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	'' ; indicate that the writer of the introduction has been charmed by the highly favorable accounts of Morga and
Zuniga	PERSON	.

		Even the documents already pre - sented in this collection would necessitate the revision of such sweeping generalizations .

		In the earlier prefaces the editors have assumed the position that the Philippine clergy were the humanitarian protectors of the natives , who were ruthlessly exploited by the secular offi - cials and other Spaniards .

		The editors fur - ther cite without dissent the views of Crawfurd and of others , according to whom the natives at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards were practically '' naked savages . ''

		As to the real condition of the natives , the relations of
Loarca	LOCATION	,
Artieda	LOCATION	, and
Plasencia	LOCATION	, who looked upon them with by no means favorable eyes , show that a relatively high degree of civilization had been achieved by the Filipino tribes before the coming of the Spaniards .

		The natives had de - veloped mining and a diversified agricultural industry , they manufactured cotton cloth and silk , they were familiar with the processes of assaying , and their cast bronze excited the ad - miration of the conquerors ; they had regular trade relations with
China	LOCATION	and
Borneo	LOCATION	; and though living in great simplicity , their society was differentiated and their laws bear witness to a social development far above that of the savage .

		In the Tagal language the natives had an instrument of expression highly de - veloped in grammatical structure and rich in literary possibilities .

		The slavery existing among the natives was abolished by the Spaniards , who , however , sub - stituted a new system of serfdom in the form of the encomiendas .

		Though the principal missionaries fought bravely and conscientiously against the exploitation of the natives , the dis - regard of their rights was by no means always confined to the secular part of the population .

		In an interesting public document of
1592	DATE	, the 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, friars pronounced for the enslavement of cap - tives of war , and we find it repeatedly stated by high officials that ecclesiastics were practi - cally enslaving natives for their own benefit .

		Though slavery was formally abolished , the original social distinctions among the natives were maintained , and the serfs , or Calians , con - tinued for centuries to be heavily oppressed by the classes above them , especially by the Ban - ians , from among whom the local officials -- the gobernadorcillas and cabezas -- were se - lected .

		In addition to the taxes for the church and state , heavy dues were exacted from the lower classes by these quasi-feudal superiors .

		In any estimate of the friars ' achievements in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	full credit will of course be given the orders for the brave and generous enthusiasm with which their work was originally undertaken ; the rapid establish - ment of Spanish rule and of the forms of Christianity certainly testify to the ability and devotion of the early missionaries .

		But
Philip	PERSON	- pine history must be judged as a whole , and it would certainly be premature to conclude that in the protracted struggle between the clergy and the secular powers the former were always in the right .

		The natives were vouchsafed the care and training due to children , but the friars resisted any change that would have led their proteges onward to an independent man - hood .

		In this respect the history of
Paraguay	LOCATION	has much in common with that of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines .

		In the case of both there existed a be - nevolent guardianship of dependent popula - tions .

		When the protecting hand of the Jes - uits was withdrawn in
Paraguay	LOCATION	, the natives proved unable to maintain themselves under the changed conditions .

		In the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	the guardianship thus exercised came finally to be resented most bitterly by the wards themselves .

		No matter how idyllic may be the picture of a life protected from the storms of existence and preserving the simplicity of childhood , it is not an ideal that can perma - nently satisfy a race of any vigor or ability .

		The editors in their prefaces give a succinct synopsis of the documents contained in each volume .

		There might have been a little more articulation of the meaning of the material , more differentiation of what is deeply impor - tant from what is merely the interesting gos - sip of travellers .

		On the side of legislation and institutions the collection is so far some - what weak ; thus , while we would of course not look for a reprint of the Hecopilaciones , the legislation in protection of the natives might well be given in some detail .

		The critical and explanatory notes are so few as to be of slight value , and they give but little assistance in judging of the relative importance and of the historical position of the individual documents .

		But notwithstanding all such minor criticisms and reservations , the great utility of the work is unquestioned , and the devotion of the edi - tors and publishers to their monumental task will undoubtedly make the work increasingly satisfactory in all respects , and increasingly just to all the historical factors involved .

Hedin	PERSON	made a trip across
Asia	LOCATION	, which terminated disastrously for his whole expedi - tion , in the sand-wastes of
Eastern Turkestan	ORGANIZATION	, in
1896	DATE	.

		Its rivers , draining the mountains on every side , all flow into a basin , without out - let , in the eastern end of the country , touching the desert of Gobi .

		Except at the foot of the mountains and on the banks of the streams , the country is a barren sand-waste , the most dreadful portion of it being the Takla-Makan south of the
Tarim	LOCATION	, in which Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	lost his entire caravan in
1896	DATE	.

		He set out with a caravan from
Kashgar	LOCATION	in
September , 1899	DATE	, and sent it east on the car - avan route to Lop-nor , while he , with a body of servants , embarked on a river-craft or house - boat at Lailik and floated down the Tarim river for two and a half months , or until winter froze up the stream .

		During all this time ,
Hedin	PERSON	carefully measured and mapped this great river in all its sinuosities , through a winding dis - tance of over 1500 miles .

		Having established a camp , he made two campaigns in different directions to ascertain the geographical features of the Lop-nor country , or the basin of
Eastern Turkestan	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
spring of 1900	DATE	he com - pleted his measurements of the Tarim to its terminus in the great central basin .

		In the
autumn of 1900	DATE	he crossed the Altyn Tagh with a caravan and penetrated southward into northern
Tibet	LOCATION	, a distance in a straight line of 600 miles .

		The region averages an altitude of about 15,000 feet , is very mountainous , is wholly uninhabited except by wild animals , and abounds in surprising geographical peculiar - ities .

		This journey occupied four months .

		From
December , 1900	DATE	, to
March , 1901	DATE	, he made a tour of the eastern reach of the
Altyn Tagh	PERSON	, crossed the desert of Gobi to the north , and swung around once more into the Lop-nor basin .

		By a strange chance , one of his serv - ants had found the ruins of a house in the for - mer crossing of the desert .

		This time
Hedin	PERSON	and his whole company set to work and discov - ered innumerable remains of houses , temples , mounds , carvings , coins , an image of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and several hundred Chinese manuscripts .

		By making a careful survey of the region , he decided that these remains marked the site of an ancient city , whose prosperity , with the fertility of its surroundings , were dependent on their proximity to an ancient basin , -- the terminus of all of the rivers of
Eastern Turkestan	ORGANIZATION	.

		With time and the shifting of the sands , the present basin is now fifty miles toward the southwest .

		The manuscripts and coins found in the ruins belong to a period between the second and fifth centuries A. D .

		In
June , 1901	DATE	, Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	started south over the mountains into
Tibet	LOCATION	with a caravan of thirty-nine camels , forty-five horses and mules , and eighteen men , and provisions for ten months , with the ultimate purpose of reaching the
Holy City of Lassa	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first 600 miles led over snow-covered mountains rising as high as 18,250 feet above the sea , across miry val - leys , through narrow and steep passes , and over swift rivers , with not a denizen aside from wild asses , yaks , bears , wolves , and marmots .

		Hav - ing pitched his camp , he started with a lama , whom he had picked up in the Lop country , and who had lived a year in
Lassa	LOCATION	, and a Buriat Cossack .

		Attired as Mongol lamas , these three set out to make a dash to
Lassa	LOCATION	.

		But their fame had preceded them from the Lop country , and spies found them when within eighty miles of
Lassa	LOCATION	.

		The
Kamba Bombo	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- governor -RRB- of Nakkchu met them with his cavalry and peremptorily ordered them back ; and back they had to go to their main encampment .

		Thus defeated in one of the cherished pur - poses of his great campaign .

		Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	with his caravan investigated the lakes of Selling - tso , Chargut-tso , and Addan-tso , and thence struck out across
Tibet	LOCATION	toward Ladak in
North	LOCATION	- ern
India	LOCATION	.

		The Tibetans , according to their custom , were careful to see that they were fur - nished with transport animals and food , and also that they should not turn their course toward Lassa .

		In four months this caravan crossed the remaining steppes of
Tibet	LOCATION	, attain - ing at times an altitude of 18,000 feet .

		On
Christmas day , 1901	DATE	, the nine remaining cam - els of that great caravan entered the city of Leh in
British India	LOCATION	.

		The volumes recounting these exploits are entitled '' Central
Asia	LOCATION	and Tibet . ''

		They com - prise a diary of daily events for a period of two and a half years .

		At times there is monotony in the narrative .

		But the daring adventures of the explorer , the newness of the scenes , the keenness of his observations , and the mathe - matical accuracy of his methods , by the use of the latest instruments , gratify the most exact - ing of readers .

		The volumes are embellished with 420 illustrations made from photographs and drawings by the author .

		Five maps indi - cate by red lines the various routes of the author throughout his long campaigns .

		These maps contain many new fixed points , as com - pared with those of
East Turkestan	LOCATION	and
Tibet	LOCATION	in common use .

		Such daring geographical service as this will soon solve the mysteries of
Central Asia	LOCATION	and
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Criticisms of Dartvin .

		* Everyone is familiar with the fact , that when in bisexual animals the male and the female cells unite to form a new individual , that individual is either male or female , not intermediate between the two .

		Very rarely the characters of the sexes are united in such a manner that one part of the animal is like the male , the other like the female ; thus in butter - flies having the wings of a diflferent color in the two sexes , specimens have been found in which one side had the male color -LRB- say blue -RRB- , the other the female -LRB- say brown -RRB- .

		Such creatures are called gynandromorphs -LRB- a Greek descrip - tive term -RRB- and are considered very wonderful .

		Even these do not show real blending ; the sev - eral parts have male or female characters , though combined in one individual .

		Why should it be thus ?

		Obviously , were it not so , the separation of the sexes could never have occurred .

		This , however , is a reason , not an explanation .

		The fact appears to be , that the opposing characters represented by the sexes are incompatible ; like two birds hatched in a nest which is only large enough for one , -- one has to get out .

		It is even believed by many , with good reason , that the circumstances which determine sex in a given individual may be more or less controlled .

		Sexual dimorphism is so common that we take it for granted , but we do not always realize that many other kinds of dimorphism and polymorphism occur among animals and plants .

		Thus cats are prevalently of three or four well-known colors , intermedi - ates being comparatively rare .

		Ants have males , females , and workers , and the latter are frequently of more than one type .

		Without going into further detail , it may be said that there are many characters besides the sexual ones , which when contributed by heredity sep - arate out , and are not commonly inherited in mixed form by the individual .

		Frequently certain characters are inherited together ; thus men have beards , and certain kinds of complexion indicate probable suscep - tibility to particular diseases .

		On the other hand , we may have '' mosaic inheritance , '' -- that is , mixed like a mosaic pattern , the single characters being pure , but variously combined in different individuals .

		This sort of inheri - tance results in what are sometimes called * Evolution and Adaptation .

		kaleidoscopic variations , '' and when the char - acters concerned are numerous , the possible results are very many , like the patterns of a kaleidoscope , all made by the same bits of glass .

		While characters thus exclude one another , every offspring of two parents must get some - thing from each , otherwise the functions of sex are stultified .

		When the whole of the charac - ters of the parents are so incongruous that they can not compromise , there is no offspring ; and this , I believe , is the simple explanation of the sterility of crosses .


Strasburger	PERSON	has shown that in plants quite impossible hybrids may reach a certain stage of growth , coming to dis - aster long before a seed is formed .

		Similarly , there is a limit to the development of any par - ticular character in a species .

		When it reaches a certain point , it is like a man who will no longer obey the laws of his country , -- he or the country has to yield , and it is easy to see which .

		In recent years , a great deal of attention has been directed to these different forms of inheri - tance and great stress has been laid upon the fact that certain characters , or sets of charac - ters , may appear all at once , by a sudden shift - ing of the specific equilibrium , as it were .

		The suddenly appearing forms , thus newly endowed , are called ^ ' mutations , '' and it is found that they very generally breed true .

		The same sort of mutation may appear over and over again .

		Just how these '' mutations '' are related to the past history of the race , it is impossible to say ; some think that they are the results of new combinations of existing and latent characters , others that they are genuine novelties , as all species were once thought to be by a process of special creation .

		Historical evidence is offered in favor of the latter view in some cases ; thus the
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	cattle all have white faces , though we know that it was not so very long ago when this conspicuous mark was wanting .

		We do not know that the white face was derived from anywhere in particular ; it seems to have come as we find it , and ever since remained .

		In the case of the
Spitz	PERSON	dog , it is evident that no wild ancestor could have had such characters , and survived ; yet in none of these cases have we anything like complete historical records .

		The particular cases I cite -- because they are familiar -- have not I think received a thorough study in the light of the newer doctrines , but for purposes of illustration they are sufficient .

		The purport of all the above is to make it clear what has engaged the attention of latter - day evolutionists ; and it must now be said , that there has arisen a group of men who be -
1904	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 197 lieve that to all intents and purposes `` muta - tions '' are new species .

		That is to say , that new species -- plants or animals having tan - gible distinctive characters , which are inherited -- come into being all at once , without the aid of the Darwinian factor of '' natural selection . ''

		Dr.
Morgan	PERSON	's book on '' Evolution and Adaptation '' is written in support and defense of the doctrine just mentioned .

		He admits that natural selection has destroyed innumer - able `` new species '' on the very threshold of their existence , but holds that on the other hand many have survived simply because their characters , even though slightly harmful , were not sufficiently so to cause their elimination .

		He admits the obvious fact that creatures are adapted to their surroundings , but urges as an argument against this being the result of nat - ural selection , that the '' adaptation '' is fre - quently more perfect than the nature of the case demands .

		The discussion of the '' mutation theory , '' and especially the breeding experiments of such men as de Vries of
Holland	LOCATION	and
Bateson	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, are certainly bringing out many in - teresting facts , and whatever is the ultimate effect upon biological theory , the air will have been cleared of various misconceptions .

		In this discussion , however , caution and scientific method are necessary , and I must say that Dr.
Morgan	PERSON	does not seem to me to possess either .

		His book is written after the manner of a law - yer , whose only interest is to clear his client , and discredit the witnesses for the other side .

		Of most of the matters treated , he has appa - rently no first-hand knowledge , and his famili - arity with the details of zoology may be judged when we find him supposing -LRB- p. 181 -RRB- that all Hymenoptera are bees .

		His commonest and most insistent argument is that we can not sup - pose this or that to have any utility , we can not believe in such and such hypotheses necessary according to the Darwinian theory , and conse - quently it is impossible that natural selection can have produced the results attributed to it .

		The practised zoologist or botanist will dis - count these statements as merely exhibiting want of knowledge or lack of imagination , for he is very well aware that it is in many cases impossible or very difficult to explain the mean - ing of characters without seeing them in actual use .

		If it were possible to resurrect some of the learned men of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and show them some of our complicated modern machin - ery , not in action , would they not declare that its use was inconceivable , and that as art it was inferior to that of their own day ?

		Just so does our book-learned naturalist dogmatise about the inutility of specific characters , while he who goes out among living things is amazed at the wonderful relations between structure and environment .

		That all characters which mark species have utility , or have had utility , or are correlated with those which have or had utility , we are not able to prove , and in the nature of things never can prove directly , by taking each of the millions of cases separately .

		Conse - quently it is easy enough for anyone to produce numerous unexplained instances , but we are reminded of
Huxley	LOCATION	's reply to the spiritualist , -- `` if I can not offer an explanation , it does not follow that I am bound to accept yours , '' -- or words to that effect .

		The worst feature in Dr.
Morgan	PERSON	's book , I think , is the way in which he parades all sorts of evolutionary doctrines , one after another , and proceeds to demolish them without making it at all clear that many of them are already obsolete .

		It is ridiculous to treat
Darwin	PERSON	's writings as if they were a body of dogma like that of the theologians , to be accepted as it stands or not at all .

		Darwin changed his opinions as he got new light , and if he were living to-day he would certainly have reached some new conclusions , which the facts known in his day did not permit .

		In the strongest possible contrast with
Darwin	PERSON	's rjeally scientific and enquiring attitude is Dr.
Morgan	PERSON	's delib - erate attempt -LRB- as it seems to me -RRB- to discredit the Darwinian theory by attacking doctrines abandoned by modern Darwinians , and insid - iously suggesting that the others are no better .

		There has been a superabundance of such argu - ment in the field of theology , but we hardly expect it from a scientific man .

		I should like to quote a number of passages , to show the bias of some and the absurdity of others , but this review is already too long .

		The anonymous '' Doubts about Darwinism '' is quite a different sort of book .

		It has this in common with Dr.
Morgan	PERSON	's work , that it is a re-thrashing of old straw , but it treats of those philosophical difficulties which occur to every thinking person , and are part of the paradox of sentient existence .

		The writer concludes that the phenomena of nature , and particularly those of evolution , can not be wholly explained on Darwinian grounds , but must have required the intervention of intelligence .

		But the quality of Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's work as a whole is suiOBciently high to condone in some measure this particular obliquity of vision , and the quantity is now so considerable that it must come into the reckoning .

		How considerable that quantity is may now be seen without difficulty , for the author has collected into a single volume all of the poetical work which he has thought worth preserving , and there are almost three hundred pages of it altogether .

		It covers nearly twenty - five years of scattered production , for the poet of whom we have thought as belonging to the younger generation is now close upon the completion of his half-century .

		Within this range are many noble spaces consecrated to the glory of nature and of art , or dedicated to worthy persons and institutions .

		We appreciate the fine impulse of these lines , and yet they share with Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's other sonnets in the lack of spontaneity .

		Coldly correct is the epi - thet which best describes the work of this thought - ful and accomplished writer .

		Another volume also made up entirely of son - nets is the work of Mr.
Joseph Warren Beach	PERSON	.

		It is entitled '' Sonnets of the Head and Heart , '' and its contents are pleasing as to form and sentiment alike .

		Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's impulses somehow seem less premeditated than those of Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	, and the re - sult is consequently more appealing .

		One example is called '' Proteus . '' ''

		Knowest thou yet my voice ?

		Or hast thou heard In vain the murmurs of thy paradise ?

		When to the horn 's melodious enterprise The low voice of the violin demurred .

		Was it not still the glad cry of the bird ?

		And when you felt your love 's bewitching eyes Upon you , did you entertain surprise That in your own heart the same longing stirred ? ''

		I am a god protean , for my name Is named diversely .

		I am called the Word Because I made the world .

		As Love I fill The veins of all the universe with fl ^ me .

		And because my desire , though long deferred .

		Is ever won at last , men call me Will . ''

		Even and careful workmanship , with not a little of genuine poetical feeling , is characteristic of Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's volume throughout .

		The foreword of Mr.
Yield	PERSON	's '' Random Verse '' has a lilt that makes us anticipate a volume of Swinburnian echoes . ''

		But the Spirit of Song , overladen With burdens of mutable years .

		Still as young as the tear of a maiden , Still as old as the tribute of tears ; Though her footsteps grown feeble may falter , Though her tombs and her temples be sealed .

		She shall bear them as gifts to an altar , Her fruits of the flock and the field . ''

		Such echoes we find occasionally in the pages that follow , but in the main the poet speaks to us with an individual accent .

		He is an adept at easy and swinging rhythms ; he has fancy of a high quality , and the touch of distinction .

		Our expository pur - pose is best served by quoting the poem `` Stop , Thief ! '' ''

		Love sat down like a tired tinker .

		Asking only a shady seat .

		Feaster neither he nor drinker , Wine nor bread would he sip nor eat . ''

		Love slept well in the
April	DATE	weather -- Laid him low where the sweet-fern grows ; Gold of gorse and the purple heather .

		Pink of poppy and rose of rose . ''

		Love stole off in the misty dawning .

		Casting never a look behind ; Calling never a gay good morning .

		Went his way where its white ways wind . ''

		Ye who watch for the mad marauder .

		Faring far with his gains ill got .

		Stay Love 's steps ere he cross the border , -- Love has stolen -- I knew not what . ''

		Mr.
Yield	PERSON	's thought is not always clear , being ad - dicted to symbolism , but it is of such a quality that this slight volume outweighs many a tome of the more labored and pretentious sort of verse .

		Mr.
James Lincoln	PERSON	introduces his '' Relishes of Rhyme '' with a note that ends as follows : '' It will be evident to the reader , if so excellent a per - sonage exists , that they were suggested , in most instances , by cablegrams from
South Africa	LOCATION	as given to the American press during the Boer war . ''

		Most of these pieces are trifles of a careless sort -- newspaper verses and nothing more .

		But to thi 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, statement we mast make exception in favor of some half-dozen of the poems , and particularly in favor of the fine sonnets to
England	LOCATION	which open and close the volume .

		We quote the first of these sonnets . ''

		Who would trust
England	LOCATION	, let him lift his eyes To Nelson , columned o'er
Trafalgar Square	LOCATION	, Her hieroglyph of duty , written where The roar of traffic hushes to the skies ; Or mark , while
Paul	PERSON	's vast shadow softly lies On
Gordon	PERSON	's statued sleep , how praise and prayer Flush through the frank young faces clustering there To con that kindred rune of sacbificb . ''

		O
England	LOCATION	, no hland cloud-ship in the blue .

		But rough oak plunging on o'er perilous jars Of reef and ice , our faith will follow you The more for tempest roar that strains your spars And splits your canvas , be your helm but true .

		Your courses shapen by the eternal stars . ''

		In the pieces that follow , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	reveals him - self as a Boer partisan , although not of the rabid type , and takes quite for granted that in defend - ing her invaded territory and taking measures to prevent similar future invasions ,
England	LOCATION	was betraying the cause of freedom .

		This seems to us a topsy-turvy way of viewing the situation , although we are well aware that it is the view of many men whom we hold in the highest respect .

		The '' Ballads of Valor and Victory '' that have been written by Messrs.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	and
Wallace Rice	PERSON	with carefully-conceived intent to illustrate the most significant phases of American heroism , make up a volume that stirs the blood and deepens the patriotism .

		Each of the authors has contributed twenty-five pieces , and the series as a whole , chronologically ordered , presents in spirited verse the story of such deeds of daring as may well awaken the pride of all who are the countrymen of those who figure in these ballads .

		The variety of the volume is so great , both in theme and in met - rical effect , that adequate illustration is impossible ; each piece illustrates itself , and hardly any other .

		From Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's share in the work we may select this strophe from `` The Men of the
Maine	LOCATION	'' : '' Not in the dire , ensanguined front of war .

		Conquered or conqueror , ` Mid the dread battle-peal , did they go down To the still nnder-seas , with fair Renown To weave for them the hero-martyr 's crown .

		They struck no blow ` Gainst an embattled foe ; With valiant-hearted
Saxon	PERSON	hardihood They stood not as the Essex sailors stood .

		So sore bestead in that far Chilian bay ; Yet no less faithful they , These men who , in the passing of a breath , Were hurtled upon death . ''

		The work of Mr.
Rice	PERSON	we may best illustrate by the first two stanzas of ''
Richard Hakluyt	PERSON	's Men . '' ''

		Here sighs the breath of the sea .

		And here sounds the boom of the wave .

		The crash of the surf on the beach .

		Through time everlastingly ; And here , through the elements ' reach .

		The lightning , the storm , and the spume , Comes the cry of the sailors who gave Their bones to the surges to bleach , Their souls to a billowy doom . ''

		What of grey dangers afar In spaces uncharted , nntrod ?

		What though the heav ` ns are a-change .

		And engulphed is the Cynosure-star ?

		What though the sun has grown strange .

		And the deep has been made molten brass ?

		At their peak flies the Cross of their GoD And , wherever their rudders may range , 'T is His Voice in the tempests that pass . ''

		As far as the two poets have distinctive manners , it may be said that the one is apt to sacrifice grace to an overplus of energy , while the other , by dint of being less energetic , achieves a more polished diction .

		But the two make admirable yoke-fellows , and their joint production is a highly creditable ad - dition to a department of American literature that seems heretofore to have missed its opportunities .

		What we particularly like about the book is that , in spite of its exultant note , it is by no means given over to anything like rampant jingoism .

		Readers of many sorts will find satisfaction in its pages , and generations of schoolboys , looking for '' pieces to speak , '' will arise to call its authors blessed .


Ralph Erwin Gibbs	PERSON	was a product of the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia schools and a teacher in the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A shocking accident last year ended his life at the age of twenty-seven , and with it a career as a writer that was marked by exceptional promise and per - formance .

		He had published a considerable quan - tity of verse in fugitive ways , but never a volume .

		That task has now been performed for him by Professor
Gayley	PERSON	, who has collected the scattered pieces and called them '' Songs of Content . ''

		Some of them are of light and juvenile quality , but others betoken the serious thinker , and in all of them there is evidence of unusual talent .

		The author seems to have given us a sort of brief spiritual autobiography in the sonnet called `` The Prize , '' which we quote . ''

		A thriftless one there was who ever sought To weave a vagrant fancy into song ; Baubles he framed in fretted verse ; and long -- In love for these his small creations -- wrought Till each , as from its maker 's heart , had caught A mimic beat .

		But friends who saw cried . '

		Wrong To waste thy Day thus I Not with rhythmic throng .

		Of dreams -- with deeds are this World 's Prizes bought . '

		Yet still this idle Singer in the Sun , -- Rhyming his chime of words , with moistened eyes .

		Mood-caught in mesh of verses fancy-spun , -- Would answer nothing save , in wistful wise , ' We go strange ways to seek one Goal .

		The Prize Is his who smiles content when Life is done . ' ''

		This sonnet , standing in the forefront of the vol - ume , invites to further discovery , and the enterprize does not go unrewarded .

		It would be both pleas - ant and profitable to quote at much length from this volume -- from such poems as '' Daybreak in the
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	, '' `` The Heretic , '' and `` The Marchioness of Yvetot , '' for example -- but we have not the space .

		The best work of Mr.
Gibbs	PERSON	seems to occur in a group of five poems written in Omarian rubaiyat , and one of these five gives us quatrains versified from Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's prose translation that are not unworthy to be named in the same breath with that of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL .

		201 '' When thou and I are blotted from the List , A little while no doubt we shall be missed ; They '11 set up bricka upon thy grave and mine To mark that Thou and I did once exist . ''

		A Brick , betokening this World 's concern With Thee or Me !

		And then , to make , in turn Another brick to mark another grave .

		Thy Clay , perchance , or mine , they '11 dig and burn .

		* ' Let \ rho8o aim at

		Better sing one Song To lift the sadness from a weary Soul ! ''

		For be thou wise as
Aristotle	LOCATION	, -- yea .

		Or potent thou as
Monarch of Cathay	ORGANIZATION	, Or Roman Caesar : -- comes the End , and none Shall know Thv Ashes from the common Clay . ''

		This matter is all derivative , no doubt , but the expression is certainly noteworthy .

		It seems to us that the author had in him the distinct promise of becoming something more than a minor poet , and his untimely death is a matter for deep regret .

		After a long silence .

		Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	comes before the public with a new volume of verse .

		This latest published work , like her earliest , is dramatic in form , but with a difference .

		Instead of the con - ventional five-act play , conforming to the traditions of the English poetical drama , she now gives us five brief sketches , vivid transcripts of modern life or reflections of its issues , richer in their suggestion than in their actual verbal investiture , and disclos - ing momentary vistas of the deep ultimate realities of emotion .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	has heard the message of the moderns -- of the great Norwegian most of all -- and her little plays might almost be described as footnotes to the body of doctrine spanned by the arch which began with '' Love 's Comedy '' and ended with '' When We Dead Awake . ''

		Certainly , her fundamental idea is the same as that of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	-- the idea that our lives are so often mis - shapen because we blind ourselves to the realities of existence , and do service to false gods .

		A passage from '' After All '' -- the dialogue of two lost souls in hell -- may be quoted in illustration of this thesis . ''

		He .

		At last We who have lost may know the game .

		She .

		Yea , we who missed the fateful cast .

		Faltering when the angel passed .

		May count his footsteps one by one Down to our earth , back to his sun .

		He , And we who never spake before
May	DATE	utter pallid words .

		She , And we Whose wind-drawn senses feel no more ,
May	DATE	tell the ruinous heart-throbs o'er That beat us down this bitter path .

		He .

		We -- pale inheritors of wrath .

		Who might be treading , hand in hand .

		Spaces afoam with wings .

		She , If you , That day when God was with us two .

		Had given me the supreme command .

		He , If you had stood less proudly there Against the sun , had seemed aware Of the desire that did not dare .

		She , I who dared all !

		He .

		If the red lips , That smiled , had trembled once .

		If ever One quiver of the fingers-tips Had proved you woman She .

		If like a man You had torn the veil He .

		We blurred God 's plan -- Rust on the shining rim of heaven . ''

		In this beautiful passage is struck the keynote of the spiritual tragedy which these little verse-dramas echo in various colors .

		One can not read them with - out being deeply moved or without feeling that this writer has achieved a finer art than heretofore .

		It is an art having both restraint and distinction , daring enough to use plain speech at need , yet re - maining essentially poetical in the most prosaic surroundings . ''

		The Singing Leaves , '' by Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	, is a little book of little songs , mostly occupied with childish dreams and fancies , graceful , tender , and altogether alluring .

		It would take a very crabbed person to resist the charm of the following couplet '' Concerning Love '' : '' I wish she would not ask me if I love the Kitten more than her .

		Of course I love her .

		But I love the Kitten too : and It has fur . ''

		These stanzas `` Before Meat '' are worth quoting : '' Hunger of the world , When we ask a grace , Be remembered here with us .

		By the vacant place .

		`` Thirst , with nought to drink .

		Sorrow more than mine .

		May God some day make you laugh .

		With water turned to wine . ''

		An unsuspected aspect of Miss Peabody'a delicate art is revealed in these pieces , which are as genuine as they are simple .

		A considerable number of the < ' Poems '' of Miss
Josephine Daskam	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Bacon	PERSON	-RRB- are songs of child - hood , and the happiest of these is the set of stanzas which express the childish notion of '' Heaven . '' ''

		She says that when we all have died We 'll walk in white there -LRB- then she cried -RRB- All free from sorrow , sin , and care -- But I 'm not sure I 'd like it there . ''

		She can not tell me what we '11 do , I could n't sing the whole day through : The aogels might not care to play .

		Or else I might n't like their way . ''

		I never loved my
Uncle Ned	ORGANIZATION	, So I ca n't love him now he 's dead .

		He 'd be the only one 1 know -- She says it 's wicked to talk so . ''

		I ' d like to see how God would look , I 'd like to see that Judgment Book : But pretty soon I 'd want to be Where the real people were , you see . ''

		When people turn dead n a dream , I wake up , and I scream and scream : And since they 're all dead there , you know , I 'm sure that I should feel just so . ''

		Miss Daskam 's verses have grace and fancy ; they reflect the tastes of a student of good literature 202 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, with a talent for semi-conscious assioiilation .

		At their most serioas , as in '' Two Sonnets from the Hebrew '' and the ``
Washington	LOCATION	`` Ode , '' they are toached by a grave beauty .

		Perhaps the highest reach of the volume is found in '' The Old Captive , '' a poem of sea-passion , which closes with these finely imagined lines : '' Where the pale light strains down through undreamed deeps To glimmer o'er the vast unpeopled plains , The ancient treasure piles of dead kings ' fleets , The mighty bones long bleached beneath the Sea , * ' There where cool corals and still seaweeds twine , There on the solemn level ocean floor , Till God 's great arm shall terribly plough the deep , I shall lie long and rest beneath the Sea . ''

		Yet the question arises whether any young woman is well occupied with such imaginings .

		Miss H ^ loise
Soule	PERSON	's ''
Heartsease	PERSON	and Rue '' is a thin volume of unpretentious but not unpleasing verse , of which '' No Tears '' oflPers a fair example . ''

		Thank God , all ye who weep I Ye only know the name of dry despair ; My barren waste , my arid desert bare , Is watered by no tears that gently creep '' From underneath the lids , Soothing the soul again to ancient calm .

		No crying comes to me for healing balm , -- Nature her common solace me forbids . ''

		Think not I never wept I 'T is only that the fountain has run dry ; And bare beneath the burning , sultry sky The blasted desert of my heart is kept . ''

		It is rather a pity , for the author is evidently a very young woman , as is indicated by the fact that a '' class poem '' is the most considerable piece of her collection .

		Miss
Mary Ainge De Vere	PERSON	opens her volume of verse with '' The Wind-Swept Wheat , '' and allows that piece to provide a title for the collection .

		Her work displays careful execution , and illustrates many phases of sentiment and fancy . ''

		Once '' is a copy of verses that may serve to illustrate the manner of this writer . ''

		Cool salt air and the white waves breaking Restless , eager , along the strand -- An evening sky and a sunset glory .

		Fading over the sea and land . ''

		We two sitting alone together .

		Side by side in the waning light , Before us the throbbing waste of water .

		Behind us the sand heaps , drifted white . ''

		Ships were sailing into the distance Down to the land where the sun had gone ; The rough fresh wind blew o'er our faces .

		The shadows of night crept slowly on . ''

		Is it a dream that I remember ?

		Some ghost of a hope that will come no more , We two sitting alone together , Hand in hand , on the ocean shore ? ''

		Nature is the predominant inspiration of '' A Spray of Cosmos , ''
Miss Bristol	ORGANIZATION	's volume of poems .

		And we find nothing more fitting to quote than these blank verse lines from the poem addressed to '' The Pyxidanthera '' : '' Sweet child of
April	DATE	, I have found thy place Of deep retirement .

		Where the low swamp ferns Curl upward from their sheathes , and lichens creep Upon the fallen branch , and mosses dark Deepen and brighten , where the ardent sun Doth enter with restrained and chastened beam , And the light cadence of the bluebirds ' song Doth falter in the cedar , -- there the
Spring	DATE	, In gratitude , hath wrought the sweet surprise And marvel of thy unobtrusive bloom . ''

		When we read these lines , we feel like starting at once for the pine-barrens of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, where the pyxidanthera is blooming at the present moment . ''

		A Hill Prayer '' is a poem by Miss
Marian Warner Wildman	PERSON	, to which the * ' Century '' maga - zine five years ago awarded its prize offered to col - lege undergraduates .

		Encouraged by this early success , the author has persevered in verse-compo - sition , and now publishes a volume having the above-mentioned prize poem in its forefront .

		Miss
Wildman	PERSON	's poems are mostly lyrics of nature as spiritualized by the reflective mind . ''

		A
Beech	LOCATION	- Wood in
October	DATE	'' is an example of her work at its best . ''

		Beneath the ancient beeches , cloth of gold For
Autumn	DATE	's regal passing has been laid .

		Gold sunbeams pierce the thinning golden shade , Where wider glimpses of blue sky unfold . ''

		No bird sings here ; and never light wind blows To stir the leafy curtains , golden brown .

		But still the ripened leaves drift slowly down , And still the carpet softer , thicker grows . ''

		Among the beeches
Autumn	DATE	does not die In crimson passion or in scarlet pain ; Here only peace and golden silence reign ,
June	DATE	dreams forgotten -- Winter fears put by . ''

		So would I die , O beeches I When at last My days are numbered like your ripened leaves , I would not be as one who idly grieves , And mourns the glories of the
Summer	DATE	past . ''

		In peace and golden silence I would lie , Still gazing upward through the thinning gold , Until the last leaf fell , and there -- behold I Beyond the lifeless boughs , God 's open sky 1 '' The quiet excellence of these verses is shared by many others of Miss
Wildman	PERSON	's pieces , and the total effect of her work is pleasing in a high degree .

		We will close this review with a word of tribute to a woman of marked poetical sensibility and meritorious performance in verse -- the late
Mary M. Adams	PERSON	, wife of the late President of the Uni - versity of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	. ''

		The Song at
Midnight	TIME	, '' arranged for publication just before her death , in - cludes poems new and old , from which we select a sonnet called '' Evening on
Lake Winona	LOCATION	, '' with - out knowing positively whether it is one of the new poems or not , but recognizing it as a typical example of the author 's work . ''

		The
Summer	DATE	's affluent beauty crowns the night ; Flowers and fragrance are on every side ; The moon , arising as a joyous bride , The water seeks and chastens with love 's light ; While happy souls , enraptured with the sight , Find here no human sense its best denied ; Entrancing melodies on soft airs glide .

		And hearts responsive hold the vision bright .

		The simple sincerity and deep religious feeling of these lines are everywhere marked characteristics of the author 's work , and have long endeared her to the many hearts who feel the poorer for her death .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		This most recent biography of the
Whittierata Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet , contributed by Profes - sor
Greorge Rice Carpenter	PERSON	to the '' American Men of Letters '' series -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , follows close upon the Life by Mr.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, in the older series of '' English Men of Letters . ''

		The existence of this work , together with the earlier biographies by
Kennedy	LOCATION	,
Underwood	PERSON	, and
Pickard	PERSON	, does not make Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	's work superfluous or inoppor - tune ; the volume has a peculiar value of its own .

		While not many details of importance have been left for this later garnering , it has remained for the author to throw a new emphasis upon some phases of
Whittier	LOCATION	's career which place his personality in an interesting and somewhat unwonted light .

		In - deed , it would not be unfair to suggest that the present portraiture of the poet presents him in the character of a man of action as distinctly as a man of letters -- a man of energetic and passionate ac - tivities amid the exciting experiences of his early manhood ; for to this feature of
Whittier	LOCATION	's career , as journalist , politician , and reformer , the author devotes two hundred out of the three hundred pages of the book .

		The position of the young farm - er poet among his contemporaries of the
New England	LOCATION	group is shown to be unique ; he was the only member of that group country born and bred , the only writer of his day distinctively representing rural
New England	LOCATION	and the simple Puritan type .

		Again , Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	has given fresh empha - sis to the storm and stress period of
Whittier	LOCATION	's own youth , the intense ambition that led him in his twenty ` fifth or twenty-sixth year to contemplate ser - iously the desertion of the muse for the allurements of a political career . ''

		I would have fame with me now -- or not at all , '' he wrote to Mrs.
Sigourney	PERSON	in
1832	DATE	; '' Politics is the only field now open for me , and there is something inconsistent in the char - acter of a poet and modern politician . ''

		Later in the same year he writes to a friend , '' Of poetry I have nearly taken my leave , and a pen is getting to be something of a stranger to me .

		I have been compelled again to plunge into the political whirl - pool , for I have found that my political reputation is more influential than my poetical , etc. '' The de - ' velopment of abolition sentiment in
New England	LOCATION	, and the growth of the movement to the climax of its influence in national politics , is admirably sketched .

		The eminently judicial position of the young
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, his fearless attitude toward friend as well as foe , and his complete freedom from fanati - cism , are clearly shown .

		Of literary criticism , the author has less to offer than the earlier biographers , but what is offered is pointed as well as brief .

		Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	's own literary style is of nota - ble excellence , and adds a distinctive quality to the book .

		The Dutch ^ ^ '' ' ^ ^ ® Dutch Founding of New founding of York , '' by Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	, ^ g have a sprightly sketch , none the less valuable for its sprightliness , of the origins of our greatest city and our greatest commonwealth .

		It is but a sketch , though in external aspect it is a portly octavo volume ; thick paper and very wide margins give the book its size , while the number of words is about equal to that of
Burke	PERSON	's Speech on Conciliation , and is but a quarter greater than that of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's Essay on
Milton	LOCATION	.

		But the subject is not a large one , and the treatment is entirely ade - quate for the needs of every reader except the special student of our national beginnings .

		The book will be useful in correcting the false impres - sions created by Irving 's skilful and humorous mis - representation of the Dutch .

		Everyone knows that when
New York	LOCATION	was founded the Dutch had just passed through a tremendous struggle , in which , after defying the greatest power of
Europe	LOCATION	, they had fought off the Spaniards , had won their inde - pendence , and during the struggle had constantly grown in strength and had gained the mastery of the seas .

		Yet the common notion of the Dutch of the early seventeenth century is that of a sleepy , tobacco-loving , schnapps-drinking people , instead of the < ' hard-headed , hard-hitting men '' that they were .

		Those early Dutch settlers in
America	LOCATION	are not especially lovable as they are shown to us .

		They were rough , smugglers , law-breakers ; they cheated and oppressed the Indians ; < ' they had the vices of their kind enlarged by the vices of their time . ''

		But they were keen , alert , sturdy , and full of pluck , -- by no means the easy-going men of Irving 's fairy tale .

		Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	follows the story through from the small beginnings to the melan - choly end , showing failure of the Dutch government and the steadily growing pressure of the surround - ing English colonies , until the inevitable came and the English completed their holding on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast .

		Old
Peter Stuyvesant	PERSON	is the only character that stands out with any clearness , as he is the only one about whom many details are given ; and his setting forth is by no means creditable to him , though in external matters he showed a good sense that was sadly lacking in his management of the colony .

		The author , while making his story vivid by the use of very modern English , hardly keeps up to the traditional dignity of historical writing .

		For instance , within three pages he uses the fol - 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, lowing expressions : `` Those cheeky Commission * ers , '' '' the sporting offer of the Marylanders to fill in the close season for tohacco with a time-killing war did not materialize , '' '' until the Dutch were squeezed out and done for . ''

		In all the externals of book-making , the work is one of the most at - tractive of recent issues from the
Harper	PERSON	press .

		Corresponding in kind to Dr. van The
Bible Dyke	PERSON	's valuable essay on `` The in
Browning	LOCATION	.

		f .

		™ , „ ■ ' , Bible m lennyson , we now have Mrs.
Minnie Gresham Machen	PERSON	's volume entitled `` The Bible in Browning '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is provided with an able introduction , analytical of
Browning	PERSON	's use of Scriptural phrases and motives , and also suggestive of his religious faith .

		The work is well edited and tabulated , showing not alone exhaustive research in textual criticism , but also a strong appreciation of the broader scope of the poet 's allusions .

		So frequently has
Browning	PERSON	employed some Biblical phrases that they have be - come almost mannerisms in both his letters and his verse , -- as '' pearls before swine , '' '' to live and see good days , '' and the thought of Hezekiah , '' I will go softly all my years , '' in which the poet usually substitutes '' days '' for '' years . ''

		With scholarly accuracy ,
Browning	PERSON	rarely introduces Scriptural quotations into his classic poems where the allusions would be anachronisms for the characters .

		As the sub-title of this volume declares , it deals especially with '' The Ring and the Book , '' wherein the author locates more than five hundred Biblical quotations of direct and subtle reference , taken from a wide range of Old and New Testament authors .

		Not alone are these phrases and analogies traceable to the
Bible	LOCATION	, but the poem abounds in reproduc - tion of Biblical ceremonials and customs , until it seems , in truth , '' almost saturated with the Bible . ''

		Flaws in
Browning	PERSON	's phraseology are cited , while the admirable adjustment of Biblical material to the diverse characters is well emphasized : '' The language of God 's Word falls like dew from the dying lips of
Pompilia	LOCATION	, and is transmuted into gall and bitterness on the sarcastic tongue of
Count Guido	LOCATION	.

		Illustrations from Holy Writ are pumped forth profusely by the ready wit of the hypocritical lawyers , and are hurled out by the ' soldier-saint , '
Caponsacchi	PERSON	, to point his indignant invective .

		And the Pope , -- that ' good old man who happens to hate darkness and love light , ' -- with clear insight and reverent hand , he brings forth out of this treasury of truth , things new and old .

		Turning the search-light of God 's Word full upon sophistry and ignorance , he leaves no confusion of sin with mistake or misfortune , but ' In God 's Name ' right is right and wrong is wrong . ''

		In the introduction , covering about one-fourth of the volume , the author has formulated the main tenets in
Browning	PERSON	's creed , based upon his Biblical quotations and motives .

		There are a few limitations noted in this portion of the study , both in logic and biographic insight ; but the general creed is \ < ell outlined .

		`` Not one but all mankind ' t epitome , '' A theme to tax the powers of the ablest historian has been chosen by
Winifred Lady Burghclere	PERSON	in her ``
George Villiers	PERSON	, Second Duke of Buckingham '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and she has shown a grasp of her subject and an impartiality in its treatment by no means universal among her sister biographers .

		Her re - searches have not been confined to published sources of information , numerous as these are , but consid - erable unedited matter has also passed under her scrutiny .

		The result is altogether creditable to her , the more so that she has not allowed the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's fascinations to beguile her into whitewashing the darker phases of his character .

		The only criticism we would make is one that savors of praise as well as of censure .

		Certain portions of her work betray , by contrast , marks of haste .

		For example , a fuller treatment of the '' Rehearsal '' episode would have pleased her readers .

		The last seven years , too , of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's life are despatched in one short chapter .

		In general , the fulness of detail noticeable in the first half of the book seems not exactly matched by equal painstaking in the last half -- as if the writer had tired of her disreputable hero , and his scandal - ous amours , as well she might have .

		We look in vain for an adequate account of
Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	's vast estates and his passion for building .

		His
Cliefden	PERSON	-LRB- now
Cliveden -RRB- House	ORGANIZATION	, of interest if only for its subsequent varied fortunes , appears not to be men - tioned , although acknowledgment is made to its present owner , Mr.
Astor	PERSON	, for permission to repro - duce a portrait of the '' wanton
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	. ''

		The house , let it be added , has been at least twice de - stroyed by fire and rebuilt .

		Nine good portraits add to the interest of this well-written biography .

		The standard work of Professor L ^ vy - The philosophy ^ ^ ^ -RSB- ^ i q ^ ^ ^ ^ Philosophy of Comte , published m
1900	DATE	, is now made ac - cessible to English readers in a very good transla - tion -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The book is an admirable example of clear and sympathetic exposition from the stand - point neither of the thick-and-thin disciple nor of the critic of the
Positive Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result is that we have an account which perhaps is truer to the real spirit of Positivism than any other that is available .

		Without advancing extreme claims -LRB- it is admitted , for example , that
Comte	ORGANIZATION	is quite beyond the mark in his estimate of the importance and finality of his concrete contributions to the sci - ence of sociology -RRB- , the author succeeds in showing that many of the traditional difficulties that have been found in
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's system fail to get fully at the motives and logic of his thought .

		The supposed inconsistency between his earlier philosophy and his '' second career , '' or religious period , it is argued , does not exist at all .

		So the criticisms that have been passed upon the classification of the sciences , the attitude toward psychology , the admission of the idea of progress , the failure to attempt a pre - liminary investigation of the nature of knowledge , and other similar objections , were all , it is pointed •
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 oat , anticipated by Comte himself ; and his position is shown to be at least the only logical consequence of his point of view .

		On the whole , a reading of the book , even by those who find it impossible to stop with the
Positive Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, will hardly fail to arouse anew a sense of the fertility , in spite of its aberrations , of
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's genius , and of the im - mense value of the ideas for which he stood .

		That the positive spirit as interpreted by
Comte	ORGANIZATION	, when taken as a final attitude toward the universe , does not meet all the needs of the human spirit , one may perhaps still be permitted to believe fifty years after the death of its great Apostle .

		Why Comte should have been so ready to reject certain interests as futile , should have been so limited in his sympathies along certain lines , the present volume helps to ex - plain by its emphasis of the nature of the soil in which his thought took shape , and the unsatisfactory character of those forms of the tendencies he op - posed with which he was most familiar .

		But while the completeness of his interpretation of the nature of human experience may be questioned , there can be no doubt of either the theoretical or the practical importance of the aspect which he brought chiefly to view .

		The disciplining of the imagination which Positivism involves , the reverence for concrete fact and law , the recognition of the essentially progres - sive nature of truth , and the distrust of finality and dogmatism , the wholesome orientating of thought by the ideal of human welfare , are elements of a temper of mind which is still far too rare in our life and education , and the social need of which can hardly be over-emphasized .

		Journal of the The fourth volume of the collected '' Father 0 / the writings of
James Madison	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
Gaillard	PERSON	Hunt and published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , appears as a com - panion volume to the third , the two comprising the Journal of the Constitutional Convention of
1787	DATE	.

		Mr.
Madison	PERSON	was a constant and faithful attendant upon the sessions of this famous body , and as the champion of the ' ^
Virginia	LOCATION	Plan '' was the most in - fluential member in fashioning the Constitution as it was finally adopted .

		In the absence of modern machinery for accurately recording the discussions of a convention , Mr.
Madison	PERSON	's self-imposed task of keeping extended and careful minutes of the pro- ceedings made him an authority in all later contro - versies regarding constitutional questions , and gave to his opinions and arguments a commanding force .

		His own notes were supplemented by additions made by other delegates with whom he consulted in the years following the Convention ; and in the two volumes comprising the so-called Journal of the Convention the editor has given footnotes citing statements made by members of the body whose papers have been published .

		The result of such careful editing is a most valuable account of the discussions in the Convention .

		There is not much gf general interest in these two volumes , such as qUo finds in Volume I. -LRB- published in
October , 1900	DATE	-RRB- or in Volume II .

		-LRB- published in
December , 1901	DATE	-RRB- .

		Letters to leading men of the time , written between
1769	DATE	and
1787	DATE	, make the bulk of material for these first volumes ; and the reader finds in them those expressions of opinion , descriptions of events , and statements of facts , from which the life of the period may be known .

		But no collection of
Madison	ORGANIZATION	's writings would be complete which failed to include these Convention notes by the '' Father of the Con - stitution , '' which give us so clear an account of the ideas in the minds of these master-builders of a government .

		Forty-four pages of index , and a re - duced facsimile of the draft of the first page of the Constitution , add value to the Journal .

		The four volumes bring the life of Mr.
Madison	PERSON	down to
September 17 , 1787	DATE	, when he signed the Constitu - tion .

		Daring the next two years he played a very prominent part in the fight for the adoption of the instrument , and then gave twenty-eight additional years to the public service .

		In the opinion of many , his best work was done in the earlier part of his ca - reer ; and the four volumes of his collected writings will always remain the great source of information regarding this period of his public life .

		To prepare an intelligent account of sirtfTmeJSa '' '' ' ^ the several nations comprised in the South American continent , for the series of historical studies known as '' The Story of the Nations , '' is no easy task .

		For one reason ^ these nations have not yet attained such '' promi - nence in history '' as to bring them within the scope of the series ; nor do they appear to stand in any true '' relation to universal history . ''

		Yet the colo - nization of the continent by
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century , the manner in which the colonies were governed -LRB- or misgoverned -RRB- for nearly three centuries , the struggles of the several prov - inces for independence early in the nineteenth cen - tury , and the gradual emancipation of each from the spell of the European Peninsular political sys - tems and its advancement towards liberal republican institutions , -- all this furnishes many interesting and picturesque incidents which should no longer be left unwritten , as well as many heroic characters whose names and deeds should no longer remain unknown to readers of history .

		Mr.
Thomas C. Dawson	PERSON	, Secretary of the
United States	LOCATION	legation to
Brazil	LOCATION	, and for six years a resident of the southern continent , is thoroughly equipped for the task of preparing the story of '' The South American Re - publics '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , but to adapt his work to the series above mentioned he has found it necessary to divide it into two volumes .

		In Part I. , which is now before us , he treats of
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Paraguay	LOCATION	,
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		In the crowd of picturesque incidents comprised in the history of this eastern portion of the continent we miss the story of the rise of the Mamelucos -LRB- Mamelukes -RRB- or Paulistas of
Brazil	LOCATION	, who for many years maintained their inde - pendence of both
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	; and that of the '' Reducciones '' or Jesuit Mission villages .

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	'' Still , the story of the foar eastern coantries is full of interest , and is especially timely when the atten - tion of the world is heing drawn away from the older coantries to the rising republics of the new world ; and we await the appearance of Part II. , which will treat of
Venezuela	LOCATION	and the republics lying along the western coast -LRB-
Chile	LOCATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	,
Bolivia	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	, and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which are more interest - ing to the seekers for dramatic incidents .

		Adoicn-Easi ^ S ^ od book for all , and especially itory-teiier for boys , is the account of Elijah andpreacher .

		Kellogg 's life and work , compiled by Professor
William B. Mitchell	PERSON	of
Bowdoin	LOCATION	.

		This college graduated Kellogg in
1840	DATE	, and two of its professors have united with other friends of the late popular preacher and author in the preparation of a memorial volume .

		Besides a brief review of his early life and sympathetic sketches of the man as seen and known at different periods of his active and useful career , the book contains , to the extent of more than half its bulk , many selections from
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	's writings , both prose and verse , beginning with the well-known declamation , '' Spartacus to the Gladiators . ''

		This piece was written and recited as a seminary exercise when
Kellogg	PERSON	was a theological student at
Andover	LOCATION	, and it appears to have elec - trified its first audience , as it has so many hearers since .

		Excellent anecdotes abound in this biography , portraits and other illustrations are generously sup - plied , and the whole forms as interesting a picture of Yankee life and character as any reader could wish .

		The story of
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	's marriage , at the age of forty-one , to a bright young schoolmistress whom a friend had recommended , is a curious bit of ro - mance .

		But Professor
Mitchell	PERSON	twice errs in re - ferring to the married life of these two as extending over more than forty years .

		From
1854	DATE	to
1890	DATE	was the exact period covered , unless the book is wrong in its chronology .

		Messrs.
Lee & Shepard	PERSON	, the publishers of
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	's numerous stories for boys , also publish this biography of the author .

		Printing in ^ ^ -
George French	PERSON	, one of the most relation to intelligent of current writers on graphic art .

		typographical Subjects , has pub - lished through the
Imperial Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Cleveland	LOCATION	a volume on '' Printing in Relation to Graphic Art . ''

		The purpose of the book , in the author 's own not very happy phrasing , is '' to try to establish a claim for printing that it is an art '' ; he believes that many of the elementary principles of graphic art , as rep - resented by such terms as color , tone , light and shade , values , etc. , may successfully be applied to printing , and that through a more general applica - tion of such principles may come a greatly-needed improvement in typographical standards .

		There is much of truth in this contention , and it is here well developed and maintained .

		But Mr.
French	PERSON	is not always to be trusted .

		He refers to Mr.
Will Bradley	PERSON	as a `` genius '' in the field of printing , placing his name with that of
William Morris	PERSON	in a '' high place apart . ''

		He persists , also , in using the word `` format '' as though it were a recognized term for one distinct element in book-making -- aft near as we can make out , the position of the type page on the leaf of paper .

		Now the word itself had best be left alone altogether , as an affectation of the amateur ; but if it must be used , it certainly has no other meaning than its English equivalent ^ and can correctly refer only to the complete exter - nal / orm or make-up of a book .

		But notwithstand - ing these strictures , and others that might easily be made , the book is one to be commended ; and if supplemented with a thorough practical understand - ing of the subject treated , it can not fail to prove of value to any printer .

		It is , besides , a pleasing piece of book-making , being well printed on hand - made paper and stoutly bound in marbled paper boards with linen back .

		Lying just across the
North Channel County Antrim	ORGANIZATION	fj ^ j ^
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Antrim County	LOCATION	is in prote and verse .

		i , t .

		i .

		• i. i more Scotch than Irish in its dialect .

		Therefore it is that in Mr.
John Stevenson	PERSON	's ''
Pat McCarty	PERSON	, Farmer of Antrim : his Rhymes , with a Setting '' -LRB- Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the jingling verse savors not a little of lowland Scotch , and not at all of the Irish brogue .

		The '' setting , '' which is of prose , is English without provincial peculiarities except in quotations .

		Pat is obviously enough Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	himself .

		His verses are pleasing in their Celtic light-heartedness and frequent gleams of humor ; and still more pleasing , though unconsci - ously so , is the poet 's account of their mode of com * position .

		As if communicating something unique , he tells us that '' the method is a curious one . ''

		He does not sit down with malice aforethought and say .

		Go to , now , I will write a fine poem ; but he seizes some chance incident or situation , or catches at the unpremeditated rhythm of some swinging line that pops into his head , and from that works out his verses , fitting lines before and after -- and there you are !

		To the making of poetry , he gravely in - forms us , '' an intention to write and a choice of subject are not necessary preliminaries . ''

		The tone of his interspersed prose is frank and genial , much information is conveyed about men and things in northern
Ireland	LOCATION	, and the whole is tinged with a generous coating of local color .

		The poems are homely in the best sense , dealing with such themes of perennial interest as wife and bairns , games , vis - itors , flowers of field and garden , walks and talks , love , life , and , appropriately last , death and burial .

		Free metrical versions of six psalms blend a little of dignity and seriousness with the lighter elements of this entertaining medley .

		Valuable Americana reprints .

		Two new volumes have recently ap - peared in the extensive series of Americana reprints issued by the Messrs.
Burrows Brothers Company of Cleveland	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of these volumes contains the Rev.
John Miller	PERSON	's account of ``
New York	LOCATION	Considered and
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 Improved . ''

		Mr.
Miller	PERSON	came to
New York	LOCATION	in
1692	DATE	, as chaplain to two companies of infantry stationed in that colony .

		Embarking for
England	LOCATION	after four years of service , he was captured by a French privateer and imprisoned at
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	.

		During his imprisonment he wrote this interesting work .

		It was printed in
1843	DATE	, and again in
1862	DATE	.

		Many errors in these editions are corrected in the present reprint , as is asserted in an introduction by Mr.
Victor Hugo Faltsits	PERSON	.

		This reprint has been set up in literal form from a transcript of the manuscript in the British Museum .

		A sample page of the manu - script is reproduced , as well as the original maps .

		The annotating is well done , but not over-done .

		The worthy chaplain 's opinion of the moral condi - tion of
New York	LOCATION	during the period of his incum - bency is not flattering .

		His ' < improvement '' is the usual suggestion of an American bishop .

		-- The second volume is the much larger < '
Lionel Wafer	PERSON	's Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is annotated and provided with a preface by Mr.
George Parker Winahip	PERSON	, and is reprinted from the original edition of
1699	DATE	.

		It preserves the original typography and the maps and quaint illustrations .

		Translations of Wafer have appeared in Dutch , German , French , and Spanish .

		The last edition in English appeared in
1729	DATE	.

		Wafer , as a buccaneer along the Spanish isthmus from
1680	DATE	to
1687	DATE	, collected the information which he first published in
1699	DATE	, at a time when attention was attracted to the Isthmus by
Paterson	ORGANIZATION	's ill-fortuned Scotch colony on the northern coast .

		By placing these old works within the reach of modern students and readers the enterprising publishers are doing an invaluable service to the literature of American history .

		The second woman to be honored tJ ^ i/uuer3 . ''

		^ ' ^ ^ '' ```` at apo ° g the `` English Men of Letters '' is
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, whose life , by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, forms the latest volume of the series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To say that Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	has succeeded with his task is superfluous , for he is not given to failures ; his charmingly limpid style and sympathetic knowledge of the eighteenth cen - tury combine to make a delightful study .

		Miss
Burney 's Diary	ORGANIZATION	is of course the chief authority ; it is , in Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's mind , the novelist 's best work , and '' one of the great diaries of literature . ''

		By well managed excerpts from it he brings before us the
Burney	PERSON	family and their brilliant circle of friends , from whom Fanny got her inspiration for the characterizations of '' Evelina '' and ''
Cecilia	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	is inclined to regard the hue and cry over
Miss Burney	LOCATION	's appointment to the position of Queen 's dresser as largely a waste of good ink .

		He admits that she was totally unfitted for the duties of her office , and exceptionally gifted and clever in other directions .

		But he points out in re - buttal that when she entered Queen
Charlotte	LOCATION	's service she had written nothing for four years and had earned from her two popular novels less than two hundred pounds .

		Her advisors , then , naturally saw many advantages for her in an offer of two hundred pounds a year for life , and could not fore - see that the tedium and restraint of her post would render it intolerable .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Hawthorne 's essay on '' The Old Manse , '' being the introductory paper in his volume of '' Mosses from an Old Manse , '' has been given a separate reprint by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, as one of the '' Riv - erside Limited Editions . ''

		In general make-up the volume is similar to the reprints of Thoreau 's '' Friend - ship '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Democracy , '' previously issued in the same series ; and like these it is charmingly printed in large old-style type on hand - made paper .

		A vig - nette wood-cut of the
Manse	ORGANIZATION	in
winter	DATE	, printed on the title-page , is the only note of decoration in the book .

		Hawthorne is at his best in this tranquil idyl of the old
Concord	LOCATION	parsonage , and we are grateful for having it in a separate setting of such fitness .

		The annual volume of the '' Proceedings and Ad - dresses '' of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	is always an important contribution to educational litera - ture .

		The volume for
1903	DATE	, reporting the
Boston	LOCATION	meeting , is now published by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Winona	LOCATION	,
Minn.	LOCATION	-RRB- , and seems to us of even more than the usual interest and weight .

		The managers of that meeting seem to have exerted themselves to their utmost to make the papers and discussions representative of the best educational thought as expounded by the ablest men in the profession , and he would be a dull teacher indeed who could not find much that was stimulating and helpful in this collection of educational discussions .

		A reissue of
Crowe	PERSON	and
Cavalcaselle	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of Painting in
Italy	LOCATION	'' is being imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, and the first two volumes are now at hand .

		Their respective subjects are '' Early Christian Art '' and `` Giotto and the Giottesques . ''

		The forty years that have elapsed since the original production of this standard work have brought to our knowledge many new facts and sifted many old conclusions , so that the new edition , which is almost a new work , was really very much needed .

		The editing is being done by Messrs.
Langton Douglas	PERSON	and
S. Arthur Strong	PERSON	, who have had the advantage of the manuscript material left by the authors .

		In its new form , the work is very handsomely gotten up , and is liberally illustrated .

		Brief biographies of the authors properly introduce the opening volume .

		To the discussion of the interesting question of the differences in intellectual tendencies of men and women .

		Miss
Helen Bradford Thompson	PERSON	has added the results of some very careful experimental researches directed mainly to a presentation of the kind and manner of sex differences to be found in the sensory and motor endowments , as well as in the intellectual and emotional processes , of a small group of students who lent themselves to such tests at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The results are difficult to summarize , be - cause such of them as are really general require limit - ations and reservations to make them accurate .

		The interested reader must accordingly be referred to the work itself , `` Mental Traits of Sex '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which he will find the most discern - ing statement of the established differences between the sexes that has yet been pitblished .

		BRIEFER MENTION 242 NOTES 243 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 244 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 244 EDWIN ARNOLD .

		Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	died on the twenty-fourth of
March	DATE	, in the seventy-second year of his age .

		The physical ailments of his later life , including the crowning calamity of blindness , must have made death a welcome release to him , since the close of his days brought him the satisfaction of one who can look back upon a long and useful career and feel that its essen - tial aims have been worthily accomplished , its destined work completely done .

		And reading of his death , we think instinctively of the words of his own poem , spoken from the tomb of him '' who died at Azan '' and after sent a message of comfort to his friends . ''

		Allah glorious !

		Allah good !

		Now thy world is understood ; Now the long , long wonder ends ; While ye weep , my erring friends , While the man whom ye call dead , In unspoken bliss , instead , Lives and loves you ; lost , ' t is true , By such light as shines for you ; But in light ye can not see Of unf ulfiU 'd felicity , -- In enlarging paradise .

		Lives a life that never dies . ''

		Many and varied were the deeds and the distinctions of this accomplished scholar , jour - nalist , and poet .

		Bearing his
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	honors as a Newdigate prizeman , he became master of an English public school , but after two years resigned this post to accept the principalship of a government college in
Bombay	LOCATION	.

		This sojourn in the
East	LOCATION	, which lasted for five years , gave to his life the definite direction which it ever after - wards kept , as far as its expression in litera - ture was concerned .

		He buried himself in the study of the languages , the religions , and the poetry of
India	LOCATION	, and , although he never became an oriental scholar in the exacting sense of philological science , he acquired a sufficient knowledge of certain aspects of oriental thought to become their efficient interpreter to the Western world .

		Returning to
England	LOCATION	in
1861	DATE	, he began his connection with the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' and his editorial relations with that newspaper continued to occupy him for the remainder of his days .

		He revisited the
East	LOCATION	more than once in his later years , and it remained the one lasting and inexhaustible inter - est of his life .

		He was three times married , showing in this a fine cosmopolitan taste , for his first wife was an Englishwoman , his second an American -LRB- the daughter of our own
W. H. Chan	PERSON	- ning , the successor of Martineau in
Liverpool	LOCATION	-RRB- , and his third , who now survives him , a
Japan	LOCATION	- ese woman of much intelligence and charm .

		It must be admitted that Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's repu - tation has declined considerably of recent years .

		It is just a quarter of a century since the publication of '' The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	, '' which bore him upon the full flood of popular fame .

		This poem was followed by many others -- ori - ginal compositions and translated masterpieces of Hindu and Persian literature -- but none of 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, its successors ever had anything approaching the immense vogue of his sympathetic and profound study of the legend and gospel of Buddhism .

		A number of years after the ap - pearance of that work , urged on by the charge of having exalted paganism at the expense of Christianity , he sought to provide it with a companion work in praise of the latter , but '' The Light of the World , '' as the new poem was styled , fell so far below the level of the earlier one that it is not to be mentioned in the same breath .

		Where the poem of
Buddh	LOCATION	- ism was glowing and impassioned and sincere , the poem of Christianity proved colorless '' and rhetorical and artificial ; it had clearly been a task to be performed , not a labor of love to be wrought out with spontaneous enthusiasm .

		It is , then , upon the author of * ' The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	'' that whatever permanent fame may become attached to the memory of Sir
Edwin	PERSON	must rest .

		And that poem seems to us really deserving of lasting remembrance .

		It is not creative work , except in the sense in which all work inspired by deep sympathy recreates its object , but as an interpretation of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	ideals for Western minds and hearts it is hardly matched in English literature .

		Fitz -
Gerald	PERSON	's Omar is better poetry , no doubt , but the poetry is his , and not Omar 's ; and in all the long line of Englishmen , from Sir
William Jones	PERSON	to '' A. E. '' and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, who have brought the message of
India	LOCATION	to our occidental ears , there has been no other whose actual success may be reckoned comparable with that achieved by the author of '' The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		The message proved particu - larly appealing to our American sense , for it enlarged upon a theme with which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	had toyed , and with which the whole of trans - cendental
New England	LOCATION	had been , with more zeal than knowledge , it is true , mysteriously and intimately concerned .

		The prose writings of Sir
Edwin	PERSON	, whether or not they attained the dignity of book publica - tion , are journalism , and , as such , having served their purpose , have ceased to be .

		His original verse was rarely marked by the true poetical accent , and , save for such occasional pieces as the anthologies may preserve , will not be read by his posterity .

		But he had just enough of the technique of the art to stand him in excel - lent stead as a translator , and students of com - parative literature to whom the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	origi - nals are sealed will long find his versions pleasing and helpful .

		Most of all will such stu - dents be grateful to him for his translations from the great epic of the `` Mahabharata , '' and parti - cularly for his exquisitely sympathetic version of the '' Bhagavad-Gita , '' which he rightly styled '' The Song Celestial . ''

		This book seems to us , among the many bearing Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's name , to stand next in importance to the one by which he is most widely known , and we will close our brief tribute to the work of his life by quoting from the volume this parable of the banyan tree : '' They call the Aswattha -- the Banyan tree , Which hath its boughs beneath , its roots on high -- The ever-holy tree .

		Yea !

		for its leaves Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth !

		Who knoweth well the
Aswattha	LOCATION	, knows all .

		Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth , Even as the deeds of men , which take their birth From qualities ; its silver sprays and blooms , And all the eager verdure of its girth .

		Leap to quick life at touch of sun and air , As men 's lives quicken to the temptings fair Of wooing sense .

		Its hanging rootlets seek The soil beneath , helping to hold it there , As actions wrought amid this world of men Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again .

		If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree , What its shape saith , and whence it springs , and , then , How it must end , and all the ills of it .

		The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet And cleave the clinging , snaky roots and lay This Aswattha of sense-life low -- to set New growths upspringing to that happier sky .

		Which they who reach shall have no day to die , Nor fade away , nor fall -- to Him , I mean .

		Father and
First	ORGANIZATION	, Who made the mystery Of old Creation ; for to Him come they From passion and from dreams who break away ; Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh .

		And -- Him , the Highest , worshiping alway -- No longer grow at mercy of what breeze Of
summer	DATE	pleasure stirs the sleeping trees .

		What blast of tempest tears them , bough and stem , To the eternal world pass such as these .

		Another Sun gleams there !

		Another Moon !

		Another Light -- a Light which none shall lack Whose eyes once see ; for those return no prore .

		They have attained My Uttermost Abode ! ''

		THE REVIEWER .

		No doubt the happiest field of criticism lies out - side of contemporary literatm-e , but an important field lies inside ; and in this the reviewer works .

		His conception of the truth about contemporary writing will lack certain safeguards which time and detachment afford the critic of the past .

		The ele - ments of personal prejudice or convenience , of pres - sure from within or from without , endanger his clearness of vision and his frankness of utterance .

		The difficulties of his position are many and serious enough to have led so keen an observer as M. Jules
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		229
Lemaitre	PERSON	to announce that `` the criticism of our contemporaries is not really criticism , but simply conversation . ''

		This seems to be altogether too sweep - ing a dictum .

		It fairly asperses the value of any soi ' t of individual judgment .

		We can not wait for the opinion of posterity upon the chai-acter of our next - door neighbors ; nor will it necessarily be true that our expressed opinion of them is nothing more than gossip , though the chance may lie that way .

		It is the business of the reviewer to express his opinion of next-door literature .

		His duty , like that of any other critic , is to see as clearly as he can , and to tell precisely what he sees .

		He had better not be thinking much about his liability to error ; it is enough to do as well as he can .

		I do not mean that his judgments ought to be based upon mere whim or prejudice ; if they are , he is not a critic in any serious sense .

		For criticism , as Ai ` nold said long ago , '' is the art of seeing the object as in itself it really is '' ; and the critic is of value in proportion as his vision approximates perfection .

		The great critic is born and made .

		His naturally keen vision is refined , before it reaches its highest power , by every contact : by contact with life ; with literature ; finally , with the classics of criticism .

		At the end of aU this , it remains for him only to tell what , as the result of his being and knowing , he does actually see .

		The honest expression of a firm and reasonable opinion -- this is the object which a critic has before him ; his rank depends upon the plane of reason in which his judgments are formed .

		Shiftlessness of opinion and insincerity of expression are the only crimes which can be charged against a reviewer ; his other errors wUl be due to limitations which he can - not remove .

		Moreover , personality , as well as intellect , con - tributes to the effectiveness of the critic .

		True criti - cism , we have begun to see of late , is as much a means of self-expression as any of the forms which are commonly called creative .

		The fact has been most strikingly suggested by
M. Anatole France	PERSON	in his definition of criticism as '' the adventm-es of a soul among masterpieces . ''

		This suggests the chief point of disadvantage for the critic of the contem - porary , or reviewer .

		His adventures must often be upon a lower , at least a more dubious level .

		His function can not be agreeably limited to the walled gardens of literature ; and he will not find master - pieces bursting from every hedgerow .

		He is defi - nitely committed to a contest of research of which the notable prizes must be few .

		He must travel in all places and in all companies .

		He can not , as
Ruskin	PERSON	advised , keep out of the salt swamps of literature , and live on a little rocky island , or , as
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer urged , devote his time for reading '' exclu - sively to those great minds of all times and aU countries who overtop the rest of humanity , those whom the voice of fame points to as such . ''

		He is , in fact , a drudge of fame .

		His reward is , now and then , to hit upon merit , to hit upon truth , to feel himself not only the drudge of fame , but the herald of excellence .

		At such moments he has nothing to ask of fate ; the world is his , and the fulness thereof .

		But why all this stress upon honesty ?

		Is there any reason for a reviewer 's being anything but honest ?

		There are many reasons -- more perhaps in Amer - ica than elsewhere .

		England still presei ` ves a taste for robust criticism .

		It rather likes the battering method ; it does not grudge the `` Satm-day Review '' its fun .

		One can perceive a theory behind this method , to the effect that if a reviewer -LRB- who is free to write or not -RRB- can not find a book good enough to write about , the next best thing is to find one bad enough .

		Either will give him opportunity to enunciate , or to illustrate , some important critical principle .

		This is not the American theory .

		We are given to understand that a reviewer should ignore what he can not praise .

		It is his duty to speak only of books about which he can find some - thing amiable to say .

		He is to be a guide , but not a guardian , of the public .

		Unfortunately , the ordi - nary reviewer has obvious reasons for speaking of books in which no cvdtivated taste can find occasion for praise ; and he is too likely to succumb to the general demand for amenity .

		But let us consider the extraordinary reviewer , the writer who is free to treat only such books as commend themselves to his taste .

		Is he altogether absolved from the duty of warning his audience against meretricious work upon which the perfunc - tory reviewer is pronouncing sUly encomiums ?

		It is quite true that the best service of criticism is affirmative .

		We are in no danger of underrating the value of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's assertion that '' The most valuable critic is the critic who communicates sympathy by an exquisite record of his own de - lights . ''

		The purest pleasure , the highest profit , lies in constructive work ; nobody covets the office of literary headsman .

		Yet it is a necessary office , and there is no reason why the reviewer shovdd feel him - self culpable in occasionally undertaking it .

		He is not so fatuous as to imagine that his comment upon a book will have a mysterious power of adding to or subtracting from its value .

		The immediate circulation of a book may conceivably be affected by somebody 's opinion of it ; its quality , and conse - quently its permanent standing , can be in no way affected .

		Works of merit do not always speak for themselves at once ; works of no merit very com - monly speak beyond themselves .

		It is for the re - viewer to offer some intelligible surmise as to the value of one as well as of the other .

		The especial temptation of the American reviewer is to concern himself more with persons and with volumes of printed matter than with qualities and principles .

		He thinks of the author , he thinks of the publisher , he thinks of the public -- they aU like to hear pleasant things said .

		He says them .

		This is not a method of criticism ; that is , it is not a respectful method of approaching an author or his work .

		An ingenious argument is sometimes advanced in favor of it , based upon the theory that the duty of the reviewer is not only to judge literature , but to 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, encourage authors .

		We are assm ` ed that there must be no more instances like that of the poor young
Keats	PERSON	.

		I can only say that this theory of the re - viewer 's function seems to me altogether false .

		It is his sole business to express his opinion of the abstract value of a book as literature .

		It is a pub - lisher 's business to express his opinion of its concrete value as a commodity .

		If it falls to anybody in his official capacity to encourage , to deprecate , to dis - tinguish between promise and achievement , it falls to the editor .

		Every good editor wiU succeed in bringing out much valuable new material by this sort of manipulation .

		But the critic is under obli - gation only to the truth as he sees it .

		The moment he begins to falter , to qualify , to mitigate the sub - stance of his criticism , he makes it worthless .

		To its form he may well give the highest possible degree of amenity .

		These principles can not be too strictly kept in mind by the reviewer whose critical integrity finds itself wavering under , it may be , the fourfold pres - sure of author , editor , publisher , and public .

		He is a judge , or he is a mere fabricator of book-notices .

		It is not his business to help the sale of books , or to coddle sensitive authors , or to make everybody feel comfortable about everything .

		Discrimination is al - ways offensive in one quarter or another ; and the reviewer discriminates or is lost .

		GOMMUNICA TION .

		THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS .

		1493-1898 .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		Permit us to offer a few lines of explanation regard - ing some points in the review of '' The Philippine Islands -- 1493-1898 , '' which appeared in your issue of
March 16	DATE	.

		The reviewer , while erecting admirable standards of criticism , seems to have some misconcep - tions regarding the scope of that work and the attitude of its editors .

		It is not intended to be per se a history of the islands , but is rather a careful and thoroughly impartial selection of the best documentary material available , as being the original sources for such history .

		As such , the editors conceive that it is their part to pre - sent these documents in faithful reproduction and trans - lation , permitting their writers to speak for themselves , and their readers to form through perusal their own opinions .

		The editors do not feel called upon to inter - pret or criticise the text ; or to intrude their own opin - ions in regard to any of the vexed questions that arise ; or to perform all the research , comparison , and sifting that are necessary in order to reach any just conclu - sions thereon -- processes that pertain to the historian rather than to the editor .

		The prefaces are written atrietly in accordance with this view ; they are simply synopses of the documents contained in the respective volumes , and in these summaries the standpoint of each writer is recognized and admitted ; otherwise , the edi - tors could not maintain their attitude -LRB- adopted from the very inception of their work -RRB- of impartial and unbiased observation and record of the panorama of history as it is unfolded in the successive volumes of the series .

		Anyone who wishes to verify this premise need only compare the synopsis given in the preface with the text of the document itself : e. g. , in Vol .

		VII .

		-LRB- pp. 22-24 -RRB- ,
Salazar	PERSON	's letters to the king , and his controversy with Dasmariiias regarding the Indian tributes ; in Vol .

		VIII .

		-LRB- pp. 10 , 11 -RRB- , the governor 's replies to the bishop ; in Vol .

		X. -LRB- p. 11 -RRB- , Morga 's accusations against the eccle - siastics ; in Vol .

		XII. , Bishop
Benavides	PERSON	's criticisms on all the religious orders , and
Chirino	PERSON	's history of the Jesuit missions ; etc. .

		In the numerous annotations which accompany each volume , the editors have aimed to supply such informa - tion -- historical , geographical , biographical , scientific , and bibliographical -- as will elucidate obscure or dif - ficult points that may arise in the text .

		No one can realize more clearly than do the editors themselves the deficiencies in these respects that exist in the earlier volumes -- partly due to inexorable limitations of time and space , and partly unavoidable in the beginning of any series so long and extensive as this ; but they trust that future volumes will show improvement in these respects .

		In the annotations they have preserved the same impartial attitude , as , for instance , the note on the Inquisition -LRB- Vol .

		V. , p. 258 -RRB- , in which the best histo - rians -- Catholic , Protestant , and Jewish -- are cited for the reader 's benefit .

		The editors prefer , instead of offering their own opinions , to point out to the student the leading authorities , regardless of partisan or sec - tarian tendencies .

		It is certainly not their business to in - dulge in `` critical comment '' or '' definitive conclusions '' -- from which , indeed , they have throughout sedulously refrained .

		It may be here incidentally noted that Craw - furd 's allusion to the Filipinos as '' half-naked savages '' at the time of their discovery by the Spaniards -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 72 -RRB- is simply a phrase in his statement regarding the character of the Spanish administration in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , and is not adopted or even noticed by Professor
Bourne	PERSON	; and that the latter has , in his introduction to the series , cited many authorities besides Morga and ZiiSiga .

		The subjects of legislation for the Spanish colony in the islands and for the protection of the natives , and of social conditions among both peoples , are certainly of the utmost importance ; and examination of the first ten volumes shows that much has been given therein on these matters , e.g. , royal decrees , the constitution of the
Audiencia	LOCATION	, ordinances enacted by that body , instruc - tions given to the governors , account of the encomien - das in
1591	DATE	, and
Plasencia	LOCATION	's account of the customs of the Tagalos -LRB- which was written by direction of the Audiencia for the guidance of the courts -RRB- .

		Then , too , may be found accounts of the early hospitals , benevo - lent enterprises , schools , and colleges of
San Josd	LOCATION	, as well as of the cathedral and other churches -- all these activities being in operation , less than thirty years after the foundation of Spanish
Manila	LOCATION	.

		Finally , as regards judgments and decisions in any Philippine problems , especially on that of the friar con - troversy , the editors can only reiterate their previous statements of their non-partisan and non-sectarian atti - tude toward all these questions ; and their aim of pre - senting to both students and the general public the historical material which must be the only basis for intelligent and fair opinions thereon .

		New liETTERS OF THE CHELSEA SAGE .

		* k The best possible life of
Carlyle	LOCATION	-- best be - cause self-told -- is now completed with two volumes of '' New Letters , '' carefully chosen from a great number hitherto unpublished , and edited , in such a manner as to be so far as possible self-explanatory , by Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	,
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	's nephew .

		This book is the more welcome as no really satisfactory biography of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	has yet appeared .

		It contains 395 letters , arranged chronologically , and issued in two volumes of uniform appear - ance with the recently published '' New Let - ters of
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		Considering the * ' immense number '' of letters from which the editor tells us he has made his selection , and the copious correspondence already given to the public , one may well ask how it was that a man of such productiveness in books ever found time or inclination to put forth so many letters .

		This and other matters of interest find mention in the following extract from the editor 's Preface : ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's Letters are generally the unpremeditated , spontaneous expression of his thoughts and feelings at the moment of writing , set down with perfect candour and sincerity , in his rapid , fluent style ; there are char - acteristic touches of his genius in nearly every one of them , even in his briefest Notes ; whilst many of them are equal in literary qualities to the best of his pub - lished writings .

		Yet they reveal withal the heart of their writer perhaps more than his genius ; they bear evidence that the man who wrote them was not only sincere and candid , but also kindly disposed , full of sympathy and active helpfulness , ever ready with wise advice , friendly encouragement and practical benefi - cence to all those with whom he was brought in con - tact .

		... To no honest enquirer after truth or seeker of advice , did

		gerated depiction of mental and bodily states of unease and disgust both he and his brilliant wife took the delight of true literary artists .

		Some - what as his admired Goethe turned his affairs of the heart into literature , and so got rid of them ,
Carlyle	PERSON	worked off in his letters to intimates those humors that most vexed him at the time .

		It was not his way to burn his own smoke .

		`` Let us lie and rest and say nothing , '' he writes ; and straightway proceeds not to do it .

		But who would have it otherwise ?

		The burst of almost boisterous laughter that we seem to hear after each absurdly splenetic deliverance relieves it of all appearance of ill nature .

		Indeed , the writer himself is more than half - conscious that without something to growl at he would not be happy .

		In the midst of his fretting and fuming over the '' French Revo - lution '' -- a piece of writing that made him , as he declared , '' all biliousness and fret and palpitating haste and bewilderment '' -- he was yet moved to add : '' I often think it is a great malady and madness this poor Book of mine , which wears me so , and has been 80 unlucky : yet rather I should say , it is a great hap - piness , and gives me the completest indifference towards all fretting of fortune , towards much that has haunted me like pale spectres all my life long .

		... I stand serene under the sky , and really have the peaceablest fearlessness towards all men and things . ''

		And he winds up a letter to his brother .

		Dr.
Carlyle	PERSON	: * ' Never mind these hypochondrias of mine ; at bottom , nothing wrong . ''

		It has often been said of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's literary methods , that whereas he made a terrible pother about a book while it was in the writ - ing , he banished it utterly from his thoughts as soon as it was printed and off his hands .

		This is not strictly true .

		When the agonies of parturition were over , he took a lively interest in his literary offspring 's commercial fortunes .

		Sending a package of books to his mother soon after the appearance of `` Sartor '' in book form , he says : '' But the finest item of the collection , you will say , I hope , is Teu/elsdrockh , fairly at last in the shape of a Book !

		They have got it out finally , after long delays ; and it will take its lot like other things .

		It is not a pretty volume , not at all finely done off ; but on the whole I care next to nothing at all about it , or about what comes of it , -- ' a kirk and a mill ' if the world like : I had fairly done with it almost seven years ago . ''

		With him , '' I do n't care '' means what it does with most of us : we do care a great deal , but say to ourselves that we do n't , and that we wo n't let people think that we do ; where - upon our anxiety , like Queen
Gertrude	PERSON	's guilt , `` spills itself in fearing to be spilt . ''

		Yet it 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, is just these delightfully human touches that endear the Letters and their writer to all read - ers .

		Another thing that interests is the fre - quent mention of progress or hindrance in this or that literary work .

		We seem to see the book growing from day to day , and to share the author 's hopes and fears regarding its suc - cess .

		Here is a passage referring to a chapter in the '' French Revolution '' : `` The Chapter is longer than I expected ; not right , yet it must do .

		I have a great lesson to learn : that of einmal fertig werden -LSB- getting done once for all -RSB- .

		Much poring does but confuse , and reduce all to caudle .

		Get it done , and let there be an end !

		The bricklayer does not insist on all being as smooth as marble , but only on all having a certain degree of smoothness and straight - ness ; and so he gets a wall done . ''

		Many glimpses of contemporary notabilities are given us in these pages .

		The poet
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	is rather ruthlessly pictured as having `` no hair at all , but one of the whitest bald scalps , blue eyes , shrewd , sad and cruel ; toothless horse-shoe mouth drawn up to the very nose : slow-croaking sarcastic insight , perfect breed - ing . ''

		Of the young Queen he wrote in
1838	DATE	, after seeing her driving in one of the parks , that she seemed ' ^ a bit modest , nice , sonsy little lassie ; blue eyes , light hair , fine white skin ; of extremely small stature : she looked timid , anxious , almost frightened .

		... I was heartily sorry for the poor bairn . ''

		Miss
Marti	PERSON	- neau is thus turned off : '' Good
Harriet	PERSON	, there is such a lively dispatch in her , such a sharp needling compactness , one wishes her heartily well -- at a distance , '' Fitting place may be found here for Count d'Orsay 's exclamation after viewing
Shelley	PERSON	's bust in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's house , where the Italian was making a call . ''

		Ah !

		It is one of those faces who weesh to swallow their chin . ''

		Somewhat longer shall be our quotation from the letter wherein occurs ap - preciative mention of
Emerson	LOCATION	, as early as
1836	DATE	, soon after the death of his brother
Charles	PERSON	. ''

		Emerson the American friend writes me a most gentle affectionate Letter about the sudden death of a beloved Brother of his .

		He was one of the most prom - ising young men in
America	LOCATION	, I understand ; was just going to be married , and
Emerson	PERSON	was ' enlarging his house ' for new accommodation , -- when alas the
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- row
House	ORGANIZATION	proved the one appointed !

		-- He is a good man , that
Emerson	LOCATION	; nothing can be better than the pious way he takes his great loss .

		He has sent a little Book of his writing too , which is extremely good in spirit . ''

		The book referred to is evidently '' Nature . ''

		On the occasion of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's eightieth birth - day , an anniversary duly celebrated in En - gland and
Scotland	LOCATION	, the octogenarian received a congratulatory letter from
Prince Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	.

		Carlyle 's reply betrays perhaps just a shade more than we might wish of that self-abase - ment before princes and potentates which is not uncharacteristic of the true Briton .

		But the reader shall judge for himself .

		Here is the letter , which , a footnote seems to indicate , the editor now publishes for the first time : `` Sir .

		-- On
Saturday	DATE
morning	TIME	, which was my eightieth , and probably enough my last .

		Birthday , I was honoured with a Letter , by far the remarkablest , the least ex - pected and the most agreeable that came to me on that occasion .

		This is the noble , wise , sincere and generous Letter , which you have been pleased to write , and which I read with very great surprise and very great and lasting pleasure .

		Permit me to say that no honour could have been done to me , which I should have valued so much , or which shall live more brightly in my thoughts for the rest of my time in this world .

		What you deign to say of my poor History of your great
King Friedrich	PERSON	seems to me the most pertinent and flattering utterance I have yet anywhere heard on that subject ; and I am truly proud of it from such a quarter . ''

		With very great sincerity , I warmly thank you for your goodness ; and shall continue to wish for you , as I have long done , every prosperity in your great and noble career , and that God may grant you years and strength to fulfil , or carry beyond risk of failure , the grand and salutary enterprise in which you have already gone so far , in sight of all the world . ''

		I have the honour to be and remain , '' Sir , '' Your obliged and obedient servant , `` T. Carlyle . ''

		Of all the letters in these handsome volumes , letters that vary in tone and degree of intimacy to suit the recipients , those to Dr.
John Carlyle	PERSON	, apparently the most congenial of the writer 's brothers , are the best ; at any rate , they con - tain the most of literary and general interest .

		His affectionate missives to his '' Goody , '' as he playfully styles his wife , will appeal strongly to women readers .

		The wifely devotion so abundantly made manifest in Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's letters to her `` dear , '' is answered with an equal tenderness and solicitude on the husband 's part .

		To his mother , also ,
Carlyle	PERSON	wrote fre - quent letters of the most affectionate sort , now and then enclosing a five-pound note from his rather slender and precarious income .

		Of that income , however , one is glad to note that as early as
1847	DATE	it was becoming very respectable . ''

		Reconstructions of the
Oi.d Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* During the past few years the old - line con - servative astronomer has been considerably shaken up .

		The construction of large telescopes , the application of photography , and the zeal of certain keen-eyed observers in various parts of the world , have been the means of upsetting several ancient notions .

		Astronomers in general shook their heads when they saw the drawings of Schiaparelli which showed the delicate tracery of the canals on Mars .

		But in a few years the evidence ac - cumulated by various observers put the ques - tion of the existence of these markings beyond cavil .

		When the `` canals '' were found to cross certain supposed `` seas , '' and at times appeared to become mysteriously double , the old-time astronomer was more mystified than ever , and wondered whether he had not better take to agriculture or some other quiet and respectable means of earning his livelihood .

		But might he not at least hide himself in the vast deeps of the nebular hypothesis , intrenched behind supposably irrefragable barriers of mathematical analysis ?

		Poring over the huge folios of
Laplace	LOCATION	, might he not repose in safety , walled in by thorny hedges of mathematical symbols ?

		Yet even here repose was not to be found , nor freedom from the distraction of novel ideas .

		The `` apioid '' of Poincaie , the tidal researches of
Darwin	PERSON	and others , the novel speculations of
Chamberlin	PERSON	and
Moulton	PERSON	as to the possible origin of the solar system , all these and other things have jostled the staid old nebular hypothesis in very unseemly fashion .

		One stronghold , however , has been left to which the much-perplexed astronomer might flee .

		He might at least take refuge in the placid and unchanging face of the moon , which , bereft of water and air , has maintained its surface features sharp , clear , and unchang - ing , during the three centuries which have elapsed feince

		tains on its spotty globe .

		But even this refuge seems now to be taken away .

		For Professor
Wm. H. Pickering	PERSON	, of
Plarvard	LOCATION	, has produced a sumptuous volume entitled '' The Moon , '' in which he invests our satellite with an atmos - phere , supplies it with vestiges of vegetation , besprinkles portions of it with snow or hoar - frost , furnishes here and there a mildly active volcano , equips it with some minute canals and with river-beds , and thus quite demoralizes some of the standard notions as to the utter deadness of our pallid satellite .

		The average working astronomer , -- who scarcely looks at the moon except when he has to entertain visitors by telescopic views of it , and who usually wishes that it were below the horizon whenever it is above , because its bright light overpowers that of many faint objects , which he is studying , -- will find in this work not only Professor Pick - ering 's conclusions , but the drawings and pho - tographs on which they are based .

		The book tells plainly where to look in order to verify the author 's discoveries , and what one may ex - pect to see there .

		Someone has remarked that the men who are most confident that the face of the moon is changeless are those who do not study it .

		But the book was not intended for the en - lightenment of astronomers ; it was written for the general public , and aims especially to de - scribe contributions to our knowledge of the lunar surface which have been made by Pro- fessor
Pickering	PERSON	as the result of several years of careful scrutiny of selected portions of it .

		The work also summarizes in pleasing fashion the generally accepted facts about our satel - lite , and is rendered unique by including the only complete photographic atlas of the moon in existence .

		The author begins his study of the moon at a point of time 50,000,000 years or more in the past , when it broke away from mother
Earth	LOCATION	and began to have a separate existence .

		Huge tides were raised on both of these plastic bodies , and their velocities of rotation were re - tarded .

		As the moon slowly backed away from the earth , and cooled off , it finally solidi - fied into a body not quite spherical but slightly elongated toward the earth .

		Its time of revo - lution about the parent body , and of rotation on its own axis , became coincident ; so that it henceforth presented the same face toward the earth .

		The crust cracked in the process of cooling , and the heated gases thus found vent , and craters were formed .

		Professor
Pickering	PERSON	has made similar forms by heating a small dish 234 THE DIAli -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, containing paraffine , and permitting it to cool , agitating the crust from time to time by means of a syringe inserted below it .

		But what about the atmosphere which the moon carried away with it when it left the earth ?

		It is known that the moon now has very little atmosphere , if any .

		The author thinks there is evidence of a small quantity of atmosphere , likely to be composed of carbonic acid and water vapor , -- those gases being given off largely by volcanoes on the earth , and thus similarly by those on the moon .

		In the low temperatures which must exist on the moon 's surface , especially on parts of it that are experiencing a lunar night , the water - vapor would condense into snow or hoar-frost ; while the carbonic acid would become a white solid , as it does in our laboratories when sud - denly released from compression .

		The mag - nificent system of rays radiating from the crater Tycho is explained as a set of crevices in which snow lies .

		The changes in the crater
Linne	PERSON	, observed long ago and regarded as mysterious , are attributed to the existence and melting of snow in its immediate vicinity .

		Professor
Pickering	PERSON	has for the past ten years observed certain variable spots which are dark and are '' always associated with small craterlets or deep narrow clefts , and are often symmetrically arranged around the former . ''

		These spots , in general , rapidly darken shortly after sunrise , and fade away with equal rapid - ity toward sunset .

		The author suggests that the simplest explanation of these is to regard them as due to a form of vegetation which springs up quickly under the combined influ - ence of the sun and the low-lying vapors , soon withers under the noon-day heat , and dies away again .

		One chapter of the work is devoted to popu - lar fancies and superstitions about the moon .

		A full-page plate shows some objects which people think that they see on the lunar disc , -- among them a donkey , a crab , a girl reading a book , and the profile of a woman 's head .

		The various theories that the moon influences the weather , clearing away clouds , indicating rain or its absence by the tipping of its horns , and having some connection between its phases and thunderstorms , are discussed and dismissed with the remark that no influence of any prac - tical importance has been shown .

		The appa - rent increase of size of the moon when near the horizon is considered at some length , and ex - plained in a reasonable fashion .

		The main portion of the photographic atlas with which the work closes consists of eighty full-page reproductions of photographic nega - tives , which occupy considerably more than a third of the book , and cover the entire visible surface of the moon five times . ''

		Every re - gion is shown in five different phases , many details being conspicuous at one phase of the
Moon	PERSON	that are not seen at all at another .

		In this way , changes in the snow-patches and in the vegetation are shown which could not pos - sibly be indicated by any single photograph . ''

		The photographs were made on the island of
Jamaica	LOCATION	, with a telescope of novel dimensions , suited especially to such work .

		The telescope was no less than 135 feet long , and had an object-glass twelve inches in diameter .

		It was laid along the ground , and the light was re - flected into it by a mirror driven by electric motors .

		Because of the extreme length of the telescope , the moon 's image on the photographic plate was over fifteen inches in diameter .

		It was therefore not necessary to enlarge the pho - tographs in order to get pictures on a goodly scale .

		Many recently published photographs of lunar scenery have been so much enlarged that the grain of the photographic plate shows ; Professor
Pickering	PERSON	's pictures look much smoother and more natural than these .

		There are also four maps in which some five hundred craters and other formations are named , to - gether with an alphabetical index containing the latitudes and longitudes of these objects .

		An Old-New Biography of LincoliN .

		* Not every writer of a campaign biography is as fortunate in his subject as was Mr.
Joseph H. Barrett	PERSON	, to whom was assigned , in
1860	DATE	the hack-work task of setting forth the achieve - ments of the candidate to be nominated by the Republican party that year , in such a way as to commend that candidate to the confidence and the suffrages of the voters of the North .

		It was then generally supposed that Senator
Seward	PERSON	would be the man ; and it would not have been hard to make a book on his record as a statesman .

		But as things turned out , Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's task was not an easy one ; for Abra - ham Lincoln had held no great office , his one term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had been inconspicuous , and he was unknown in the
Eastern States	LOCATION	except *
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and his Presidkncy .

		THE DIAL 235 for his recent campaign speeches .

		The hard - headed opponents of slavery in those States believed that character and statesmanship had been set aside for expediency , culture for boor - ishness , when the '' rail-splitter '' was preferred to
Seward	ORGANIZATION	and
Chase	ORGANIZATION	.

		This campaign biography , though reissued in
1864	DATE	with additions , and again in
1865	DATE	with a third part , went the way of all campaign bio - graphies ; but the great character and qualities of the subject have held the interest of the writer , and now , after more than forty years , he gives to the public another biography , far more carefully worked out , -- not this time of a frontier politician of unknown possibilities whom a great portion of his own party dis - trusted and for whom the opposing party felt only contempt and expressed only ridicule , but of one who has proved himself to be one of the great rulers of men , whom all classes and all parties delight to honor .

		Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	was an editor in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	when he agreed to write the book , and was a member of the nominating convention at
Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		Soon after it adjourned , he went to
Springfield	LOCATION	to get materials for his work .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	`` earnestly , and even sadly , insisted that ' there was no adequate material for such a work as was intended , '' but gave such assist - ance as he could to the would-be biographer .

		Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	was with him later in
Springfield	LOCATION	, and during a part of the memorable journey to
Washington	LOCATION	; and he saw much of him during the next four years , having been made Com - missioner of Pensions .

		Since that time he has been steadily preparing this more deliberate and complete work , possible only as the pas - sions of the time have cooled and the period of the Civil War has passed into the field of set - tled history .

		The work is primarily a political history .

		The man
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is largely obscured by the mass of historical and military detail of the years of his presidency ; yet he is shown , behind and in it all , as the master of the situation and the real directing power of the vast and com - plex activities of the war and the civil govern - ment , whom the strong men of his cabinet were glad to follow when once they had found what sort of man he was .

		In the early portion of the work ,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is necessarily at the front ; and while no attempt has been made to gather a large number of new anecdotes and remin - iscences , as some recent writers have done , the presentation of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's formative period is satisfactory .

		Several of the familiar legends and traditions that have gathered about him are disposed of in a very satisfactory way .

		We find -LRB- page 56 -RRB- that '' he had no invincible ob - jection to a good client with a bad cause , '' having acted as counsel for a Kentuckian who sought to reclaim certain slaves that he had voluntarily brought into
Illinois	LOCATION	for temporary employment ; though it is true that he was not often found in a case where he worked against his convictions of justice .

		The romantic fiction that
Lincoln	LOCATION	was so affected by the death of his early love ,
Ann Rutledge	PERSON	, as to be almost in - sane for a considerable period , is made to ap - pear unreasonable in view of several facts , among them that he offered himself to another woman within a year of
Ann Rutledge	PERSON	's death , and that the alleged periods of depression were of too short duration , and not at the right times , to suit the theories .

		Equally baseless is Mr.
Herndon	PERSON	's recollection of a snub received by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	from
George B. McClellan	PERSON	, then an officer of the
Illinois Central Railway	ORGANIZATION	, who is said to have scouted
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's claim for a fee of two thousand dollars in an important case , saying that it was as much as
Daniel Webster	PERSON	would have charged ; whereupon
Lincoln	PERSON	sued the company for five thousand dollars and won his case .

		The facts are as given , except that Mr.
McClellan	PERSON	was in
Europe	LOCATION	at the time .

		It is usually said that
Lincoln	LOCATION	was appointed Gov - ernor of
Oregon	LOCATION	after he failed to get the office of Commissioner of the
General Land Office	ORGANIZATION	, and that only Mrs.
Lincoln	PERSON	's objections and her faith in his future kept him from ac - cepting the appointment .

		It is true that he was appointed to an office in
Oregon	LOCATION	, but it was the office of Secretary of the Territory , which he could not accept with due self-respect .

		The two volumes contain a little less than four hundred pages each .

		Eighty-three pages are given to
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life prior to his election to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		On page 123 we come to the ''
Nebraska	LOCATION	Surprise '' ; twenty-five pages are given to an excellent account of the debates with Senator
Douglas	PERSON	; and we find him nom - inated for the presidency on page 219 .

		Three - fourths of the work are given to the five years of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life on the national stage ; but , as we have said , this part of the work is a history of the time rather than a life of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and it is too crowded to be as interesting or as val - uable as if less had been attempted .

		The view-point of Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	is that of a sincere admirer , who finds little to criticize , though his praise is not lavish .

		He writes his history as a public man with a taste for the 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, subject , and not as a trained historical student .

		The style is dignified , and the work will take its place on the library shelf as one of the worthy biographies of `` the First American . ''

American Tariff Controversies	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	's two bulky volumes on '' American Tarijff Controversies '' comprehend the entire period of American tariff history .

		The beginnings of restrictive legislation , and the course of economic thought through the colonial period , are treated only cursorily ; but the general situation is outlined with a firm grasp of this history and of its bearing upon contemporary events .

		The restrictions which were placed upon the industrial and commercial activities of the colonies , in strict accord with the political economy of the time , but which could not be other than irksome , came at last to seem an intolerable grievance .

		The colonies were thus predisposed to the new economic thought which was stirring in
Europe	LOCATION	and which crystallized in the great work of
Adam Smith	PERSON	.

		From the position thus reached there was a sharp reaction during the period of Con - federation , due in considerable measure to the failure to secure reciprocity arrangements with European powers .

		Considerations of revenue prompted the first tariff under the Constitu - tion ; but there was also the conviction , shared by the majority of the members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that without sacrificing revenue considerations a considerable encouragement could be and ought to be given to domestic manufactures .

		It is at this point that Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	's his - tory fairly begins .

		He has recorded the pro- gress of tariff legislation with all the significant changes in rates and with a painstaking resume of the events , and particularly of the course of reasoning , which led to each act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		This task he has performed with thoroughness , with fidelity to the facts , and almost without bias .

		To the general student of politics , ac - customed to rely upon the so-called tariff his - tories of unscholarly partisans , or upon the still more biased statements from the hustings , these volumes will prove a welcome corrective and an indispensable handbook .

		Not so acute as
Taussig	PERSON	, not wholly unconfused as to its in - cidental thesis , the work is yet admirably tem - *

		pered , and covers the subject with a complete - ness to which no other existing tariff history can pretend .

		Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	has chosen to write of tariff controversies rather than of tariff history .

		This , as he conceives it , allows him to escape from the necessity of a critical analysis of the theories of free-trade and protection , from '' any discussion of the theory of wages , of the wisdom of buying in the cheapest market , and of other philosophical ideas upon which men have based their conclusions as to the economic effects of tariffs . ''

		He concedes the limitations which this restricted point of view will put upon his work .

		What he will modestly attempt is to so exhibit the controversial side of this tariff history , setting forth in due measure and due relief the opposing arguments , that every reader , whatever his bias , will have at hand the material for forming his own judgment .

		Of course the resulting judgment will be valuable only so far as it is based upon sound economic analysis .

		Tariff controversies and tariff changes , without interpretation , would be profit - less reading .

		And it is the author 's interpre - tation , which he evades only fitfully , that must assign the final value to his work .

		The author 's tariff convictions are frankly stated at the outset : '' The work is confessedly that of one who believes that the system of protection has given an opportunity which the opposing system would not have afforded for the unexampled growth of the country . ''

		And at the end it is still `` a policy under which the land has moved into the front rank of commer - cial as well as of manufacturing nations . ''

		This is mild indeed for an advocate , but Mr.
Stan	PERSON	- wood makes up for his mildness by his persist - ence .

		His is not the championship of one who , long balancing the conflicting claims of two op - posing systems , finally comes to the conclusion that on the whole the advantage lies with the one system rather than the other .

		His advo - cacy is uncompromising and absolutely opti - mistic .

		He recognizes the exaggerated and contradictory claims which have been made for his cause ; he never hesitates to lay bare their fallacies .

		He will even say that '' a protective tariff is of little benefit to the country , to man - ufacturers , or to wage-earners , in those periods when trade is expanding and when prices are steady at a high level or advancing '' -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 111 -RRB- .

		But he is so calmly sure that the country has prospered under protection , that every protective tariff , no matter how it came about or what vicious features were included in
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 it , seems to justify itself .

		The tariff of

McKinley	ORGANIZATION	act very deliberately set out to win over the disaffected farmers by covering their industries with the protective mantle , the purpose being purely political -LRB- Vol .

		II. , pp. 264 , 266 -RRB- .

		None of the political raanoeuvering constantly mixed up with tariff legislation is concealed by Mr.
Stan	PERSON	- wood , but his complacency is never disturbed .

		The story of the first political tariff , that of
1828	DATE	, is given in detail with all the discordant and unsavory elements which went into its making .

		Passed by a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	really hostile to protection , in a kind of boisterously mad attempt to make a bill so extreme and farcical that it could be stomached by nobody , in its working out it proved unexpectedly satisfactory to most of the protected interests .

		According to Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	, its success was so great that a vast majority of the people were convinced that it was the chief agent in dispelling the clouds and permitting the sunshine of pros - perity to vivify the land -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 357 -RRB- .

		Yet he also holds that the acts of
1832	DATE	and
1833	DATE	were designed -LRB- and were necessary -RRB- to save the protective system from destruction .

		Clay 's position on the Compromise of
1833	DATE	is stoutly defended : '' Undoubtedly he saved his cause from a crushing and overwhelming defeat . ''

		Political sagacity required such a sacrifice . ''

		The system would surely have been swept away within a year or two if some of its adherents had not foreseen what was to hap - pen and taken security of the future '' -LRB- Vol .

		I. , pp. 385 , 402 , 410 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	is severe upon Secretary
Walker	PERSON	's Report , because of its advocacy of a larger importation of foreign goods .

		But it is Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	's own contention that '' a high tariff for purposes of protection is not levied necessarily with a view to causing a diminu - tion of imports , does not necessarily diminish them , and does not invariably fail of its pur - pose when it does not diminish them '' -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 252 -RRB- ; and he notes with evident satis - faction the steady increase in the importation of protected articles under the tariff of
1842	DATE	-- the protective tariff which immediately pre - ceded the Walker Report .

		He accounts for the fairly prosperous condition of the country under the Walker tariff by the great flow of gold from
California	LOCATION	.

		He holds that the Walker tariff -LRB- as well as the final stage of the Compromise tariff -RRB- practically ruined the woollen industry ; but evidently his usual cau - tiousness of statement has deserted him here .

		The setting forth of the course of tariff his - tory , by an analysis of how problems were stated and what arguments were used pro and con , shows to best advantage in early tariff history .

		Eighteen pages of text are devoted to a summary of the course of debate on the tariff of
1789	DATE	. ''

		In this summary , '' the author believes , '' will be found every expression con - tained in any record of the debates extant , which will assist in arriving at the truth . ''

		The summary is carefully done , yet it is doubtful if the clue to its meaning is furnished .

		For example , the dominating influence of Madison is not brought out ; and instead of making the debate itself dispose of Professor
Adams	PERSON	's hasty inference against the protective features of the act , Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	finds a labored argu - ment necessary .

		The tariff of
1816	DATE	was passed '' premature - ly . ''

		Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	has reference , of course , to the fact that , in operation , owing partly to conditions which could not have been foreseen , the act proved disappointing both from the revenue and the protective points of view .

		The distinction of this tariff , however , is that it is the one act in our tariff history in which all sections of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	joined in a sincere at - tempt to give adequate protection to American manufactures .

		The failure of this attempt marks the disappearance of the tariff as an economic question .

		Not that academic discus - sion ceased ; but between the years 1816-1828 was perfected that thorough organization of the protected interests through which their de - mands have been made and their battles fought out in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was during this period also that the sectional aspec -RRB- ; of the question became undisguised .

		As the economic aspect receded , tariffs and tariff legislation came to be more and more considered from the point of view of party politics .

		Yet the volume of discussion swells ever larger and larger , and is more and more given in extenso in Congressional records .

		Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	struggles bravely through these interminable discussions , finding little that is new , and occasionally with only strength enough left to count the pages .

		He gives an elaborate analysis and resume of the industrial conditions , depressions , and changes of the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	, claiming for the protective tariff an important role , but only as a steadying force enabling industry to come safely through very distressing times .

		* `` In view of what was taking place in the world dur - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, ing that period , one may fairly maintain that the im - portance of the tarifE was grossly exaggerated by the disputants on both sides .

		Although we were to concede without qualification the point contended for by the advocates of free trade , that the only effect of pro- tection upon the wage-earner was unmitigated evil , the results of the great industrial commotion that was going on were of such magnitude that the consequences of the tariff would be quite imperceptible .

		On the manu - facturer 's side , the same disturbances were causing him so much anxiety that the maintenance of the protective system merely saved him from one peril which might have been the fatal peril only because he was already so harassed on every side .

		The free-trader did not perceive , nor did the workingman , nor did the manu - facturer , that the lot of each was to be greatly ameli - orated by events which while they were in progress caused them all infinite discomfort , and which seemed to threaten every one of them with ruin '' -LRB- II. , 245 -RRB- .

		Out of that depression the country emerged into a remarkable era of expansion at home and conquest of the markets of the world .

		Some idea of the relative unimportance of tariffs , in this new industrial situation , is im - pressed upon all but the most blinded partisan of either side .

		The great desideratum in tariff-making is an understanding of the pre - cise part which may be assigned to such leg - islation among all the complex forces and sit - uations that go to bring about industrial supremacy , or whatever object the legislator may legitimately have in mind .

		To this end , it is necessary that mere party politics play as little part as possible .

		Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	has failed many times to point out how political tariffs have outraged a just sense of what is legitimate and proper , and his dramatization of tariff history does not bear out very strongly his own thesis .

		The temper in which he has written , however , is admirably calculated to help toward a better understanding of the problem and how it ought to be approached .

		In the task of getting this problem seriously before our lawmakers in its economico-national aspect , Mr.
Stanwood	PERSON	's work ought to prove extremely useful .

		* Of the progress in natural history study in this country , and of the thoroughly practical nature of our scientific work .

		glish only the scantiest literature , -- a single volume by
Berkeley	LOCATION	, and a list published here or there by some one of his pupils .

		To-day the cryptogamic flora of every
State	ORGANIZATION	is studied perhaps only less universally than the flower - ing plants , and certainly with equal accuracy and zeal .

		The Fungi , however , have come last to the attention of the general public .

		The reasons for this are many .

		In the first place , these forma of vegetation are often inconspicuous ; men do not notice their existence .

		In the second place ^ many of these plants are insignificant ; they seem to play a small part , or none , in the general economy of the world .

		A deeper reason than all this is perhaps to be found in the nature of the plants themselves : they are '' off color '' I While all other plants with which we are fami - liar bear in their coloring the evidence of vig - orous life , the Fungi , even in their most con - spicious types , are pale livid - looking things , suggestive of anything but life , -- nay , even associated with decay and death .

		Hence it is that , in this country at least , when men see a fungus , the first and only impulse is to kick it .

		to pieces .

		Nevertheless , in
Europe	LOCATION	, centuries ago , mei > somehow learned that some fungi are good to eat .

		It must have been in a time of un - common destitution that some poor emaciated starveling , bolder than his fellows , ventured ta sate his famine with mushrooms , and so saved his life to tell his secret unto others , -- imper - fectly no doubt , for with most men the rule haa run to eat the thing , and it will be proved ta be good if you live , poisonous if you die !

		Pro- fessor
Atkinson	PERSON	's book is intended to teach good Americans how to distinguish good fungi from bad by some rule less hazardous in appli - cation , even if withal less positive in its deci - sions .

		The great American public has indeed proceeded to classify the larger umbrella-like fungi into two divisions , toadstools and mush - rooms .

		On this proposition , mushrooms are good to eat , toadstools are not ; but the afore - said public can not even now distinguish save by the ancient rule , and any book that will help us in this particular will be welcome indeed .

		It is fashionable to eat mushrooms .

		Unfortunately , there is no short road to the knowledge that we seek .

		The volume before us , with its clear illustrations , vivid as light , can make them , is obvious evidence of the truth that to select edible from inedible forms , of mushrooms we must learn to know these things as we do others ; to distinguish one 19U4 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 from the other by details of form , color , hab - itat , habit , as we distinguish buckeyes from chestnuts , plums from persimmons , grapes from brambles , and figs from thistles .

		Such attain - ment will come to those only who have the pa - tience to study mushrooms in the field ; and to such study this book will be of the highest service .

		These pale or sometimes snow-white objects lend themselves well to photographic art , and with a little care almost any mushroom plant may be identified by simple comparison with its photograph shown on these pages .

		With the added description , identification ought to be at length absolute .

		For the more distinctly colored forms , colored plates of more or less accuracy are also offered .

		A surprising number of species is offered as `` edible . ''

		It is a matter of regret that the leading genus of white-spored agarics -LRB- a bet - ter general name than either mushrooms or toadstools -RRB- , the genus Amanita , should not be more decidedly condemned .

		The species are poisonous as a rule and the phrase `` edible , with great caution '' is ill-advised .

		The factor of safety would suggest that all such forms be put down as inedible .

		It is also a truism that many forms not poisonous are still inedible , simply because they are not good to eat .

		One of the commonest forms in our western fields , Lepiota morgani Pk. , here quoted as uncer - tain , is surely poisonous in the extreme .

		It may be known by its having the gills at length green , a character unique among agarics .

		To this second edition of a very valuable book are added chapters on the uses and cul - tivation of the real mushrooms , and some ten or twelve colored plates .

		The volume is a handsome one ; the paper is , however , of the highly calendered variety , a necessity to the printing of these abundant half-tones .

		Other anecdotes in his book are either familiar to the well-read or are novel only in the matter of scene and actors .

		This is not said in disparagement .

		The good story is a plant of so hardy and vigorous a constitution that it will take root and thrive in almost any soil .

		A witty word from
Oacar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is worth quoting .

		A tiresome poetaster , complaining that the critics seemed to have entered into a conspiracy of silence against him , asked
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	what he would advise him to do .

		`` Join it , '' was the reply .

		`` Sigma '' shows himself to be a loyal Harrovian , and as such an ardent ad - mirer of
Palmerston	LOCATION	, also a
Harrow	LOCATION	graduate .

		A tendency to depreciate
Gladstone	PERSON	results perhaps from this worship of ''
Pam	PERSON	. ''

		In art and poetry the author extols the pre-Raphaelites and glows with enthusiasm for
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the field of fiction he thinks
Thackeray	PERSON	has received rather more than his due of praise , he himself in - clining to rate Trollope above
Thackeray	PERSON	except in the latter 's very best work .

		A discussion of the authorship of the
Junius Letters	ORGANIZATION	betrays a lack of penetration .

		Basing his case on certain passages in Lady
Anne Hamilton	PERSON	's '' Secret History of the Court of
England	LOCATION	, '' our author makes what seems at first a plausible if not convincing argument in support of the Rev.
James Wilmot	PERSON	's authorship of the Letters .

		But he ignores the fact that Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	dieclaimed responsibility for the '' Secret History , '' which is now regarded as the work , wholly or in part , of Mrs.
Olivia	PERSON	-LRB-
Wilmot	PERSON	-RRB-
Serres	PERSON	, whose life was a series of notorious impostures , the chief of which was her masquerading as
Prin	PERSON	- cess Olive of
Cumberland	LOCATION	and niece of
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a word , the careful student of the Junius mystery will find little that is either new or true in this attempt to settle the vexed question .

		This , however , is merely by the way , and must not be allowed to prejudice the reader against a book that makes no claim to rigorous historical accuracy or to critical acumen .

		A treasury of EnglUh literature .

		With the publication of the third vol - ume , the new edition of `` Chambers 's Cyclopaedia of English Literature , ' * edited by Dr.
David Patrick	PERSON	, is now complete .

		The Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	are the American publishers of this work , and have copyrighted no less than fifty special articles among its contents , which should prove an effective protection against piracy .

		These special articles constitute the feature of chief inter - est in the present volume .

		There have been special articles in the other volumes , but not in so large a number , or with such actuality of interest .

		In the present case , almost every important nineteenth - century author has been entrusted to some specialist , who has written the essay and made the illustrative selections .

		Thus we find such noteworthy features as the treatment of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Scott by Professor
Ker	PERSON	, of Shelley by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, of
Byron	PERSON	and Borrow by Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	, of

		The American articles are mostly by Mr.

Woodberry	PERSON	, President
Schurman	PERSON	, and others .

		Be - sides all these , and many more of nearly equal 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, importance , there is an introductory esBay on '' The Renascence of Wonder in Poetry , '' by Mr.
Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	, a work of sach extraordinary grasp and insight as to be comparable only with that writer 's essay on '' Poetry '' in the '' Britannica . ''

		These two essays are alone sufficient to mark their author as the profoundest and best-equipped critic of poetry now living , and serve to deepen our regret that the greater part of his critical writing remains uncol - lected and inaccessible to the ordinary student .

		Now that this great work is complete , it is possible to form some estimate of it as a whole , and that estimate is highly to the credit of the editors , who have done their task with a thoroughness and a judicial poise that leave almost nothing to be de - sired .

		We may indeed congratulate ourselves that the same year has put us in possession of the two most important treasuries of English literature ever published -- the work now under consideration , and the recently-completed work of Drs.
Garnett	PERSON	and

		jg contained in the Rev.
Adolph Roeders	PERSON	`` Symbol Psychology '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , whose sub-title , ' * A New Interpretation of Race-Tradi - tions , '' is a more lucid statement of the book 's con - tents .

		Of the various explanations advanced by anthropologists to account for the origin of myth , the author selects one , -- the wish of the savage wherever found to account for the world he lives in , -- and one limited and sophisticated form of that ; namely , his attempt to symbolize in story the facts of his spiritual experience .

		Proceeding on this theory , which few readers will probably care to accept as a working hypothesis , since it neglects many elements of a complex situation , and attributes to the savage impulses that imply civilization , Mr.
Roeder	PERSON	chooses a cycle of familiar tales common to many races and attempts to explain them on purely symbolic lines .

		For example , there is the Twin Brother Story , whose characters appear variously as
Romulus	PERSON	and
Remus	PERSON	,
Baldur	PERSON	and Hodur , Castor and Pollux , Hengist and
Horsa	LOCATION	,
Cain	PERSON	and Abel .

		In this tale , according to our author , the race '' has either consciously or sub-consciously -LSB- but is not the whole question begged in the use of this word ? -RSB-

		faced a general problem , '' that of the duality of human experience ; and has sought to show that everywhere a constant struggle is going on be - tween two discordant elements -- heat and cold , light and darkness , rest and motion , body and spirit , good and evil .

		Again , the captive maiden , so common a figure in the folk-tale , is made to sym - bolize the latent possibilities of humanity , dormant but ready to spring into life at the opportune mo - ment .

		Mr.
Roeder	PERSON	's premise that myth is a stage in the evolution of religion will find few disputants to-day .

		But an hypothesis that assumes all myth to be essentially allegorical , and capable , further , of a specific spiritual interpretation , may be reduced to an absurdity quite as easily as that other favorite and over-burdened theory of the solar myth .

		The novelty of the present work consists in the partic - ular interpretations proposed for the folk-stories .

		These are sufficiently ingenious and suggestive to claim the attention of anthropologists and students of comparative religion , who have already had the opportunity of reading one chapter of the book , when it recently appeared as a separate essay in the periodical '' Mind . ''

Charles Whibley	PERSON	, on
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		The author of `` Pendennis '' has rarely been subjected to such searching , we might almost say scorching , analysis .

		The intrusion of the author '' gives certain passages in ' Vanity Fair ' a rakish , almost a battered , air . ''

		Half of `` The Newcomes '' is `` irrelevant . ''

		`` The Virginians '' is `` a thing of patches , not an organic whole . '' ''

		The Adventures of Philip '' is the mere repeated work of a fatigued writer .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	evidently has no illusions about
Thackeray	PERSON	, and is no hero-worshipper .

		Certainly his judgments are far enough from tallying with those of the public , -- else
Thackeray	PERSON	had long ago become as dusty a library classic as Lever , or
Peacock	LOCATION	, or Beacons - field .

		As it is , his works have gone through edition after edition ; bibliographers are still on the hunt for every scrap he ever wrote ; and he has taken his rightful place as one of the two greatest En - glish novelists of the nineteenth century .

		Why is this ?

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	has not succeeded in telling us .

		Is it because he is temperamentally unsuited to be the biographer of Thackeray ?

		It is doubt - less true that
Thackeray	PERSON	wrote many mediocre pieces ; and as he was a journalist , his practice - work , instead of reaching the oblivion of the waste - basket , found its way into print .

		But even his masterpieces seem not to have awakened much en - thusiasm in the breast of Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	; and faint praise too often gives a wrong impression .

		Of
Thackeray	PERSON	's large and deep human sympathy , which expressed itself in a thousand ways in his writ - ings and in his life , we find all too little said .

		The book has been carelessly printed -LRB- or written -RRB- : wit - ness p. 27 , `` it must e ` en have been composed , '' etc. ; p. 88 , `` for
Thackeray	PERSON	, although he might , and he chose , have studied , '' etc. ; p. 237 , '' neither
Dickens	PERSON	nor Bulwer ... give you a sense of liter - ary allusion . ''

		Thackeray 's verse , too , deserves more recognition than it receives here .

		Yet Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	is often right , and his book should not be neglected by students of
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 241 sions .

		This has been admirably accomplished in a volume of zo5logical essays entitled '' Mostly
Mam	ORGANIZATION	- mals '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor R. Ly - dekker .

		These essays have been collected from various scientific and popular English periodicals , and are issued in handsome book form with illus - trations .

		While the variety of subjects detracts from any connected treatment , there nevertheless runs through most of the essays a thread of discussion of the relation of mammals to their environment .

		The significance of the coloration of the larger mammals , of the spots on the giraffe and the stripes on the tiger , the causes of the light colors of the Arctic animals and the pale tints of the inhabitants of the desert , are discussed with a wide range of pertinent facts in the light of cur - rent theories .

		An excellent photograph of East African giraffes '' in covert '' affords a graphic illus - tration of the similarity of their coloration to the effect produced by the light and shade in low shrub - bery .

		Considerable attention is also given to the past history of mammals as revealed by fossil re - mains , and to the origin of domesticated races , -- for example , to the pedigree of the cat and the dog .

		The geographical distribution of existing mammals is incidentally treated in several essays that touch upon unique illustrations of the principles which have controlled this in the past , and instances are cited of the extinction of large animals within his - toric times and the causes of the destruction are related where they are known .

		The essays exhibit a wide range of learning and technical knowledge , and a keen appreciation of those phases of the science which are of popular interest and bear upon scientific problems of broad import .

		No living zoologist is better informed than the author , upon the subjects with which he is dealing ; the book is therefore both interesting and authoritative , and a model of high-grade natural history from the scien - tific rather than the literary or dramatic point of view which dominates so much of the recent litera - ture in this field .

George H. Palmer	PERSON	, of Har - eonductand

		^ ^ ^ philosophic study of conduct and the forces that serve to upbuild character .

		His recent volume on '' The Field of Ethics '' was an introduction to the study of conduct , defining the field and pointing out the moral problems that lie within its bounds .

		His later work on `` The Na - ture of Goodness '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- takes up and grap - ples with those problems themselves , establishing the real nature of goodness .

		The author 's method is that adopted in his popular philosophical lectures .

		He begins with the simplest form of the problem , and advances by easy but definite steps into the more complicated phases of the question .

		The good - ness of persons is sharply discriminated from the goodness of things .

		These differences , according to Professor
Palmer	PERSON	, are four , to each of which a special chapter is devoted .

		These four character - istics of persons are ability of self-consciousness , self-direction , self-development , and self-sacrifice .

		Each one of these chapters is a lucid , untechnical , entertaining , and very instructive exposition of ethical matters that should interest every student of self or of conduct in general .

		The last two chapters of the book are a gathering-up of the pre - ceding discussions , in such a manner as to crystal - lize the thought of the whole .

		The author 's lan - guage and method of procedure show him to be a master of the art of teaching and of leading the thinking of his auditors , and that in a way most helpful in the building up and establishing of character .

		It is always difficult to summarize Recent advances j.jjg general contributions of modern periods of development to the ad - vance of learning .

		The difficulty is that we are too near to estimate them in their proper perspec - tive , and occasionally too much out of sympathy with the older culture to appreciate the part it has played in making way for the new .

		In Psychol - ogy this is particularly true , -- so much so , that some have believed that the pathway of recent Psy - chology has been revolutionary rather than evolu - tionary .

		From an Italian source we have the most comprehensive of recent attempts to take the measure of modern Psychology .

		Professor Villa of
the University of Rome	ORGANIZATION	has put forward a volume which well merits the honor , now accorded it , of an English translation , `` Contemporary Psychology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The translation itself is adequate , and presents to English readers a variety of chap - ters of special interest to them .

		Students will differ much in their estimate of what should and should not be contained within such a survey .

		But Professor
Villa	PERSON	's arrangement of chapters , and his general presentation , although somewhat unsatis - factory and certainly diffuse , yet shows clearly some of the more important of recent advances in Psychology .

		The purposes which the book will best serve will be to introduce the general student and lay reader to the historical setting of the last century that forms the background to recent ad - vances in Psychology .

		For this limited but im - portant function , the manner and matter are both well suited .

		With the present general interest in all that relates to the labor question , the title of Mr.
George L. Bolen	PERSON	's latest work , `` Getting a Living '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is likely to attract popular attention .

		And it would seem , by the author 's simplicity of style and sparse - ness of technical terms , that he intended his book for the reading public as well as for economists .

		Those who read the work will receive not only a fair comprehension of '' the problem of wealth and poverty -- of profits , wages , and trades-unionism '' -LRB- as the sub-title runs -RRB- , but they will also get the point of view of a man of varied experience as an employee and employer in different parts of the The problem of personal livelihood .

		The critic might complain that the argu - ments against profit-sharing are weak , or he might take issue with the author 's opinions on some prob - lems involved in trades-unionism ; he would almost certainly consider Mr.
Bolen	PERSON	's treatment of social - ism vindictive rather than scholarly ; and he would find such a phrase as '' There is no wealth but life '' an anachronism in a book on economics .

		But at the same time he would have to concede that Mr.
Bolen	PERSON	, following in a measure the English classical school , has been unusually successful in his expo - sition of rent , wages , and profits .

		Showing himself conversant with the current opinions and relations of capitalists and labor leaders , Mr.
Bolen	PERSON	gives his readers a broad view of the present situation .

		He makes a splendid plea for self-dependence -LRB- aside from his attack on socialism -RRB- , concluding that '' to a large extent , nature has decreed that each tub must stand on its own bottom . ''

		The present in - dividualistic system of getting a living will survive , for '' no easier means than the present system im - proved can ever be expected , and that with no easier means could there be a continuance unimpaired of intelligence , morality , and liberty . ''

		The combina - tion of fair-mindedness and optimism , which char - acterizes the book , makes its moral tone high and invigorating .

		Certainly one would expect the history of
Parliamentary England	LOCATION	to go back to the time of
Edward I.	PERSON	, or at least to that of
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		; yet the author , in his interesting dis - cussion of the beginnings of the Cabinet System , regards the year
1705	DATE	as having far greater claims to be considered the exact date than any that pre - ceded it , and clearly regards the system as fully developed at the time of the passage of the Reform Bill in
1832	DATE	.

		It is no criticism of his work to say that it begins with an abruptness that would seem to indicate that it was a portion of a more extended political history of
England	LOCATION	.

		But whether correctly named or not , and whether or not the volume prop - erly belongs in a series which purports to present '' in story form the current of each nation 's life ... and its picturesque and noteworthy periods and episodes ... in their philosophical relation to each other as well as to universal history , '' this study of the development of the Cabinet System is a val - uable contribution to the history of English politics .

		These laws give us a very vivid picture of life in

		It is the earliest Code now known .

		The growth of legal practices is curiously shown , in that there are survivals of tribal law , family law , and divine law in a Code that is preeminently sanctioned by royal decree and carries out only the royal wishes .

		NOTES 270 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 272 THE ELECTI VE SC HOOL BOARD .

		The municipal election held this month in
Chicago	LOCATION	was comparatively unimportant as far as its character as an election proper was concerned , but was of great interest as an ex - pression of opinion upon certain questions of public policy that had been proposed to the voters .

		These questions mainly concerned the municipal ownership of the street railway sys - tem , and the result of the vote was a striking declaration in favor of the policy of public control .

		Unfortunately , an entirely different question -- that of the elective city board of education -- was proposed at the same time and under substantially the same auspices .

		The popular mandate on the subject of muni - cipal ownership thus carried with it , by force of attraction , a mandate in favor of an elective school board , very much as the party majority in a national election will usually carry with it a majority for the state and local candidates bearing the tag of the successful party .

		The vote upon the school question resulted approximately as follows : Of the total number of those who went to the polls , about one-fourth expressed no opinion at all upon this question ; the remaining three-fourths registered a vote of almost exactly two to one in favor of substi - tuting an elective for an appointive board of education .

		A majority for the policy was de - clared in every one of the city wards , although it is noticeable that the majority was only a small one in the wards that represent the more intelligent classes of citizenship , while it was largest in the wards that stand upon a lower plane in point of cultivation and political mor - ality .

		The vote on this question , moreover , had absolutely no legal force ; it was merely an expression of opinion -- of ill-considered opin - ion -- and an application of the principle of the initiative as permitted by the law of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		We say advisedly that the vote was an expression of ill-considered opinion , for the subject had not been brought under serious discussion , and the decision went largely by default .

		It was the result of a sort of subter - ranean agitation carried on for several years past by peculiarly unscrupulous methods , and supported by all the devices of the demagogue .

		The proposition was opposed by the reput - able newspaper press of the city , but in so perfunctory a way , and with so imperfect a realization of its dangers , that there is no won - der , considering all the circumstances , that it should have received so large a vote .

		Attrac - tion , as we have already said , operated largely in its favor , and a sensational appeal to selfish interests did the rest .

		Thoughtful deliberation coupled with knowledge of the situation really had little to do with the matter ; prejudice on the one hand and apathy on the other were the 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, determining influences as far as the majority of the votes were concerned .

		Still , in spite of all these allowances , and in spite of the fact that no other power than the
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	can act effectively upon the
Chicago	LOCATION	school system , the thing is ominous , and those who care for the interests of the schools as distinguished from the interests of those who And them the means of a living must bestir themselves to see that the move - ment goes no further than this expression of opinion , pious or the reverse .

		From this time on there must be a serious campaign of edu - cation upon the subject of education , lest Chi - cago some day awake to find its school system bound hand and foot and given over to the tender mercies of the politician .

		What that would mean we know , or may know if we will , from the example of many other American cities , of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, for instance , which oc - cupies a peculiarly bad eminence in this , as in other municipal matters .

		It has thus far been the pride of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools that they have not been a part of the political system of the municipality .

		They have in the past been touched by politics , no doubt , but the infection has never spread very far , and the last few years have witnessed a notable degree of suc - cess in the elimination of political influences from their management , and in the establish - ment of methods in which merit and the inter - ests of education alone prevail .

		Of all times in the world , the present is the one in which a radical change would be most wanton and ill-advised .

		We might fill columns with the mere enumeration of the things that have been done of late to promote efficiency , to raise standards , to discourage attempts at `` influence , '' and to give a healthful tone to the whole vast system .

		But it is no secret to those conversant with the situation that these salutary reforms have been the very main -
spring	DATE	of the agitation for a change that has at last so far achieved its purpose as to get the popular vote upon which we are now making comment .

		It is just because of these recent changes which have done so much to substitute desert for favor , and some measure of discrim - ination for the old wholesale methods of ap - pointment and promotion , that a considerable proportion of the teaching force has sought a way of escape from such irksome restraints , and has even resorted to an unholy alliance with the forces of labor unionism , thus endeav - oring to lower the noble profession of teaching to the level of a trade .

		The conditions now existing in the school system of
Chicago	LOCATION	are certainly such as to make a demand for elec - tive school authorities singularly ill-timed .

		It is a mistaken idea to suppose that democ - racy means the popular election of all officers who occupy important civic posts .

		What it really means is the election of as few officers as possible , and the concentration in their hands of the largest practicable powers of ap - pointment -LRB- subject to clearly-defined require - ments of fitness -RRB- , in order that the responsi - bility for wrong-doing may be distinctly lodged where it belongs .

		Even as things now are , voters throughout the country are called upon to elect far too many officers , too many , that is , for a general exercise of intelligent judg - ment .

		Every attempt to increase this burden ought to be firmly resisted on general princi - ples .

		Particularly should it be resisted in the case of school officers , whose qualifications are of an expert nature , and no more to be deter - mined intelligently by average opinion or by a show of hands than the qualifications of libra - rians or physicians or engineers .

		Let it be granted that the appointing power sometimes makes mistakes , or is actuated by unworthy motives , yet how much greater must be the danger of these things when election by pop - ular vote is substituted for appointment .

		The simple fact is that an elective school board in a large city would mean a board made up of members who had sought the office .

		Now office-seeking is never dignified and is not often legitimate ; the last man or woman who should be entrusted with the duties of a school board member is one who would be willing to put himself in the position of appealing to popular suffrage for the office .

		We all know the noisy , self-advertising class of persons whose names would be found upon the ballot in such a case , and we all know how next to impossible it would be for a city in that manner to secure the services of members of a really desirable type .

		This is entirely aside from the merely political danger , in itself serious enough , and however ingeniously guarded against by such devices as large dis - tricts , special elections , and nominations by peti - tion , sure to make its presence felt in some insid - ious fashion .

		If it be urged that the objections above made apply also to the appointive method , it may be admitted that they do in some meas - ure ; the question is one of degree rather than of kind , and the elective method seems to us to carry with it a far greater degree of danger .

		At all events , when the appointive system is

		IN RE SHAKESPEARE -
BACON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Some years ago there appeared in '' Literature '' a new and ingenious series of arguments which ought to have settled for all time the vexed question of the authorship of '' Shakespeare . ''

		But we still find people stiffly defending the
Stratford	LOCATION	poacher 's most absurd and baseless claims .

		Now I have a valuable addition to make to the line of proof adopted by Mr.
Bucke	PERSON	-LRB- I think that was the writer 's name -RRB- , and I am convinced that the evidence I have to adduce will prove a clincher and will shut the mouths of all Shakespearians so tight that not another peep will ever be heard from them .

		Knowing that
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	is widely circulated among intelligent and fair-minded readers , I have selected it as the most fitting medium for publishing this epoch - making discovery of mine .

		Mr.
Bucke	PERSON	calls attention to the fact that almost every great author is commonly associated with the chief character he has created .

		Thus we link together
Cervantes	PERSON	and
Don Quixote	PERSON	, Le Sage and
Gil Bias	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	and
David Copperfield	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	and
Maggie TuUiver	PERSON	.

		Each of these characters stands in a measure for its author , representing him or his ideas with some degree of fidelity .

		What , now , is the chief , the best-known character in the so-called
Shakespear	PERSON	- ian dramas ?

		Hamlet , to be sure ; and in the name lurks a very clever crypto-pun , -- Ham -LSB- i. e. ,
Bacon	PERSON	-RSB- let -LSB- or hindered from openly declaring his identity -RSB- So far , Mr.
Bucke	PERSON	.

		But let us go a step further .

		What is Hamlet 's most famous speech ?

		The immortal Solil - oquy .

		And the most familiar line therein ?

		The first .

		Let us examine this line . ''

		Be '' is phonetic for the second letter of the alphabet , and the line thus becomes '' To B -LSB- acou -RSB- or not to B -LSB- acon are these plays to be ascribed -RSB- , that is the question . ''

		And how is the ques - tion decided ?

		In the affirmative , of course .

		The so - liloquist determines against self-annihilation .

		The Baconian authorship is thus established .

		Note the foresight here displayed .

		With that prescience which belonged to the universality of his genius , Lord
Bacon	PERSON	foresaw that this Soliloquy would be on every school - boy 's tongue , and that its first line especially would be a household word .

		Hence the first line was chosen as the repository of his secret , the key and answer fol - lowing in the body of the speech .

		Could anything be plainer ?

		How easy it is to stand an egg on end as soon as you know how !

		If after this anyone has the hardihood to question
Bacon	PERSON	's authorship of the so-called Shakespearian plays and poems , he must expect a speedy invitation to '' go way back and sit down '' with the believers in a flat world and a Ptolemaic astronomy .

		A
Great University President	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Dr.
William Pepper	PERSON	's name is widely known as that of a man of prodigious energy and achieve - ment , not only in education and in the practice of medicine , but also in the promotion of count - less good causes having chiefly to do with his city and state .

		In his short life of fifty-four years he reorganized and recreated the Univer - sity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, founded the
University Hospital	ORGANIZATION	and various museums , as well as the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Free Library , and effected the improvement of the city 's water supply and a complete change in the local sentiment toward education and the higher ideals .

		In the course of this work he raised more than
ten million dollars	MONEY	and secured about one hundred acres of land from the city , adding the personal gift of almost half
a million dollars	MONEY	earned by him in the practice of an exacting profession .

		His most important achievements were those connected with the university that gave him both his academic and his professional educa - tion .

		In
1868	DATE	, at the age of twenty-five , he began his lectures in the medical school , and continued them for thirty years .

		Succeeding Provost Stille as head of the
University	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	, he at once set about raising the institu - tion from its comparative insignificance to a position of national importance , at the same time striving , not without success , to co-ordi - nate with it the educational systems of the city and state .

		He found the
University	ORGANIZATION	a respect - able school ; he left it a real university .

		Seven - teen new departments were created by him , more than a score of costly buildings erected , the faculty was increased from ninety to near three hundred members , and the student body more than tripled .

		He raised
four million dollars	MONEY	for endowment and other purposes , and added more than forty acres to the campus .

		All this , be it noted , was effected in a com - munity whose slowness and conservatism have passed into a proverb , and whose municipal corruption has of late attained unenviable noto - riety .

		Mr.
Francis Newton Thorpe	PERSON	is well quali - fied to tell the story of this life of bewilder - ingly varied activity , having himself been connected with the

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, pears , intimate with its head during the last thirteen years of the latter 's life .

		The prepa - ration , too , of an earlier work involving re - search in much the same field -- the painstak - ing account of ''
Franklin	PERSON	and the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	'' -- has made easier for him this presentation of a '' second Franklin '' and his relations to the same institution of learning .

		Something of the charm of Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	's per - sonality seems to have found its way into the pages of his biography , which is a book to attract the reader , despite its 555 large octavo pages .

		But we will not send it to the barber 's with Polonius 's beard ; only let it be permitted the reviewer to regret that its topical arrange - ment has entailed a number of overlappings and repetitions , thus increasing its length in a manner that tends to try the reader 's patience .

		The first intimation to the world at large of Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	's marked ability was at the time of the
Centennial Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		He discharged with noted success the difficult duties of Medical Director , receiving , among other tokens of foreign recognition , an appoint - ment as Knight Commander of the Order of
St. Olaf	ORGANIZATION	from the
King of Norway	LOCATION	and Swe - den .

		The executive capacity then displayed by him , when but little over thirty years of age , together with his fruitful exertions for improving the medical school of the Univer - sity , paved the way to his election as Provost in
1881	DATE	, after the office had been refused by
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	and Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		To his wonderful ability as a college president the present splendid equipment of the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is an impressive mon - ument .

		Where only four unimposing build - ings stood in
1881	DATE	may now be seen more than twenty handsome and well-appointed struc - tures .

		In thirteen years he increased the Uni - versity 's wealth from
$ 1,600,000	MONEY	to more than
$ 5,000,000	MONEY	.

		Of his fame as a medical lecturer and clinical demonstrator the record of his addresses in all parts of the country and the testimony of his pupils furnish abundant proof .

		As a medical writer Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	stood in the front rank .

		Besides founding the '' Med - ical Times , '' he edited , with Dr.
John F. Meigs	PERSON	, the well-known and authoritative '' System of Medicine by American Authors , '' and pub - lished numerous articles and pamphlets , the fruit of his wide experience as a practising physician .

		The `` Text - Book of Medicine by American Teachers '' was also largely his work .

		But as new authorities are daily supplanting the old in medical literature , so that ten years is a long life for a medical treatise , his enduring monument will be , not his writings , but his creations in stone and brick , and what they stand for .

		It will also be long before the pro- fession forgets his conspicuously successful and brilliant presidency of the Pan-American Med - ical
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, and the ovation given to him by a similar assembly at
Mexico	LOCATION
three years later	DATE	.

		The happy combination of Anglo-Saxon vigor with the ease and suavity of the Latin-American , as well as his fluency in a language -LRB- the French -RRB- better known to them than English , won for him an extra - ordinary popularity with our southern neigh - bors .

		To fill out still further this imperfect sketch of the man , let us quote a few passages , either descriptive of him as seen by Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	, or embodying in his own words ideas and opin - ions characteristic of his life and work .

		Of his appearance in the consulting room his biographer says : '' In his treatment of the sick it was his study to get on the side of nature .

		He trusted much to rest and regimen , and , primarily , to getting the mind of the patient in a normal frame .

		He was by nature a psychol - ogist and his powers of diagnosis were of the highest order .

		These powers he applied in other interests than his medical practice .

		Each of the innumerable civic and educational problems which came before him was met as he met the critical medical cases which were pre - sented to him for diagnosis .

		His reasoning faculties were wonderfully strong , active , and accurate ... He seized on causes and effects readily and with almost unerring precision , and his mental processes were phe - nomenally rapid .

		With these powers he exercised an inspiring sympathy which quickly won confidence .

		A patient felt safe under his care . ''

		Combining the best features of conservatism and progressiveness , he was among the first to advocate the elective system in college educa - tion ; but his electives were to be in carefully planned groups rather than offered singly , thus having strict regard to the general bent , not to the idle whims , of the immature student .

		Note - worthy , too , is his high estimate of the classics as a part of the curriculum .

		Himself a man of science and of affairs , he yet felt moved thus to uphold the claims of Greek and Latin in an address before the Modern Language Asso - ciation : '' We have nothing to do with the question of the necessity of the classics in any and every system of ed - ucation worthy of the name .

		We assume that to be conceded beyond discussion .

		Could
Milton	PERSON	have written ` Paradise Lost ' or the ` Elegy on Lycidas , ' or
Burke	PERSON	his oration against
Hastings	PERSON	, Landor his Dialogues , without a profound study of the classics ?

		Could Corneille or
Racine	LOCATION	, or Goethe or
Lessing	PERSON	, or Dante
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 have produced their immortal works without such study ?

		What boots such questioning ?

		May the day never come when the glorious languages of Homer , of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, of Sophocles , and of
Cicero	LOCATION	, of
Virgil	LOCATION	, of Horace shall not be recognized as the very keystone of the highest and most inspiring education which can be imparted . ''

		This , of course , is better in fervid oration than in cold print ; but the attitude behind it all is significant .

		The notes drawn from Dr. Pep - per 's diary are illuminative to the student of his character .

		His definition of genius makes it to be '' the power of sustaining concentrated attention in a rare degree . ''

		Of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, just after his lecture in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the diary records : '' Vigorous and well preserved -- bad enunciation -- terrible pronunciation of some words , as • girls , geerU ' -- quiet , clear , caustic , appreciative ... `` Took breakfast with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; one would naturally think , `` What a good fellow , with frank and easy manners -- a strong , fine figure -- and a strong face ' ; but he mouths his words and talks with pro- truded lips and indistinct utterance when addressing an audience of any considerable size , altogether the result of defective elocution .

		Voice sufficiently pleas - ant in ordinary conversation , and with force enough to be heard clear enough in any hall if properly managed .

		How often we notice this in English literary men , even their public men , whose education and pursuits have led you to expect better things in the way of public speaking . ''

		Civic reform , Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	held , was to be sought through educational methods rather than in ward politics .

		Whether just or unjust , this is his opinion of the Municipal League : '' Their purpose seems to be the old business of put - ting up special candidates for special little offices , spending a lot of money , and getting licked like thun - der .

		That is what has kept me off from all these reform movements ; that , instead of earnest educational work , such as the
Civic Club	ORGANIZATION	is doing , and
Brinley	PERSON	is doing for
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, they go into ward politics . ''

		A paragraph of Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	's will give some conception of the crushing press of engage - ments always weighing upon Dr. Pepper . ''

		On one occasion , at a theatre-party which he was giving , after some fifteen minutes , he excused himself , and was gone three-quarters of an hour .

		Remaining a short time , he excused himself again , and was gone nearly as long .

		He then returned for a moment , and excused himself a third time .

		He had appeared at three functions , at two of which he had made formal addresses ; the third disappearance was for a consulta - tion .

		While under great pressure of work he occa - sionally worked thirty-six or even forty-eight hours without interruption except for a bite of food . ''

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, in presenting Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	's portrait to the American
Philo	PERSON	- sophical Society in behalf of the contributing members , paid him a tribute well worth quot - ing .

		He said , in part : ' `` It is pleasant to hope that during his lifetime Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	was at least faintly conscious that his influence for good was thus wide-spread , and that among his fel - low-citizens he had become the representative of great educational and civic movements ... This is not an occasion for eulogy , nor have I any capacity for analyz - ing character -LRB- who can analyze his own ? -RRB-

		, but by one noteworthy element in Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	's temperament I was always impressed , and this is a sense of proportion .

		He had the faculty of differentiating values .

		He was never astray among the important and the unimportant .

		His perspective was always true ... Ambition is pro- verbially selfish , and that he was ambitious we all know .

		But herein was almost his crowning quality .

		His ambi - tion was never for himself ... Rarely shall we find the man more thoroughly , utterly unselfish than he .

		To the reflex effect upon himself or his fortunes of any course which he deemed of moment , I think he gave never a single thought .

		That a man of as forceful a character should meet with opposition and even detrac - tion is inevitable .

		But we have solemn words of warn - ing ringing in our ears : * Woe unto you when all men speak well of you I ' Therein is found our consolation and his ever-present balm . ''

		What wore this man out so early was work .

		Never at ease unless pushing on half a dozen gigantic enterprises at once , he neglected to cultivate the art of enjoying leisure .

		One note in his diary describes him as working seventy-two hours without sufficient intermis - sion to go to bed .

		In
1894	DATE	he resigned the presidency of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, but the easing of one burden only led to the assumption of others hardly less heavy .

		He knew , as a wise physi - cian , the penalty he was incurring for his in - discretion ; but he declared if his life were to live over again he would follow the same course .

		Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	tells his story in a way to arrest and hold the attention .

		A little more con - ciseness , however , a more successful avoidance of repetitious , might have been attained .

		A few lapses , too , from good English might have been corrected . ''

		Accrue '' he uses in the passive voice ; '' less '' occurs for '' fewer '' , and even as early as the third page of the Preface a jarring note is encountered in the very easily avoidable misuse of '' would '' for '' should . ''

		But only hypercriticism can refuse to the author hearty thanks for his handsome accomplishment of a difficult task .

		In follow - ing Dr.
Pepper	PERSON	's varied career , he had to narrate the life , not of one man , but of many men under one name .

		For producing so clear a portrait of this Protean individuality he de - serves high praise .

April 16	DATE	, Problems of the Home .

		* It is impossible to read the books of Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman	PERSON	without realizing that their author is deeply , sometimes passion - ately , in earnest .

		One can not fail to see , likewise , that most of her radical views will gain but slow headway , for the present at least , even among women themselves , to whom chiefly her writings and speeches are addressed .

		Her work on `` The Home , Its Work and Influ - ence '' is a further development of ideas ex - pressed in `` Women and Economics , '' pub - lished a few years ago , and emphasizing the essential social equality of man and woman .

		Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	's ideals are high , as will be seen by the following extracts from her Introduction : '' The home should offer to the individual rest , peace , quiet , comfort , health , and that degree of personal expression requisite ; and these conditions should be maintained by the best methods of the time ... We are here to perform our best service to society , and to find our best individual growth and expression ; a right home is essential to both these uses . ''

		She makes a plea for homes that shall pro- vide greater scope for individuality , greater privacy for each and every inmate , and a reduction of expense for those who must main - tain them .

		She finds the two greatest errors to be `` the maintenance of primitive industries in a modern industrial community , and the confinement of women to those industries and their limited area of expression . ''

		In the chapter called `` Domestic Mythol - ogy '' the author protests against the reverence for the old merely because it is old , -- the blind following in the footsteps of our fore - bears ; against the indiscriminate '' mother - worship , '' which makes us assume that because a woman is a mother , she must know the best way to care for and bring up children , as well as the best way to maintain the home in peace and comfort ; and against the fetich of the '' feminine touch , '' which is popularly sup - posed to beautify everything on which it is laid .

		As the ordinary home is at present maintained , the time of the over-burdened house - wife is consumed in cooking , cleaning , and sewing ; what time , Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	asks , has she for child-culture and self-culture ?

		On the other hand , in the home of the well-to-do the work of the home is done by '' ignorant and inferior young women , under conditions of con - stant change . ' ''

		Cooking and child-tending are here left to lower grades of labor , whereas , for ♦ The Home .

		the good of the race they should be raised to the rank of professions .

		Domestic life like - wise suffers from domestic seclusion .

		In fact , Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	believes that most if not all of the industries now performed in the home could be better and more cheaply performed outside of it by professional workers ; that organization should have its place in home life as in business life ; that the results of modern ingenuity should not be confined to hotels and other public places , but should be used to release the housewife from the burdens that keep her down .

		Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	believes that the homes of to-day , with rare exceptions , foster selfishness , cowardice , untruth , injustice , self-conscious - ness ; that woman is undeveloped physically , mentally , and morally , and over-developed on the feminine side .

		She says : `` If the woman was fully developed on the human side , she would cease to be over-developed on the fem - inine side .

		If she had her fair share of world - life , she would expect of her husband that he be a satisfactory man , but not that he be a satisfactory world , which is quite beyond him . ''

		Hospitality , as at present practised , is abused ; it should mean the entertaining of one 's inti - mate friends in the home , while there should be public rooms for larger gatherings .

		Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	's idea , when carried to its conclusion , is that when the woman is freed from the restrictions of house-keeping and child-rearing , and able to direct her energies into the lines of work for which she is best fitted , likewise relieving the husband of part of his too-heavy burden , she and the man will become not only better husbands and wives , fathers and moth - ers , but also better citizens , enlarging their social activities , widening the range of their interests , and performing their functions as in - dividuals , as home-makers , and as part of the social whole , more nearly as civilization in the present age demands .

		It is undoubtedly true that two tendencies have been strongly felt in recent years , -- one an earnest effort toward some solution of the `` servant problem , '' chiefly felt in the estab - lishment of training-schools for servants and their mistresses ; the other , the increasingly large number of married women who enter business life .

		Nevertheless , this number is not yet large as proportioned to the women who really prefer home-life , nor can it ever be so long as women are mothers .

		During the child-bearing period , no woman is free to enter upon a continuous business life ; nor could she
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 do so successfully if she would .

		This will always be the strongest argument against Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	's theories .

		It is true that she does show forth some of the causes of failure in the home , and suggests many needed reforms .

		But doubts will exist as to the wisdom of her methods of cure .

		The world is not yet ready for changes so radical as some of those that she suggests .

		Much can be done in the way of improved sanitation , and in a division of industries that will relieve the servant-problem of some of its worst bugbears ; home-makers and mothers can and should receive a training that will make them wiser and more skilful .

		But whatever may be the reason , a majority of the women of to-day would not accept a life that would take them for the greater part of the time outside the home .

		Moreover , with - out a violent readjustment of conditions in the business world , it would not be possible for them all to find positions ; and without special training , which only the few are able to enjoy , they could not enter professional life .

		While not always coherent , and occasion - ally showing signs of careless or hasty con - struction , this book is worthy of sober consid - eration .

		It is the result of earnest conviction , it shows in an extreme form certain tendencies of the day , and it offers some suggestions that may well receive attention from thoughtful students of large social problems .

		It abounds in statistics of square miles of territory , bushels of products , and millions of population .

		In this respect , it is a compendium of information rather than an attraction for the general reader .

		It is really a study of the admission of the sev - eral states into the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, together with a sketch of the territorial addition from which they were created .

		A preliminary chapter de - scribes the colonization and development of the original domain , and two appended chapters give a statistical sketch of our foreign possessions .

		As connecting links , a geueral commentary on the leading events of American history runs through the book .

		A vast amount of informa - tion is afforded on the public land system , the development of industries , and comparisons with other peoples .

		Presumably , the statistics are correct .

		But in the commentary on the course of affairs a number of errors have crept in .

		The title of `` United States of
America	LOCATION	'' does not date from
July 4	DATE	, although that makes a pleasing statement , but from special action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on
September 9 , 1776	DATE	.


Congress	ORGANIZATION	did not authorize
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	-LRB- not
Clarke	PERSON	-RRB- to make the expedition into the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, but
Virginia	LOCATION	, under Governor
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, took that initiative .

		Vergennes is charged with pro- posing that the Americans be deprived of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	in the peace of
1783	DATE	.

		Jay , the negotiator , says that
Vergennes	LOCATION	was '' very cool and reserved '' toward
Aranda	PERSON	's suggestion , and there is no evidence that
Rayneval	ORGANIZATION	's pro- posed division was presented to him .

		Doniol makes this clear , and frees
Vergennes	LOCATION	, if not the court of
France	LOCATION	generally , from the charge of opposing the American title .


Spain	LOCATION	aban - doned her claim to
West Florida	LOCATION	in
1795	DATE	, not
1798	DATE	.

		The classic names proposed by
Jeffer	PERSON	- son for the states of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	do not ap - pear in the Ordinance of
1784	DATE	, as the context of their description makes it seem .

		The
Ohia Company of Associators	ORGANIZATION	was formed some time preceding the purchase of land and passage of the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	, instead of after that time .

		It is evident in advance that any volume on explorations of the Rocky Mountain region must be taken up largely with the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition , since materials for it are most abundant .

		Considering the length of the jour - ney , its timeliness , and its results , one may easily pronounce it the most important under - taking of the kind in American history .

		Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, in his `` Brief History of Rocky Moun - 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, tain Exploration , '' has given it a mention in his subtitle as being the exploration jyar excel - lence .

		From
Balboa	ORGANIZATION	's crossing of the Isthmus of
Darien	LOCATION	to the construction of the
Pacific	LOCATION	railways is the space covered in the volume .

		Cook , Qua - dra ,
Verendrye	LOCATION	, and Captain Gray find places in the earlier chapters , and Long , and
Pike	PERSON	, and Fiemont in the later portions , with
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	making , however , the bulk of the book .

		The work is in Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's well-known style , and pleasantly calls attention to one as - pect of the conquest of the continent .

		The need of a condensed sketch of the
Lou	LOCATION	- isiana Purchase has been well supplied by Mr.
Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	, whose little book on that subject falls into four parts , Discovery and Ac - quisition , the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	exploration , the other discoveries , and the Industrial Develop - ment of the region .

		As in the volume by Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, a large share of space -- nearly a hundred pages -- is given to
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	; while thirty pages suffice to cover the negotia - tions , the transfer , and all constitutional ques - tions involved .

		The most novel feature in the outline is to be found in the rather picturesque treatment of the development of the Purchase , due to the author 's connection with a series bearing on various phases of Western life .


Edwin E. Sparks	PERSON	.

		A SOITTHERNER 'S IjIFB OF
JEFFERSON	LOCATION	.

		* Of making books on
Jefferson	PERSON	there is no end ; and Mr.
Thomas E. Watson	PERSON	presents us with the latest addition to the collection .

		He appropriately entitles his contribution `` The Life and Times of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	'' ; for he has treated that statesman 's times quite as fully as he has his life .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's portrait of
Jefferson	PERSON	does not differ greatly from the one commonly accepted ; though drawn in fuller detail , it gives essentially the same familiar personality .

		The acceptability of the book will be found largely in the pictures presented of
Jefferson	PERSON	's times , and of the work and accom - plishments of his great conteimporaries .

		The style of the book is sketchy .

		Its fifty-one chap - ters are so many outlines of episodes of the era in which its principal subject lived , many of them connected with him only by the coinci - dence in dates ; a group of parti-colored beads , strung upon the thread of one political career .

Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Not that the incidents sketched are foreign to the main subject , for they are the transactions in which
Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	would have been profoundly interested , even though he had not participated in them ; but they do not profess to furnish either a complete biography of the man or a history of his time .

		The reader will enjoy the sympathetic portraiture of the character of
Washington	LOCATION	, and be entertained by the lively description of the strenuous activities of John
Paul Jones	PERSON	,
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, and others of
Jefferson	PERSON	's contemporaries ; but he will not easily be led to suppose Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's para - graphs to constitute serious history or biog - raphy .

		With all his evident historical tastes , and his fondness for historical research , the author does not exhibit the judicial tempera - ment necessary to the historian .

		Indeed , he is too much of a critical controversialist to suc - ceed in writing history .

		The frequency and ardor with which he controverts the conclusions and the deductions of other writers indicate a part of his mission to be to confound the mighty .

		His pages redound with sarcastic ref - erences to the errors of which he convicts Messrs.
W. E. Curtis	PERSON	,
S. G. Fisher	PERSON	,
H. C. Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, and other writers .

		An excerpt from a passage complaining that American history has been too much devoted to
New England	LOCATION	and its inhabitants will illus - trate the critical spirit and methods of the book . '

		• Entirely too much has been made of trivial
New England	LOCATION	incidents and of third-rate
New England	LOCATION	in - dividuals .

		Too many
New England	LOCATION	mole - hills have been magnified into historical mountains .

		Even
Henry Cabot Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, though he made a manful attempt , could not cut himself loose from the swollen body of dead tradition .

		As to
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's book , -- well , we will change the subject . ''

		Even though Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's readers might sometimes concur in his criticisms , they will usually prefer to find such complaints in an - other setting .

		This form of controversy is such a favorite with Mr.
Watson	PERSON	as to suggest the doubt whether he is himself a safe guide in historical exegesis .

		One is scarcely sur - prised to find him , in his zeal for the just fame of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, saying of the
Virginia	LOCATION	statesman 's draft of his famous `` Ordinance , '' that `` It was in this celebrated Ordinance of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	- ern Territory that the first suggestion of a plan for the admission of future states ap - peared '' ; the fact being that
Maryland	LOCATION	had , as early as
October , 1776	DATE	, advanced this prop - osition as a part of the destiny of that
Terri	ORGANIZATION	- tory , and that her delegates had introduced it
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		263 into the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
October , 1777	DATE	, before the Articles of Confederation had taken final shape .

		So , also , historical study has given place to partisan theory , when Mr.
Watson	PERSON	character - izes the non-importation agreement of the col - onists as follows : '' In fact , the attitude taken by
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	,
Henry	PERSON	,
Adams	PERSON	,
Sherman	PERSON	,
Jay	PERSON	,
Dickinson	PERSON	, and
Rutledge	PERSON	was substantially that of a labor-union of the present day during a struggle with a capitalistic trust .

		Those Americans who would not join the association and boy - cott
Great Britain	LOCATION	were ` enemies to the liberties of their country , ' and were themselves to be boycotted . ''

		This comparison belittles those Fathers of the Republic , and becomes possible only by ig - noring the legal and constitutional principles which were the bed-rock of the non-importation agreement and of all the contentions of the American colonists , nothing similar to which distinguishes the modern struggles between labor and capital .

		In like manner , the author is apparently seeking to sustain a preconceived theory when he argues : `` The Mecklenburg Resolutions were in effect the first of American declarations of Independence .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	soon followed .

		Then came the town-meetings of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Then
Virginia	LOCATION	,
May 6th	DATE	, closely followed , having no idea that any other colony had al - ready shaken off the burden of allegiance to
Great Britain	LOCATION	. '' ''

		After
the Declaration of Independence	ORGANIZATION	, and its rati - fication by each
State	ORGANIZATION	, each one of the thirteen col - onies most certainly considered itself a sovereign State .

		The only bond of
Union	ORGANIZATION	was a common cause and a common danger .

		Their delegations to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	did not bind them to a confederation any more than their Committees of Correspondence had done . ''

		The idea that there were many declarations of independence by which the thirteen colonies severally revolted against
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the theories advanced by Mr.
Watson	PERSON	to sus - tain this idea , run counter to many of the facts of our history , not the least impressive of which are these : that
North Carolina	LOCATION	on
April 12	DATE	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	on
May 4	DATE	,
Virginia	LOCATION	on
May 6	DATE	, and five other colonies at later dates down to
June 28 , 1776	DATE	, expressly instructed their dele - gates to join in one Declaration of Indepen - dence and in forming a confederation for ex - ternal purposes , while reserving to the people of each colony local self-government for inter - nal purposes ; that the language of these sev - eral instructions is so similar as to indicate a common purpose pervading the colonists ; that no action inconsistent with this was taken by any colony ; and that two other colonies ,
New York	LOCATION	and
South Carolina	LOCATION	, had previously re - solved that they would leave the momentous question of Independence to be determined by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was this action of
Virginia	LOCATION	on
May 6 , 1776	DATE	, which Mr.
Watson	PERSON	seeks to interpret as a separate revolt by that colony .

		In these and other instances are manifested the peculiar political views of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, which , however , do not debar him from writ - ing a sprightly and entertaining book .

		In his chapter on `` The Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' the experiences of
Jefferson	PERSON	as governor are con - spicuously overlooked , while the troubles of the `` times '' are vividly portrayed ; but there is compensation for this omission as to the per - sonal
Jefferson	PERSON	in the minute account that comes later of his interesting experiences in
France	LOCATION	.

		A responsive chord in the hearts of students will be aroused by the author 's fervid appeal for a reprint of
Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	's valuable '' Notes on
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		^ 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	ter is a list of questioDs bearing on the text bat not covered by it , designed to stimulate independent thought among the students .

		Each chapter also contains a bibliography , well adapted for class use , of the materials used .

		The general bibliography at the beginning of the book is by no means as judi - ciously selected , works of great value by such men as
Preyer	PERSON	,
Baldwin	PERSON	, Sully , and Compayrd being men - tioned by the side of
Wiggin	PERSON	's '' Children 's Rights '' and Du
Bois	PERSON	's '' Beckoning of Little Hands . ''

		This , however , is a matter of small importance .

		Consid - ering the difficulties of the subject .

		Professor
Kirk	PERSON	- patrick 's book must be pronounced a success of the first order .

		The author 's thorough knowledge of psychology has protected him from crude general - izations ; his sense of proportion is good ; the ma - terial is well digested , and the practical suggestions that he ventures upon from time to time are useful .

		The book is well adapted to the serious lay reader , and at tbe same time is valuable to the student .

		Prof.
Irving King	PERSON	's '' The Psychology of Child Development '' covers the same ground as the work just spoken of , though from an entirely different standpoint ; the aim in this case being not so much the organization of facts as the interpretation of the more fundamental phenomena .

		Professor
King	PERSON	has a thesis to defend , which in brief is this : A great mistake has been made by
Preyer	PERSON	and others in studying the mental life of children ; this mistake consists in employing the mental processes or facul - ties of the adult as instruments in measuring and describing the child 's intelligence .

		The true method is functional , it regards the child 's experience as a unity and describes it as such instead of trying to discover the rudimentary beginnings of adult men - tal processes to single acts .

		In his application of this view to infancy and early childhood .

		Professor
King	PERSON	has been successful in making the child 's ac - tivity seem more intelligible than in the writings of any previous thinker .

		His thesis leads him to mag - nify the difference between the child and the adult mind , and to somewhat exaggerate the difficulties in the way of understanding children 's ideas after the first three or four years .

		As a running com - mentary on the methods generally in use , this book will perform good service , its function being dis - tinctly critical .

		No recent educational book gives more evidence of painstaking thought , of the care - ful consideration of a subject from a single point of view .

		It is an important contribution to the litera - ture of the subject .

		There is a fairly representative but by no means complete bibliography in the ap - pendix .

		The third volume of the present group , that by Dr.
E. L. Thorndike	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	on ' < Educational Psychology , '' also discusses method in child study .

		It is a plea for more rigorously scientific standards and methods than those that have hitherto been largely employed .

		The volume consists of a sum - mary and criticism of all the studies which the author considers sufficiently accurate to be of value .

		The territory covered is indicated by the following list of topics : the measurement of mental traits , the distribution of mental traits , the relationship be - tween mental traits , original and acquired traits , mental inheritance , the influence of environment , the influence of special training upon general abili - ties , the influence of selection , the development of mental traits with age , sex difference , exceptional children , the relationship of mental and physical traits , and broader studies of human nature .

		The last chapter treats of the questionnaire method of investigation , which Dr.
Thorndike	PERSON	condemns , care - fully pointing out the abuses to which it is liable .

		There can be little question that this criticism is greatly needed ; still if we are to throw out all data that can not be tested by the methods of the exact sciences , progress is likely to be slow in all of the social disciplines for some time to come .

		Several sections of Professor
Kirkpatrick	PERSON	's book show that in the hands of a thinker who knows and makes allowance for the limitations of the questionnaire and similar methods , results of significance can be achieved .

		The latest book of Prof.
M. V. O'Shea	PERSON	treats of the philosophy of education , and is entitled < ' Edu - cation as Adjustment . ''

		It attempts to define edu - cation from the standpoint of evolutionary philoso - phy , and to show the futility of all educational theory founded on purely logical or metaphysical considerations .

		The first three chapters contain the discussion of education as a science ; after which Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	treats at some length the mean - ing and aim of education .

		The last and longest section of the book , `` the method of attaining ad - justment , '' is a treatise on the psychology of the learning process .

		In the first two divisions of the work the author is laboring under the obvious dis - advantage of possessing only a second-hand knowl - edge of biology and philosophy .

		He has indus - triously collected a large mass of material , but it is poorly classified and the interpretation is me - chanically forced .

		The statements are inexact , and many minor sections have no logical bearing on the main argument .

		Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	's equipment for the work may be judged from the following quota - tions : '' Direct observations and statistical investi - gations are made with something of the exactness and completeness of detail in the field of mental development by such persons as
Preyer	PERSON	,
Hall	PERSON	,
Shinn	PERSON	,
Baldwin	PERSON	, and others that were attained by
Darwin	PERSON	in the field of biology or
Newton	LOCATION	in physics or Gal - ileo in astronomy '' -LRB- p. 42 -RRB- .

		Locke devised '' innate faculties and other things '' -LRB- p. 49 -RRB- .

		The psycho - logical half of the work is much better done , and as a critique of existing methods deserves recognition by the side of the three books already mentioned .

		There is an excellent discussion of the dogma of formal discipline .

		The present volume , which de - fines the author 's fundamental positions , forms the introduction to a series which is to include treatises on '' Educational Aspects of Mental Development , ''

		THE DIAL 265 `` The Values of Studies , '' `` The Psychology of Method in Teaching , '' and '' The Organization and Management of Schools . ''

		Under the title `` A Modern School , '' Professor
Paul H. Hanus	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has collected his recent educational utterances .

		The volume hears for the most part on secondary education , particularly the first five papers , which expand and reinforce the posi - tions that Professor
Hanus	PERSON	advanced in an earlier volume .

		The sixth and seventh essays , '' Our Faith in Education '' and '' Obstacles to Educational Progress , '' are wider in scope , and present a well - balanced estimate of the attitude of the American people toward public education .

		The eighth chap - ter , '' Education as a
University Subject	ORGANIZATION	and the
Professional Training of College	ORGANIZATION	- Bred Teachers , '' justifies the existence and notes the functions of the college training school for teachers .

		The last chap - ter , '' Graduate Testimony on the Elective System , '' gives us the result of a questionnaire circulated among
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduates of recent years .

		One who is seeking for revolutionary opinions , startling paradoxes , or brilliant flashes of pedagogical in - sight may as well avoid this volume , for it consists of sober , mature , and carefully-weighed opinion on certain controverted questions of great practical importance .

		Professor
Hanus	PERSON	shows great ability in interpreting the standpoint of the professional school man to the general public ; the citizen who wants to know the best professional opinion of the country on questions relating to secondary education will do well to read this book .

		The author does not let his fair-mindedness interfere with the promul - gation of a definite pedagogical platform .

		He be - lieves in public high schools , in a six year high-school course , in the culture rather than the formal sub - jects in the secondary curriculum in the elective system , and in encouraging manual training and the industrial subjects .

		The fourth volume of ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Educational Series '' consists of '' The Educational Theory of
Immanuel Kant	PERSON	, '' as translated and edited by Dr.
Edward Franklin Buchner	PERSON	of
the University of Alabama	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first third of the book is given up to the author 's introduction ; the next section con - tains a translation of
Kant	PERSON	's lecture-notes on peda - gogy ; and the concluding portion is made up of selections on education from
Kant	PERSON	's other writings .

		No attempt is made to trace the influence of
Kant	PERSON	on the educational theory of his own or succeeding generations , attention merely being called to the different editions of '' Ueber Padagogik . ''

		With this exception , the work may be highly commended .

		The author has striven against the tendency , which must have been a strong one here , to magnify the importance of the subject .

		His introduction , while appreciative , shows scholarship and critical balance .

		The translation is in good idiomatic En - glish , a difficult achievement in view of the broken and fragmentary character of the lecture notes .

Korea	LOCATION	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- , though timely and
Momtng Calm	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		\ ^ , , .

		, , l ^ • interesting , contains little that is new .

		The great mass of information in the text has already appeared in the pages of the Korean Repository , the
Korea	LOCATION	Review , and the Transac - tions of the
Asiatic Society of Korea	LOCATION	, whence it has been extracted , digested , and pleasantly re-pre - sented .

		Indeed , the author would have done well to state his obligations more specifically .

		Having spent several weeks and possibly months as news - paper correspondent in the country , he was in just that frame of mind in which a man feels most like writing a book , -- that is , when he is without those later judgments that overrule former hasty impres - sions , and when the picture on his mind is as at - tractive as a poster , from the very fact that it lacks perspective .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's style is rapid and his method interesting , and altogether the work is most readable , although -LRB- except where the author is tell - ing of his personal adventures -RRB- one feels that there is little solidity in the text and that he is mainly a purveyor rather than a producer .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	begins his personal narrative by an account of the coast of
Korea	LOCATION	, with its fascinations of floral color and changing landscapes seen as one threads his way among the numerous islands on the west side .

		We have a lively description of
Chemulpo	LOCATION	, the port of the capital , and its trade , in which the Japanese are pictured as a turbulent and uncanny lot ; and also of
Seoul	LOCATION	, the capital , with its many modern edifices , legations , French cathedral , and occidental features -- including tall chimneys and trolley cars .

		The white clothing of the people , starched and glistening in the case of the upper classes and of a dingy hue among the lower folks , gives one a sug - gestion of '' the orthodox notion of the Resurrec - tion . ''

		The men are fine , well built , and dignified in their bearing , showing evidences of descent from the semi-savages of northeastern
Asia	LOCATION	and the Cau - casian peoples from the
West	LOCATION	.

		Slavery , especially of the females , is common , and the standard of morality is rather low .

		Several chapters are de - voted to the '' emperor , '' and the tawdry pageantry always visible on his rare public appearances .

		The results of government in
Korea	LOCATION	are little else than oppression and poverty for the people , for the coun - try still clings to its ancient system of supporting thousands of civil and military officers , real or re - puted , in idleness , so that there are few incentives to wealth or industry .

		Of the modern interests , British ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, Japanese , French , German , and Belgian , the author gives an account that is full , clear , and timely .

		He devotes chapters to Fusan ,
Wonsan	LOCATION	, and other treaty ports , though one can easily see that his notes are mainly from his read - ing and not from close observation on the spot .

		The later chapters , in which he describes his journeys across the country and his stay among the 266 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Buddhist priests in the monasteries , are the most interesting of all .

		Appendices , statistics , index , and maps complete a very pertinent and informing book .

		A stimulating ^ he publication of a series of novel monograph on and valuable `` Monographs of the
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		American Revolution '' is announced by
the University Press of Cambridge and Messrs. A. W. Elson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, in conjunction .

		The general character and style of this series is indi - cated in the initial number , a posthumous essay on
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	written by
Paul Leicester Ford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume appears in an edition de luxe , in large quarto form , printed on Imperial
Japan	LOCATION	paper , in beautiful typography , and finely illustrated by an original etching from the
Stuart	PERSON	portrait of
Jeffer	PERSON	- son in
Bowdoin	LOCATION	college , and a photogravure from the profile of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, also by
Stuart	PERSON	.

		This hand - some edition is a noteworthy specimen of the best possibilities of the printer 's art .

		It is limited to 500 copies , so that it is destined to remain , as it is now , a rarity .

		Copies of a few of
Jefferson	PERSON	's original papers are appended , one of which is that stirring first draft of the Declaration of Indepen - dence , whose incisive invective of
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	's devotion to the perpetuation of African slavery in
America	LOCATION	stirs the reader 's blood even at this day .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's contribution to this unique ' < monograph '' is an original essay , completed shortly before his death , and never before pub - lished .

		In his well-known trenchant style , the writer has endeavored to portray the political feel - ings and views of his subject , to illustrate the inconsistencies and contradictions that beclouded his political theories and actions , and to throw light upon the vexing problem of what were in fact his political motives .

		But with all of this writer 's perspicacious study of an era so attractive to him , and with all the brilliancy of diction with which he unfolds to us what he has observed , we can not deny that the problem which allured him remains unsolved , and that our
Jefferson	PERSON	is as much of a mystery as ever .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	thinks he discovers
Jefferson	PERSON	's secret in part when he aligns that puzzling subject over against
Washington	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	.

		Is it a correct deduction from the his - tory of the revolutionary era , to say that
Jeffer	PERSON	- son 's work was permanent in character , while the contributions of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	to their day were merely ephemeral ?

		To take one in - stance , -- is there any more enduring force to-day in our governmental system than the Federal Con - stitution , for which both
Washington	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	did so much , and to which
Jefferson	PERSON	contributed so little in comparison ?

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	presents
Jefferson	PERSON	as the great protagonist of '' the masses '' as against * ' the classes , '' and seeks to find in this the basis of his great fame .

		But he fails to name for us any - one who at that time was championing '' the classes '' as against '' the masses . ''

		It surely could not have been
Washington	LOCATION	, the one man who had the oppor - tunity to promote an American kingship , and who indignantly rebuked the suggestion ; nor
Franklin	PERSON	, the exponent in two hemispheres of the possibilities of American democracy .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	is astute to note
Jefferson	PERSON	's failure to apply , as President , his own theories concerning a strict construction of the Constitution .

		He does not seem quite ready to admit that
Jefferson	PERSON	proceeded without reserve to apply and enforce in practice the Federalist the - ories which he had formerly reprobated ; a fact which enhances the Jeffersonian puzzle .

		The truth is that partisanship went to such lengths as to make it , both for the men of those days and for ourselves , an unsafe guide to generalization .

		The Federalists did not attempt to build up '' the classes '' at the expense of '' the masses '' ; they sought to strengthen the national government , not at the expense of any , but in the interest of all citizens .

		Jefferson may have once supposed it to be his mission to oppose and thwart '' the classes . ''

		But he must have learned the contrary before he died .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's monograph is a sprightly contribution to the dis - cussion of the interesting question , '' For what did
Jefferson	PERSON	stand ? ''

		He has more sharply stated the great contradictions and apparent inconsisten - cies that have made
Jefferson	PERSON	so deep a problem .

		Thus he has left us a legacy of no slight value ; for it may stimulate , while it has not closed , that dis - cussion .

		The editor has brought to - gether the critical introductions to six eighteenth - century editions of Shakespeare -- those of
Rowe	PERSON	, Pope ,
Theobald	PERSON	,
Hanmer	PERSON	,
Warburton	PERSON	, and
Johnson	PERSON	, -- besides
Dennis	PERSON	's three letters `` On the Genius and Writings of Shakespeare , '' Farmer 's '' Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare , '' and
Maurice Morgan	PERSON	's '' Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	. ''

		The praise , sometimes extrav - agant , bestowed on the dramatist by these upholders of a dramatic tradition quite different from his is sufficient evidence that the
Shakespeare	PERSON	cult was uninterrupted from
Dryden to Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		We do not , of course , forget that the plays were mangled in presentation ; but of that charge the present age is not wholly guiltless .

		It is worth remembering , too , that
Johnson	PERSON	found in Congreve 's '' Mourning Bride '' a finer passage than any in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	; that in
Addison	LOCATION	's view , '' Otway shines in the pas - sionate parts more than any other of our English poets , '' and that Shaftesbury prefaces his very mod - erate praise of `` Hamlet '' with a caveat setting forth the poet 's '' natural rudeness , his unpolished style , his antiquated phrase and wit , his want of method and coherence , and his deficiency in almost all the graces and ornaments of this kind of writ - ings . ''

		Nor is Dennis quite happy in his remark
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's blank verse : '' Such verse we make when we are writing prose ; we make such verse in common conversation . ''

		Nevertheless , with all necessary allowance for limitations of taste , these men praised
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ardently and praised him well .

		It is Dennis '' who loves and admires his charms and makes them one of his chief de - lights , who sees him and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated . ''

		Indeed , these essays are far from being of mere historical value ; at least three of them -- Pope 's ,
Johnson	PERSON	's , and -LRB- nota - bly -RRB-
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's -- are intrinsically good criticism , while the subject of Farmer 's famous paper is of perennial interest , as Mr.
Churton CoUins	PERSON	's recent '' Fortnightly '' articles prove .

		The editor deserves especially well of all Shakespeare students for ren - dering
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's essay accessible .

		The student of eighteenth-century literary history also will find in
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	's strictures upon Pope and in
Warburton	LOCATION	's upon
Theobald	PERSON	admirable examples of the fine art of innuendo , brought to such perfection by the Augustans .

		The editor 's introduction is a valuable essay on `` Shakespearian Criticism in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' the only fault of which is an occasional suggestion of irrelevance and confusion due to the compression of a large amount of material .

		The numerous allusions in the text of the essays are abundantly annotated , and there is an excellent in - dex .

		This volume will be of far greater service to the student of Shakespeare than many modern lit - erary essays or imaginary biographies .

		By a natural though not altogether happy economy of mental effort man - kind has a way of simplifying the careers of great men , satisfied with a general con - ception and unconsciously fitting this over every phase , with little regard to the notion of develop - ment .

		Those who cherish such a summary view of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	will be inclined to rub their eyes a little as they read
M. Gilbert Augustin	PERSON	-
Thierry	PERSON	's book on `` The Plot of the Placards '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , for their first discovery will be that among the soldiery in
1802	DATE	the
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	was regarded as too fond of a peace policy , and that some of the army leaders actually plotted to over - throw him in order that a military party might come into power under which riches and glory would still be possibilities for ambitious men .

		The plot , which had its headquarters at
Paris	LOCATION	although it was en - gineered at
Rennes	LOCATION	, has remained obscure because it was important to Napoleon after he had been made
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	for life that there should be no discordant note in the general pseon of praise .

		Another reason was the fact that the evidence pointed to
Bernadotte	PERSON	, his own relative , as the orig - inator of the scheme .


M. Thierry	PERSON	has announced that the book is the first of a series of studies with the general title of '' Conspirateurs et
Gens de Police	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is based upon papers in the
National Archives	ORGANIZATION	and in the archives of the
Prefecture of Police	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , however , no dry-as-dust compilation .

		Napoleon and the Rennes eontpiraey .

		More historie American highways .

		Anyone familiar with French police archives is aware that dossier after dossier contains materials for romance , comedy , or tragedy according to the taste of the investigator .

		All the personages in - volved in this fiasco are described in such detail and yet with such a sense of the unities and the proportions of the story that the reader is carried forward with a constantly increasing interest from one phase of the plot to the next and so on to the denouement .

		Incidentally there are studies of such men as
Fouchd	ORGANIZATION	,
Bernadotte	PERSON	, and of Mounier .

		Espe - cially curious is the reappearance of Mounier , who in the early days of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	had figured as a great statesman , but who soon sank hopelessly into the opposition and was later driven into exile .

		Mounier now appears as prefect of the department of Ille et Vilaine .

		On the whole the book is an excellent example of a form of historical writing that the French are doing particularly well .

		The latest volumes in Mr.
Archer B. Hulbert	PERSON	's '' Historic Highways '' series -LRB-
Arthur H. Clark Co.	PERSON	,
Cleve	PERSON	- land -RRB- are numbers ten and eight , issued in the order named .

		Volume ten is a re-issue , in the style of the series , of the author 's '' Old National Road , '' published in
1901	DATE	.

		The title has been changed to `` The Cumberland Road , '' this latter being the legal designation of the highway .

		The only change in the text seems to be the omission of the chapters on
Washington	LOCATION	's and
Braddock	PERSON	's roads , which have been treated separately in earlier volumes of the series , and a slight re-arrangement of the material .

		The rather interesting '' kodaks '' of toll-houses , taverns , and mile-stones , that appeared in the orig - inal volume , are omitted in the reprint -- perhaps not being regarded as sufficiently pretentious for the present purpose .

		The aim of the monograph is to emphasize the influence exerted by the '' Old Pike '' in uniting East and West before the era of the railroad .

		-- The subject matter of volume eight is better indicated by its sub-title , '' The Conquest of the Old Northwest , '' than by its main title , '' Mil - itary Roads of the
Mississippi Basin	LOCATION	. ''

		The roads are routes , and the only pare of the
Mississippi Basin	LOCATION	treated is that north of the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The volume covers five military campaigns , --
Clark	PERSON	's against
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	and Yincennes in
1778	DATE	and
1779	DATE	, and the campaigns of Harmar ,
St. Clair	LOCATION	, and
Wayne	PERSON	against the northwestern Indians from
1790	DATE	to
1794	DATE	.

		The treatment of
Clark	PERSON	's campaigns is con - fined to an examination of the routes , while of the other campaigns quite full accounts are given .

		The author has found most of his material in the Dra - per manuscripts in the library of the
Wisconsin State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and to this he adds a per - sonal examination of the territory traversed in the campaigns .

		His study of the routes is undoubtedly the most authoritative that has ever been made , and its result modifies accepted opinion in some impor - tant points .

		In the case of
Clark	PERSON	's campaigns , he gives a modern map upon which he indicates their 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, routes .

		This same service should have been done for the various roads treated in the earlier volumes of the series , and for the other campaigns covered by this volume .

		Important as are these highways in the history of the westward movement , the pre - cise details of their location have little interest to any but the antiquarian .

		On this account the author should save the reader 's time by presenting the results of his studies in the form most easily and most quickly grasped .

		Amold ^ s ezpfdilion to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		It is said that
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	once asked an American prisoner held in the British camp what the Americans would do with him -LRB- Arnold -RRB- if they should capture him .

		The prisoner replied that they would take off the leg that had been wounded while
Arnold	PERSON	was storming the stronghold of
Quebec	LOCATION	for his country and bury it with the honors of war , and then hang the rest of his body on a traitor 's gibbet .

		This story introduces an exhaustive account of the
Quebec	LOCATION	Expedition written by
John Codman	PERSON	, 2nd , and now brought out in a third edition by Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam Abbatt , with added matter and illustrations .

		The hardship and risk connected with the attempt to lead a military expedition through the pathless forests lying between the
Kennebec	LOCATION	and Chaudiere rivers in
1775	DATE	can scarcely be imagined at the present day .

		It has been likened to Hannibars crossing the Alps .

		Starting with only 1100 men ,
Arnold	PERSON	lost fully 400 of these by death and deser - tion .

		The expedition was foredoomed to failure .

		The author of the present narrative has seized upon the most picturesque events of the journey , and has made a study of the exact route taken .

		Many of his statements were questioned , it may be remem - bered , by Prof.
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	, who brought out a book on the same topic last year .

		The death of Mr.
Codman	PERSON	, really before his work was complete for the first edition , threw the burden of a rejoinder upon his friends .

		But the task could
Lave	PERSON	been undertaken only by one who had made such an in - timate study of the geography of the route as had Mr.
Codman	PERSON	and Professor
Smith	PERSON	.

		Regardless of details of the itinerary , the story is one of devotion , daring , and endurance , which makes one feel the possibilities of
Arnold	LOCATION	's career , if only his fidelity had remained unimpaired .

		AdUHnguUhed ^ ne whose faith in man has been W < - Biem educator shaken by too close contact with the andphuanthroput .

		g ^ ggj ^ ^ j ^ j worldliuess of this Com - mercial age will find an excellent tonic for his faith in the volume entitled ``
William Greenleaf	PERSON	Eliot : Minister , Educator , Philanthropist '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Charlotte C. Eliot	PERSON	.

		This is a most inspiring record of a man of the highest spiritual and social ideals , who went in his early manhood from the choicest environment of the East to become a home missionary in the frontier town of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, remaining there until his death ,
fifty-three years later	DATE	.

		Not only did he build up a large church but he became in many ways the first citizen of his city , the recognized leader in all plans for the general good of the community , with an influence extending throughout the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Val - ley .

		He never had time to become a profound scholar , and he had no great eloquence ; but he gave himself heart and soul to all who needed him , and he w as a natural leader of men , with a genius for friendship .

		Of his many public services we can mention only three of the greatest .

		He may be called the founder of the public school system of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, for it was but a poor apology for a sys - tem that existed when Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	became President of the
School Board	ORGANIZATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		He threw himself into this work with all his marvellous energy , and it was not long before the system was on a secure financial basis and was well organized .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	was also the founder of
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	, first chartered as '' Eliot Seminary '' entirely without his knowledge .

		To the development of an institu - tion that should be '' for
St. Louis	LOCATION	what
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	is to
Boston	LOCATION	, or
Yale	ORGANIZATION	to the city of its abode '' he gave himself with unremitting energy for more than thirty years , half of the time as Chancellor without salary .

		Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	, who served under him , in the introduction to this book , bears eloquent testimony to his great service and his gifted personality .

		The third distinguished service , this time to the whole country , was the organization of the
Western Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, through which four and a
quarter millions of dollars	MONEY	were expended for the relief of suffering among the wounded and helpless .

		The story of Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's life was well worth telling , and it is here told with sympathy and skill .

		Specialized history is the order of the day , either in point of subject matter or of time .

		Mr.
Herbert W. Paul	PERSON	has specialized in the latter sense at least in producing a '' History of Modern England '' -LRB- Mae - millan -RRB- that begins with
1846	DATE	and is to extend , in five volumes , to the
end of the century	DATE	.

		Moreover , a just criticism of the two volumes already issued must recognize that the author shows himself par - ticularly competent in one field only , the narration of purely political events in parliament and in po - litical campaigns .

		Other important topicH , such as religion , art , and literature are much emphasized by Mr.
Paul	PERSON	in his introduction , but in the body of the work these are treated hurriedly and without the personal interest manifested in political affairs .

		Apart from this defect , however , the work is of real value as offering a convenient and readable account of modern
England	LOCATION	.

		The author , for some reason , does not specify either his earlier produc - tions or his present position , both of which should be of value in offering to the prospective American purchaser some means of estimating the value of the work .

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	has been a member of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment , as a Liberal , has written a life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and a volume on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	for the '' English England in the l < ut halj century .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 269 More about Eye-xtrain and ill results , Men of Letters '' series , and is a leader writer on the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News . ''

		He is perhaps as well qualified as anyone to write the only kind of his - tory of modern
England	LOCATION	possible at
this early day	TIME	, for he knows his parliamentary history thoroughly and has an acute newspaper sense of the value of events as they appear to a contemporaneous pub - lic .

		His history is therefore a resumS of events as they assumed importance in parliament and with the public .

		The second volume concludes with the death , in
1865	DATE	, of
Palmerston	LOCATION	, for whom the author evinces more personal ill-will than for any other English statesman in the period covered .

		In gen - eral Mr.
Paul	PERSON	does not seem to permit his political affiliations to bias his judgment , though Peel is distinctly a hero , and largely for his stand on the question of free trade in corn .

		It will be interest - ing to note whether Mr.
Paul	PERSON	will attempt in the remaining volumes of his work to point a moral ap - plicable to the present interesting political situation in
Etigland	LOCATION	, whether , in fact , his history is a genu - ine historical undertaking , or a bit of political prop - aganda .

		There is nothing definitely indicative of the latter purpose in the volumes already published , but there are statements and deductions possible of later development .

		A year ago Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	issued a volume of `` Biographic Clinics '' -LRB- Blakiston -RRB- , in which he ascribed to eye-strain the bodily ills of De Qaincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and
Brown	PERSON	- ing .

		This book , he now tells us , was inadequately and even contemptuously noticed by medical jour - nals , and its author charged with hobby-riding .

		Lay periodicals showed themselves more sympa - thetic .

		But , on the whole , the world has not yet given the subject that serious attention which Dr.
Gould	PERSON	is convinced it demands .

		Therefore he has brought out , through the same publishers , a second volume of these clinics , treating of '' the origin of the ill health of
George Eliot	PERSON	,
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	,
Wagner	PERSON	,
Parkman	LOCATION	,
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Margaret Fuller Ossoli	PERSON	, and Nietzsche . ''

		Of all the members that minister to the belly , the eyes , as we here learn in a second and fuller lesson , are the most potent in their influence for ill if sub - jected to abuse .

		Vomiting and sick headache , such as poor Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	suffered from , are often the result of eye-strain .

		Heart trouble , neuralgia , dys - pepsia , and many other ailments , are not seldom attributable to the same cause .

		The eye , a verita - ble `` evil eye , '' is the source of countless woes .

		The author declares he has never seen a pair of eyes free from optical defects .

		What , then , is to be done about it ?

		Greater care must be taken of the eyes , and spectacles , adapted to the particular form of eye-ailment , must be worn , and must be changed with the changing of the eye .

		This , of course , presupposes the malady to be in some degree pronounced .

		The proper care of the eyes would usher in a new era , not only of physical , but also of mental well-being , if we may believe Dr.
Gould	PERSON	.

		The effects would be manifest even in our litera - ture , which would become more cheerful and op - timistic .

		The earnest efforts of our oculist to hasten this glad time are wholly praiseworthy ; but the non-medical critic queries , with submission , whether Dr.
Gould	PERSON	may not possibly be showing us the de - fects of his qualities .

		The zeal that tries to prove too much weakens the cause .

		It is so easy to see only what we are looking for if we do but set about it in tremendous earnest .

		To one wearing the spectacles of impartiality and unprejudice the author 's theory , sound though it may be , seems strained when he makes it account for the ailments of so many persons , now dead , whose recorded groans and sighs are not exactly the fullest and most satisfactory data on which to base a diagnosis .

		Professor
William Mathews	PERSON	's lat - ^ fTu ^ Tj ' est volume , '' Conquering Success '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is in many respects a repetition of his famous `` Getting On in the World . ''

		The veteran author has no new prescription for success , but insists , as he did thirty years ago , that it is to be won by industry , energy , patience , hon - esty , and several other virtues .

		He even repeats in part the words he used thirty years ago , though he gives his chapters new headings .

		But the new book is better than the old .

		The chapters are shorter , -- a reform which young readers especially will appreciate , -- and the whole expression is more terse and pointed .

		The new subjects considered , -- pluck , cheerfulness , the evils of hurry , spectral dis - couragements , etc. , -- have distinctly modern appli - cation .

		And the examples which enforce the morals have grown in number and interest .

		They were indeed a cloud of witnesses in the old volume , but in the new they are as continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle in the Milky Way .

		No one , in history or out , has ever failed or succeeded in any - thing , that Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	did not whip out his pen - cil and make a note .

		Consequently , though the garment of his advice is commonplace and sober enough , it is gayly embroidered with modern -- and ancient -- instances .

		It is no wonder such a book is popular .

		The young who have not yet succeeded like it because it marshals them the way that they are going .

		The old who have succeeded like it be - cause they can say '' That 's so ; that 's what I did . ''

		The old who have not succeeded perhaps like it best of all , for '' Success is counted sweetest By those who ne'er succeed . ''

		They can taste the sweets of success on the printed page , if nowhere else .

		The question which remains about the book in the end is , just what does Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	mean by success ?

		Does n't he , in spite of a few protestations , attach rather too material a meaning to the term ?

		Possibly so .

		But possibly also his books are no less practical or popular on that account .

		270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	is well indMndweiieri 0 / ^ nown from his lectures and books the Painted Desert .

		i o i - i '' i • i i upon the oouthwest , and for his book on Indian Basketry .

		Perhaps no one who writes knows the Grand CaSon of the
Colorado	LOCATION	better than he , and few have done as much to make the whole Southwestern desert known to the outside world .

		In * • The Indians of the Painted Desert Region '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he describes and pictures the human native population of the area .

		As is natural , he devotes the most of his space to the Hopi -LRB- Moki -RRB- of
Arizona	LOCATION	, and the Navajo .

		But his chapters on the Wallapais and the
Havasupais	PERSON	are even more important , as there has been little written in regard to these relatively inaccessible canon-dwellers .

		Now , when hundreds go annually to the Hopi snake - dance , and since
Matthews	PERSON	has given us the results of a life-study of the Navajo , we have abundant information regarding these interesting peoples .

		But the Wallapais and
Havasupais	PERSON	are in a different category .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	is a real traveller and ex - plorer , and an interesting writer .

		While his ego is sometimes obtrusive , and he occasionally breaks down in an attempt at '' fine writing , '' his material is good .

		He knows the Indians , sympathizes with and loves them -- although after a somewhat pat - ronizing fashion , -- and gives us a true picture .

		The book is a good nature-book , with a great sub - ject .

		A number of illustrations from photographs adds to the interest of the volume .

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. W. Mumford	PERSON	-RRB- is to be found in a recent work by Dr. 0 .

		C
Farrington	PERSON	of the
Field Columbian Museum of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is very systematic , including in its scope all known gem minerals , not only those now used for gems but also others which if better known might come into demand as jewels .

		The treatment is scientific in that the physical and chemical prop - erties of the minerals are given , and their mode of geological occurrence and geographical distribu - tion is discussed ; it is popular in that the methods of mining , of grinding , cutting , and polishing gems are described , and the historical setting of the better-known gems and notable jewels is given .

		The popular superstitions concerning gems among vari - ous peoples of the Occident and orient are given at length , and even birth stones are assigned accord - ing to the lines of a well-known dealer in jewels .

		One chapter is devoted to the principles on which the valuation and price of gems are based , and an - other to imitation gems and methods of detecting them .

		The volume is abundantly illustrated with maps of mining regions , photographs of famous mines , diagrams of cut stones and crystal ?

		, and by fifteen colored plates of marked excellence made by the colortype process .

		The applicability of this latter method of illustration to the portrayal of these most difiBcult of all natural objects adequately to picture is well demonstrated in theee plates .

America	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the Making of a Book '' is the title of a little brochure compiled by the literary department of
Messrs. D. Appletou & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and published by that firm .

		It is planned to serve as an aid to authors , and its advice in regard to preparation of manuscript , proof-reading , etc. , can not fail to prove of the greatest value .

		Somewhat similar in kind , though in this case intended primarily for the printer rather than the author , is the booklet of `` Rules for Compositors and Readers at
the University Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Horace Hart	PERSON	, Director of the Press , is responsible for these rules , while the English spellings adopted have the additional authority of Drs.
J. A. H. Murray	PERSON	and
Henry Bradley	PERSON	.

		No more accu - rate or painstaking printing establishment exists today than the Oxford concern , and -LRB- of course with due allow - ance for differences between English and American standards -RRB- its rulings may safely be accepted by any printer or author .

		Among other articles in the
April	DATE	number of '' The Hibbert Journal '' Prof.
Henry Jones	PERSON	writes on '' The Moral Aspect of the Fiscal Question , '' dealing with a side of the subject that has , perhaps , not received as much attention as it deserves .

		Sir Oliver Lodge con - tributes some '' Suggestions towards the Re-interpreta - tion of Christian Doctrine '' ; and
Canon Hensley Hen	ORGANIZATION	- son writes on '' The Resurrection of Jesus Christ , '' and the Bishop of
Ripon	LOCATION	on `` Gladstone as a Moral and Religious Personality . ''

		Under the designation of `` The Chiswick Quartos '' the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	will begin publication this
spring	DATE	of a series of reprints in quarto form , choicely printed at the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, in editions limited to 350 copies each .

		Keats 's poems , edited by Mr.
George Sampson	PERSON	, and
Herbert	PERSON	's '' The Temple '' will be the first to appear .

		To their '' Library of Noble Authors '' the same firm will shortly add a folio reprint of the '' Golden Ass '' of Apuleius , in
William Adlington	LOCATION	's translation .

		Two volumes to be issued immediately by the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	Press are '' An Introduction to the Bible for
Teachers of Children	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Miss Georgia L. Chamberlin	PERSON	, and '' A Political and Constitutional Study of the Cumberland Road , '' by Mr.
Jeremiah S. Young	PERSON	.

		Early in
May	DATE	the Press will have ready Dr.
George E. Howard	PERSON	's important '' History of Matrimonial Insti - tutions , '' and in
June	DATE	will appear a volume of '' Studies in the Gospel according to Mark , '' by Dr.
Ernest De	PERSON	-
Witt Burton	PERSON	.

		The war in the
East	LOCATION	lends new interest and perti - nence to Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	's charming '' Letters from
Japan	LOCATION	, '' now published in a single volume containing the complete text and all the illustrations of the original two-volume edition .

		The war is responsible also for the appearance of new editions of Mr.
Wirt Gerrare	PERSON	's `` Greater
Russia	LOCATION	'' and Mr.
Archibald R. Colquhoun	PERSON	's '' The Mastery of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, '' both of which , so far as we can judge , remain unchanged in form and contents .

		All three of these books bear the imprint of the
Mac - millan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American edition , limited to 100 copies , of the reproduction of the celebrated ''
Breviario Grimani	PERSON	'' has been secured by Mr.
Martinus Nijhoff	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	, and the work may be obtained in this country only through him .

		The reproduction is probably one of the most elaborate enterprises of the kind ever under - taken .

		There will be twelve parts in all , each contain - ing twenty-five plates in color and 110 in collotype , accompanied by the descriptive text of Dr.
Sal	PERSON	.

		Mor - purgo .

		It is not likely that the work will be completed inside of six or eight years .

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, Sr. , is rapidly com - pleting the preparation of '' Love 's Labor Lost , '' which is to be the next volume in his monumental `` Vario - rum ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of which the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are the publishers .

		This new volume comes from the 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, hands of Dr.
Farness	PERSON	, Sr. , in accordance with the plan for a division of work , announced a few months ago , by which the editorship of the comedies in the ''
Vario	PERSON	- rum '' edition will continue to he the work of the elder Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, while the other plays will be edited by his son .

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, Jr. .

		One of the most interesting announcements in con - nection with the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	centenary is that of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's reprint of the Journal of
Patrick Gass	PERSON	, one of the party composing the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition .

		This work originally appeared in
1807	DATE	, and ran through three editions , the third dated
1811	DATE	, but no reprint has been made since the some - what crude edition published at
Dayton	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, in
1847	DATE	, which has long been out of print .

		Messrs.
McClurg	PERSON	's edition will be in one volume , uniform with their re - prints of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark Journals	ORGANIZATION	and
Hennepin	ORGANIZATION	's Travels , and will be provided with a new Analytical Index and an Introduction written by Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	.

		The volume will be illustrated with facsimi - les of the six quaint pictures in the original edition , a portrait of
Gass	PERSON	, and a map of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	route .

		Messrs.
MeClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue in the early Fall , in uniform style , a reprint of Lahontan 's Travels , edited by Mr.
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	, and illustrated with facsimiles of the original illustrations .

		The materials for his story being fortunately of great variety and interest , Mr.
Orcutt	PERSON	has chosen from them wisely and has woven them into a narrative which has all the verisimilitude of biography and all the romance of fiction .

		Historical personages and imaginary characters move hither and thither through the pages , but they all center around the great personage of La Salle . ''

JAMES K. HOSMER	PERSON	, an analytical Index , facsimiles of the 7 original illustrations , a rare portrait of
Patrick Gass	PERSON	, and a map of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	route .

		The appearance of this volume in the year of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	celebrations is especially pertinent , as no practical library edition has been available of the `` Journal of Patrick
Gass	PERSON	. ''

		The work originally appeared in
1807	DATE	, and ran through three editions , the third dated 181 1 , but no reprint has been made since the somewhat crude edition published at
Dayton	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, in
1847	DATE	, which has , of course , long been out of print .

		Aside from its actual historical value , it is a volume of unusual interest , containing , as the old title-page says , '' an authentic relation of the most interesting tran - sactions during the expedition ; a description of the country ; an account of its inhabitants , soil , climate , curiosities , and vegetable and animal productions .

		BRIEFER MENTION 305 NOTES 305 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 306 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 306 QUOTATION VE RSUS ORIGINALITY .

		The reproach is often brought against mod - ern essayists that the substance of their writ - ing is quotation , and only the dressing original .

		A patchwork of extracts is indeed a pitiful thing .

		Where the excerpts from
Bartlett	PERSON	or Allibone stand shivering in a scantiness of drapery that is next to nudity , it is evident that the cobbler -LRB- to vary the metaphor -RRB- has erred in choosing for his medium of expression literature instead of leather .

		But the apt use of another 's words , the knowing just where to go for the immortal phrasing of a turn of thought , the graceful giving place to a supe - rior where an attempt at originality would argue presumption as well as ignorance , and the skilful weaving of the borrowed material into the fabric of one 's discourse , -- this it is that marks the man of letters , the litterateur .

		Illustrations are hardly necessary ; but let us suppose , for example , the case of a writer who has the hardihood to offer the world an - other essay on
Milton	LOCATION	.

		Let it be further assumed that , departing somewhat from the beaten track , he undertakes to expose , briefly and pointedly , the weakness of Milton 's '' Doc - trine and Discipline of Divorce . ''

		He sees at a glance that its assailable side is its supreme disregard of the wife 's interests .

		Imagine , says our writer , the case of a man who has a weakness for a succession of wives -- a private
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	.

		He marries No. 1 , and after a while , on the plea that he finds her incompatible , he avails himself of
Milton	PERSON	's law and gives her a bill of divorcement .

		No. 2 succeeds to the vacant place , and is ere long treated in like manner ; and so on , till the brutal rascal , undeniably exempt from all legal censure , may be living in the centre of a per - fect solar system of discarded wives , all mov - ing in nearer or farther orbits around him ^ according to the times , more recent or more remote , when they were thrown off , and each attended by her one or more satellites of little darlings .

		Is that about as graphic and force - ful a presentation of his case as our essayist could have made ?

		If you say it is , you com - mend his wisdom in adopting Professor Mas - son 's humorously effective image instead of 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, employing a less striking illustration and a feebler phraseology of his own -- provided , of course , that he fails not to name his authority and to use the required quotation marks , which have here been purposely omitted .

		Not to have cited the eminent
Edinburgh	LOCATION	scholar at this point would almost have argued ignorance of his work .

		A writer is characterized nearly as much by his quotations as by his own composition .

		If he quotes learnedly , we know him to be a scholar .

		If his quotations bite and sting , he is a satirist .

		If he quotes indiscriminately and inaptly , that too is characteristic : it stamps him as lacking in clean-cut , positive ideas of his own .

		The bungler 's borrowings always betray him .

		His foreign matter is rather sug - gestive of the crude lumps in a piece of Rox - bury pudding-stone than of the delicate veining in a slab of polished marble .

		But the man of genius makes his own all that he takes from others . ''

		What would remain of me , '' asks Goethe , '' if this art of appropriation were derogatory to genius ?

		Every one of my writ - ings has been furnished to me by a thousand different persons , a thousand things : wise and foolish bave brought me , without suspecting it , the offering of their thoughts , faculties , and experience .

		My work is an aggregation of beings taken from the whole of nature ; it bears the name of Goethe . ''

		Man , it has been well said , is a quotation from all his ancestors .

		Eliminate the quota - tions and you reduce him to less than the shadow of a shade .

		But in the power of assimilating the appropriated matter , so far at least as literature is concerned , there are many degrees of difference .

		As the metaphor pleases more than the labored simile , so the literary allusion , the veiled citation , the apt word or phrase , whether from a familiar source or from one half-forgotten , stimulate the flagging interest more than paragraphs and pages of direct quotation .

		The writings of beginners and of the unscholarly are painfully bare of these literary trimmings .

		Subtle allusion and illuminative reference glare by their absence .

		If attempt is made to relieve the bareness by an occasional bit of jewelry , the artifice is too obvious and so defeats its end .

		We seem to see the self-congratulatory smile with which the writer contemplates his imported finery .

		It is not meant , of course , that the expert in this art is necessarily in constant practice of it .

		Thackeray rarely quotes ; but when he does , it is admirably to the purpose .

		Recall that little scene at
Rawdon Crawley	PERSON	's club just after
Rawdon	PERSON	had been appointed gov - ernor of
Coventry Island	LOCATION	.

		`` A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband , '' says
Brown to Smith	PERSON	in enigmatical explanation of
Lord Steyne	LOCATION	's action in obtaining the appointment for the husband of
Becky Sharp	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is doubt - ful if
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	's wisdom has ever been turned to a droller use .

		Another admirable but rather wicked biblical quotation , suggested by the foregoing , is that recorded of young
Calverley	PERSON	who , having eluded the pursuit of a university proctor and his myrmidons and reached sanc - tuary by a bold feat of climbing , called back in triumph from within : '' I have run through a troop , and by my God have I leaped over a wall . ''

		The very familiarity of a quotation , as in the instances just cited , is often its best feature .

		A new and fitting application of the old is more generally pleasing than the employment , how - ever skilful , of the far-fetched and unfamiliar .

		We experience nearly as much joy in finding a new place for an old saying as in the discovery of a new thought .

		Yet we demand that the cur - rent coin of wisdom shall receive constant addi - tions from the mint ; and effectively to employ the unfamiliar in quotation , so that it shall ever afterward be quoted , requires genius little inferior to that of original production .

		Many will read an author before one thinks of making the happy quotation ; but as soon as this is done the passage or phrase is immortalized .

		The good quoter shows that exquisite appreciation of literary charm which is so often affected , so seldom felt .

		He knows what it is both to exult in the one best word and to find delight in the daintily pliant sentence embellished with all sorts of felicitous linking of figure to abstrac - tion .

		He is quick to feel the glow and thrill imparted by the perfect utterance of & prim & ry truth , the voicing of '' what oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed . ''

		Those who profess a hatred of '' mere literature , '' who think that a writer 's style , like
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's
Lavinia	LOCATION	, '' when unadorned is adorned the most , '' will cry out that all this is mischievous moonshine , the quintessence of effeminate dilettanteism , and subversive of all that is vigorous and virile in literary art .

		It may be made so , as every right principle is capable of abuse .

		The Corinthian column may display such elaborate ingenuity of deeply-cut fluting and scroll-work and acan - thus leaves , in shaft and capital , as to make one fear for its strength .

		Montaigne was justified in li \ `` score for rhetoricians who '' go a mile out
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 287 of their way to run after a fine word . ''

		Fine writing for its own sake no sensible person will seek to defend .

		But those who , in contempt of rhetorical embellishment , aim at unadorned literalness of presentation too often fail to put forth an idea worth contemplating , a thought worth the thinking ; striving to be plain , they cease to be impressive , and thus defeat their own purpose .

		This unwillingness to make oneself avowedly a debtor to earlier writers is entertained only by those whose acquaintance with literature is so restricted that they fail to perceive how few of their own ideas have not already been admir - ably minted by other minds .

		They are blissfully unconscious of the impossibility of breaking entirely away from what has been said and thought before them .

		They should ponder the words of the elder Disraeli : '' Whatever is felicitously expressed risks being worse ex - pressed .

		It is a wretched taste to be gratified with mediocrity when the excellent lies before us . ''

		They need to bear in mind Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	's warning to the students of the
Eoyal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		What he has to say about origi - nality in painting applies equally well to the other arts , and to literature not least of all .

		* ' Invention is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory -- nothing can come of noth - ing ; he who has laid up no materials can produce no combinations .

		Those who attempt production without such previous knowledge are always anticipated , and differ only in eccentricities .

		The more extensive , there - fore , your acquaintance is with the works of those who have excelled , the more extensive will be your powers of invention ; and , what may appear still more a para - dox , the more original will be your conception . ''

		♦ ' Let the sticklers for originality , '' writes an anonymous commentator on this lecture , ** ■ the devotees of the new in any of its preposterous shapes , ponder these often-quoted words ; and let us that have free souls and unwrung withers hold firmly by that allusive and quoting habit to which is due so much of excellence in the verse of
Virgil	LOCATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	, in the prose of
Addison	LOCATION	,
Burton	PERSON	, and Montaigne . ''

		The natural relation between a quotable style and a fondness for quoting has often been noted .

		Here seems to apply the Golden Rule : quote others if you would have others quote you .

		Emerson ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, all of them utterers of '' stamped sentences , '' are generous quoters .

		Their neighbor and contemporary ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, very rarely quotes and is still more rarely quoted .

		His pages , free from borrowed gems and offering none to the would-be borrower .

		recall the lament in the `` Curiosities of Liter - ature , '' -- that * ' the greater part of our writers have become so original that no one cares to imitate them . ''

		The author further notes with approval the continued vogue of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Seneca	LOCATION	, and the elder Pliny , all of whom in their literary work drew on the riches of their libraries ; while Epicurus , who boasted of hav - ing written three hundred books without bor - rowing , has perished .

		Apart from the literary charm of apt quota - tion , apart from the fact that when once a thought has been perfectly expressed our alle - giance to the best will tolerate nothing inferior , and we demand that this recognized best form , which haunts our own minds , shall be at least suggested if not reproduced in detail by the author we are reading , -- apart from all this , there are certain uses of quotation which sel - dom fail to please and of which a brief mention will here suffice .

		The timely recital of the ipsissima verba of an eager antagonist , when this can be done in such wise as to refute him out of his own mouth , always wins applause .

		So also we relish the unexpected and adroit use of a writer 's or speaker 's words to enforce an argument quite different from that which they originally strengthened .

		The skilful in - terweaving of a prose quotation in the lines of one 's verse , so as to make the borrowed phrase or sentence fall into metre and rhyme with the rest , is another amusing device ; while the em - ployment of a line of poetry to lend dignity and elevation to one 's prose , is an expedient of every-day adoption .

		Finally , the desire to give utterance to sentiments that we secretly cherish , but shrink from heartily and openly avowing , affords still another use for quotation .

		Behind the friendly shelter of inverted commas , we in - dulge in satire with Pope and in cynicism with La Rochefoucauld .

		Somewhat akin to this practice is the putting into the mouth of an imaginary character such products of one 's wit or fancy as an author wishes to make more impressive , or less the expression of his own mind , than he imagines they would be if uttered in the first person .

		Understanding the word '' classical '' in its broader application , we would say in conclu - sion , as
Johnson	PERSON	said to
Wilkes	PERSON	when the latter expressed his opinion that the habit of quoting was a mark of pedantry , -- `` No , sir , it is a good thing ; there is a community of mind in it .

		Classical quotation is the parole of literary men all over the world . ''

		The
Spencer Aut	ORGANIZATION	obiographt .

		* After several delays and postponements , the autobiography of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	has at last made its appearance , and the reader 's appetite , already whetted by the fragments that the pub - lishers have previously allowed to escape from confinement , is free to indulge itself to the full .

		The work is in two volumes , aggregating nearly thirteen hundred pages , provided with portraits of the author and of several of his relatives , to - gether with other illustrations explanatory of certain mechanical inventions of his devising .

		The main body of the work was put into type about fifteen years ago , and of the plates then made a few impressions were taken which `` a select few '' of the author 's friends were per - mitted to read .

		A few years later a supple - mentary chapter was prepared , bringing the nar - rative down to
1894	DATE	.

		At this date , the author penned a brief preface , of which the following is the opening paragraph : `` • It has seemed to me that a natural history of my - self would be a useful accompaniment to the books which it has been the chief occupation of my life to write .

		In the following chapters I have attempted to give such a natural history .

		That I have fully succeeded is not to be supposed ; but perhaps I have suc - ceeded partially .

		At any rate , one significant truth has been made clear -- that in the genesis of a system of thought the emotional nature is a large factor : perhaps as large a factor as the intellectual nature . ''

		With these words we are introduced to a hu - man document of extraordinary interest , the intimate record of a great thinker 's life .

		The book is the most important of the present year , one of the , most important of many years .

		It was in
1886	DATE	that failing health turned
Spencer	PERSON	's activities from the more formal work of his life to the less exacting task of autobi - ography .

		He had already set down some mem - oranda for such a purpose , and `` gradually fell into the habit of passing a little time daily in putting these into shape . ''

		He began with an account of his early life and education , then passed to the record of his later years , and afterwards filled in the gap that had been left between .

		The reasons why he thought it best to make the publication of the work post - humous are thus stated : `` As the work advanced I became conscious that a constitutional lack of reticence is displayed throughout it , to an extent which renders present publication un - desirable .

		In years to come , when I shall be no longer * An Autobiography .

		conscious , the frankness with which the book is written may add to whatever value it has ; but while I am alive it would , I think , be out of taste to address the public as though it consisted of personal friends . ''

		These words indicate what is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the book .

		Frankness is in it everywhere apparent , carried some - times almost to the point of naivete ; the wish of the writer to be absolutely honest , both with others and with himself , is noticeable throughout , and in this respect the autobiog - raphy is more striking than that of Mill , with which we naturally compare it , although it has not the literary grace of that intensely inter - esting record .

		After devoting something like seventy pages to his extraction and immediate antecedents , the author turns to the story of his own early years .

		His childish associations were nearly all of a most serious nature ; on the intellec - tual side , they were largely determined by the fact that he was descended from a family de - voted to the profession of teaching , on the religious side , they might be described as the product of Methodist influences mitigated by Quakerism .

		We find the boy
Herbert	PERSON	much given to dreams and castle-building , deeply affected by the beauty of nature , with a pro- nounced bent for scientific studies , and an equally pronounced aversion to linguistic pur - suits .

		It is a not insignificant fact that the first book read by him of his own accord was ``
Sandford	PERSON	and Merton , '' which he perused at the age of seven .

		Of his childish tendency to castle - building he says : • ' In early days the habit was such that on going to bed , it was a source of satisfaction to me to think I should be able to lie for a length of time and dwell on the fancies which at the time occupied me , and fre - quently next morning , on awaking , I was vexed with myself because I had gone to sleep before I had rev - elled in my imaginations as much as I had intended .

		Often these dreams , becoming literally day-dreams , quite filled my consciousness when walking . ''

		If it is something of a surprise to us to learn of the traits of character already mentioned , it is still more startling to be told how the boy of thirteen rebelled against the restraints of school and the irksomeness of the Latin grammar to the point of running away and tramping more than a hundred miles homeward with two shillings in his pocket at the start .

		This is quite another
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	from the one we have hitherto known , and makes us hesitate about accepting the poet 's claim that the child is father of the man .

		We recognize more clearly the Spencer of our preconception in a remark made concern -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL is ^ ing the first months , spent in
London	LOCATION	, of his engineering career .

		It is the boy of eighteen who , during this six months ' sojourn in the capital , '' never went to a place of amusement , nor ever read a novel or other work of light literature , '' but instead spent his evenings drawing , calling upon friends , and rambling about the streets .

		These engineering years must be passed over briefly .

		They are more interesting for their extraneous memories and reflections than for their professional achieve - ments .

		Thus , we note with interest that the reading of
Lyell	PERSON	's '' Geology , '' at twenty , only strengthened his opposition to the doctrine of fixed types for which
Lyell	ORGANIZATION	then argued , but which that geologist was afterwards to be so ef - fective in overthrowing .

		We are also interested to note the restlessness of mind which succes - sively attracted
Spencer	PERSON	's attention to subjects so diverse as phrenology , phonography , and politics -- the latter of these preoccupations leading to a series of newspaper letters on `` The Proper Sphere of Government , '' a col - lection of opinions in which his philosophy of '' Social Statics '' was gradually taking shape .

		Significant of much in
Spencer	LOCATION	's later development is his reported observation of `` how needful analytical intelligence is in cases where a question of right and wrong is raised out of the daily routine . ''

		It is indeed true , as he goes on to say , that '' the moral sentiments , however strong they may be , and however rightly they may guide in the ordinary relations of life , need enlightenment where the problems are complex . ''

		Of much curious interest is also the following passage from a letter of
1848	DATE	: '' I feel more and more determined to write a poem in a few years hence , and am gradually working out the plot in my mind and putting down memoranda of thought and sentiment .

		The title I intend to be < The Angel of Truth , ' Inclosed I send you a few lines by way of specimen of a first attempt .

		They are supposed to be part of the winding-up of a meditation upon the state of the world during the Dark Ages . ''

		Still another literary project was '' The Rebel , '' a drama '' exhibiting the failure and disap - pointment of a high-minded hero , consequent on the weakness and baseness of those with whom he acted . ''

		The tentative period of
Spencer	PERSON	's life was ended when , in
1848	DATE	, he went to
London	LOCATION	to join forces with '' The Economist . ''

		From this time on , he was to devote himself to literary work in one form or another , and to develop the system of thought with which his name will forever be associated .

		One-third of the auto - biography has been covered when we reach the end of these years of varied occupations and uncertain aims .

		Summing them all up , the author finds little to regret in their seeming dissipation of energy .

		They brought him much knowledge of nature and of men , they strength - ened his '' faculty of seizing cardinal truths rather than of accumulating detailed informa - tion . ''

		There had been nothing that was aca - demic in the discipline of these years -LRB- `` I never passed an examination ; nor could I have passed any such examinations as are commonly prescribed '' -RRB- , but their discipline had been none the less effective .

		They had given clear evidence of both his strength and his limita - tions .

		The latter appear plainly enough in what he says of such matters as music , poetry , and philosophy .

		Although music served him as a recreation during much of his life , he found his ideal of dramatic musical composi - tion in Meyerbeer ; he listened with slight pleas - ure to ''
Don Giovanni	PERSON	'' and was for the first time completely satisfied when he heard '' Les Huguenots . ''

		In poetry ,
Shelley	PERSON	first attracted him , and for a time held him strongly , but in later life had no power to charm .


Wordsworth	PERSON	- seemed to him '' not wine but beer , '' and
Dante	PERSON	- '' a gorgeous dress ill made up . ''

		What hes thought of Homer is thus expressed : `` My feeling was well shown when , some twenty years ago , I took up a translation of the < Iliad ' for the purpose of studying the superstitions of the early Greeks , and , after reading some six books , felt what a task it would be to go on -- felt that I would rather give a large sum than read to the end . ''

		If he felt thus toward the great poet , he would naturally have small sympathy for the lesser ones , and concerning them he expresses him - self in vigorous language .

		< ' As for the versifiers and the minor poets , they da little more than help to drown good literature in a flood of bad .

		There is something utterly wearisome in this continually working - up afresh the old materials into slightly different forms -- talking continually of skies and stars , of seas and streams , of trees and flow - ers , sunset and sunrise , the blowing of breezes and the singing of birds , etc. , -- now describing these familiar things themselves , and now using them in metaphors that are worn threadbare .

		The poetry commonly pro- duced does not bubble up as a
spring	DATE	but is simply pumped up ; and pumped-up poetry is not worth reading . ''

		The conclusion of all this is that `` no one should write verse if he can help it '' -- an ex - cellent counsel of admonition . ''

		Let him sup - press it if possible ; but if it bursts forth in spite of him it may be of value . ''

		Spencer 's limitations upon the side of aes - thetic appreciation are so evident throughout 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, his writings as to need no argument .

		Although he often wrote in dogmatic manner upon such subjects as poetry and music and literary style , what he said about them served to make pain - fully apparent the fact that it would have been better for his reputation had he left them un - touched .

		Much the same , thing must be said of his excursions into the field of philosophy , although this will be taken as a hard saying by those who are accustomed to think of him as one of the greatest of philosophers .

		But the contention may safely be rested upon these words spoken of a really great philosopher : '' I found in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's house a copy of a transla - tion of
Kant	PERSON	's ' Critique of Pure Reason , ' at that time , I believe , recently published .

		This I commenced read - ing , but did not go far .

		The doctrine that
Time	ORGANIZATION	and Space are * nothing but ' subjective forms , -- pertain ex - clusively to consciousness and have nothing beyond con - .

		sciousness answering to them , -- I rejected at once and .

		- absolutely ; and having done so , went no further ... `` There was , in the first place , the utter incredibility of ithe proposition itself ; and then , in the second place , tthere was the want of confidence in the reasonings of anyone who could accept a proposition so incredible .

		... Whenever , in later years , I have taken up
Kant	PERSON	's ' Critique of Pure Reason , ' I have similarly stopped short after rejecting its primary proposition . ''

		This , it will be observed , is not the report of a youthful prejudice , but the statement of a ma - tured and lifelong opinion -- if '' opinion '' we may style this deliberate unwillingness to grap - ple with the thought of the most profound thinker of the modern world .

		We make these remarks , with their accompanying extract , in the interests of exact definition , and not with the intention of minimizing
Spencer	PERSON	's splendid achievement in his own sphere of scientific co - ordination .

		When the '' Social Statics '' was produced at the age of thirty ,
Spencer	PERSON	's Lehrjahre were over , and his Wanderjahre as well , except as his physical needs impelled him to seek rest and recreation in travel .

		He was no longer driven from pillar to post as the consequence of his engineering and other occupations , and had definitely settled down to the life of the student , the collector of facts , and the synthetic thinker .

		From this time on , the record of his life is essentially an account of the circum - stances under which his successive works were produced , and an exposition of the manner in which his fundamental ideas were shaped .

		Space does not permit of our following this exposition step by step , although a review of broader scope would find therein one of the most interesting of tasks .

		In place of such detailed analysis , we quote a passage of great significance in the light which it throws upon his mental processes .


George Eliot	PERSON	once ex - pressed to him her surprise that there should be no lines of thought on his forehead .

		The following bit of dialogue ensued : '' < I suppose it is because I am never puzzled . '

		< 0 !

		that 's the most arrogant thing I ever heard uttered . ' '

		Not at all , when you know what I mean . ' ''

		And then
Spencer	PERSON	proceeds to explain what he means : '' It has never been my way to set before myself a problem and puzzle out an answer .

		The conclusions at which I have from time to time arrived , have not been arrived at as solutions of questions raised : but have been arrived at unawares -- each as the ultimate outcome pf a body of thoughts which slowly grew from a germ .

		Some direct observation , or some fact met with in read - ing , would dwell with me : apparently because I had a sense of its significance .

		It was not that there arose a distinct consciousness of its general meaning ; but rather that there was a kind of instinctive interest in those facts which have general meanings ... And thus , little by little , in unobtrusive ways , without con - scious intention or appreciable efPort , there would grow up a coherent and organized theory .

		Habitually the process was one of slow , unforced development , often extending over years ; and it was , I believe , because the thinking done went on in this gradual , almost spontane - ous way , without strain , that there was an absence of those lines of thought which Miss
Evans	PERSON	remarked -- an absence almost as complete
thirty years later	DATE	, notwithstanding the amount of thinking done in the interval . ''

		This is an extraordinarily illuminating state - ment , and helps us to understand the organic solidity of the synthetic philosophy , as well as the fact that its author contrived for over half a century to do battle with ill health , and resist collapse , while at the same time pursuing his intellectual purposes with moderate but aston - ishingly persistent activity .

		Before closing this review , we will take occa - sion to reproduce , without any special attempt at orderly sequence , a few of the more striking and characteristic passages of the autobiog - raphy .

		All students of the history of education are familiar with
Spencer	PERSON	's singularly biassed view of the relative value of the several educa - tional disciplines , as well as with the mischief that his opinion has wrought in educational practice .

		How utterly blind and deaf he was to the appeal of humanistic culture may be shown by quoting these words on the study of the ancient classics : `` To think that after these thousands of years of civilization , the prevailing belief should still be that while knowledge of his own nature , bodily and mental , and of the world physical and social in which he has to live , is of no moment to a man , it is of great moment that he should master the languages of two extinct

		Two local groups of facts and fictions , filling a rela - tively minute space in the genesis of a World which is itself but an infinitesimal part of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	, so occupy students that they leave the World and the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	unstudied !

		Had
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	never existed , human life , and the right conduct of it , would have been in their essentials exactly what they now are : survival or death , health or disease , prosperity or ad - versity , happiness or misery , would have been just in the same ways determined by the adjustment or non - adjustment of actions to requirements . '' ''

		Had
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	never existed , human life , and the right conduct of it -LSB- we add the italics -RSB- , would have been in their essentials exactly what they now are '' -- in the presence of so amazing an expression of
Philistinism	LOCATION	as this , we can only gasp for breath , and mar - vel at the warped view which it indicates , at its reckless disregard of one of the elementary truths of history .

		Among
Spencer	PERSON	's many characterizations of his famous contemporaries , those of
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and Mill are particularly interesting .

		When he read `` Modern Painters , '' he was delighted to find a critic of art who was dar - ing enough to speak unfavorably of
Raphael	PERSON	, but when he opened '' The Stones of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' his delight was transformed into something quite different .

		`` My faith in Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's judgment was at once destroyed ; and thereafter I paid no further attention to his writings than was implied by reading portions quoted in reviews or elsewhere .

		These , joined with current statements about his sayings and doings , sufficiently justified the opinion I had formed .

		Doubtless he has a fine style , writes passages of great eloquence , and here and there expresses truths ; but that one who has written and uttered such multitudinous absurdities should have acquired so great an influence is to me both surprising and disheartening . ''

		The following remarks about
Carlyle	PERSON	are also of much interest : '' He has , strange to say , been classed as a philos - opher !

		Considering that he either could not or would not think coherently -- never set out from premises and reasoned his way to conclusions , but habitually dealt in intuitions and dogmatic assertions , he lacked the trait which , perhaps more than any other , distinguishes the philosopher properly so called .

		He lacked also a fur - ther trait .

		Instead of thinking calmly , as the philos - opher above all others does , he thought in a passion .

		It would take much seeking to find one whose intellect was perturbed by emotion in the same degree . ''

		Of Mill , from whom he experienced many acts of kindness , and with whose ideas he was for the most part in sympathy , he gives us this pen-portrait : '' In manner he was quiet and unassuming .

		His face gave constant evidence of the extent to which in later life , as in his earlier life , his nervous system had been overtaxed , for he had frequent twitohings of some facial muscles .

		Another trait of expression I can recall -- there was a certain habitual setting of the lips , implying , as it seemed to me , a conscious self - restraint .

		Too stern a discipline in his boyhood , and perhaps too serious a view of things in his later years , put , I think , an undue check on the display of pleasur - able feelings .

		I do not remember his laugh ; and my impression is that though he appreciated good things he did not laugh heartily . ''

		We refrain somewhat reluctantly from giving other illustrations of this sort of portraiture , which , if not always just , is at least clear-cut and impressive .

		One more extract , taken from the chapter of '' Reflections '' appended to the second vol - ume , must end these illustrative quotations .

		As the expression of
Spencer	PERSON	's ripest views upon the fundamental question of religious beliefs and practices , the following passages are perhaps the most deeply interesting to be found anywhere in the work .

		After speak - ing of the way in which '' real creeds contin - ually diverge from nominal creeds , and adapt themselves to new social and individual re - quirements , '' and how '' in modern preaching theological dogmas are dropping into the back - ground and ethical doctrines coming into the foreground , '' he goes on to say : `` Thus I have come more and more to look calmly on forms of religious belief to which I had , in
earlier days	DATE	, a pronounced aversion .

		Holding that they are in the main naturally adapted to their respective peo - ples and times , it now seems to me well that they should severally live and work as long as the conditions permit , and , further , that sudden changes of religious institutions , or of political institutions , are certain to be followed by reactions .

		If it be asked why , thinking thus , I have persevered in settmg forth views at vari - ance with current creeds , my reply is the one elsewhere made : -- It is for each to utter that which he sincerely believes to be true , and , adding his unit of influence to all other units , leave the results to work themselves out ... Thus religious creeds , which in one way or another occupy the sphere that rational interpretation seeks to occupy and fails , and fails the more it seeks , I have come to regard with a sympathy based on com - munity of need : feeling that dissent from them results from inability to accept the solutions offered , joined with the wish that solutions could be found . ''

		To some such mellowed view as this every serious thinker must come , after he has passed through the period of indignant revolt against the absurdities of tradition , and upon this com - mon ground the defenders of the old and the apostles of the new gospels may find room for mutual sympathies and a concerted endeavor to reach the larger truth .

		We have passed over many matters without a word of mention .

		We should like particu - 292 THE DIAL .

Italy	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, -- and of his effort to set right the distorted view of our public concerning the attitude of Englishmen during and after our Civil War .

		We should like also to speak of his friendships , of his delight in social intercourse , and of his recreations .

		We should like to illustrate the essential good humor which he preserved through his years of trial and hardship , and the animation given to his pages by the personal anecdote and the ex - cellent jesting which he recalls here and there .

		The lasting impressions which the autobiog - raphy leaves upon our mind is that , besides being the record of a life that was heroic in the finest sense , it is also a very human produc - tion , and one of the most absolutely honest books ever written .

		It is as honest as the '' Diary '' of
Pepys	PERSON	and the '' Confessions '' of
Rousseau	PERSON	, and has the advantage over those works of portraying a nature to which base - ness and pettiness were unknown , a character founded upon altruistic feeling and devotion to goodness and truth .

		original history was so careful a presentation of the war in its various aspects that there was nothing to be added , and no change in the point of view to be made other than that necessitated by addressing a British as well as an American audience , and this more by way of introducing little amenities than in any other manner .

		The two salient points that constitute Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's claim to originality dominate both his - tories , -- one being that the American frigates were larger , heavier , and better ships than those they met and conquered ; the other , that British self-confidence and ensuing lack of gunnery - practice contributed largely to the British defeat .

		But this chapter is open to one objec - tion that would not lie against the author 's book above-named .

		Though not so long , and occupied largely with sketches of conflicts rather than detailed accounts of them , and though Mr.

		`` British captains , in single-ship contests , had not been accustomed to weigh too nicely the odds against them ; and in the twenty years during which they had overcome the navies of every maritime power in
Europe	LOCATION	they had repeatedly conquered in single fight when the odds against them had been far heavier '' -LRB- page 37 -RRB- . ''

		During the preceding twenty years , the traditions of the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	had taught him -LSB- Captain Garden , of the Macedonian -RSB- that it was possible to win against such odds .

		This had been proved scores of times in single fight '' -LRB- page 47 -RRB- . ''

		Time and again , moreover , the British had won against odds as great , or greater , in single fight '' -LRB- page 61 -RRB- . ''

		The countrymen of each combatant tried , on the one side , to enhance the glory of the victory by mini - mising this difference in force , and , on the other , to explain away the defeat by exaggerating it '' -LRB- page 27 -RRB- . ''

		The victors , the greater to enhance their glory , sought to minimise the difference of force in their favour ... ; the vanquished , to extenuate their de - feats , attributed them entirely to the difference in force , and enormously exaggerated this '' -LRB- page 59 -RRB- .

		The second chapter , the forty - second of the work , is by Sir
Clements R. Markham	PERSON	, G.C.B. , President of the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and is concerned with peace rather than war , dealing with the voyages and discoveries from
1803	DATE	to
1815	DATE	; while the forty-fifth chapter carries the same tale on to the year
1856	DATE	.

		The intervening chapters are by Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	, one dealing with the civil and the other with the military history of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	from
1816	DATE	to
1856	DATE	, as in the volumes immediately pre - vious .

		The greatest destruction of human life was during the bombardment of the city of Acre by the British , Austrians , and Turks , in
November , 1840	DATE	, which is thus described : '' The Allies had midshipmen at their mast-heads to direct aud correct the aim , and , whenever the smoke grew too thick , desisted for a short time .

		Yet the bom - bardment went on with very little relaxation for nearly three hours .

		A most frightful explosion then flung half the town into the air , and shook every ship to her keel , the concussion knocking down the seamen at their guns half a mile away .

		The grand magazine had blown up , killing , it is believed , upwards of 1200 people , and ab - solutely wrecking a space of about 60,000 square yards .

		This awful catastrophe sounded the fate of the town . ''

		Wars almost forgotten fill the pages , and place is found for the exploits of
Cochrane	PERSON	and
Brook	LOCATION	, reminders of two most romantic lives .

		Arctic explorations cut no small figure ; while the civil history concerns itself with the intro - duction of steam , proving anew the conservat - ism of constituted authorities when confronted with radical changes in method .

		The most important of the wars treated is that of the
Crimea	LOCATION	; and the statement recently made , that
Japan	LOCATION	finds a precedent for attacking the Rus - sian squadron at Port
Arthur	PERSON	before the dec - laration of war in the course of
Russia	LOCATION	toward
Turkey	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the Crimean war in
1853	DATE	, is effectually disproved .

		The Sultan made his formal declaration on
October 4	DATE	of that year ; the battle of
Sinope	LOCATION	, in which Rus - sia completely destroyed the squadron of
Osman Pasha	PERSON	, was not fought until
November 30	DATE	, and then Osman fired the first gun in response to the Russian demand for his surrender .

		It is true that
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Prussia	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	were restraining the Turks from attacking , and had lost them a material advantage on land ; but
Russia	LOCATION	was in no way restrained , and was clearly within the limits of international law in preventing Osman from supplying the Turk - ish troops in
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, as he had intended doing .

		The seventh volume is differentiated from its predecessors by the appearance of the '' Sir '' before Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's name , in sign of the knight - hood conferred upon him in
1902	DATE	as a recogni - tion of the value of the present work .

		This is the most readable of all the volumes , by reason of its contemporaneousness , and is noteworthy in this country as showing the incidents in which men of the British and American navies fought side by side , as in the battle of the Peiho Forts in
November , 1859	DATE	, when
Commodore Tattnall	ORGANIZATION	gave utterance to the remark , daily gaining in significance , ' ^ Blood is thicker than water '' ; the landing of American sailors and marines after the bombardment of
Alexandria	LOCATION	in
July , 1882	DATE	, and the march to Peking during the Boxer outbreak .

		The panic that seized the British in the first-named incident , as recorded by Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	, is not mentioned by Sir Will - iam
Clowes	PERSON	in the narrative ; and several omis - sions of the sort do not enter into his consider - ation , as is usual in history .

		The volume is divided into three chapters , two by Sir
William	PERSON	on the civil and military history of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	respectively , and one on voyages and discoveries since
1857	DATE	, by Sir
Clements R. Markham	PERSON	.

		The civil history , since it includes all that has made war-ships modern in the way of heavy guns , rapid-fire guns , and the armor to withstand them , is most informing in spite of its necessary tech - nicalities .

		Nothing is said concerning the ves - sels like the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' built in
England	LOCATION	for the Confederate States ; nor is the debt to
Ericsson	ORGANIZATION	and other American inventors of the Civil War period acknowledged .

		The chap - ter on voyages and discoveries does not con - tain any accounts of the laying of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	cable , as might be supposed , but it appears briefly in the military history , and the
Ameri	PERSON	- can initiative there is not mentioned .

		The part of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in deposing
William Walker	PERSON	, '' last of the filibusters , '' is set forth ; and there was in general , at this time , an in - terference in the affairs of the Spanish - American republics that would hardly be tolerated to-day .

		Many entertaining anecdotes of older days diversify the pages of the work , but the deep - est impression conveyed is that of the police service performed by the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	through - out the world for the benefit of civilization and commerce .

		There is no dearth of criti - cism anywhere in the book , from Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's strictures on
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Madison	PERSON	, and occasional dabs at the Federalists of their 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, day as well , to comments on the failure of British naval authorities to awaken to modern needs interspersed through Sir
William Clowes	PERSON	's narrative .

		All this forms a marked contrast to the work on '' The
New American Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
John D. Long	PERSON	, formerly secretary of our navy , who has nothing but praise for all that has been done by Americans in the way of build - ing war-ships , and of their conduct during the recent war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Two ofl & cers of our navy , and two only , fall under Mr.
Long	PERSON	's displeasure ; and the value of the criticism in these cases may be best judged if we state at once that these officers are the victors of the battles of
Manila Bay	LOCATION	and of
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Eear-Admiral -LRB- then Commodore -RRB-
Schley	PERSON	, for the way in which the ''
Brooklyn	LOCATION	'' was man - aged , and Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	for approving of his management , fall under the displeasure of the former head of the naval department .

		The effect is perhaps not what was intended .

		The late Rear - Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	upon more than one occasion was compelled to disobey the orders of the
Board of Strategy	ORGANIZATION	during the war with
Spain	LOCATION	; but there is nothing but praise for that body , and its mistakes are not even hinted at .

		The late Eear-Admiral Samp - son is believed on good authority to have been more instrumental than any single officer in our navy in preventing the introduction of smokeless powder before the war .

		But this striking lack of modern equipment on the part of Mr.
Long	PERSON	and his subordinates is not ex - plained , except in so far as he says that experiments had been in progress for some time previous to the war with smokeless pow - der .

		But the only statement made regarding the failure of our ships to be provided with it is contained in a single sentence , '' Smokeless powder was introduced into the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	during the war with
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		There is a somewhat disingenuous excuse given , in another place , to the effect that there was not enough smokeless powder in the coun - try to equip all the guns of all the ships , there - fore it was thought best to equip only a few ships .

		As a matter of fact , the only war-ships of the
United States	LOCATION	that were equipped with smokeless powder during the hostilities of
1898	DATE	were those bought from
Great Britain	LOCATION	, smokeless powder and all , -- the navy depart - ment under Secretary Long fitting out none of them .

		As a result of this indiscriminate praise and lack of discriminating criticism , the book is not a valuable one ; nor does its author 's official access to papers not at the com - mand of the public seem to have been of much service to him .

		The generally received opinion that Mr.
Koosevelt	PERSON	, while assistant secretary of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	under Mr.
Long	PERSON	, was responsible for the shipment to Admiral Dewey of the munitions of war which made the victory at
Manila	LOCATION	possible , is rather elaborately dis - proved .

		Take it all in all , '' The New Amer - ican
Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' is a book that could only be written by an American who believes that his country - men can do no wrong unless they chance to disagree with him personally .

Modern Germany	LOCATION	.

		* With the death of
Herman Grimm	PERSON	there passed from his enviable place in the life of
Berlin	LOCATION	a man , who , as Professor
Francke	PERSON	had well observed , was `` the most eminent advo - cate of aesthetic culture , the principal , if not sole , upholder of the classic tradition of Wei - mar and
Jena	PERSON	. ''

		In the 419 compact pages of the autobiography of
Sebastian Hensel	PERSON	, the only child of
Fanny Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, we have , as its title indicates , * ■ * ■ an epitome of
Germany	LOCATION	's years of schooling , '' the period in which a nation ceased to be chiefly the land of poets and philosophers , in order to become an aggressive leader in commerce , manufactures , military affairs , and wealth -- passing from '' the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	'' to `` the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Hensel was born into the celebrated Men - delssohn family , that line distinguished by
Lessing	PERSON	's friend , the philosopher Moses Men - delssohn , by that broad-minded financier and generous citizen ,
Abraham Mendelssohn	PERSON	- Bartholdy , and chiefly by those heaven-gifted children of the latter , Fanny and
Felix	PERSON	, -- not to mention other relatives , connections , and associates which made the palatial home in the Leipzigerstrasse the attractive place of resort for all manner of conspicuous talents in the days of the capital 's greatest intellectual and aesthetic brilliancy -- the centre of a culture which was as strong and sane and full-orbed as it was high and delicate and refined .

		THE DIAL 296
Fanny Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	married the painter , Professor
Wilhelm Hensel	PERSON	.

		Sebastian , their only child , developed in an atmosphere which well-nigh predestinated him to the purely aes - thetic life , and his own mental gifts were by no means discreditable to the circle to which he belonged .

		As a matter of fact his days were spent in large practical concerns : the management of an extensive landed property in eastern
Prussia	LOCATION	, the office of secretary of a great building association which lent its share in creating the splendors of '' new
Berlin	LOCATION	, '' and , particularly , in the very successful direc - tion of the luxurious KaiserJiof ^ the first cos - mopolitan hotel in the German capital .

		Those who have enjoyed the grateful comforts of the Cafe
Bauer	PERSON	^ at the intersection of
Berlin	LOCATION	's chief promenades , will be interested to learn here that it was
Hensel	PERSON	who first caused this institution to migrate from
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Apart from any final tendencies in this book , it is a keen delight to come into closest asso - ciation with so uniformly gifted and animated a group as that in which
Hensel	ORGANIZATION	always moved .

		He surely was baptized with a liberal handful of the water of the Spree , for he was clever from the cradle -- a Berliner Kind through and through .

		To such a person a sprightly style comes as naturally as breathing to other people : stabbing wit , mordant satire , corrosive sarcasm , jeux d'esprit , crisp daring phrases which verge upon slang , but fly straight to the mark , a continuous crackle of sparkling ori - ginality -- sometimes more stout than delicate -- these features are alive in every page of the book .

		There were always excellent women in this society , as the world has already come to know in HensePs splendid '' Life of the Men - delssohn Family , '' which , now in its eleventh edition , has become a classic .

		Like
Hensel	PERSON	's autobiography , it was at first intended merely as a family-book for the children and imme - diate connections .

		Both books have passed on from private uses to become the common property of cultured humanity everywhere .

		The present work is , in fact , a continuation of the '' Life , '' which came to an abrupt end with the death of
Fanny Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Hen - sel -RRB- in
1847	DATE	.

		Besides opening a fuller view of admirable people we had come to know in the `` Life , '' it carries the history further , es - pecially in the new letters of Kebecca Men - delssohn -LRB- wife of the great mathematician Dirichlet -RRB- , addressed to her nephew .

		The book is a modern criticism of life against a back - ground of high culture .

		In tendency it is democratic and political , given to comment upon the larger history of the times , delight - fully familiar , stocked with a fund of good stories , and , above all , up-to-date .

		If , at times , it may jar romantic souls by its tone of superiority toward the alluring world of dreams , its insistence upon reality and its impatience of mummery make it good reading for our day .

		However practical its author may be in business , he inherits a full stock of the in - flexible Prussian sense of honor , which stands out in refreshing contrast to the `` graft '' of
Vienna	LOCATION	, with which the author was forced to come in contact in his business ventures .

		In - cidentally , the most refreshing thing in the book is the account of stubborn opposition on the part of the
Berlin	LOCATION	authorities to giving a '' concession '' to a great corporation which might lead to a monopoly of the food - supply of the capital .

		Hensel satirizes their provin - cialism , but there is nothing finer than the watch-dog pertinacity with which they stood on guard to prevent any exploiting of the common peoples ' necessities of life .

		After an unusually wide outlook upon the greater world the author comes to the final conclusion : '' The life of a land - holder whose activities are carried on upon a large scale still seems to me the most enviable which can be imagined , ex - cept , perhaps , that of a gifted artist . ''

		The book is so full of interest that it is use - less to attempt to pick out particular features ; it is printed on good paper and in clear , honest Eoman letters , though with a culpable array of minor errors .

		Despite the fact that many of the most significant figures of the nine - teenth century appear at close range , there is unfortunately -LRB- as too often is the case with German books -RRB- no index .

		Hensel 's autobiography would more than justify a first-rate English translation .

		In our '' new education '' we have many conditions which could gain light from these ample ex - periences .

		Although some of us are still old - fashioned enough to hold , first of all , to Romantic values , to '' The light that never was on sea or land .

		The consecration and the poet 's dream '' as the supreme Guide of Life , we can all be profited by this intimate story of a high - minded man who was most successful in deal - ing with the modern world of affairs .

		Christianity versus Dogma .

		* The late
Auguste Sabatier	PERSON	, having pub - lished in
1897	DATE	his '' Outlines of a
Philosophy of Religion	ORGANIZATION	based upon Philosophy and His - tory , '' planned as a sequel a work devoted to the history of the Roman Catholic and Protestant dogmas , in which an attempt would be made to distinguish the genuine elements of the
Chris	PERSON	- tian faith , and separate them from the errors which had accumulated under the guise of Christianity .

		This work was completed in the rough at the end of
1900	DATE	; and
Madame Sabatier	PERSON	in a prefatory note thus describes the author 's feeling regarding it : `` On
December 2 , 1900	DATE	, my husband joyfully called me to him , saying , • I have put the last period to my book . '

		And while I was congratulating him , he added : * Now I shall let it rest during our journey to
Egypt	LOCATION	and Palestine .

		It will take me three months to revise it on our return , but I shall not modify its form , for I have said that which I desire to say .

		If accident be - falls me during the journey remember this : my book must come out whatever happens .

		There it lies , ' he continued , turning to his desk ; < you will give it to M ^ D ^ goz and
Roberty	PERSON	, who will both willingly revise it ; but it must appear ! '

		He repeated the words with emphasis , separating each syllable to show that this was his well-considered determination . ''

		Although
M. Sabatier	PERSON	had long been out of health , and evidently was aware of his slender hold on life , he did not cease to press forward , and when urged to rest would say , '' I have work planned out for two hundred years . ''

		He died in the midst of his labors , as a warrior dies in battle , and did not even make that journey to Palestine which he had looked forward to as the crown of his toil .

		Under these circumstances , those who had to see the book through the press naturally hesitated to make alterations ; '' with pious re - spect they have hardly touched the form of this work , preferring to leave some repetitions rather than risk weakening the thought , and not daring to undertake the work of condensa - tion which its author would have performed . ''

		It thus results that the book is unnecessarily long for the matter it contains , and many of the statements in it are repeated in different places in a manner rather discouraging to the reader .

		While it was entirely right to publish it so , it is probable that a condensed edition , prepared by one of the author 's disciples at
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, would find an appre - ciative public .

		would wish to see an index supplied , and it would be better to print the notes , which now constitute an appendix , as footnotes to the pages where they belong .

		Putting aside such minor criticisms as we have offered , we have nothing but praise for the book .

		The present reviewer is not one of those who can pretend to estimate the accuracy of the historical data given , but it may be said that not only was
M. Sabatier	PERSON	a student of the first rank , but his conclusions , as regards their main and essential outlines , do not differ from those already reached by others who had used rational historical methods .

		It is not probable that the author wished the work to be regarded as a contribution to historical research , so much as an interpretation of the known facts of history , in the light of our knowledge of the human mind .

		It is precisely by this ap - plication of psychology to history that the latter is transformed from a dry record of real or supposed events to a living reality , vitally connected with the life we live to-day .

		The discussion of the conflict between Christianity and Dogma may be approached in two different ways .

		To admit that there is a conflict is to condemn the latter , since the validity of the dogmas discussed depends upon their assumed Christian authority .

		M. Saba - tier says in his preface : '' Two systems of theol - ogy still confront one another : the theology of authority and the theology of experience , '' and it is evident from the first which he re - gards as truly Christian .

		The work is that of a man who has found in the religion of Christ that which directly appeals to the human mind , -- to which the support derived from external authority is not only no support , but a hindrance .

		Dogma is thus condemned a priori ^ as it were , and the second method of discussion , that in which the actual historical facts are considered , seems in a measure un - necessary .

		If Christ was in no sense the founder of a new body of dogma , what did he do ?

		M. Saba - tier does not leave us in doubt . ''

		The essential characteristic of the gospel of
Christ	LOCATION	, that by which it marks a new epoch in the religious and moral development of humanity , is that it has made things that were formerly essential and of principal im - portance -- priesthood , rite , exterior law -- to be acces - sories ; and on the other hand has raised those which were formerly derived and subordinate -- heart piety and relations with God -- to be things of final and cap - ital importance , the very essence of religion .

		Thus the religious world has been reversed ; all its relations have been inverted because its centre of gravity has been dis -

		Never in all human history was there a more radical revolution and change '' -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- . ''

		Jesus promised his disciples the help and guidance of the spirit of God , in all circumstances , for all their needs , and in all that they should have to do or to suffer , but in no sense to contribute a new scriptural code to which Christians would thenceforth be forever enslaved .

		How , then , came it to pass that the Church learned to distrust the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's promise , and hastens to build up again that which he destroyed -- the absolute authority of the so-called divine letter ? ''

		-LRB- p. 299 -RRB- .

		The explanation is this : when new thoughts , laws , or customs appear to conquer the world , they do but engraft themselves on those which previously existed .

		New blood introduced into a race may profoundly modify it , but it does not summarily banish that which is old .

		The time of Christ was a time of religious unrest , and as to-day , people were seeking something to replace the faith which was rapidly failing them .

		The Christian gospel , a veritable spir - itual communion , exalted the subjective side of human personality , and made the value of external things seem as nothing to the worth of the human soul .

		Not all were citizens of
Rome	LOCATION	, but all who chose might be children of God , -- nay , all were so , if they would but acknowledge it .

		It is not difficult to see how this doctrine , based on the most essential char - acters of the human mind , interpreted far and wide by so great a master of thought and language as
Paul	PERSON	, should have gained accept - ance .

		The phenomenon was , after all , none other than a part of that struggle for freedom which has convulsed peoples from the earliest dawn of history , and will do so yet again .

		Thus understood , it takes its place as one of the upward steps of mankind , a real advance of incalculable importance , but not unchecked by that sinister hand which always bars the way .

		As a matter of fact , the old paganism , supposed to be destroyed , was bound to have its revenge , and it took it in full measure .

		Christianity , so-called , became an officially governed institution ; the spirit was denied to those who were not in authority ; God was no more approachable than some haughty em - peror .

		Not only was the purpose of Christ defeated , but the very name of the Master was applied to that which he had set aside .

		Was the gospel of Christ therefore a dead letter ?

		By no means .

		It held its own in the recesses of the people 's hearts , like a defeated but not conquered people in the fastnesses of their mountains .

		Every now and then it surged for - ward , often to be condemned as heresy .

		Even - tually it gained a remarkable success in the reformation initiated by Luther , and protest - antism stood for freedom long - denied .

		The sinister hand , however , had not lost its cunning , and protestantism itself became bound by the dogma of the infallibility of the Biblical text -- a dogma more absurd and less easy to defend than that of papal supremacy .

		In mod - ern times this also has been undermined , and
M. Sabatier	PERSON	sees the dawn of a new era in which Christ shall come to his own .

		May it indeed be so , but it will not be without a strug - gle , nor will Christianity ever maintain itself as a passive thing .

		Custom may pass into habit , instincts may be formed , but the life of the Spirit is always life , the golden rim on the edge of consciousness , the point of contact with the beyond .

		Herein , indeed , lies the assurance of the reality and permanence of our being .

		A PREACHER OF THE LiARGER HOPE .

		* It is wholly fitting that a year of reverential silence should have followed the death of a man like
Dean Farrar	PERSON	, and that the first voice to break the silence with the story of his life should be that of his son .

		Mr.
Reginald Farrar	PERSON	's task has not grown less difficult , how - ever , with the lapse of months , for delay has whetted expectation .

		Now that the authorita - tive life is published , many of us will doubtless feel that we had come to expect too much of it .

		That it should take rank in the first class of biographies was scarcely reasonable to hope , since it was written by a man who makes no claim to literary genius , and whose very near - ness to his subject precludes the rendering of ultimate judgments .

		Moreover he himself has cherished no ambitious designs , but has `` aimed at producing rather a memoir of such length as should be within the compass of the general reader than a complete and exhaustive bio - graphy . ''

		That his work is ideal so far as it goes , no one will hesitate to admit .

		But there may perhaps remain even among '' general readers '' some who will be unwilling to forego their larger expectations for the author 's mod - est purpose , and who will feel that in this case , in which material was so abundant and so in - teresting , two volumes would have been better than one .

		Instead of leading to the maddening confusion in which this method often results , the multiple-narrative is so skil - fully managed as to add a wealth of vivid per - sonal interest to the story .

		No one could have told the history of
Frederick Farrar	PERSON	's days at King 's College so delightfully as his fellow - student
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	, who naively confesses that
Farrar	ORGANIZATION	usually took first prize and Arnold ^ ^ proxime accessiti * ^ except that sometimes when the contests were theological the order was reversed !

		Of the young master 's early struggles at
Marlborough	LOCATION	, when the college was new and '' all things lay in doubt , '' one of his pupils writes : ''
F. W. F.	PERSON	came to
Marlborough	LOCATION	like an apparition -- a flame of fire -- kindling enthusiasm for all that was noble and chivalrous .

		No one ever was so young as he was in those days , and I suppose he was then twenty - three or twenty - four ; but the marvel was , how he knew such a lot and associated himself with us little fellows , as if we could minister to his happiness ... He played foot - ball -LRB- Rugby -RRB- like a madman , running amuck with his eyes shut , and got awfully mauled , laetissima pulvere farra , as some fellows said , much to his delight . ''

		Another pupil tells how , in his fifteen busy years of teaching at
Harrow	LOCATION	, ♦ ' his exuberance of rhetoric , though in latter years it offended adult audiences , awed and fascinated boys , and his solemn yet glowing appeals for righteous - ness and purity and moral courage left perma - nent dints on our hearts , and -- what is less usual -- on our lives . ''

		Friends , assistants , and various members of his family tell the more familiar story of his life as
Canon	ORGANIZATION	of West - minster and
Dean of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, celebrating with loving particularity the countless activities and deeds of friendliness which made him one of the most influential men of the century .

		Glimpses of his childhood , of his boyish days of privation and rigorous discipline at
King William 's College	ORGANIZATION	, Isle of Man , -- where the absence of cheap literature saved him '' from becoming the debauchee of shoddy fiction '' and gave him time to develop his literary bent by committing to memory long passages of the English poets , -- and of his undergraduate life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, are quoted from his own stories of ``
Eric	PERSON	, '' `` St.
Winifred	PERSON	's , '' and ``
Julian Home	PERSON	, '' which are to some extent autobiograph - ical .

		Whenever the author himself becomes the narrator , he is straightforward and effec - tive , fulfilling the ideal which he sets himself when he says : '' I have tried impartially to paint the portrait of my father as he lived , not ignoring the fact that his work was often the subject of criticism , but writing throughout , as a son must needs write of such a father , in a spirit of loving reverence . ''

		Many apparent omissions in the book are due to the author 's unwillingness to trespass on ground that his father had covered in his own writings .

		The chapter which one natur - ally expects to find on Dean
Farrar	PERSON	's friends , for instance , -- a chapter which would have been of especial interest to Americans , since the great churchman had many warm personal friends in this country , -- is lacking , because it would have repeated much of what is contained in `` Men I Have Known . ''

		Wisely enough , however , a condensed statement of his religious belief is quoted from '' Eternal Hope , '' so that exact knowledge of his right to the title '' preacher of the larger hope '' may be in pos - session of all readers of his biography .

		One feels in closing the volume that the letters quoted in it though too many for artistic effect , are of great significance nevertheless as showing how generously the world responds to a life like
Dean Farrar	ORGANIZATION	's .

		The picture left on one 's mind , though so variously composed , is clear and satisfying , and does justice , we are glad to feel , to a man who , besides being a great teacher , writer , and preacher , was one of '' the saints elect , whom all hearts confess . ''

		THE DIAL 299 same period -- the earlj years of the sixteenth century -- in treatment and purpose they are yet so entirely different that there is room for both .

		The distinguishing characteristic of the French work is its picturesqueness .

		The familiar facts are grouped ronnd some central point , -- as a picture , a church , a phrase from some old document , -- in a way to create a vivid impression which will not soon escape the memory , the whole effect being like a series of clear-cut silhouettes .

		Under the title ''
Rome	LOCATION	and the Renaissance , '' the author sets his boundaries of place to one city alone , his boundaries of time to the pontificate of Julius 11 .

		-LRB- 1503-1513 -RRB- .

		A study of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	apart from the city of
Florence	LOCATION	might seem at first thought like the play of Hamlet without the character ; but considering the embar - rassment of riches here , elimination becomes a wise policy .

		Michelangelo busy in the
Sistine Chapel	LOCATION	,
Raphael	PERSON	in the
Vatican Stanze	ORGANIZATION	,
Bramante	PERSON	in the
Vatican Belvedere	ORGANIZATION	and at the new St.
Peters	PERSON	, the belligerent but art-loving old man in the pontifical chair planning and directing all , -- these are figures large enough and absorbing enough to warrant our ignoring for the time being some no less great or even greater work elsewhere .

		The writer who can supplement wise powers of elimination by equally wise powers of classification travels on the right road and attains success in the presentation of his theme , -- as in the present case .

		A good illus - tration of the author 's method may be gained from his opening chapter , in which we are introduced to the future Pope
Julius II	PERSON	.

		The chapter is called ''
Melozzo	PERSON	's Freeco , '' -- meaning the large picture called `` Sixtus IV. , Founder of the Vatican Li - brary , '' familiar to all who have visited the Picture Gallery of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	and to many others through photographs .

		Probably we have thought of it less in its historical significance than as a monumental work of Umbrian art .

		Our author says of it : '' This fresco by
Melozzo da Forli	ORGANIZATION	is a great page of history , as well as a great page of painting .

		It helps us marvellously to understand those Popes of the Renaissance , with all their qualities and their faults , their political rather than religious turn of mind , their humanist predilections , their passion for building and beautifying the city of
Rome	LOCATION	, their nepotism .

		In the haughty old man seated there , nothing recalls the
Francesco della Rovere	PERSON	of earlier days , the humble monk of the Order of the
Minor Brethren	ORGANIZATION	, born of obscure parentage in
Ligurian Savona	LOCATION	.

		He sits like a king , in a splendid hall , surrounded by high dignitaries of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, all very young , -- all , furthermore , his nearest kinsmen .

		His profile is singularly clearcut , and singularly hard , also , -- as is not nn - Buited to the all too clearly proven accomplice of the
Pazzi	LOCATION	. ''

		Each one of the six characters -- four of them '' nephews '' -- is in turn made the subject of an his - torical sketch , ending with
Giuliano della Rovere	PERSON	, now thirty-one years of age , and for the
last six years	DATE
Cardinal of San Pietro	ORGANIZATION	in Vincoli . ''

		It is upon this figure that
Melozzo	PERSON	has concentrated all the vigor of his brush , with a presentiment , it would seem , of the great place that history was to give to his subject .

		What energy in the face , already so deeply marked by am - bition I What fire in the glance I And , withal , a certain veiled sadness , and that unsatisfied look which comes to the elect of destiny when their star too long delays its coming . ''

		Another highly picturesque chapter is the one called `` A Family Sanctuary -LRB- 1505-1508 -RRB- , '' namely , the
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not only do we learn how it came to be the favorite and domestic sanctuary of the
Rovere	PERSON	family , but also how it marks a memorable date and an important phase in the history of sepulchral monuments in general .

		`` The mediaeval conception of a bier and the dead figure lying upon it , -- a severe and stately theme which had so long inspired the
Pisani	PERSON	, the Cosmati , the admirable Tuscan sculptors of the Quattrocento , -- was now embodied for the last time in this church by
Andrea Sansovino	PERSON	, and with excess of emphasis in the tombs of Sforza and of
Girolamo Basso	PERSON	. ''

		The translation of this work has been done admirably by
John Dennie	PERSON	, and fifty-two full-page illustrations have been well chosen to en - force the argument of the text .

		The German work , ' < The Art of the Italian Renaissance , '' is by Professor
Heinrich	PERSON	Wo ` fflin of
Berlin University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He considers the word
Renais	PERSON	- sance as covering the first twenty-five years of the sixteenth century , and says that in all the history of Italian art there is no more obscure period than this which we call its golden age .

		The task which be sets himself is the forever tempting but forever im - possible one of seeking the sources of artistic crea - tion , of revealing the inner sanctuary of the artistic mind in the act of composition .

		In a prefatory note .

		Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	, Director of the Na - tional Gallery at
Dublin	LOCATION	, says : '' Anyone reading
Herr Wolfflin	PERSON	carefully may fairly assume that he is following the workings of
Raphael	PERSON	's mind as he built up things like the
Disputa	LOCATION	, the School of
Athens	LOCATION	and the
Madonna di San Sisto	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		If only the learned German , or anyone , could ever do any - thing like this , that would indeed be something to win eternal fame and gratitude !

		But perhaps he is as successful as the nature of the case allows ; and in chapters on
Leonardo da Vinci	LOCATION	,
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	,
Raphael	PERSON	,
Fra Bartolommeo	LOCATION	, and
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	, their technical methods of producing desired effects are discussed with no small amount of discrimina - tion and insight .

		These chapters occupy about two - thirds of the volume ; but they are , after all , less valuable than the remaining third devoted to '' The New Feeling , '' `` The New Beauty , '' and `` The New Pictorial Form . ''

		The generalizations on these sub - jects are enforced by parallel illustrations showing the variance of treatment of the same theme as presented by the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries respectively .

		The New Feeling in art was nothing less than a new conception of human greatness and dignity .

		Men developed a feeling for the impor - tant , the solemn , the grandiose , in comparison with which the fifteenth century must have appeared awkward and timid .

		There was also a tendency to weaken the expression of emotion .

		For example , -- `` In the Scene of the
Annunciation	LOCATION	,
Mary	PERSON	is no longer the girl gazing in joyful alarm at the unexpected visitor , as
Filippo	LOCATION	,
Baldovinetti	LOCATION	, or Lorenzo di Credi painted her , nor the modest maiden casting her eyes down like a candidate for 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, confirmation ; but , absolutely composed , yr \ th a royal bearing , she receives the angel like a fashionable lady who is not to be taken by surprise ... Art is no longer middle class , but aristocratic ... Only important events were considered worthy of notice .

		In the stories of the Qaattrocentists there are a number of homely , idyllic touches , which have little to do with the real theme , but delight the modern spectator with their simplicity ... The interest of the later historical picture was concentrated entirely on the actual event .

		This entailed a rigorous condensation of the diffuse elements hith - erto introduced in
Lives of the Virgin	LOCATION	and kindred subjects .

		... Reality was the first thought of the fifteenth century , whether the result was or was not beautiful .

		The sixteenth century banished the stereotyped forms whenever they were unlovely .

		The
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	is the frail beauty and not the ema - ciated penitent , and the Baptist takes on the strong virile beauty of a man who has grown up in wind and weather , without a trace of privation or asceticism .

		The youthful St.
John	PERSON	again , is depicted as the model of a perfectly beautiful boy , and in this form became a favorite figure of the epoch . ''

		Ideals of beauty themgelves underwent a change .

		* ' The taste of the early Renaissance inclined to undevel - oped forms , and slim , agile figures .

		The angular grace and the salient outlines of youth had a greater charm than the rounded abundance of womanhood or the ripe strength of manhood .

		The girl-angels of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	and Filippino , with their sharp joints and lean arms , represent the ideal of youth - ful beauty .

		The sixteenth century had a different standard .

		... Its gallery of beauty contains none but mature types , e. g. , the
Donna Velata	PERSON	, the
Dorothea	LOCATION	at
Berlin	LOCATION	, the
Forna	LOCATION	- rina of the Tribuna , the magnificent female figure by
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	at
Madrid	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Taste reverted to the fully devel - oped woman . ''

		Under the title '' The New Pictorial Form '' the author attempts to giasp and expound the various components which make up the idea of a rich and mature style , -- repose , space , mass , size , simplifica - tion , lucidity , enrichment , unity , and inevitability .

		An undertaking of such difficulty on the part of the writer naturally is not entirely easy on the part of the reader .

		Yet it is service for gratitude , since it is one so seldom rendered .

		It goes beyond where most histories of art end .

		In the author 's own words , near the conclusion , -- `` There is a conception of the history of Art which sees in Art merely a ' translation of life ' into pictorial language , and tries to make every style comprehensible as an expression of the prevalent spirit of the time .

		Would anyone deny that this is a profitable way of looking at the question ?

		Yet it only leads to a certain fixed point , one might almost say only as far as the point where art begins .

		Anyone who restricts himself to the subject-matter in works of art will be satisfied with it ; but as soon as he wishes to estimate things by artistic standards , he is compelled to deal with formal elements which are in themselves inexpressive , and belong to a development of a purely optical kind . ''

		It is a pity that so suggestive a book should not have had a more careful proofreading of the text , and that the hundred illustrations , well-chosen in themselves , are so badly executed that they do painfully scant justice to the great originals .

		A single-volume History of
Florence	LOCATION	in En - glish , combining in one narrative both her political and her artistic evolution , is something which has long been desired .

		Each story has been told sepa - rately very often and with much elaboration .

		But there has been no English work showing them as parts of one whole , until the publication of Mr.
Francis A. Hyett	PERSON	's work entitled • '
Florence	LOCATION	, her History and Art . ''

		The confusing conditions be - tween Blacks and Whites , the ups and downs of the Guelphs and
Ghibellines	ORGANIZATION	, the peculiar powers of the Trade Guilds , the prerogatives of the un - titled Medici , seem to have a new import when we see how closely allied these political experiments were with a great literature and a many-sided art .

		The period of the Republic -LRB- 1200-1530 -RRB- coincides very nearly with the period of greatest artistic development , and the book concerns itself mainly with the story of these three centuries .

		The diffi - culties of epitomizing two such stupendous themes must have been great , but they have been overcome triumphantly .

		The space given to Art and Litera - ture is about a fourth of tbe nearly six hundred pages ; their consideration is confessedly paren - thetical , and dependent upon the generally accepted authorities , such as
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Symonds	PERSON	,
C. C. Perkins	PERSON	,
Crowe	PERSON	and Cavalcaselle ,
Morelli	PERSON	,
Berenson	PERSON	, and others .

		Indeed , if there is any fault to be found with this book it is that the foot-notes are almost irritating in their abundance , especially when it is quite evident that the author is fully competent for independent investigation and vigorous statement when he attempts it .

		The following , concerning Architecture , will serve as an example : `` In
Florence	LOCATION	, Renaissance Architecture was born , and in
Florence	LOCATION	the disease which put an end to its existence was contracted .

		Brunelleschi was its parent , and
Michelangelo	PERSON	-LRB- more than any single man -RRB- was its destroyer .

		... In the
San Lorenzo Sacristy	ORGANIZATION	and the Laurentian Library he sowed the seeds which blossomed into the barocco . ''

		Also this , after tracing the downfall of Renaissance Art in painting : `` These painters , by a study of antique forms , merely caught a trick of expression , and their works have only the same kind of merit that is to be found in a good parody .

		Of this trick they were inordinately proud and made a great parade .

		The pedantry of Art in its Post-Raphaelite days had more to do with its overthrow than its secularization , and for this neither Paganism nor Naturalism can be held responsible .

		Nevertheless , pedantry was but a secondary cause .

		The pri - mary cause of the decadence of Renaissance Art in
Italy	LOCATION	was that Christianity and Paganism had both become shams . ''

		About the time that the great artistic work of
Italy	LOCATION	was practically completed , travellers from the north of
Europe	LOCATION	began to visit the country and to record their impressions .

		But Englishmen , even the most cultured , lacked the ability to discuss art at all at the time
Vasari	PERSON	's '' Lives '' were written , and even much later .

		The northern sight - seers were at first instructed by the inhabitants ; but they soon began to compare , to classify .

		We travel now with their accumulated experience ; but many appreciations which are easy to us now are the results of years of inquiry .

		It is worth while , therefore , to trace the growth of this SB-tthetic evolution .

		In a work called '' The Book of Italian Travel '' we have a symposium of traveller 's re - ports expressing their delight when fresh from one of the unique experiences of life .

		Poets and dramatists from the time of Chaucer had used Italian books as a mine of romantic material , but this was a different matter , and the real succession 19U4 . -RSB-

James Howell	PERSON	-LRB- 1641 -RRB- : `` She hath been always accounted the
Nurse of Policy	ORGANIZATION	, Learning ,

		She saw everything with American eyes , commenting and contrasting , always with generous appreciation and with a laudable desire to profit by her splendid social opportunities , but still retaining the old long `` - ing for home ways and home people .

		In this respect she reminds one of her famous predecessor at the same court , the first American minister 's wife ,

Fanny Burney	PERSON	and her friends .

		One of this group was
Alexander d'Arblay	PERSON	, to whom
Miss Burney	PERSON	was afterwards married .

		This mar - riage and its early fortunes gradually become the principal theme of the book , which includes sev - eral unpublished letters written by the author of ''
Evelina	PERSON	, '' by her father , and by
Edmund Burke	PERSON	.

		At
Juniper Hall	ORGANIZATION	lived for a time
M. de Narbonne	ORGANIZATION	, who as minister of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		had urged the war against
Austria	LOCATION	in the hope that the King would gain popularity and strength enough as leader in a national struggle to overawe and punish the Jacobins .

		Another member of the group was the young
Mathieu de Montmorency	ORGANIZATION	, whose generous illusions must have paled a little since the day in the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	when he had argued that in drawing up a declaration of rights the French enjoyed an advantage over the Americans , for they '' could more boldly invoke reason and allow it to speak a language more unalloyed . ''

		Among the visitors at the house were
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	and
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, and also the
Doke de la Rochefoucauld	ORGANIZATION	-
Liancourt	PERSON	, who shortly afterwards travelled exten - sively in

		It is the interchange of politenesses be - tween these persons and their English friends that Miss Hill pleasantly describes , with little effort to draw in clear outline any personage save perhaps
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	herself .

		The story gains its main interest from the fame of the characters , but also to some degree from its glimpses of English country life in the eighteenth century .

		t-v 1 1 '' • 1 • acter of Donatello s art in relation to that of his contemporaries and successors '' has heretofore appeared in English , the new book by Lord Balcarres , with fifty-eight illustrations , -LRB- im - ported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- , will be wel - comed by those interested in Renaissance sculpture .

		Except for a few introductory and concluding par - agraphs .

		Lord Balcarres presents
Donatello	ORGANIZATION	's person - ality only as it is revealed in his works ; and these are for the most part criticised singly and in chro - nological order .

		As Donatello has been called '' the 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, master of those who know , '' it is to be expected that this latest tribute to him should proceed from one of the knowing .

		The pages teem with references to works of all schools and lands , and the writer has seen the original of nearly every existing piece of sculpture , architecture , and painting that he men - tions .

		Yet , in spite of his evident erudition , he as - signs little space to debated questions of date and authenticity , and seems constantly aware that both his subject and his readers are human .

		Thus he is in harmony with the spirit of Donatello , who cared primarily not for abstractions , but for life as he saw it in roguish children , in calm and majestic citizens of middle age , and in gnarled and bald old men .

		In his discussion of
Donatello	ORGANIZATION	's sense of distance .

		Lord Balcarres compares his work with that of classic sculptors , and calls our attention to the mean - ingless summit of the Trajan column , to the lack of variation in the reliefs of different altitudes upon Roman arches , and to the
Parthenon Frieze	LOCATION	, which , when in position , '' was only visible at a most acute angle and in a most unfavorable light , '' so that the '' skill of Phidias was never fully revealed until its home had been changed from
Athens	LOCATION	to Blooms - bury . ''

		The protruding forehead of Zeus and the deep-set eyes of the Vatican Medusa are merely '' accidents or else coincidences . ''

		We are told , too , that ''
Donatello	PERSON	was certainly no realist in the sense that an ideal was excluded , nor could he have been led by realism into servile imitation or the multipli - cation of realities '' ; that he ' < took the lead among those who founded their art upon the observation of nature . ''

		However , his `` love of nature was lim - ited to the human aspect , '' so that he `` could only make cut flowers and withered fruit . ''

		His drapery , hands , grouping , technique , relation to Gothic art , and sense of light and shade and of proportion , are all treated in detail .

		It seems perhaps irrelevant to notice typographical mistakes , to wish that the book were divided into chapters , or to wonder why we are nowhere given
Donatello	ORGANIZATION	's full aame .

		Our writer uses few superlatives , yet as we read his descriptions of statues , busts , medallions , singing - galleries , doors , fonts , tombs , and pulpits , we catch something of his enthusiasm .

		Donatello was mas - ter of low relief ; his
Martelli	PERSON	shield presents the most satisfactory of griffins , his
Gattamelata	PERSON	is one of the world 's two greatest equestrian statues , and his St.
George	PERSON	is too perfect to challenge competi - tion .

		Surely it is well that we have so careful and comprehensive a presentation of this versatile , fas - cinating , and robust sculptor .

		Lift and labor The second series of '' The Life and 0 / the people Labor of the People of
London	LOCATION	'' of
London	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- , written by Mr.
Charles Booth	PERSON	with the assistance of several of his asso - ciates , deals with the large subject of Industry .

		As the work comprises five volumes of three hun - dred pages each , and the style is yet concise , it provides its readers with a very extensive view of
London	LOCATION	's industrial conditions .

		Further , it sug - gests the trend of modern industry , whose char - acteristics in general , as Mr.
Booth	PERSON	says , do not differ greatly from those prevailing in
London	LOCATION	.

		He employs a double method of inquiry : he at - tempts to ascertain , first , how people live ; and , second , how they work .

		After a general survey of the situation , he divides the whole population of
London	LOCATION	according to its occupations , and applies the statistics already given to each industrial sec - tion .

		His classification is elaborate , -- dealing first with the age , sex , and social conditions of the peo - ple engaged in a group of trades , and then in more detail with those in each separate trade .

		After four volumes of statistics , Mr.
Booth	PERSON	makes a number of comparisons between the various trade sections , as to apparent poverty , earnings , social conditions , etc. , and then draws some conclusions on the subjects of employment , trade-unionism , wages , and industrial remedies .

		He recognizes , as the characteristics of modern industry , ' < The speculative forestalling of wants , a great com - plexity of operation , and increased responsibility of management . ''

		In his chapter on trade-unions , he does not attempt definitely to fix the relations between capital and labor , but says : '' There is neither fixity nor finality in industrial relationships , and there are no sharply dividing lines . ''

		His conclusions are interesting and suggestive . ''

		There is no single panacea , '' he says , `` no philosopher 's stone by which economists or statesmen can touch the surging life of
London	LOCATION	, even with the glint of an age of gold .

		It is indeed not this or that par - ticular remedy that is the most essential need , but rather a vital movement ; not laws or regulations , but the creation of a quiet determination on the part of men and women , rich and poor alike , to do their individual share . ''

		The Japanese ^ f ^ ^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ J f ° < ^ Somewhat un - methodof willingly coming into consciousness physical training .

		^ ^ ^ ^ jjjg Japanese have a civilization fully comparable with our own , notably in that final boast of
Christendom	LOCATION	, the art of making war , we are coming more and more to study Japanese methods , in the belief that possibly there is more to be learned from them than we have to teach their inventors .

		This is illustrated by two books written by Mr.
H. Irving Hancock	PERSON	, `` Japanese Phys - ical Training '' and `` Physical Training for Women by Japanese Methods '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		In both the old jiu-jitsu exercises of the samurai ^ the feudal re - tainers of the ancien rSgime , are set forth with just enough explicitness of detail to awaken curi - osity and stimulate the inventive American mind to experimentation .

		The two books are differen - tiated by prescribing a specific series o ^ gymnastic and calisthenic exercises for women , looking toward complete bodily development , while those for men are suggestive rather than descriptive .

		Jiu-jutsu is a complete regimen for obtaining and maintain - ing health and strength .

		A dietary of the simplest sort is prescribed , which includes the daily absorp -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 303 tion of a gallon of water -- a procedure in complete opposition to all conceptions of Western trainers .

		With no apparatus except a strong bamboo wand , which is used only in a limited number of cases , the subject is then developed symmetrically with a view to injuring others without being injured himself , there being no restriction in the means to be em - ployed to either end .

		Hair may be pulled , bones broken , and spines put out of commission with a celerity and freedom that indicates one reason why the Japanese are so uniformly polite to one another -- it would hardly be profitable to be rude to a per - son who is able to dislocate one 's neck without warning .

		It is to be said that Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	does nut prescribe all the methods by which death can be inflicted in this glorification of the '' rough-and - tumble fight '' of Christian lands , holding a certain reserve that is rather stimulating to the imagina - tion , and forcing a reconsideration of the restric - tions Christians place upon hand-to-hand conflicts -- restrictions , be it noted , as unknown to the ath - letes of classical times as to the samurai .

		The individual in hit relation !

		to society .

		There never was a time when so much was written about the various problems that concern the life of the individual , the history of the race , the relationship between man and his fellows , and between man and the state .

		Yet perhaps there never was a time when it was so hard for a person of limited time to ac - quire , through reading , a general knowledge of these questions .

		The trouble lies in the over-specialization of subject : the biological aspect is treated , not in one book , but in a great series of books ; the his - torical aspect in another series , the political in a third , the educational in a fourth , and so on through a long list , until it is almost impossible for a begin - ner to make more than a chance choice of aspects .

		It is safe to say that , with the probable exception of Mr.
C. Hanf	PERSON	ord
Henderson	PERSON	's '' Education and the Larger Life , '' which treats the philosophical rather than the practical side , there has been no attempt at a correlation of all the great questions , before the publication of Prof.
Nathaniel S. Shaler	PERSON	's study of the individual and the government entitled '' The Citizen '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is , in a way , a sequel to the author 's work on '' The Indi - vidual , '' which , by its simplicity , its convincing logic , and its sane philosophy of life , won its way to a remarkable popularity a few years ago .

		The pres - ent work has all the qualities that recommended the previous one , and adds that of definiteness in the treatment of questions that apply directly to the daily life of every American citizen .

		In a space of only three hundred pages it is of course impossible to discuss fully a series of questions that includes the origin of mankind , the beginnings of government , the share of the average man in the state , party allegiance , origin and distribution of wealth , educa - tion , public health , universal suffrage , the negro question , imperialism , the American spirit , and a dozen other topics of no less importance and inter - est. .

		The questions are hardly more than formulated here ; but they are so stated , with all the arguments pro and con regarding them , that the reader who approaches them with a receptive spirit leaves them better prepared to form judgments concerning them , to recognize their proportional values and their re - lations to one another , and to enter , properly qual - ified , upon the special study that appeals to him .

Shaler	PERSON	's writings have that rare quality that not only brings applause , but influences to ac - tion ; and the young man whose citizenship is not yet old enough to be commonplace must be phleg - matic indeed who is not led by them to rebel actively against some of the ills that mar our system of life , education , and politics .

		In a dainty little volume called andZZ 's '' ^ '' '' Kwaidan : Stories and Studies of Strange Things '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	presents some mat - ters of real interest , and others of little moment , but all told in his exquisite English , and embel - lished with two graceful drawings by a Japanese artist . ''

		Weird Tales '' appears to be the meaning of the book 's main title , and they are mostly from old Japanese sources , retold apparently without a too literal adherence to the original , but with enough native words retained to color the narra - tive , and sometimes to puzzle the reader .

		Some of the stories have , for the thoughtful , a deeper mean - ing , as the tale '' Of a Mirror and a Bell '' and '' The Dream of Akinosuk ^ . ''

		Others , as '' Mu - jina , '' '' A Dead Secret , '' and '' Oshidori , '' are too slight and pointless to make a very perceptible im - pression .

		The last three chapters , `` Insect Stud - ies , '' treat of butterflies , mosquitoes , and ants , and introduce matter that is in the sharpest contrast , not to say discord , with that which precedes .

		From Japanese folklore to Spencerian philosophy is a bold leap .

		One suspects that the author has raked his desk-drawer nearly clean to furnish forth this slender booklet , which , be it further noted , in - dulges in a prodigal display of unprinted paper .

		A genial word from the author in closing : referring to Dr.
Howard	PERSON	's method of exterminating mosqui - toes , and to the swarms of these insects generated in Buddhist cemeteries , where each grave is kept religiously supplied with a vessel of water to quench the departed one 's thirst , Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	speaks a word for the mosquitoes -LRB- supposed to be reincarnations of human souls -RRB- and for himself , when he says , '' I want to have my chance of being reborn in some bamboo cup , or mizutamS , whence I might issue softly , singing my thin and pungent song , to bite some people I know . ''


William Penn	PERSON	, ``
William Peuu	PERSON	, in every aspect of and ihe founding character and in every relation of of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		ijfg ^ ^ ^ g ^ g ^ ^ ^ j ^ ^ ^ j ^ j ^ ^ ^ ^ think , equally apparent that he was a great man .

		Sometimes he was a great statesman ; at other times he was a great
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	; but he never was 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, both at the same time . ''

		Such are the conclusions of Mr.
A. C. Buell	PERSON	, in his '' Life of
William Penn	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The volume differs from the usual biography of an American colonist in taking into consideration the contemporary events in
England	LOCATION	.

		In this aspect the work is very praiseworthy , and might well be imitated by other biographies .

		The lives of
Penn	LOCATION	have heretofore been either
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	or an ti -
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	.

		This author , perhaps unintention - ally , is unlikely to please those who eulogize the Friends .

		He considers the Quakers in
England	LOCATION	as ' • a harmless people who did not disturb the peace and committed no crime , '' being victims to British ecclesiastical tyranny ; but he does not conceal his contempt for the
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, for their non-resistance inconsistencies , their prejudices , and their illiberal policies .

		He deplores the loss of the Swedes to
Delaware	LOCATION	, harried out of the land by the restrictive laws of the Qaaker Assembly of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The volume is more than a sketch of
William Penn	LOCATION	, -- it is an outline of the found - ing of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, bringing the narrative down to the loss of the
Penn	LOCATION	estates in the Revolution , fifty-eight years after
Penn	LOCATION	's death .

		The style is somewhat amateurish , frequently descending to pre - tended wit , beneath the dignity of historical com - position .

		Many exclamation points are necessary to express the author 's indignation or sarcasm .

		Notwithstanding these idiosyncrasies , it is the most readable sketch of
Penn	LOCATION	that has recently appeared .

		A new book
Admirers of Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	of the Ger - / rom FAizabeth man garden will agree that she made of the Garden .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mistake when she went to Rtigen .

		She should have stayed at home ; the gar - den was too charming a background to be lightly abandoned , and the Man of Wrath , the flowers , the books , the babies , and the unwelcome guests were better subjects for meditation than any she was likely to find on her travels .

		But having read of the delights of RUgen she set her heart upon seeing them , and decided incidentally to provide a guide-book to
Germany	LOCATION	's largest island for the use of such English and American visitors as might be tempted thither in her wake .

		With this end in view she has included a map in her latest book , '' The Adventures of Elizabeth in Rugen '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , has named the chapters geographically , and sandwiched occasional bits of useful information about roads , inns , and bath-houses into the more per - sonal narrative .

		But it would seem that
Elizabeth	PERSON	was not born to be useful .

		In any case she quickly drops the role of guide , and explains how she was driven to give up her happy holiday in order to act as peace-maker between a fantastic , free-thinking young cousin and her elderly and very conservative husband , -- a part which she plays without the least success but very entertainingly .

		Neither of her ben - eficiaries is very interesting ; the Harvey-Brownes , who also attach themselves to her ungracious per - son , are conventional English folk , and the other `` bath-guests '' stodgy bourgeoise whose insufferable dulness makes them all too easy marks for
Eliza	PERSON	- beth 's gentle ridicule .

		As to the adventures , they are ingenious and amusing but overdrawn , -- in - clined to farce , while the garden scenes were pure comedy .

		So we hope that next
summer	DATE	there may be no drought in the garden , -- for it was drought that drove
Elizabeth	PERSON	to seek the fresh fields and cooling waters of RUgen .

		Students of zoology in American ifzSim - colleges and universities have been largely dependent upon English edi - tions of German texts , or upon more or less ency - clopeedic treatises of foreign origin intended for those who plan to become specialists in the science .

		An epitomized treatment of the subject , suitable for those who dip into the science as a means of general culture , and at the same time serviceable as an introdaction to more extensive later study , has long been a desideratum .

		Professor
Weysse	PERSON	's `` Synoptic Text-book of Zoology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- bids fair to meet this need .

		The work forms a substantial volume of about 500 pages , and is abun - dantly illustrated with many classic cuts from former treatises and a considerable number of new figures from drawings and photographs .

		The birds and mammals are much more acceptably pictured than is usual in text-books , thanks to some excel - lent photographs of the admirable groups in the
American Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text is noteworthy for its simplicity and clearness , and the choice of subject - matter has been made with care .

		Considerable attention has been paid to the introduction of illus - trative data which bear on general biological prob - lems or are of economic or sanitary importance .

		The book is also free from the more technical terminology which only the specialist needs .

		The arrangement of the subject-matter is excellent .

		After laying down a few general principles , the various animal types are dealt with in detail , and the theoretical phases and general problems are discussed in the closing section .

		The book forms a clearly presented , well balanced , comprehensive , and accurate epitome of zoology . ''

		The most remarkable of all the Anavtgator sensations of aerial navicfation ... 18 the utterly new sensation of move - ment in an extra dimension , '' observes
M. A. Santos-Dumont	PERSON	in his entertaining and most in - structive book , '' My Air-Ships '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As the first human being since Icarus who has felt that sensation he is entitled to be heard at length . ''

		With respect of combinations of vertical and horizontal movements , man is absolutely without experience , '' he goes on to say ; '' therefore , as all our sensations of movement are practically in two dimensions , it is the extraordinary novelty of atrial navigation , that it affords us experiences -- not in the fourth dimension , it is true -- but in what is practically an extra dimension , the third . ''

		This is perhaps the most remarkable statement in a
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 book that is assuredly the work of a remarkable personality .

		There is no doubt that this young Brazilian has really and practically solved the problem of a dirigible machine which shall carry him at will through the air .

		This marvellous feat has been accomplished by the expenditure of much money , and more patience , ingenuity , and caution than are apparent on the surface , but which the author sets forth in his narrative with more than Anglo-Saxon candor .

		At the present moment
M. Santos-Dumont	PERSON	has a '' stable '' of four or five air-ships , all sufficiently practicable as to have the official cognizance of the French military , and he is quite without a rival .

		He does not believe in agro-planes or other devices that follow the model of bats and birds , pointing out that locomotives do not progress like animals , nor steamships like fish .

		The book is illustrated with reproduced photographs of the inventor and his various mechanisms .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's classic of childhood , '' The Golden Age , '' appeared some three or four years ago in a holiday edition , with illustrations by Mr.
Maxfield Farrish	PERSON	.

		A happier combinatiou of author and illus - trator could hardly have been hit upon , but it was quite evident that the half-tone process employed in repro - ducing the pictures did scant justice to the beauty of Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's originals .

		We are glad to note that the publisher -LRB- John Lane -RRB- has now brought out a new edition of the book , with the illustrations reproduced in photogravure .

		The result is a great improvement in every way over the original edition , the volume being hardly less charming from the artistic than the literary standpoint .

		The volumes of the '' Mermaid Series '' of English dramatists , in their neat new issue , are coming to us thick and fast .

		The latest publications are
Webster	PERSON	and Tourneur in one volume , edited bj
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	;
Middleton	LOCATION	, in two volumes , edited by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	; Massinger , in two volumes , edited by Mr.

Ford	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	; Hey - wood , edited by Mr.
A. Wilson Verity	PERSON	; and
Dryden	PERSON	, in two volumes , edited by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		The
Dryden	PERSON	is a new work , having never before been in - cluded in the series .

		These books are imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It is with much satisfaction that we record the pub - lication , by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of Volumes XV .

		to XVII .

		of their `` ' New International Encyclo - paedia . ''

		These volumes complete a work of which we have frequently had occasion to speak in terms of praise , and we only now add that such use as we have thus far made of it for purposes of reference has more than borne out our first favorable impressions .

		There is certainly no better work of the kind for general and popular reference now upon the market , and it has the additional advantage over all its competitors of being the most strictly up-to-date .

		It is equally satisfactory from the three standpoints of conciseness , readability , and attractiveness of dress and illustration .

		It comes near to being an ideal work for the family and the school .

		NOTK8 .

		Some forty heretofore unpublished letters written by
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	to various American friends have been secured by '' The Independent , '' and will appear in early issues of that journal .

		The Messrs.

		```` A Hundred Years of Warfare , 1689-1789 , '' by Mrs.
Marguerite Stockman Dickson	PERSON	, is a reading-book in American history for school children , abundantly illustrated , and provided with many helpful aids for both teachers and pupils .

		It is a publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		First in the field with a handbook to the

		In addition to descriptive mat - ter regarding the Exposition and the city , there are pages for daily memoranda , maps , etc. .

		The latest in the important series of special bibliog - raphies which the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	is engaged in publishing is a '' Biblioteca Filipina '' of about three thousand entries , compiled by
Serior T. H. Pardo de Tavera	PERSON	of
Manila	LOCATION	.

		Introduction and notes are all in Spanish , which of course is familiar to all who would find the work of any use .

		The latest volumes in the Messrs.
Appletons	PERSON	' series of illustrated reprints are '' Mr.
Sponge	PERSON	's Sporting Tour , '' with
Leech	ORGANIZATION	's wood-cuts and colored plates , and a reproduction of Major 's classic edition of '' The Com - plete Angler . ''

		The latter volume will be a boon for the many who can never hope to possess the original issue of this beautiful edition .

		329 BRIEFER MENTION NOTES LIST OF NEW BOOKS 333 334 335 , JOK AI M OR .

		No Hungarian writer has achieved a more world-wide fame than the novelist who died on the sixth of last month , having just entered upon his eightieth year .

		To the popular mind , indeed , contemporary Hungarian literature means the books of
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	and noth - ing else .

		This is due , of course , to the fact that his work takes chiefly the form of fiction , and that our modern habit of novel-reading makes us turn to all the corners of the civil - ized world for the gratification of our appetite for fiction .

		Although only a comparatively small fraction of
Jokai	ORGANIZATION	's fiction has been made accessible to English readers , the number of translated volumes is still considerable , and they have sufficed to make the name of their author widely familiar to English readers .

		It is unfortunate that no systematic e # fort has thus far been made to give us the best of Jokai in some uniform shape and in accurate versions .

		The translations we have are the work of many hands , and in the majority of cases have been taken from the German rather than from the original -- a process of transmutation which no work of literature can bear without losing much of its distinctive character .

		The trans - lations , moreover , have too frequently been mutilated in deference to narrow standards of taste or to the demands of commercially - minded publishers .

		Hence it can not be said that
Jokai	PERSON	has been given an adequate op - portunity to impress himself upon our public .

		Nevertheless , as already remarked , enough has been done to enable us to form some sort of an estimate of his quality , and the showing is fairly dazzling in point of energy and inven - tion , and in point of the portrayal of a people whose racial instincts are alien to those of the rest of the European world .

		In point of style and the higher artistry of composition in gen - eral , it must be confessed that the English translations afford only negative evidence that such characteristics are to be found in his writing .

		But then ,
Dumas	PERSON	had no style worth mentioning , yet we accept him as one of the greater French novelists by virtue of very much the same 9ort of ^ ifts as are so profusely ex - 316 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
May 16	DATE	, hibited by the famous Hungarian who has just died .

		In fact , it must be admitted that the latter derived no small share of his inspira - tion from the example of the man who made spectacular romance out of so many episodes in French history , and who was contented to produce his effects without any great degree of sublety .

		The first English translation of Jokai of which we find any record is '' The New Land - lord , '' which appeared nearly forty years ago .

		Since then , perhaps a score of his novels have been given to the English-speaking public .

		Among them we may mention ''
Timar	PERSON	's Two Worlds , '' `` Pretty
Michal	PERSON	, '' `` Black Diamonds , '' a story of the coal mines , `` The Green Book , '' a romance of Eussian revolution in
1825	DATE	, '' The Nameless Castle , '' with a Napoleonic theme , '' A Hungarian Nabob , '' picturing Hungarian life nearly a hundred years ago , `` The Poor Plutocrats , '' '' Debts of Honor , '' '' The Baron 's Sons , '' dealing with the Revolution of
1848	DATE	, `` Dr.
Dumany	PERSON	's Wife , '' dealing with the Franco-Prussian War , `` Midst the Wild Car - pathians , '' '' In Love with the Czarina , '' `` The Lion of
Janina	PERSON	, '' a Balkan tale , '' The Day of Wrath , '' and '' Eyes Like the Sea , '' which is a curious mixture of invention and autobiog - raphy .

		As a writer of fiction ,
Jokai	PERSON	was a roman - ticist at heart , although he turned more and more to realism as the years went on .

		As may be seen from the list of titles given above , his range was wide , and he devoted himself with equal facility to historical and social themes .

		He was fond of making a display of special and even technical knowledge , and he flung facts about in a reckless fashion suggestive of the custom of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		His construction was frequently chaotic , and his invention was char - acterized by a bizarrerie which recalled the manner of the '' Arabian Nights '' rather than the rational methods of modern fiction .

		It is to this fantastic opulence of invention , reveal - ing the barbaric and oriental impulses that still lurk in the background of the Hungarian con - sciousness , that the powerful appeal which he made to his countrymen is largely due , although of course his lifelong identification with the cause of popular patriotism had also much to do with his influence .

		To our English-speaking public , these things have a curious intellectual interest , and little more , and we find our chief account in those of his works which pict - ure to us so intimately the strange Magyar civilization of modern Jijimes , witjbi it ^ types and situations of a kind that could not be found anywhere else in contemporary
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But his work can never come as close to our sym - pathies as can the work of almost any German , or Scandinavian , or French , or Italian writer of our time , for the reason of its racial and intellectual remoteness from our life .

		The element of autobiography is found in a number of
Jokai	ORGANIZATION	's novels , and is most evident in '' Eyes Like the Sea , '' already mentioned in this connection .

		This book , which was pub - lished in
1890	DATE	, and crowned by the Hungarian Academy as the best novel of the year , is mainly the story of the author 's experiences in the Revolution of
1848	DATE	.

		It tells us of his association with
Petbfi	PERSON	in the leadership of that uprising , of his escape from capture , his period of hiding from his pursuers , and his love for
Rosa Laborfalvy	PERSON	, the talented young actress who married him after saving his life at this year of peril .

		This was in
1849	DATE	, and it is interesting to note that exactly fifty years later , another actress of tender years became his second wife , an occurrence which caused much excited comment among his friends , who did not relish the notion of marriage between a chit of a girl and the venerable representa - tive of modern Hungarian letters .

		Jokai Mor was an immensely prolific writer , beginning with a play at the age of seventeen , and keeping pen in hand for over sixty years .

		The novels alone fill hundreds of volumes , and besides the novels there are numerous plays , a history of
Hungary	LOCATION	, and a huge mass of journalistic and periodical production .

		He was connected editorially with one periodical or another nearly all his life , the last of the series being `` The Nation , '' which he began to edit in
1894	DATE	.

		At about this time the jubilee of his literary activity was celebrated with much ceremony , and was signalized by the publication of a uniform national edition of his works .

		He served for many years in the lower house of the Hungarian Parliament , and in his later years was made a member of the
House of Magnates	ORGANIZATION	by imperial favor .

		His nearly eighty years were filled , in short , with almost every con - ceivable kind of honor , and now that he has died in the fulness of time , he has left behind him an enduring reputation in the hearts of all Hungarians .

		Even the world at large , however little it may know of his writings through personal acquaintance with them , must have some dim sense of the fact that one of the grand old men of European letters has passed away ,

		THE DIAL 317 COMM UNICA TION .

		THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		I am not quite willing to accept your definition of democracy , as presented in your editorial in The Dial of
April 16	DATE	, as entirely satisfactory .

		I may , perhaps , agree with your contention that democracy does not mean `` the popular election of all officers who occupy important civic posts . ''

		But I dissent , utterly , from the view therein expressed that `` it really means the election of as few officers as possible , and the concen - tration in their hands of the largest practicable powers of appointment . ''

		Nor can I believe that '' voters ... are called upon to elect far too many officers , too many , that is , for a general exercise of intelligent judgment . ''

		The foregoing quotations are taken from your ed - itorial discussing the elective school board , and are designed , presumably , to have particular reference to that subject .

		Nevertheless , the school systems of this country have become both important and great because , as I insist , of their close and intimate touch with the masses .

		If there is one department of our government more than another in which all of the people are deeply , sincerely , and honestly interested , it is our public school system .

		And it is the very democratic character of the system which admits and encourages that popular in - terest .

		Withdraw the active management of our public schools from the masses , and you will have done much to affect unfavorably their usefulness and practical value .

		You also suggest that '' Office-seeking is never dig - nified and is not often legitimate . ''

		On the contrary , office-seeking , in a democracy , should be always dig - nified and never illegitimate .

		If it is not so , more 's the pity .

		I will concede that the methods employed in getting office are open to strong criticism .

		But , if the `` better element , '' so-called , of our citizenship would actively identify itself with public affairs , these repre - hensible methods would soon fail of their nefarious purposes .

		Active , intimate , and constant contact with public affairs , tempered by wisdom and honesty , is , or at least should be , a condition precedent to all living under a democratic form of government .

		The appointive system is not satisfactory .

		The people of this country are demanding its annihilation .

		It is both un-democratic and un-American .

		It does not make preeminent fitness a qualification for appoint - ment .

		It emphasizes favoritism .

		It is autocratic , dic - tatorial , and selfish .

		The election of a president , of our
United States	ORGANIZATION	senators , and of our judiciary , are ex - amples of what the people want .

		And it is not too much to say that their demands will be met and granted in the not far distant future .

		I should say , keep as many officers within easy reach of the whole people as possible , eliminating from the list , perhaps , those of a purely clerical or technical nature .

		In these latter let merit win as the result of a fair and impartial examination .

		In this way will it be worth while to live under a democratic form of gov - ernment .

		Then , too , will democracy have a meaning worth having .

Massachusetts	LOCATION	' Wak Governor .

		* In Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's Life of
John A. Andrew	PERSON	we have the carefully drawn portrait of an extremely interesting , forceful , and lovable character , and the detailed account of a most noteworthy contribution toward the freeing of the slave and the triumph of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause in our civil war .

		In the rather surprising lack of any previous biography of Andrew approach - ing this in fulness , Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's work will be welcomed as supplying a want and as probably the final and authoritative life of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts ' famous war governor .

		The opening paragraph of the preface de - clares the impossibility of presenting
Andrew	PERSON	fully to the reader , transparent and void of guile though the man 's nature is felt to be .

		Manifestly this is to be taken for granted in any biography .

		Who can analyze and under - stand his own character , not to speak of an - other 's ?

		However , the author appears to have spared no pains in the ransacking of all sorts of documents that might throw light on his subject . ''

		The thirty thousand or more pages '' of
Andrew	PERSON	's letters have been read by him , or at least this is distinctly implied in the Preface .

		Old friends of the Governor have been inter - viewed , contemporary prints of all kinds ex - amined , and , in short , nothing seems to have been neglected that could yield its bit of truth and realism and graphic force to the final re - sult of years of faithful labor .

		Entering thus heartily into his subject , it is inevitable that the author should , for the time being , view the world to some extent through the eyes of his hero .

		Hence we have , for ex - ample , a presentation of Lincoln which is not entirely that of an ardent admirer .

		In those times that tried Northern men 's souls , espe - cially in the year preceding the Emancipation Proclamation , and in the
summer	DATE	following it ,
Andrew	PERSON	's strenuous exertions for the cause were not always in harmony with the more cautious policy of the administration at Wash - ington , and in his vigorous recruiting of volun - teers for the field he repeatedly found himself entangled in the red tape of the war depart - ment . ''

Prest	LOCATION	.

		from the infamy of ruining his country . ''

		Yet when the trying time was past , as before it had be - gun ,
Andrew	PERSON	was generously disposed to utter none but words of praise for Lincoln . ''

		You ask me what
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	is like , '' he said in a speech soon after his return from the nominating convention ai
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		My eyes were never visited with the vision of a human face in which more transparent honesty and more benignant kindness were combined with more of the intellect and firmness which belong to masculine humanity .

		I would trust my case with the honesty and with the intellect and with the heart and with the brain of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	as a lawyer ; and I would trust my country 's cause in the care of Abraham Lin - coln as its chief magistrate , while the wind blows and the water runs . ''

		And in communi - cating to the legislature the sad news of the assassination ,
Andrew	PERSON	spoke eloquently of '' the MAN on whom the people hung with fonder hope and confidence than had ever been exercised within the memory of the generation to which we belong . ''

		Of Lincoln as presi - dent he added : ' ^ We should still be enabled to challenge all human history to produce the name of a ruler more just , unselfish , or unre - sentful . ''

		Not the least interesting chapter of the book is that which sets forth the relations between
Andrew	PERSON	and one of the most notorious `` politi - cal generals '' of the war .

		Curiously enough it was
Andrew	PERSON	himself who launched the irre - pressible
Butler	PERSON	, vehement political opponent though he was , on his remarkable military career .

		He was appointed as the fittest of six militia brigadiers to the command of the first regiments hurried off by the Governor at the earliest call from
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The way in which he thereafter made himself a thorn in
Andrew	LOCATION	's side and embroiled him for a while with the war department , makes one smile now as at the ingenious and naughty devices of a pert child who laughs at correction .

		Yet it was plainly no laughing matter for the Governor at the time .

		The story of
Andrew	PERSON	's nomination for the governorship has probably never before been so fully told in print as by Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	.

		It was expected that Governor Banks , who rep - resented the conservative section of the Repub - lican party , would serve another year .

		He however had secretly accepted the presidency of the
Illinois Central Kailroad	ORGANIZATION	and was plan - ning to step out , but designed to publish his intentions too late for
Andrew	PERSON	's friends to rally around their candidate , and not too late for the Banks men to unite upon
Henry L. Dawes	PERSON	, then in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as his successor on
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	.

		From ex-Governor
Claflin	PERSON	Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	now learns how the secret leaked out . ''

		On
Thursday	DATE
night	TIME	Governor Banks and
William Claflin	PERSON	, the chairman of the Republican State Com - mittee , were travelling by boat from
New York	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In the evening their talk of politics was gen - eral ; but the next morning on the train Banks showed
Claflin	PERSON	the draft of the letter which he was to send him later in the day .

		After leaving the train ,
Claflin	PERSON	went at once to
Charles Sumner	PERSON	's house in
Hancock	PERSON	street , and told his story .

		` Give me my boots , ' ex - claimed Sumner , starting up .

		`
John A. Andrew	PERSON	must be the next governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	. '

		Though
Andrew	PERSON	's friends lost no time in g ^ etting to work , they could afford to stop now and then to denounce to each other the trick of the < little joker . ' ''

		Andrew 's nomination and election were both by large majorities .

		Of
Andrew	PERSON	's many public addresses fre - quent extracts are given ; but , as he relied so largely on the inspiration of the moment and the potent influence of a great audience , his speeches suffer somewhat from being printed .

		The force of their impetuous eloquence may , it is true , be dimly surmised even as they stand in cold type , and here and there a ring - ing sentence is recognized as one that must have evoked tumults of popular applause .

		Thus , in addressing a Methodist camp-meet - ing on the island of
Martha	ORGANIZATION	's Vineyard , he thrilled his audience with the often-quoted words : '' I know not what record of sin awaits me in the other world , but this I know , that I was never mean enough to despise any man because he was ignorant , or because he was poor , -- or because he was black . ''

		In estimating
Andrew	PERSON	's services to his country -- there is no space here to indicate what he achieved for his state or to name the many good causes he promoted -- we may quote what is said of his heroic exertions in the
summer of 1863	DATE	.

		`` The tide of Northern fortune had ebbed incredibly low ; it seemed that it must ebb still lower .

		The army was shattered in strength and spirit ; foreign interven - tion appeared certain ; there were no fresh troops .

		By the force of human wills the tide must be turned ; the people must be made to enlist , to put into the renewed prosecution of the war all their resources of money and life .

		To help create in his people the will to do this was
Andrew	PERSON	's task .

		The story of his labors to this end all through the
summer	DATE	, one day following another with its crowded confusion of work , is largely the chronicle of a dull office routine ; yet through this toil of body and of spirit the end he wrought for came to pass . ''

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAL 319 The great work he did , too , in raising colored regiments and in finally securing white man 's pay for the negro soldier , must not be over - looked .

		Upon closing this engrossing biography the reader feels that he has been in the company of one with whom simple truth was indeed his utmost skill .

		Unstudied straightforwardness , disregard of the consequences of right conduct , generous warm-heartedness , scorn of all mean - ness , and , despite his impetuosity , an unusual staying power in every arduous undertaking , -- these are the qualities that shine resplendent in
John A. Andrew	PERSON	.

		His capacity for work , both the larger task of directing others and the more patience-trying personal attention to minute details , was extraordinary .

		No wonder he broke down at forty-nine . ''

		A warm heart and a cool head '' are the attributes ascribed to him more than once by the author .

		A warm heart he certainly had , but his generous im - pulses often hurried him into courses that appeared unwise to the sober understanding of his friends .

		Yet his may have been that higher wisdom of the heart which refuses to count the cost .

		In a work showing such evidences of thor - ough preparation and such literary excellence one is reluctant to search for errors .

		Never - theless , dealing as it must with many matters of party politics , the book can not expect the cordial assent of every reader to every sen - tence .


Henry Wilson	PERSON	is handled not exactly with gloves in the account of the gubernatorial contest of
1854	DATE	, when '' the astute politician , '' according to Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	, '' in all probability sold out '' his supporters to the Know-Nothing party .


Wilson	PERSON	's whole career is so at variance with such treachery that , though the circum - stances may look suspicious , his admirers must hesitate to convict without more conclusive evi - dence .

		A statement , too , not strictly accurate occurs in the narrative at this point with regard to the party in question .

		The writer names
1854	DATE	as the year when it '' came myste - riously upon the scene , '' whereas the Know - Nothing movement had made itself manifest two years before , although its first important victories were won in
1864	DATE	.

		A surprising statement is made in reference to that unde - niably astute politician and sympathizer with the South ,
Caleb Gushing	PERSON	.

		To save appear - ances , when all loyal men of note in the state were pressing their services on the Governor ,
Cushing	PERSON	joined the procession and applied for a military command , which was very naturally and justly refused him by the man he had so actively opposed in the past .

		But the author writes : '' We of this day , knowing from the course of events the sincerity of
Cushing	LOCATION	's offer , can not help feeling , perhaps to excess , what seem to be the cruelty and the injustice of
Andrew	PERSON	's refusal . ''

		This heart-throb of commiseration few will share .

		Cushing was a turncoat , if ever there was one .

		Some will remember that when
Grant	PERSON	, who had found him a useful tool , wished to make him chief justice , the timely production of a damaging letter from
Cushing	LOCATION	to
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	com - pelled the withdrawal of the nomination .

		An especially attractive feature of the book must receive brief mention .

		Not a few of that memorable body of men who held up the Gov - ernor 's hands in those trying times are re - peatedly introduced .

		Sumner ,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Howe	PERSON	,
Forbes	LOCATION	,
George L. Stearns	PERSON	,
Henry Lee	PERSON	, ^ glimpses of these and many others add interest to Mr.

Thomas Hardy	PERSON	has sought to express a philosophy of history in a closet - drama .

		Both feats are quite impossible of achievement upon the terms of the arts respec - tively involved , yet both produce deeply inter - esting results because of the powerful person - alities which they exhibit .

		The symphonic poem throws little light upon the doctrines of Nietzsche-Zoroaster , but much upon the inner workings of the composer 's mind ; the histor - ical drama likewise adds little to our insight into the Napoleonic wars , but does much to illuminate the point of view from which its author contemplates the significant happenings in the tragi-comedy of human life .

		It takes for its motto the words : '' And I heard sounds of insult , shame , and wron ^ .

		320 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, It might even better have taken
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's familiar lines about Heine : '' The Spirit of the world , Beholding the absurdity of men -- Their vaunts , their feats -- let a sardonic smile For one short moment , wander o'er his lips . ''

		The word '' short '' in the quotation would hardly be applicable , for Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's porten - tous production extends to nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes , but the '' sar - donic smile '' is everywhere in evidence , and '' the spirit of the world '' is one of the speak - ing characters of the drama .

		The mere enumeration of these characters fills four pages of print , and one of the four is a list of the '' phantom intelligences '' who hover about the scene , and comment upon the action after the fashion of a Greek chorus .

		There is the
Ancient Spirit	ORGANIZATION	of the Years , the
Spirit of Pities	ORGANIZATION	, the Spirit of Kumour , and Spirits Sinister and Ironic , besides the Shade of the
Earth	LOCATION	and a sufficient number of Ke - cording Angels .

		These ideal shapes are not kept mostly outside the main action , as in '' Faust , '' but mingle with it at every point , and penetrate the scene with their intelligence .

		Their part is so important that we must quote in full the author 's explanation of how he came to use them and what he intended should be their function in his artistic plan . ''

		It was thought proper to introduce , as supernatural spectators of the terrestrial drama , certain impersonated abstractions , or Intelligences , called Spirits .

		They are intended to be taken by the reader for what they may be worth as contrivances of the fancy merely .

		Their doctrines are but tentative , and are advanced with little eye to a systematized philosophy warranted to lift ' the burthen of the mystery ' of this unintelligible world .

		The chief thing hoped for them is that they and their utterances may have dramatic plausibility enough to procure for them , in the words of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, * that will - ing suspension of disbelief for the moment which con - stitutes poetic faith . '

		The wide prevalence of the Monistic theory of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	forbade , in this twen - tieth century , the importation of Divine personages from any antique Mythology as ready-made sources or channels of Causation , even in verse , and excluded the celestial machinery of , say , < Paradise Lost , ' as peremp - torily as that of the < Iliad ' or the * Eddas . '

		And the abandonment of the masculine pronoun in allusions to the
First or Fundamental Energy	ORGANIZATION	seemed a necessary and logical consequence of the long abandonment by thinkers of the anthropomorphic conception of the same . ''

		This explanation , which is also a confession of faith -LRB- of a lack of faith , some will say , with too great a readiness to jump at conclusions -RRB- , is absolutely essential to any comprehension of Jthe mood or temper in which the drama has been wrought ; it sets the work apart from those others which likewise make use of super - natural machinery , but which use it in such a way as to give at least temporary credence to the concrete forms in which the outworn re - ligions have shaped forth their envisagement of life 's inmost meaning .

		A great historical period , then , viewed on the one hand with the eye of the most minute and relentless realism , and on the other seen absolutely sub specie ceternitatis , is what Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has given us in '' The Dynasts , '' of which the first six acts are now published .

		That the eternal aspect of his theme , rather than the temporal aspect , is what chiefly con - cerns him , is a fact of which we are not per - mitted to doubt for a moment .

		He makes this perfectly clear in the scene of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's Cor - onation at
Milan	LOCATION	, where the dumb show of ceremonial becomes the subject of spiritual comment after the following fashion : `` Spirit of the Pities . ''

		What is the creed that these rich rites disclose ?

		Spirit of the Years . ''

		A local thing called Christianity , Which the wild dramas of this wheeling sphere Include , with divers others such , in dim ,
Fathetical	LOCATION	, and brief parentheses ; Beyond whose reach , uninfluenced , unconcerned , The systems of the suns go sweeping on With all their many-mortaled planet train In mathematic roll unceasingly .

		Spirt / of the Pities . ''

		I did not recognize it here , forsooth ; Though in its early , lovingkindly days Of gracious purpose it was much to me . ''

		From this point of view the mightiest figures in human history shrink to mere manikins , and the men who have convulsed the world seem no more than puppets controlled by a mysteri - ous and inexorable destiny .

		Perhaps three-fourths of the present volume is in the form of verse -- blank verse for the dialogue of mortals , lyrical measures of vari - ous forms for the discourse of spirits .

		But the verse , whatever its form , is such as to defy all the conventional canons of poetic diction , being devoid of grace and melody , and having in their stead only sheer intellectual weight and merciless logic .

		Two more illustrations may be given besides those already introduced for illustration of the author 's thought .

		Here are the words spoken by
Pitt	PERSON	upon hearing the news of Austerlitz : '' O God that I should live to see this day !

		* Defeated -- the Allies -- quite overthrown At Austerlitz -- last week . '

		-- Where 's Austerlitz ?

		-- But what avails it where the place is now ; What corpse is curious on the longitude

		... His heel on

		And here is part of the antiphonal song of the Recording Angels , chanted to `` aerial music '' : '' Feeble-framed dull unresolve , unresourcefulness .

		Sat in the halls of the Kingdom 's high Councillors , Whence an nntactical torpid despondency ■ Weighed as with winter the national mind . ''

		Surely such dactyls as these were never shaped before ; that they are the utterance of an an - gelic voice seems to be one of the deepest of the ironies in the author 's whole ironic scheme .

		Clearly this work must be taken on Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's own terms ; the ordinary terms of literary art would compel its summary rejec - tion , and it is quite impressive enough to force us to set those terms aside .

		The conception of the historical
Napoleon	PERSON	here presented is essentially just .

		It is that of the hero perverted until he has become the '' man of mere traditions , '' that of the leader with whom ```` The large potencies Instilled into his idiosyncrasy -- To throne fair Liberty in Privilege 's room -- Are taking taint , and sink to common plots For his own gain . ''

		The three figures of
Napoleon	LOCATION	,
Nelson	PERSON	, and
Pitt	PERSON	stand out far above the mass of historical characters that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has brought into his drama .

		Women hardly appear in the fore - ground of the action , and few of them are even named in the long list of dramatis personce .

		The section of the work now published may be summed up historically with the five words
Milan	LOCATION	,
Boulogne	LOCATION	,
Ulm	PERSON	,
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	, and
Auster	PERSON	- litz .

		The Peninsular War will be the central theme of the second section , with
Jena and Wagram	PERSON	for subjects of secondary interest .


Moscow	LOCATION	,
Elba	PERSON	, and
Waterloo	LOCATION	will be the cap - ital headings of the third and concluding sec - tion , followed by an epilogue in a
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	village , and an '' after scene '' in '' the over - world , '' to match the '' fore scene '' with which the work is opened .

		The programme which gives us this outline ends with a note to the ef - fect that the remaining sections are `` in hand , '' although '' their publication is not guaranteed . ''

		We trust that they may see the light .

		So gran - diose a plan , conceived by so forceful and dis - tinguished a writer , could not suffer frustration without the world 's being left the poorer .

		An undertaking no less ambitious than that of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, and one which , if of less weight as an embodiment of ripened wisdom , is of far greater weight as an expression of the poetic imagination , is Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	's trilogy on the Promethean theme .

		Our opin - ion of '' The Masque of Judgment , '' holding it to be one of the most extraordinary produc - tions of recent literature -- a poem in so high a sense that it may be doubted whether its author has a peer among the younger singers of our race -- was expressed in these pages
three years ago	DATE	.

		It now appears that '' The Masque of Judgment '' was planned as the in - termediate section of a three-fold drama , of which `` The Fire-Bringer , '' recently published , constitutes the first part , and which some as yet unnamed and unimaginable work -LRB- as far as the public is concerned -RRB- will bring to a con - clusion .

		With two-thirds of this drama already in our possession , we trust that no untoward and malign fate will deprive us of the comple - tion of a production which offers every promise of enduring life .

		^ schylus ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shelley	PERSON	-- these are the names that any treatment of the Prome - theus myth must bring to mind .

		Now there are two ways in which the great names of lit - erature may be brought to mind .

		One of them is by the appalling contrast between the work of genius for which they stand and the work of some mediocre modern talent that seeks their shadow ; the other is by the sug - gestion of an evident kinship that makes it not altogether preposterous to speak in the same breath of the masters and some modern disci - ple who has caught his inspiration from their teaching .

		We have no notion of discovering a new iEschylus , or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, in Mr.
Moody	PERSON	, but we make bold to say that he has , greatly daring , dealt so worthily with their famous theme that we may not fairly charge him with rashness ; that he has , to use a figure naturally suggested by that theme , filched some spark of fire from their heaven for our use . ''

		The Fire-Bringer '' opens upon a world made desolate by the wrath of Zeus .

		The floods have swept over it , destroying the race of men , save only the few rescued by
Deuka	LOCATION	- lion 's ark .

		The stone men and women sprung from the '' big seed '' cast by Deukalion and
Pyrrha	PERSON	have indeed in a way repeopled the world , but they are stolid figures , unawakeued to the life of the spirit , and groping about over an earth made dark by the cloud-pall that still overhangs it , and made dismal by the ooze 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, and slime left by the '' black ebb '' of the waters .

		Prometheus has in vain ranged the world in search of a spark of fire , and has even scaled the heavens only to be baffled in his quest .

		But his soul is still indomitable , and the love and faith of Pandora bring to him a gleam of cheer and strengthen his high purpose .

		Prometheus thus describes his first fruitless search : '' I clambered down Old earthquake-cloven rifts and monstrous chasms Where long ago the stripling Titans peered At play and dared not venture , -- found me out Flint-stones so buried in disastrous rock I thought the
Darkener	PERSON	sure had passed themby ; But not a spark lived in them .

		Past the walls Rhipean , and the Arimaspian caves , I sought the far hyperborean day , But not a banner of their rustling light Flapped through the sagging sky , nor did the Fates Once fling their gleaming shuttles east or west .

		By
Indian Nysa	ORGANIZATION	and the Edonian fount Of Hsemus long I lurked , in hope to find Young Dionysus as he raced along And wrest his pine-torch from him , or to snare Some god-distracted dancing segipan .

		And from his garland crush a wine of fire To light the passion of the world again And fill man 's veins with music ; but there went A voice of sighing through the ghostly woods , And up the mountain pastures in the mist Desolate creatures sorrowed for the god .

		In the second act , the few maddened sur - vivors of the deluge , in their last frantic effort to appease the anger of Zeus , come bringing the child

		And the song of Pan - dora is heard again , and then the voice of Prometheus , '' Thou gavest me the vessel ; it is filled . ''

		Let their hands light the altar of the world . '

		T is yours forever .

		I have brought it home ! ''

		The third and closing act of the drama brings retribution to the daring saviour of mankind .

		The scene is the tomb of

		A chorus of old men is fol - lowed by choruses of girls and young women , who sing of '' the dark peace-giver ,

		And then amid gathering clouds , and thunders , and the flashes of angry lightning the pursuit of Prometheus is foreshadowed .

		Pandora ap - pears questioning , -- `` Deemest thou That he will yield himself unmurmuring up , Or will he make wild war along the peaks ? ''

		To the cry Prometheus himself answers , sud - denly appearing and clasping her in his arms .

		`` Be comforted ; it is established sure .

		Light shall arise from light , day follow day .

		Season meet season , with all lovely signs And portents of the year .

		These shall not fail ; From their appointed dance no star shall swerve , Nor mar one accent of one whirling strophe Of that unfathomed chorus that they sing Within the porch and laughing house of Life ,

		The sun , the sun-thief , and the flaming reed That kindles new the beauty of the world . ''

		At the end of the long monologue which is thus begun , Prometheus departs to meet the doom which he clearly foresees , sustained in spirit by the thought of what he has done for the race of men , and by his memory of Pan - dora , to whom he speaks these pregnant last words : `` There where I go thou art . ''

		And as darkness drifts deeper and deeper over the scene , we hear the song of Pandora : '' A thousand sons , nailed in pain On the blown world 's plunging prow .

		That seeks across the eternal main , -- Down whatever storms we drift .

		What disastrous headlands lift , Festal lips , triumphant brow , Light us with thy joy , as now ! ''

		And amid the peace of the following starlight , and the flush of the succeeding dawn , this lyrical drama ends with a hymn to Apollo , chanted by a chorus of young men coming up the mountain slope .

		```` For thou alone , O thou alone art he Who settest the prisoned spirit free , And sometimes leadest the rapt soul on Where never mortal thought has gone ; Till by the ultimate stream Of vision and of dream She stands With startled eyes and outstretched hands .

		Looking where other suns rise over other lands .

		And rends the lonely skies with her prophetic scream . ''

		After these quoted illustrations , mere prose can find little to say that is worth recording .

		The work which has thus been passed under swift review seems to us to have fairly scaled the heights which it has attempted , to have reached with unflagging wing that thin upper air to which few poets find access , and in which still fewer can breathe .

		The song is indeed a thing not of earth , and some may find a cause for reproach in this very fact ; to us it is rather a cause for thankfulness , since it shows us that even in this prosaic modern world of ours the poetic spirit may still achieve something of the accent and the utterance of the great voices of the past .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Cogent Essats on Various Themes .

		* If Mr.
William Garrott Brown	PERSON	were not already known to a wide public as a conscien - tious and sometimes fairly brilliant essayist , he would certainly deserve to gain that repu - tation on the strength of his recently published book , '' The Foe of Compromise . ''

		In this vol - ume we have a collection of four genial essays , three of which appeared originally in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' the fourth being accounted for as the outgrowth of an address delivered somewhat more than two years ago before the
Harvard Memorial Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays exhibit such diversity of theme that one can hardly hope to characterize them as a group , save perhaps to say that while here and there * Thb Fob of Compbomisk , and Other Essays .

		^ 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, they tend a bit toward abstruseness , their thought is usually cogent and their style of expression straightforward and pleasing .

		In the title essay , Mr.
Brown	PERSON	sets out to discover what is that force which '' in one man keeps alive his whole desire , his undiminished aspiration , while in another man , after a brief struggle , a faint beating of its wings , it yields to necessity , to circumstance '' ; in other words , what is the foe of compromise , -- the elemental power which compels the neighbor on my right , often to his hurt , always to his discomfiture , to scorn to temporize or concede in his dealings with the world , but which in the more easy - going neighbor on my left rarely succeeds in even rufiBing the surface waters of his life .

		In the nature of the case , no very exact solu - tion of the problem can be arrived at .

		Many exceedingly interesting observations are re - corded , but what the thing itself really is , as Mr.
Brown	PERSON	confesses , can not even be described , much less defined . ''

		But when it rises up , out of the nothingness within , the man will know it for his very inmost self .

		Ideal is not its name , for ideals are many , and they change ; the thing I mean is one and constant .

		It is , rather , the champion and tutelary god of all ideals .

		Nor is it aspiration , but rather the monitor that bids us always aspire , and largely .

		Nor is it desire , but rather a royal parent to desires .

		There is , in fact , no name for the thing I mean .

		Let us call it merely the foe -- the hidden foe -- of compromise . ''

		It is the esprit de resistance which again and again makes tragedies of human life and gloats over the deed , yet which at its worst possesses a certain wild charm and at its best commands the universal admiration of the thoughtful .

		In '' A
Defence of American Parties	ORGANIZATION	, '' the author considers at some length the assertion of Bryce and De Tocqueville that political parties in the
United States	LOCATION	are not divided by principles of fundamental importance , but rest only on tradition and matters of expe - diency , and seeks to determine whether or not the present-day party system which so domi - nates us is really meaningless .

		After a fair enumeration of the weaknesses of the system , argument is skilfully produced to establish the thesis that '' parties do stand for a right and necessary division of the American people . ''

		Mr ,
Brown	PERSON	's historical characterization of the Republican and Democratic parties , while brief , is worthy of a careful reading .

		The next essay has for its subject `` The Task of the American Historian , '' and while not a formal review , was evidently prompted by the appearance a year or more ago of Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's '' Essays , Historical and Literary , '' and the seventh volume of the ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	, '' dealing with the
United States	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	is himself a man of some experience in the writing of history , and his characterizations of such historians as
Wilson	PERSON	,
Fiske	PERSON	,
Justin Winsor	PERSON	,
Parkman	LOCATION	, and
Lord Acton	PERSON	, are highly suggestive .

		As a man of letters , Mr.
Brown	PERSON	manifestly approves of President
Wilson	PERSON	's habit of regarding history as a branch of literature rather than of science .

		The closing essay , '' The Great Occasions of an
American University	ORGANIZATION	, '' is easily the most interesting , if not the most scholarly , of the series .

		The university is
Harvard	LOCATION	, and the great occasions are the visit of Governor
Hutchinson	PERSON	in
1771	DATE	, that of
Washington	LOCATION	when about to take command of the American army in
1775	DATE	, that of La Fayette in
1824	DATE	, that of the doughty Westerner ,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, in
1833	DATE	, the celebration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the college in
1836	DATE	, the re - union of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	survivors of the Civil War in
1865	DATE	, and the funeral of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	.

		As official curator of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	records in recent years , Mr.
Brown	PERSON	has had an invalu - able opportunity to acquaint himself with both the history and the tradition of the university , all the way from the Puritan days to the pres - ent .

		In this essay we have the very cream of his knowledge of the subject .

		There is a fine appreciation not only of the more picturesque and striking personages who have touched the life of the university , but also of the aspira - tions , struggles , tragedies , and triumphs of the great throng of college men who do not be - come famous .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	has a wholesome philosophy , and his essay can not fail to inspire in the reader both a deeper respect for
America	LOCATION	's favored seats of learning and a more thorough-going sympathy with the great work sought to be accomplished in them .


Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	.

		A WOKK that will occupy a distinct place of its own in the great amount of literature concerning
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	now appearing , is Mr.
Olin D. Wheeler	PERSON	's '' The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, '' announced for immediate publication in two volumes by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	, who is known as the writer of the attract - ive `` Wonderland '' series issued by the
Northern Pa	ORGANIZATION	- cific Railway , has travelled several thousands of miles over the original route of the explorers , and his identi - fication of their trail is thus based on direct personal observation and research .

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAL 326 Ax American Man of Actions When we get far enough away from the literature of the present period to see it fairly , we shall probably come to the conclusion that one of its most attractive features is its biog - raphical treatment of the leaders in the various paths of our national development during the past century .

		Such series as the '' American Statesmen , '' and the '' American Men of Let - ters , '' deservedly occupy a high place in our con - sideration ; but we have in mind particularly the more spontaneous output of Autobiograph - ies , Recollections , Memoirs , etc. , represented by such books as
Stillman	PERSON	's '' Autobiography of a Journalist , '' Mr.
James	PERSON	's ''
William Wet	PERSON	- more Story and his Friends , '' General
Gordon	PERSON	's '' Reminiscences of the Civil War , '' and
Sena	ORGANIZATION	- tor
Hoar	PERSON	's `` Autobiography of Seventy Years . ''

		The level of literature of this class produced during the past few years has certainly been high , and to say that any particular work stands distinctly above that level is high praise indeed .

		And yet we do not hesitate to predict that such will be the verdict of intelligent readers gener - ally with reference to the
Memoirs of Henry Villard	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is true that the work was left unfin - ished , and as a consequence is ill proportioned ; but these formal blemishes leave upon the reader in the end nothing but regret that death caused anything to be sacrificed from what the author had it in his heart to tell .

		The success - ful autobiographer must have had either un - usual power to see , or unusual power to bring things to pass .

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	had both , and the story that he has left gives to the reader the full advantage of both .

		The power of Mr.
Villard	PERSON	to see is shown most clearly in the details of his career as a newspaper correspondent , from
1856	DATE	through the greater part of the Civil War .

		To anyone acquainted with the general character of the man , it is needless to say that as a war corre - spondent Mr.
Villard	PERSON	did not follow the prin - ciples and methods of the modern sensational journalism , which the Civil War did so much to develop .

		Commanders whose armies he accompanied quickly learned that their plans and purposes could safely be discussed in his presence , for neither his honor nor his patriot - ism would allow him to give news to the public prematurely for the paltry prize of a newspa - per '' scoop . ''

Washington	LOCATION	^ in advance of all others was due simply to
8 %	PERCENT	.

		perior industry and insight , never to method ^ in the slightest degree reprehensible .

		It is easy to see the value to his memoirs of the confiden - tial relations with officers which such a reputa - tion permitted him to maintain .

		They were conscious of no necessity of assuming any spe - cial disguise in his presence , and so he saw them as they really were , whether in their weakness or in their strength .

		All this gives high authority to his expressions of opinion concerning the general character , or conduct in specific cases , of the commanders who came under his observation ; and he has shown no hesitation in making his opinions known when occasion offers .

		He had set a very high stand - ard of completeness and carefulness for the military portion of his memoirs , checking him - self at every point by thorough examination , of the official records , both Federal and Con - federate .

		Especially was it his desire to give a complete account of the operations about
Chickamauga	LOCATION	and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, and the thor - ough preparation which he thought necessary for this portion might serve as a valuable les - son to many a professional historian .

		But all this took time as well as effort , and failing health broke the story off abruptly with the description of the ' ^ Battle above the Clouds . ''

		But it was not the military record alone which suffered from this failure of health ; to the same cause is due the fact that we get but a hurried compendium of the entire subsequent period , covering the writer 's remarkable and romantic career as an assistant in the develop - ment of the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is intimated in the Preface , however , that a detailed a ^ count of this peculiar feature of his career may yet be given to the public by his family .

		In the brief sketch that he found time to pre - pare , Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's candor forbade any attempt to use his brilliant successes in such a way as to blind the eyes of the uninformed reader to the attendant failures .

		Mistakes of judgment there were , bringing severe loss to others , and to himself not only painful loss but still more : painful abuse and misrepresentation of motives ; but the mistakes are pointed out with the same unswerving accuracy as the brighter features of the picture .

		The plain statement of facts on both sides warrants , we think , the conclu - sion that his most disastrous reverses were due to causes which he could not have been ex - pected to foresee or control ; and this view is 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, further supported by the readiness of well informed investors to trust his judgment again after disaster had befallen .

		The losses by the way were after all quite insignificant when compared with the accumulated wealth which owes its origin to the mighty stimulus that he gave to the material development of the States of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		When wealth and power came within his control they were employed with a due regard for the general welfare .

		As an indication of his attitude in this respect we may cite the fact that upon the completion of the railroad system of the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company	ORGANIZATION	, completely under his con - trol , the cost of moving grain to the sea was at once reduced by more than forty per cent , giving a rate lower than the growers them - selves had asked .

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's enlightened insight recognized the importance of intellec - tual as well as material foundations for the section of the country in which he was so vitally interested , and when the Universities of
Oregon	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	were found to be dangerously embarrassed he came promptly to their relief .

		He paid the floating debt of the former , provided it with the nucleus of a library , and later gave it
$ 50,000	MONEY	in cash on condition that the legislature should levy a reasonable tax for its current expenses .

		He kept the
University of Washington	ORGANIZATION	in opera - tion by his benefactions for two years , when the Territorial legislature had failed to make appropriations for that purpose , and the amount thus advanced was never returned .

		These are only instances of a beneficence that found many channels , when money was at his command , and was always intelligently directed and administered without display .

		But perhaps one of Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's best services to the public , though not in the direction of what is usually classed as philanthropy , was his course in acquiring the ownership of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' and `` ' The Nation . ''

		His own relation to American journalism had clearly revealed to him the sinister influences under which it was laboring , and he determined that in one quarter at least the light of a gen - uine editorial independence should continue to shine .

		Kealizing that his ownership of these papers must become known , and that they would naturally rest under suspicion of being used as his personal organs in the promotion of his financial interests , he placed the control of the property entirely out of his hands , put - ting it in trust for the benefit of his family and giving the trustees full power to maintain its editorial independence against any interfer - ence whatever .

		The sincerity of this abdication of personal control was put beyond question by the character of the men in charge as ed - itors , --
Edwin L. Godkin	PERSON	,
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, and
Horace White	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	was of course deeply interested in the great causes with which the '' Evening Post '' and '' The Nation '' were already identified , such as the freedom of inter - national commerce , the reformation of the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, and the adoption and maintenance of a sound money system , as against the evils , actual and threatened , which had their genesis in the financial stress occasioned by the Civil War .

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	was thrown into contact with many men of immediate or subsequent prom - inence , and his volumes record many interesting episodes of such contact .

		In
1858	DATE	, for example , he and
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	were driven , each sep - arately , to a little flag station in
Illinois	LOCATION	, late at night , and left there alone to wait for a belated train .

		There was no station house , and they were obliged to take refuge from a thunder storm in an empty freight car , where , squatting on the floor in the absence of anything to sit upon , the President - to-be talked frankly of his polit - ical history and prospects . ''

		Mary insists that I am going to be Senator , and President of the
United States	LOCATION	too '' ; and then , after a roar of laughter at her ambition , his lank arms around his knees and his whole body shaking with mirth , `` Just think of such a sucker as me as President ! ''

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	was then but a comparatively unknown newspaper corre - spondent , only five years from his native land .

		Thirty-two years later , when his enterprises in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	had carried his name and fame into many lands , he was honored with an invi - tation to visit Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, at
Friedrichs	ORGANIZATION	- ruhe .

		The Prince was still bitterly chafing over the humiliation of his enforced resigna - tion , and poured the story of his woes into his visitor 's ears so freely and forcibly as to pre - clude repetition by a man of Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's nice sense of honor .

		On other subjects , however , there was no such reason for reticence , and the account of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's views on various matters discussed is of extreme interest .

		We have said nothing of the romantic story of Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's youth , his arrival in this coun - try without the knowledge of a word of English , and the frequent disappointments through which he struggled upward to a better adjust - ment to his new environment .

		It is a story of absorbing interest , and there is no space to

Japan	LOCATION	, Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	writes of the
Island Empire	ORGANIZATION	with fresh spirit , keen insight , and clear outlook .

		He lived in southern
Japan	LOCATION	five years ; then , his health failing , he recuper - ated in the northern island of Yezo , where live the aboriginal Ainos .

		Hence he speaks with authority , with truth , and with sympathy , of the country '' shaped like the rising moon , and named for the Rising Sun . ''

		This little bow - shaped line of islands bends as far as it can toward the West , and contains as many mil - lions of people as it has years of modern his - tory .

		It was only in
1854	DATE	that
Commodore Perry	PERSON	'' opened it , a veritable box of curios for the Western world . ''

		While
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	curiosity regarding the contents of this box has seemed insatiable , the desire of this race of archers to turn their iron-pointed reeds into leaden bullets and to exchange their clumsy ballistics for twelve-inch steel guns has been insatiable too .

		Ten years ago Western curi - osity deepened into wonder when `` this little bow-shaped country suddenly pierced the rusty mail of
China	LOCATION	with the swift arrow of war . ''

		To-day wonder has turned to amazement in beholding , as in a colossal game of ju-jutsu -LRB- ^ not ju-jitsu -RRB- , the little islanders closing in a death struggle with the Slav .

		Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	has no very high opinion of the morality of the Japanese , even though out - wardly everything in the land is lovely and aesthetic .

		He notes a difference between polite - ness and courtesy ; pointing out that although the Westerner may be outwardly clumsy and may never hope to equal the finesse of the Japanese , yet in real courtesy he is vastly the superior of the two .

		The language of
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	is saturated with insincerity ; it is a superb instrument in helping you to say beautifully what you dori * t feel , while it renders less help in telling the truth than those languages that are built on lateral breadth rather than on perpendiculars and many grades of subor - dination .

		The Japanese are aesthetical , the Chinese are ethical ; the latter being creators and the former imitators .

		The upper classes in
Japan	LOCATION	are usually rationalists to the core , but as a matter of course they believe in de - moniacal possession .

		In summing up the Japanese traits .

		Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	finds , on the negative side , a marked absence of certain attributes that to the
Occi	PERSON	- dental seem fundamental and indeed inevitable in a civilized and enlightened nation .

		Moral - ity , as we understand the word , scarcely exists among the islanders .

		They do not know the value of time , they seem to have no nerves , they are colossally impassive and strangely lacking both in sympathy and in mutual con - fidence .

		In economy , politeness , industry , power to adopt and adapt , they are wonderful .

		So far from believing in the
Cinderella	LOCATION	theory of the rise of modern
Japan	LOCATION	to greatness .

		Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	throws overboard the fairy tales of the tourist .

		He devotes a chapter to
Verbeck	PERSON	, the engineer , scholar , and missionary , who , after all his wonderful gifts and graces are catalogued , was only the pioneer of an army of thousands of teachers , engineers , advisers , drill-masters , miners , and experts in every line of human endeavor and achievement , who for over a generation have taught the Japanese how to do the things they are doing so well to-day .

		In his opening pages Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	shows the comparative resources of
Japan	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	on sea and land ; while in the final chapter , called `` The Gates of
Asia	LOCATION	, '' he states his reasons for believing in the potency of the Japanese to win , uttering his faith in their victory as that of '' the West in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Philosophy and liiFK .

		* Perhaps the most promising sign in the realm of philosophy just at present is the growing conviction among philosophers that thinking is bound to justify itself by its fruits , by the contribution it makes to the concrete value of life .

		There was a time when the philosopher might hug himself in his isolation , dismiss the question of utility and practical con - sequences with a few condescending words , and , with * • thinking for thinking 's sake '' as his motto , busy himself with his abstract and esoteric doc - trines , under the delusion that he alone was getting close to reality , and that the rest of the world were blindly missing all the real worth of life .

		The attitude is still by no means unknown , and not a few thinkers of to-day seem to prize their results more highly the more they are out of relation to concrete human interests , and the more they emphasize the essential unreality and illusiveness of our knowledge .

		But as we come to a better knowl - edge of the nature of man and of the human mind , the less plausible does this separation appear be - tween valuable thinking of any kind , and practical aims .

		There is in the general temper of the times that which makes men turn with increasing im - patience from whatever meets no obvious human need .

		Psychology in particular has emphasized the solidarity of experience , the essentially teleologi - cal character of all our thinking , and its connection with the concrete ends of action .

		Ethics and re - ligion have long been ready to meet this tendency half way , and to find the possibility of spiritual value , not apart from the common and the practi - cal , in a special realm of experience , or in another and a higher world , but in the transformation of every-day experience by its relation to worthy ends .

		The same humanistic movement is showing itself at last in philosophy also , and is resulting in a most promising activity in many quarters .

		Professor
William James	PERSON	is in
America	LOCATION	the great apostle of the new tendency , and there is a growing recogni - tion on all sides of the immense debt that contem - porary philosophy is beginning to owe to him .

		Dewey and seven colleagues , all former students in the
Department of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	; and there is a substantial agreement in regard to general doc - trine .

		The Studies are in form somewhat tech - nical and closely reasoned , and are not easily intelligible to the general reader .

		But for the student of modern Logic , their importance is very considerable , involving as they do a recon - struction in large measure of logical theory .

		The main thesis of the book is in the direction of what the writers call the instrumental character of Logic .

		It insists upon the essentially practical nature of the logical problem .

		Truth does not refer to a sphere of reality outside human experience , which thought is content to stand off and copy .

		It rather represents a means to the enriching and harmo - nizing of experience itself .

		We can not understand thought save as we recognize that it is not merely thought in general , but that it grows out of particu - lar crises of experience , particular psychological situations , and has for its purpose to reconcile the contradictions of life , and lead the way to a new and larger immediacy of satisfaction .

		The things which it knows , the laws which it uses , are all rela - tive to their teleological and practical value , not metaphysical things in themselves .

		And so the test of valid thinking is not a mere supposed cor - respondence with reality , but the practical test of success in leading to fulness of life .

		This general thesis is defended with much acuteness , and with a great deal of psychological insight , against various modern types of theory .

		Of course it raises many questions , not all of which the writers succeed in answering plausibly ; and it will not improbably be felt by many to be one-sided in its emphasis , and to make the riddles of existence rather simpler than the facts warrant .

		But that it is an important piece of work , whose general influence will be salutary in the direction of making philosophy more con - cretely human , can not be doubted .

		Mr.
Schiller	PERSON	's volume of essays entitled '' Hu - manism '' continues the line of attack which was started by a group of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	men in the recently published `` Personal Idealism . ''

		It will make a more popular appeal than the work just noticed ; indeed , it is as distinctly popular in form as a seri - ous piece of philosophical writing that deals with more or less technical subjects can easily be .

		Mr.
Schiller	PERSON	has a good colloquial English style , and heartily despises the uncouth phraseology in terms of which it has come to be felt necessary to treat philosophical subjects .

		He has , moreover , a sense of humor not common among philosophers , which shows a tendency to pass into sarcasm whenever he happens to think of his particular aversions -- Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	and the Absolutists .

		To this is to be added a distinct originality of treatment , which opens up many things in a suggestive way , and which is not held in check by an undue fear of inconsistency .

		If the tone also shows a self-confidence which occa - sionally approaches audacity -LRB- one might instance the dialogue in which the author represents himself
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 as lecturing Plato and Aristotle in the realms of the
Blest	LOCATION	-RRB- , this quality adds zest to the reading .

		And , finally , the author is not ashamed to connect phil - osophy with real human interests .

		This is indeed the burden of the volume as a whole .

		The h priori philosophies have all been found out , as the preface puts it .

		The only useful method in philosophy in - volves the recognition that our beliefs are all postu - lates , set up to satisfy human needs , and accepted on the basis of their success in meeting these needs , -- a new empiricism , in which the emotional side of man 's nature is made , however , equally important with the physical or the merely intellectual . ''

		The Ethical Basis of Metaphysical Truth , '' < ' Non - Euclidian Geometry , '' `` Reality and Idealism , '' `` Darwinism and Design , '' `` The Place of Pes - simism in Philosophy , '' `` Concerning Mephisto - pheles , '' `` The Desire for Immortality , '' -- this selection of chapter-headings will suggest the cath - olic range of interests which the essays cover .

		Turning to another volume which also , though in a very different way , emphasizes the practical value of thought for life , one 's estimate is apt to vary considerably according to the standpoint from which he views it . ''

		The Nature of Man '' is pro- fessedly a scientific study of old age and death .

		That science , and science alone , is our source of refuge in time of trouble , appears to the author an elementary truth .

		Man is a mere animal of a superior sort who can think , in a world where nat - ural law reigns supreme ; and his happiness lies in having an organism as completely as possible ad - justed to his surroundings , -- which at present it is far from being .

		Of these mal-adjustments , the chief place is assigned to those that centre about old age and death .

		Religion and philosophy are brushed lightly aside as having no message of relief ; what is the answer of science ?

		The main outcome of the book is to the effect that the ills that attach to old age are perfectly preventible .

		The phenomena of old age are largely due to the encroachment of the white corpuscles on the higher tissues of the body ; and this probably could be prevented by introducing a serum to strengthen such tissues , and by taking other means at the same time to prevent the growth of the bacteria of putrefaction .

		Old age would then be a per - fectly natural -LRB- now it is pathological -RRB- ripening of powers , with duties and a satisfaction of its own that would be necessary for a complete experience ; and it would pass at length without perturbation into a -- perhaps somewhat easily assumed -- '' instinct for death . ''

		And since life would no longer be cut off prematurely , but only when the desire for life had ceased , the fear of death that now torments man - kind would be lost .

		The writer 's eminent qualifica - tions make the scientific part of his book of great interest ; it points in the direction of results which , if they are attained , will be without doubt of the utmost practical importance and benefit .

		As a com - plete philosophy , however , and a professed answer to all the tangled problems of human life , it offers what to many readers will seem a rather slender programme .

		The writer 's temper of mind is cast a little too much in the mould of scientific dogmatism , and is too lacking in a broad sympathy for man 's many-sided nature , to be a wholly safe guide to the highest philosophy of living .

		The latest biographer , Mr.

		To offset these minor lapses , it may be said that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	rejects in toto the evidence furnished by Lady
Wray	PERSON	's letter of
1732	DATE	, which , whether writ - ten in good or in bad faith , is certainly most un - trustworthy , and has misled to some extent almost every biographer of Taylor down to the present time .

		Some parts of the life of
Taylor	PERSON	are in - volved in obscurity : his college life , his four years at
Uppingham	LOCATION	, his whereabouts at times during the Civil War and the Commonwealth pe - riod .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	indulges in few conjectures , and some of his guesses are perhaps as near the truth as one may now hope to get .

		His assumption that
Taylor	PERSON	beheld the entry of
Charles I.	PERSON	into
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
October , 1641	DATE	, is borne out by the fact that
Taylor	PERSON	was admitted
D.D. of Brasenose College	ORGANIZATION	on
November 1	DATE	.

		In its larger aspects , Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's biography must be pronounced of good proportion , sympathetic , and in criticism fairly adequate and just .

		He is right in emphasiziUg
Taylor	PERSON	's impor - tance as a writer rather than as a theologian or a casuist .

		While admitting the theological and philo - sophical importance of '' The Liberty of Prophesy - ing , '' he points out its literary inferiority . ''

		Holy Dying '' is immensely superior to '' Holy Living , '' being not a piece of task-work but rather '' a pro- 380 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Taylor 's authorship of the '' Discourse of Auxiliary Beauty '' is re - jected ; but Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	decides that
Taylor	PERSON	must have written the title and taken charge of the MS. for < ' some great lady in the orthodox camp , '' per - haps the Countess of

		The chapter on `` Taylor 's Place in Literary History '' is an acute and comprehensive study of the various aspects of the art of '' the Shakespeare of English prose . ''

		The volume will add to the reputation of its author as an accomplished critic and biographer .

		j -LSB- ^ ^ `` '' i ' * The political history of
Venice	LOCATION	is the days of its j • • i i i • r t commercial distinctly the bistory of the growth aristocracy .

		of the Commercial aristocracy which governed the state during the entire period of its active corporate life .

		When every other nation was gradually developing a tendency toward popu - lar government ,
Venice	LOCATION	had reversed the order .

		Beginning with a scheme on which , whatever its feudal resemblances , there prevailed the first prin - ciple of democracy , majority rule , the change was from equality to privilege , from popular rule to that most absolute of all governments , an oligarchy .

		In his '' Oligarchy of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
George B. McClellan	PERSON	traces this evolu - tion , from its beginnings in the days of the migra - tion of the peoples to the end of the story .

		There is no attempt to include anything of the literary or artistic history of
Venice	LOCATION	: no painter or poet is even mentioned ; the book is a study of what Mr.
McClellan	PERSON	aptly calls `` the Venetian leit-motif , '' the supremacy of its commerce and its merchants .

		When refugees from the mainland first sought pro- tection from the Huns in the shallows and the lagoons , they brought with them certain traditions which were strong enough to influence , but not strong enough to found , a government ; but they also brought '' an almost absolute equality of pov - erty , '' and it was this fact that led directly to class cleavage along the lines of material success in the days that followed .

		Add to this the peculiar geo - graphical conditions under which
Venice	LOCATION	existed , and the basis of her history is complete .

		The story of the first acquisition of power by the doges as representatives of the people , and the gradual limi - tation of the power of both doge and people through successive coups d'etat , is well told by Mr.
McClel	PERSON	- lan , whose work shows a thorough study of all the materials at hand , as well as judgment in the selec - tion of authorities in the cases where notable preju - dice , as against the church or the ruling aristocracy , might have influenced the writer .

		This judgment is especially evidenced in the treatment of that most discussed event in Venetian history , the conspiracy of the Doge
Marino Falier	PERSON	.

		Mr.
McClellan	PERSON	takes the position , easily justified by a study of
Marino Falier	ORGANIZATION	's character , but generally opposed by histo - rians , that something more than a mere childish spite was the basis of the Doge 's action . ''

		It is more than likely that through the long years of his pub - lic activity he had chafed under the oppression of those whom he regarded as his inferiors , and only awaited an opportunity of endeavoring to break their power .

		It does not necessarily follow that
Falier	PERSON	was in advance of his time in a fondness for popular liberty .

		It is , however , altogether probable that bis hatred of the oligarchy was the growth of years and not of a day , and that in scheming to destroy it he would naturally turn to the then only known remedy for the oppression of the nobles , -- a benevolent despotism founded upon the support of the people . ''

		Mr.
McClellan	PERSON	's recent election to the mayoralty of
New York	LOCATION	has led to an attempt to refer his treatment of certain phases of Venetian political life to modern problems .

		It is only just to say that he is entirely free from such evidences of a lack of taste .

		Venetian imperialism , class politics , and political machines are treated solely in reference to the conditions peculiar to
Venice	LOCATION	, and lose none of their interest thereby .

		When a man does a great many ^ irTrSt ^ * .

		things well , - almost as well as the best , but not quite , -- he is apt to find his work overshadowed to a large extent by the work of those who stand just above and beyond him .

		The Right Honorable Lord
Avebury	PERSON	affords a striking instance of this .

		He is one of the great scientists of the century , -- not only the friend of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and
Spencer	PERSON	, but their active co-worker , fighting with them the great bat - tles which the friends of science have waged in the last half-century ; he is an authority in many impor - tant biological , geological , and botanical matters ; he has led not only the thought and the writing of his time , but in many cases its legislation as well , wherever questions of practical reform have arisen .

		Yet it is probably safe to say that hardly one person in a thousand knows him except as the Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	who has told us so well and so truly about '' The Pleasures of Life '' and '' The Use of Life . ''

		This is especially true in
America	LOCATION	, where his par - liamentary services are unknown , and where there naturally is but little interest in his progressive attitude toward education , economics , and religion , as evidenced by his position in the political life of
England	LOCATION	.

		Some idea of the variety and depths of his interests may be gained from a recently pub - lished volume of his occasional '' Essays and Ad - dresses '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which the subjects range from Municipal Trading , the
Fiscal Policy of England	ORGANIZATION	, and the present position of British Com - merce , to
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, Bank-holidays , and Nature-study .

		The introductory essay , on ''
Hux	PERSON	- ley 's Life and Work , '' is especially valuable for its searching analysis of
Huxley	LOCATION	's attitude toward re - ligion , -- not toward creeds , dogmas , and miracles , but toward the religion which implies '' the strenu - ous endeavor to be and do what is right , '' as well as a reverence for '' whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report . ''

		THE DIAL 331 The old discussion of the conflict between science and religion is no longer carried on with any seri - ousness , outside of high-school debating clubs ; but one of the evil effects of that so-called conflict has lasted far beyond its time , namely , the belief that
Darwin	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and their co - workers in modern scientific research , were what they were called at the time when their theories first startled the world , -- materialists , atheists , unchristian men .

		Calling them such , and believing them such , has become a habit , a habit that the careful study of their works , or , failing that , the careful reading of an essay like Lord
Avebury	PERSON	's , should do much to break .

		There is something noble and inspiring in the picture of this old man , remaining after the work of all his friends is done , to vindicate their good name .

		And he does it worthily .

		The writing of reminiscences still Memories , artutie merrily on , and now John and p4rsoncU , '' • '
Callcott Horsley	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	, who died
last October	DATE	at the age of eighty-seven , contributes his `` Recollections of a Royal Academician '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mrs.
Edmund Helps	PERSON	.

		From the fact that he was a schoolfellow of
Shelley	PERSON	's , that his vocation brought him into the friendliest relations with the Queen and the Prince Consort , and that his long connection with the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	made him acquainted with a host of noted men , both in his own and in other callings , we are prepared to expect some chapters of interest from his pen -- or , rather , from that of his amanuensis , to whom he dictated from a well-stored and remarkably retentive memory .

		Nor are we disappointed .

		These artless reminiscences have something of that charm of professional enthusiasm and ingenu - ous self-revelation that made
Haydon	ORGANIZATION	's Autobiog - raphy so attractive to readers of fifty years ago ; and they have not a particle of that sourness of disappointed ambition which rendered
Haydon	PERSON	's book not exactly a gospel of sweetness and light .

		In his painting ,
Horsley	PERSON	sometimes , as Haydon almost always , chose themes from history , sacred or profane .

		Like
Haydon	PERSON	, too , he was a devoutly religious man , as his book shows in a not too ob - trusive way .

		But as his was a far healthier nature than the poor suicide 's , his reminiscences are by so much the pleasanter reading .

		An aptitude for other forms of art besides his chosen one enlarged
Horsley	PERSON	's sympathies , so that we find him on inti - mate terms with
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Moscheles	PERSON	, the Kembles , and others famous in the musical , dra - matic , or literary world .

		Profound , even to excess , was his admiration for Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, for the artist
Turner	PERSON	, and for Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		No superlatives are too strong to denote their unap - proachable excellence .

		Latter-day critics do not rate
Horsley	PERSON	nearly so high as his frankly com - placent reminiscences might lead one to infer .

		He outlived the somewhat undue fame of his palmiest days ; but he evidently remained to the end a very agreeable raconteur .

		A popular account ^ o the general reader of history , of Norman-Bngiith the later ccnturies of the
Middle	LOCATION	national life .

		^ ggg ^ _ t ^ e period of Feudalism , -- is likely to appear as an age of endless turmoil and confusion .

		Seeing the interminable feuds of quar - relsome lords and militant bishops , he naturally infers that life in those days must have been rude and unsettled .

		As to its rudeness , there can be no question ; but rarely has an age seen conditions more firmly settled and fixed .

		The further we pen - etrate into the lower strata of feudal civilization , the more pronounced do we find this fixity of con - ditions and the greater the monotony of life .

		This fact is well brought out in a recent volume entitled `` Mediseval England , '' by
Miss Mary Bateson ^ Lecturer of Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The book is an account of English society from the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	to
1350	DATE	, and belongs to < ^ The Story of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It would seem that such a work does not exactly fit into the scheme of that series : there is nothing picturesque in the daily drudgery of the serf , nothing dramatic in the life-history of the average clerk or monk .

		Though the book is therefore not of the kind that we should expect , it is none the less valuable , as it is perhaps the first serious effort to write a popular account of Norman-English society .

		The author aims to present a full view of the national life as it was lived in country and in town , at court and in castle , in spacious monasteries and on wide manors .

		Political movements are kept in the background , and important personages are noticed only when their recorded mode of living may serve to illus - trate some particular phase of social existence .

		The author shows great familiarity with the literature of the period and subjects treated , and puts before us a mass of historic details , nearly all of which make excellent materials , though some might more prop - erly have been omitted .

		It may be added that the author seems to underestimate the Anglo-Saxon civilization that preceded
William	PERSON	's invasion , and credits the Normans with making a great many improvements that probably date from the period before
1066	DATE	.

		The book is written in a rather heavy style , and the author 's meaning is not always readily apparent ; but on the whole she has succeeded in pro- ducing a readable and scholarly work .

		Eiiays and plays by an Irish mystic .

		That Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	should have won his way to so large a place in the public eye be - speaks marked talent .

		A pronounced mystic , a seer of visions , and dreamer of dreams , he stands at the opposite pole from the comfortable
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	burgher and his leisure-consuming wife , who are actuated by nothing if not plain common sense and a respect for the conventionalities .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is a man of temperament , and it is the boast of most of the English-speaking race that they are without that somewhat discommoding possession to any noticeable extent .

		And yet he continues to write , which means that he is read .

		In his ' ^ Ideas 332 THE DIAIi -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, of Good and Evil '' -LRB- published , like the other books to be mentioned , by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he sets forth the faith that is in him , in the form of medi - SBval white magic , crystal reading , interpretation of dreams and the like , mingling these things with disquisitions on literature , but always from the same mystical and semi-comprehensible point of view .

		This book has been followed by two volumes of < ' Flays for an Irish Theatre , '' the first containing a five-act satirical tragedy , `` Where There is Nothing , '' in which the customary person of '' respectability '' is held up to shrewd scorn , while the protagonist goes from an assured position in the county to the road as a tinker , falls ill through unwonted expos - ure to the elements , becomes a monk , preaches what may be termed sentimental nihilism , is ex - pelled from the convent , takes refuge with his scanty following in the Irish hills , and there is slain by a bigoted peasantry .

		The other book contains three one-act plays , the first of which , '' The Hour Glass , '' portrays the death of a teacher whose powers of intellect have led him into a fatal denial of things unseen .

		The second play , ' <
Gath	PERSON	- leen
Ni Hoolihan	PERSON	, '' is a beautiful bit of symbolic patriotism , the title being that given the green land of
Erin	PERSON	itself when British tyranny denied its peo - ple the use of the very name of their country .

		The last of the three dramas , '' A Pot of Broth , '' is picaresque , being the tale of a wandering rascal who sells a magic stone to a '' near '' peasant woman .

		All are practicable plays , not merely `` literary , '' and were written for the theatrical venture in
Dublin	LOCATION	which the playwright and his friends have made so artistically successful .

		A book about ^ ' ^ ^ made apparent in the collection bu ^ inest education of essays entitled `` Business Edu - and accountancy .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nd Accountancy '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Dr.
Frederick A. Cleveland	PERSON	from the writings of the late
Charles Waldo Haskins	PERSON	, that the trend of education to-day is toward the same system that prevailed in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	from the beginnings of history .

		From Mr.
Haskins	PERSON	's schol - arly and interesting paper on '' Accountancy in
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	'' it is evident that , while the problems in arithmetic given as exercises for the infant Babylonian mind were of the mercantile type so familiar to American children , the ancient instructor went much further and used forms of contracts and commercial documents for reading and writing lessons , and , further , that the higher education was largely along the lines of modern com - mercial schools .

		This is something worth knowing , if only to settle the question whether we are four thousand years behind our times or the ancient Babylonians were four thousand years ahead of theirs .

		With the increase in the magnitude of commercial affairs in recent years there has come a demand for improved methods of the keeping of trust and corporation accounts .

		Mr.
Haskins	PERSON	was one of the first to see and supply that demand , and he sought always to raise what had theretofore been A brie / biography of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		the merest clerical position to the dignity of a pro- fession , with all the emoluments thereunto belong - ing .

		In this , and in obtaining legal recognition of such a profession as that of '' certified public ac - countant , '' he was successful .

		As the organizer of the federal system of account-keeping Mr.
Haskins	PERSON	obtained a national reputation , enhanced by his appointment to the position of Dean of the
New York University School of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, Accounts , and
Finance	ORGANIZATION	.

		These facts are set forth by Dr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	in a memoir of the author , whose grasp of his subject as shown in the papers making up the volume in hand prove him to have been no small factor in the recent commercial development of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The aim of Mr.
B. M. Johnston	PERSON	's '' Napoleon : A Short Biography '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , as stated in the author 's preface , is to '' furnish a correct outline of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic history and to point the way along which it may be profitably pursued . ''

		Unhappily this aim has not been carried out .

		The student who should take this work as a guide would fail to discover in
Napoleon	LOCATION	anything more than a military adven - turer .

		The civil side of his work , except the Code and the Concordat , is almost wholly ignored .

		There are barely half a dozen lines on his Italian policy , and not much more upon his work in Ger - many .

		Nearly all the author 's space is taken by narratives of the successive military campaigns .

		And what is told is marred by serious inaccuracies .

		For example , in the account of the
13th Vendd	LOCATION	- miare it is remarked that
Barras	PERSON	was a member of the '' Directoire '' and that this was then the exec - utive of
France	LOCATION	, although in fact the Directory was chosen nearly a month later .

		Barras is also de - scribed as a civilian .

		In a chapter further on ,
Savary	PERSON	is mentioned as the leader of the expedi - tion to
Ettenheim	PERSON	which effected the seizure of the Due d'
Enghien	PERSON	, and the date of the execution at
Vincennes	LOCATION	is incorrectly given .

		Still later the Bourbons are said to have been proclaimed by the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	in
1814	DATE	before
Napoleon	PERSON	had abdicated , and it is added that
Louis XVIII	LOCATION	.

		entered
Paris	LOCATION	while the negotiations with
Napoleon	PERSON	were in progress .

		These illustrations are sufficient .

		Such a lack of care in explaining well-known events is all the more strange because the bibliographical lists are good .

		Mr.
Alexander Innes Shand	PERSON	, who is a veteran newspaper correspondent , author of biographies , books of tra - vel , and a book descriptive of hunting and fishing , and who is a persistent '' knockabout '' and bon vivant as well , has written in `` Old-Time Travel '' -LRB- Pott -RRB- his '' personal reminiscences of the Continent forty years ago compared with experiences of the present day . ''

		The portion of
Europe	LOCATION	with which the author began to familiarize himself two-score years ago comprised all excepting
Russia	LOCATION	and the Balkan and Scandinavian peninsulas ; and his de - Old-time European travels .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 scriptions of what was and is to be seen in the countries west of the
Rhine	LOCATION	, although sometimes a little rhapsodical , are yet informing and delightful .

		The changes which he notes as having been wrought during the years of his European travel are not so much in the appearance of the cities and towns as in the modes of travel , in the fare at the various hostelries , in the sports to be engaged in , and in the social life to be enjoyed .

		All this is from the stand - point of the author of '' Half a Century , or Changes in Men and Manners . ''

		Whether the forty illus - trations , from water-colors by Mr.
A. H. Hallam Murray	PERSON	, were made for the book or the book for the illustrations , or whether they came indepen - dently into existence and were subsequently found to have a mutual affinity , might remain open ques - tions so far as internal evidence goes .

		But , at all events , both author and artist have contributed to the making of a charming book .

		A
New England	LOCATION	^ he fact that a biography need not woman of a celebrate a famous name in order to isentury ago .

		^ ye interesting is well proved by the '' Memorials of
Mary Wilder White	PERSON	, '' edited by her daughter , and issued from the
Everett Press	ORGANIZATION	, Bos - ton .

		This volume is made up largely of Mrs.
White	PERSON	's letters , and is valuable for showing very frankly and sincerely the character and thoughts of a
New England	LOCATION	woman a hundred years ago , -- a woman who , though of decidedly more than av - erage cultivation , belonged to no famous coterie .

		Her life was not without its excitements , for at sev - enteen she was married to a West Indian planter who took her to
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	at a time when insur - rections were of almost daily occurrence , and yellow fever raged with little check .

		In five months she lost both her husband and her only brother , and her own life > f as repeatedly threatened .

		But after her return to
Concord	LOCATION	her life was only ordinarily eventful , and her biography owes its chief charm to the revelation of her personality in her letters , many of which are given here .

		They reveal a rare delicacy of thought , with force and grace of char - acter .

		Nowhere are these qualities more delight - fully shown than in her love-letters to Mr.
Daniel Appleton White	PERSON	, to whom she was married in
1807	DATE	.

		In their restraint and dignity , these letters might well serve as a model to the present more exu - berant age .

		We doubt if the most hardened of apologists for our national policy in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	could read without searchings of heart '' The Story of the
Lopez	PERSON	Family '' as set forth in a series of family letters , with comments , and edited for publication in book form by Mr.
Canning Eyot	PERSON	.

		These letters give us an insight into Filipino life and character such as we may seek in vain in the books of travellers or in official documents .

		The fact that they were written without any notion of publication makes their revelations all the more poig - nantly effective , and they constitute probably the most valuable of all the human documents that have re - sulted from our unhappy venture in colonialism .

		The book which contains this correspondence is attractively illustrated .

		It is a publication of the
James H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		```` The Book of the Short Story '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , edited by Messrs.
Alexander Jessup	PERSON	and
Henry Seidel Canby	PERSON	, is a volume of examples , eighteen in number , extend - ing from a papyrus story of ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	to a tale by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, and illustrating the chief modern literature , with one amazing exception , -- for the book includes no example of a German story .

		Besides the strictly textual matter , there is an elaborate critical essay by way of introduction , while with each story selected there goes a rather long list of other stories of the same period , which provides ample material for a further study of the subject .

		The book as a whole exhibits good judgment , and will be found useful for educational purposes . ''

		Electricity and Matter , '' by Professor
J. J. Thom	PERSON	- son , is a publication of the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It con - tains the first course of lectures given at
Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity upon the
Silliman	PERSON	foundation , and shows , among other things , a remarkably elastic construction of the terms of an endowment `` designed to illustrate the pres - ence and providence , the wisdom and goodness of God , as manifested in the natural and moral world . ''

		The treatment of the subject is as untechnical as possible , considering the recondite nature of the investigations discussed , and provides a statement of the present con - dition of physical theory concerning the ultimate nature of matter and force .

		Mr.
W. T. Ashley	PERSON	's work entitled '' The Adjustment of Wages '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a study of conditions in the coal and iron industries of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The material consists of eight lectures delivered by the author at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1903	DATE	, with the addition of a num - ber of illustrative documents .

		The attempt is to give a general survey of existing conditions , rather than to solve the problem of industrial organization .

		The con - clusion is reached that ** the differences between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, in the matter of the organization of labor , are differences of degree , not of kind , '' -- the latter country having reached a later stage of industrial development .

		Mr.
Ashley	PERSON	's presentation of the problem can hardly fail to interest the average reader , and will induce him , incidentally , to draw some conclusions of his own .

		Herr L ,
Viereck	PERSON	's ''
Zwei Jahrhunderte	PERSON	Deutschen Unterrichts in denVereinigten Staaten '' -LRB-
Braunschweig	LOCATION	- Vieweg --
New York	LOCATION	:
Stechert	PERSON	-RRB- is the expansion of a paper on '' German Instruction in American Schools '' prepared by the author several years ago for the Re - port of the
U. S. Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its present form the work is a volume of three hundred pages , presenting not only a conspectus of modern con - ditions and courses in the various school systems and universities -LRB- together with portraits of many well - known teachers of German -RRB- , but also a historical sur - vey of the subject based upon a very wide range of authorities .

		The book is even more than this , for it is a study of the influence of German culture upon Amer - ican life and thought , viewed in a far wider than the merely educational aspect .

		There are some amusing misprints of proper names , of which the most conspicu - ous is that of
William Torvey	PERSON	-LRB- for
Torrey	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Harris	PERSON	, on the frontispiece portrait , and the most startling that of Dr. '' Morderow ''
Wilson	PERSON	for the president of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Poet Laureate of
England	LOCATION	, speaking before the Royal Institution last
February	DATE	, made some suggestive observations concerning what he called `` the growing distaste for the higher kinds of poetry '' among the English - speaking peoples .

		It is the fashion of present - day journalism to speak slightingly of Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's own performance as a poet , and to turn the prejudice created by his poetical pre - tensions against his public deliverances upon all subjects , which constitutes a distinctly un - worthy form of indirect attack upon a writer whose prose is always graceful , whose verse is at least respectable , and whose opinions are those of a gentleman of marked culture and reflective power .

		It is easy to indulge in cheap flings at certain of his ill-considered and too '' timely '' poems ; it would be easy , in the case of the address now under consideration , to find a target for sarcasm in the passage in which the author alludes feelingly to the public igno - rance of his own '' long , serious works '' ; but we prefer to take seriously his argument upon a serious subject , and to inquire how far his contention is borne out by the facts .

		After defining poetry as '' the transfiguration of the actual or the real into the ideal , '' Mr.
Austin	PERSON	goes on to express the opinion that we no longer care for the higher sort of poetry as our forbears cared for it . ''

		Men and women of a former generation seized with eager hands on a new poem , read it with fervent tenderness , returned to it again and again , learned much of it by heart , and gave it a permanent place in their thoughts and affections . ''

		At the pres - ent time the men and women of whom this may be said are few in number .

		For short poems , it is admitted that '' there is perhaps as much taste and liking as ever , '' but from a sustained poetic flight in the narrative or dramatic form , '' most readers nowadays turn with invincible repugnance . ''

		This is a hard saying , but we are constrained to believe that it has a large element of truth .

		There is much significance in the writer 's recollection that in his own youth he knew by heart such poems as the `` Essay on Man , '' `` The Traveller , '' `` The 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Deserted Village , '' and the `` Elegy , '' and in his pertinent question : '' Is there a man or woman under thirty at this moment who can say the same ? ''

		Among the causes assigned for our modern '' alienation of taste from the higher , more seri - ous , more intellectual poetry '' are the preva - lence of novel-reading , the newspaper habit , and the standards set by the popular stage .

		The novel has ousted the poem because it is '' better adapted to the capacity of the average mind , '' and unfortunately the novel is read for purposes of its own , which are very different from those professed by the poem .

		Instead of a '' useful tonic '' it * ' becomes the most depress - ing of stimulants , '' and completely ruins '' the taste for mental food of a more delicate and sustaining kind . ''

		As for much reading of newspapers , it is bound to dull the literary sense and coarsen the intellectual tastes .

		The hurried writing of the journalist gets the hur - ried reading which is all that it deserves ; yet it makes so large a demand upon our attention as to preclude most other reading .

		It gives us information at the expense of culture , and imperfectly - digested opinion at the cost of ripened wisdom .

		The commercial philosophy of the stage does not need Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's fresh exposition .

		It was set forth once for all in Goethe 's '' Vorspiel auf dem Theater . '' ''

		Sucht nur die Menscben zu verwirren ; Sie zu befriedigen ist schwer . ''

		We all know how the English-speaking stage balks at literature , and how disastrous is almost invariably the attempt to make it the scene of poetic utterance .

		Added to these depressing influences , the writer finds two others , one of which is the feminization of taste , and the other -LRB- as much a consequence as a cause -RRB- is the fact that poetry , in the minds of many worthy people , is represented by compositions which are '' not poetry at all . ''

		What he thinks about the in - fluence of feminine taste in determining the success or the failure of a book , is neatly illus - trated by this statement of the average woman 's attitude toward one of the master poems of the world .

		The '' episode of Dido and ^ neas is the only one in
Virgil	LOCATION	's great poem that really interests them , and they absolutely refuse to concern themselves about the Romanam con - dere gentem , the foundation of the Empire . ''

		Now the larger part of present-day readers are women , and the interests of women are not , as a rule , '' as wide and as detached from per - sonal issues as are the interests of men . ''

		There is the argument in a nutshell , and it is not easily to be controverted .

		As for the compositions taken for poetry which are '' not poetry at all , '' Mr.
Austin	PERSON	takes
Browning	PERSON	for his illustration , quoting for the purpose a pas - sage which is really fine , ethically and intellec - tually considered , but which has no touch of the transfiguring wand which converts the real into the ideal .

		He might have made an even more pointed argument by quoting from the popular ditties of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		The fact that such performances , or the perform - ances of , say , Mr.
Riley	PERSON	of
Indiana	LOCATION	, are in many quarters innocently assumed to be poetry ^ offers a convincing and , at the same time , de - pressing confirmation of the contention that hosts of people nowadays do not know what poetry means , taking the term in its long - accepted and legitimate sense .

		We have thus analyzed at some length Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's argument , because it seems to us that he has , on the whole , made good his dictum that poetry no longer means what it formerly did to the public at large .

		Speaking of our own country , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	says : '' Its verse until the dominance of prose fiction -- well into the seventies , let us say -- formed the staple of current reading , and ... the books of the ' elder American poets ' lay on the centre - tables of our households and were read with zest by young and old . ''

		Where is the literary op - timist who would venture to assert that any - thing like this was true at the present day ?

		The message of our older poets , it is true , has lost something of its timeliness with the lapse of years , and they have not found the successors that we could have wished ; but we doubt greatly if a new Longfellow or a new
Lowell	PERSON	could now become a real force in our national life .

		One of the noblest poems ever produced by an American writer has been published during the past few weeks , but we do not an - ticipate for it anything like popular vogue ; its melody will fall upon ears deafened by the din of a material civilization , and its stately im - aginings will find no general public sense at - tuned to their harmony .

		Abundant lip-service , no doubt , is now paid to the great poets in both
America	LOCATION	and En - gland .

		Their names are bandied about in journalism and in private converse , and no one is too poor to adorn his speech , on occasion , with tags and snippets of poetry .

		We have new editions of the poets , also , in a profusion formerly unknown , and their volumes orna - ment the walls of countless thousands of our
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		355 homes .

		With amazing industry our youth also , in school and college , pursue the study of literature , and make themselves widely fa - miliar with names , and titles , and literary origins , and critical speculations .

		But all these things are only the husks of culture , and the kernel is somehow missed .

		The great poets ought to be our constant and unfailing inspira - tion , and most of us well know that they are not .

		They should occupy the inmost citadel of heart and mind , but we keep them outside the walls .

		They invite us to royal banquets , while we prefer , as
Euskin	ORGANIZATION	suggests , to feast with scullions .

		Now all this , as Mr.
Austin	PERSON	says , with deep feeling , matters enormously and vitally .

		We are menaced by what he calls the '' cosmopoli - tan religion of material prosperity , '' and in what quarter shall we look for refuge ?

		Let him answer the question in his own eloquent words .

		`` Where but in the pages of the Greater Poets , the Higher Poetry , which pre - sent to us a very different conception of the meaning , the purpose , and the uses of life , and keep steadily before us a worthier and nobler ideal .

		This you will not find in merely lyrical or emotional poetry , however beautiful and enchanting it may happen to be ... The spirit ... requires to be braced by com - panionship with the masculine poets , the poets who move and enchant , but at the same time stimulate and strengthen , by mingling with emotion , thought , intellect , and reason . ''

		And if there is any season of the year when such counsel is more timely than at another , it is the
summer	DATE	season which brings to most of us some measure of relaxation from the engros - sing cares of life .

		Then we repair to the mountains or the sea for their tonic influence upon our unstrung physical nature ; why should we not at the same time repair to the calm heights and the free expanses of poetical crea - tion for the healing of our souls as well ?

		An important series devoted to '' American Jurists '' is now being actively prepared by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Harry Alonzo Gushing	PERSON	is the editor of the undertaking , which will be planned to interest laymen no less than lawyers .

		Each volume will make plain the position of its subject in the development of Amer - ican law , and will elaborate the important contributions made by him to the present system of American law .

		AN Era op Flower Books .

		* Two hundred and fifty years ago Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	noted with delight that '' new herbals fly briskly from
America	LOCATION	upon us from per - severing enquirers . ''

		It was a day of flower - books , the like of which had never been known before ; nor has it been known since till our own day .

		When
America	LOCATION	was settled by En - glishmen the whole world of flowers lay un - studied , almost unnoted .

		There was but one meagre list , which was full of `` unlearned cacographies and falsely-named herbes . ''

		The eyes of the whole world seemed suddenly to awaken to the vegetable world .

		English schol - ars noted with delight the hundreds of plants in their own country that had never been de - scribed , and they invented botanical terms in which to make descriptions .

		They learned with excitement and anticipation of strange flowers and trees in the new world . ''

		Joyfull Newes out of the New Found World '' is the exultant title of the botanical book that first told of tobacco and other strange American plants .

		Travellers , diplomats , even common sailors secured blossoms and seeds and plants in '' Out-Landish '' ports to bring home to pol - iticians , physicians , potecaries , herbalists , and flower-lovers .

		Physick-gardens were planted , and parties of eager young men , '' cullers of simples , '' searched the fields and meadows for specimens for gardens and herbariums .

		It is easy to understand why the great costly folios of
John Gerarde	PERSON	and
John Parkinson	PERSON	, the works of
John Evelyn	PERSON	,
John Ray	PERSON	,
John Fosr	PERSON	ter ,
John Pechey	PERSON	,
John Lawrence	PERSON	, the three
John Tradescants	PERSON	, and other English `` herb - johns , '' found ready and excited purchasers among such enthusiasts when these conditions existed .

		But it is not easy to account for the great and sudden outburst of garden and flower books within the past four years .

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, on Modern Gardening '' in
1765	DATE	, until this our year
1904	DATE	, actually saw fewer newly-published books on flowers and gardens than we have had in a single year .

		Each one of these mod - ern books has something new to tell the reader ; not always news of the flower-world , but more often the fresh thoughts and eager hopes and happy words of the writer about flowers .

		When in the garden our own Poppy is a deeper and more translucent bit of painted ruby glass than has ever bloomed before ; when our own
Larkspur	LOCATION	has a taller and stronger stalk , and blossoms of more heavenly blue than ever riv - alled the sky , -- each inspires us to tell the won - der and publish the beauty to the whole world .

		The largest and most useful flower book of this season is the volume entitled '' How to Make a Flower Garden . ''

		The name of Pro- fessor
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	as editor is warrant of the accuracy and worth of the work ; he also writes in his crisp English the chapters entitled '' The Spirit of the
House Garden	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Some Lessons from the Pan-American Exposition , '' `` Shrubs and Where to Put Them , '' '' The Greenhouse in the Snow , '' '' Where Shall We Plant Roses . ''

		The names of
Warren H. Manning	PERSON	,
W. H. Sargent	PERSON	,
W. C. Egan	PERSON	,
Patrick O'Mara	PERSON	,
James J. Allen	PERSON	, and others of note in the plant world , show that Professor
Bailey	PERSON	has gathered well his assistants .

		The chapter entitled '' The Water Garden and the Mosquito Problem '' will per - haps be read with the most eager attention .

		The finely illustrated essay on '' Water Lilies and Other Aquatic Plants '' is written by Mr.
William Tricker	PERSON	, for whom the
Victoria Trick	ORGANIZATION	- eri was named .

		A curious illustration shows the under side of a leaf of the
Victoria Regia	LOCATION	, displaying its beautiful venation and the spaces where air is held .

		It is a surprise to me to see in the accompanying picture the present - ment of a stalwart policeman upheld on the surface of the water on one of these vast lily - leaves ; for I recall distinctly the terror I en - dured when in my childhood I was placed upon the great buoyant leaf-disc of one of these whales of the water-plant domain , one of the first brought to
North America	LOCATION	, and felt it slowly quiver under me .

		I recall the equal distress of the unhappy gardener when he be - held a sturdy child vehemently stamping her ruthless way to the safe shore of the tank - `` dge over the yielding leaf-pulp of his idolized treasure .

		The illustrations for the chapters on '' Wild Gardens '' are beautiful things ; indeed the entire series of photographic illus - trations in this book could hardly be excelled .

		Among the might-have-beens which are so deeply mourned by all wild-flower lovers is the orchid-book of
William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	.

		Of this work he gave us glorious promise in a few magazine articles .

		Not only would his won - derful pen have written fresh and vivid de - scription , but his pencil would have depicted faithfully the curious characteristics of the smaller orchids which the camera in general so blurs through foreshortening that the very portions by which identity is established are wholly distorted or valueless .

		In Miss Grace
Graylock Niles	PERSON	's book , '' Bog-trotting for Or - chids , '' the colored plates depicting the larger orchids , -- the lady 's - slipper , pogonia , are - thusa , and showy orchids , -- afford excellent representations by which the hunter of wild orchids can make comparisons .

		All the illus - trations of single specimens and flower-parts are of value ; but the photographs from which the plates were made are evidently much in - ferior to those of like scenes and blooms which form the illustrations of Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	's '' Flowers and Ferns in their Haunts . ''

		The text is a sketchy account of ram - bles in
New England	LOCATION	, chiefly in the
Hoosac Valley	LOCATION	.

		Across lots and through swamps , in rich meadow , and by huckleberry pastures , by mountain brook and old pot-hole , wherever heavy bog or peat or mud-bed formed an orchid - home , -- there searched the author .

		She had a genius for finding the moccasin-flower ; it forms the triumph of her book .

		The six
New England	LOCATION	species , -- Ram 's head moccasin - flower or lady 's - slipper , white-petalled or showy lady 's - slipper , small white or prairie lady 's - slipper , large yellow lady 's - slipper , small fragrant yellow lady 's - slipper , two-leaved stem - less pink lady 's - slipper , -- are all lovingly described and their haunts and habits depicted for the reader .

		Miss
Niles	PERSON	tells likewise of their transplantal to the garden .

		Some idea of the wonder and delight occasioned by these moccasin-flowers when a novelty in English gardens in the seventeenth century may be gained from the herbals of Gerarde and Park - inson .

		It is a pleasure not only to know of Mrs.
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	's `` Mountain Garden '' ; but to learn a little of the home life of the Master who has given so much happiness and inspira - tion to thousands of music-loving souls .

		The glimpses afforded in his wife 's book reveal such a nature as we know must be his , -- strong , direct , loving of all things that need love and care .

New Hampshire	LOCATION	garden of these

		THE DIAL .

		367 two , made without gardener or even garden - knowledge , is revealed to us so fully and so frankly that the pages prove a wonderful guide to all in like status of ignorance and inexpe - rience .

		The simple accounts of garden-experi - ments , and the sensible rules and directions evolved therefrom , are far more light-giving than the pages of many a more pretentious volume .

		For Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	tells the little things that few know and many wish to know , and yet are so seldom told .

		It is ever said to garden-beginners , * ' You must learn by con - tinued experience and failures . ''

		Through this book we are saved disappointment and loss and failure , and are permitted to learn not by our own but by Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	's experiments and experience .

		Her lists of hardy plants -- `` proven '' as said the old cook-book recipes -- will be found of distinct value to the garden - tyro , not only in saving time but money .

		It often comes to the reader when reperusing after some years a book much loved of old , to endure a sad shock in finding that the halo of memory has been sadly misleading .

		The in - tense delight given by Mrs.
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	's '' An Island Garden '' when read fifteen years ago might well have grown pale after the many fine garden-books of the past few years ; but instead a deeper admiration and satisfaction comes to us as we turn the pages of the new edition , lately published .

		It is indeed a gem ; there are few books to class with it .

		Forbes
Watson	PERSON	's '' Flowers and Gardens , ''
Euskin	PERSON	's `` Proserpina , '' -- only such as these can keep it company .

		Buskin and Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	vie with each other in glorious descriptions of the Poppy .

		There was given to Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	in an extraordinary degree a quality upon which old
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	has this to say : ''
Fascina	PERSON	- tion is a thing whereof Man hath more Experi - ence than Comprehension . ''

		She fascinated all who knew her ; and her home , her garden , her flowers , were also charming .

		This inexplicable though positive quality did not depend on her personal presence , on her beauty or wit ; for her charm has never died .

		That incomprehensi - ble magnetism , that power of making and keep - ing interest , still lives in the pages of her book .

		This is not like the books of other women ; there is about it a subtle something that is as intangible as perfume , but is yet real .

		The book by Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	on '' Little Gardens '' is the very antipodes of '' An Island Garden . ''

		Just as Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	's garden was unique , so is her volume full of rare thought and elusive sentiment and poetic comparison .

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	's book deals chiefly with flowers in perhaps the most unromantic and undistinguished conditions under which flowers ever bloom , -- namely , in a city yard .

		For such a subject the hypaethral ecstasy of the poet would be ridiculous .

		Yet there is not lacking beauty of thought in Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	's book ; while for absolute and sensible instruc - tion it excels .

		It is a reasonable book , bear - ing reason in its advice , and , since it aims to mitigate the ugliness of city life , with a distinct reason for being .

		The author 's in - structions and plans for little gardens '' in the half-country '' are less pleasing than the city chapters , and the flower lists are not so well - chosen ; but his words have an earnestness and truth that force us to heed them .

		He dares to quote
Bacon	PERSON	's '' Essay on Gardens , '' in the face of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's dictum that the presence of such quotations always makes the reader put down the volume in hand and fall to reading
Bacon	PERSON	himself .

		It is the season when we all , for love 's sake , would be '' frantic-mad , with evermore unrest . ''

		For is there not a host of lovers rising up to call their pur - suit blessed , and to urge us all to join their quest ?

		368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, is full of tiny infant songs and chirps .

		Come out , then , with opera-glass and bird-book , and join the ranks of the confessed lovers of the wild .

		Truly you may return to the town with ' hose ungartered , bonnet unhanded , sleeve un - buttoned , shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation , ' but you will return happy , and perhaps a little wise . ''

		These almoners of nature 's charms have new and alluring things to say in books .

		For those of us who would have some science on which to base our devotion , and to whom a bird by any other name than its own would not sing quite so sweet , there are guide-books with facts indubitable .

		For those who eschew rules and reasons , there are '' homilies of love '' for pure enjoyment .

		Mr.
Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	's `` Field Book of Wild Birds and their Music , '' a volume of form and size convenient for actual use in the field , is unique in the emphasis it places upon bird songs .

		Not only are the songs minutely de - scribed , but the musical notation is given with an elaborate key for the benefit of unmusical readers .

		Here we have the whip-poor-will 's re - iterated exclamation , the screech owl 's descend - ing tremolo , the pewee 's plaint ,
Bob White	PERSON	's whistle , and all the other elusive strains , writ - ten down in black and white , with sharps and flats , grace notes and trills , phrasing and rhythm all complete .

		Can it be done ?

		we skep - tically question .

		Not wholly , Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	admits . ''

		All is a literal transcription , '' he says , `` not without certain puzzling phases , of course ; for who of us have never been both - ered by the rapid performance of expert musi - cians !

		Naturally , therefore , some of my records are imperfect ; indeed , it is safe to add that some singers sang a great deal more than I was able to put down on paper . ''

		It is safe to add , too , that no instrument , human or otherwise , has just the intervals or just the quality of the bird 's voice .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	has performed a wonderful service for the bird lover , and the accuracy of his notation makes it possible to identify many an invisible singer by his song .

		The colored plates with which the book is plentifully furnished are also of great value ; and if we must submit that the robin does n't look exactly as he is here pic - tured , we must remember , too , that the plate - maker and the printer are furnished with only '' limited red , yellow , and blue . ''

		These more conspicuous features of the book should not make us neglect the descriptions of the looks and characters of the birds , which are often briskly humorous , and always show an ideal combination of the lover and the scientist .

		That the passion of the bird lover is equally intense and devoted the world over is proved by Lt.-Colonel
Cunningham	PERSON	's ample volume on `` Some Indian Friends and Acquaintances . ''

		Compiled from '' a series of note-books that were in almost daily use during a period of nearly thirty years ' residence in
India	LOCATION	, '' this work is so careful and appreciative as to inter - est one in birds and beasts quite unfamiliar .

		After reading it one scarcely knows whether to envy or to pity the bird-student who lives in a country where `` the human inhabitants are free from a desire to capture or kill any strange or beautiful living thing that they may meet with , where they have no youthful hereditary in - stinct for bird-nesting , and in mature life no natural appreciation of murder as a fine art '' ; and where , consequently , the birds and beasties need not be sought out in the country , but come to live in one 's garden , and often in one 's house .

		We may pray for this state of things in our own country , -- but should we like it in
India	LOCATION	, where the birds are large and raptorial , and their brilliant colors are usually the ac - companiment of an aggressive , not to say in - trusive , disposition ?

		Should we maintain our equanimity and our devotion unimpaired if crows settled in the garden to dispute our right to be there , if kites flew upon us and snatched things from our hands , and if mynas and cuckoos called and chattered so as to dis - turb our early morning slumbers ?

		Should we enjoy having mongooses , bats , frogs , toads , and snakes in the garden , more bats and various birds in the verandah , musk-shrews and palm - squirrels on the floor of the sitting room , lizards on the wall , rats on the thin ceiling , mice in our books , and jackals in the basement ?

		If so , we should be worthy of our love indeed , as Colonel
Cunningham	PERSON	is of his .

		A volume for pure delight is Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	's `` With the Birds in
Maine	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is not locally limited , in spite of its title ; for are not the wooing of the oriole , the nesting of the olive-back , the first flights of baby red-starts , and the singing - lessons of little parulas , matters of prime importance the world over ?

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	is not one of those phil - osophers who `` fish with a generalization . ''

		She cultivates her bird friends one at a time , and becomes intimate with individuals .

		The tricks and manners , the desires and sorrows , perhaps we might add the morals , of each of
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 them are as real to her as those of her human friends .

		She has gone so deeply into the heart of bird-land that she often half apologizes to us for her intrusions and her revelations , and she knows the hidden truths of bird-life as scarcely anyone else does . ''

		The most fas - cinating of bird utterances to me , '' she says , '' are the low-toned ones not intended for the world at large .

		Not ' talk ' between two , neither notes of warning , nor of welcome , but plainly soliloquies , murmurs , trills , gurgles , and other indescribable sounds , evidently for their own enjoyment .

		Such I often hear over my head , or behind my back , when I can not stir without ending them .

		The finest song , and the greatest variety of shouts and calls to the general public , give me not half the plea - sure I feel when listening to these contented and happy little strains that assure me a fellow creature finds joy in living , and make me know that his life is not passed in constant terror . ''

		For the new devotee of bird - study who would shun detection there is the '' Baby Path - finder to the Birds , '' a little volume by
Harriet E. Kichards	PERSON	and
Emma G. Cummings	PERSON	, which is so small that it will slip comfortably into any pocket and thus bear no witness to inten - tions bird-ward .

		It gives valuable and explicit help , however , with a separate page for each of one hundred and ten of our commonest birds , and numbers which refer the student to
Chapman	PERSON	's Manual .

		Mr.
Ralph Hoffman	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Birds of
New England	LOCATION	and
Eastern New York	LOCATION	is , so to speak , a full-grown manual .

		A welcome novelty is a separate key to the birds of each season -- winter ,
summer	DATE	, and autumn -- with special lists for
March , April	DATE	, and
May	DATE	.

		The descriptions of duck , plover , grouse , and other game birds , and of shore and sea birds , are unusually full .

		Best of all , there are ample illustrations , and the cuts are wisely made most numerous of those species , such as war - blers , sparrows , and vireos , that are hardest to identify .

		The text itself is delightfully full and accurate , and gratefully free from mis - placed sentiment and poetical quotation .

		Lest we should forget that there are other things than birds in the realms of nature .

		Miss
Margaret Morley	PERSON	tells us a fascinating squirrel story called '' Little
Mitchell	PERSON	. ''

		Every child , and every grown person who has a child 's capacity for enjoying simple things , should read this tale of the baby bushy who was found clinging to a tree on Mt.
Mitchell	PERSON	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, his eyes still unopened , and his infant voice lifted in protest against the death by starvation that threatened him when his mother was shot .

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	rescued him , and carried him through a hard mountain tramp tucked safely inside her flannel blouse .

		Having brought him up to responsible squirrel - hood and gallantly offered him his freedom , which he as gallantly refused for her sake , she took him to
Boston	LOCATION	to live a sheltered and happy life as her pet and companion .

		More discursive than any of the other vol - umes in our present group , and also more democratic in its love for wild life , is Mr.
Dal	PERSON	- las Lore Sharp 's '' Roof and Meadow . ''

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	knows what it is to feed a city-starved soul on an occasional glimpse of night-hawks and migrating wild geese ; to tramp where land and river , sky and sea , meet to make the marsh ; to stand * ' upright in a hawk 's nest , sixty feet in the air , in the top of a gaunt old white oak , high above the highest leaf , with the screaming hawks about his head , and marsh and river and bay lying far around '' ; to meet , defy , and spare the giant black snake ; and even to carry a ribbon-snake in his hat .

		He writes of these things , and of many others , simply , lightly , often wittily ; yet he makes us feel in every line the poet 's seriousness and subtlety .

		Here and there , and as a matter of temperament rather than quotable words , he reaches beyond the plane on which man sym - pathizes with animal life , to the plane on which he feels himself one with that life .

		He de - spises the '' tickle-bird-screamer-naturalists who have a mere passing , fashionable madness . ''

		He is equally intolerant of the mere list-mak - ing scientist . ''

		I hardly know , '' he comments , `` which state of mind is farther from the mind of the true nature-lover -- the ecstatic , exclama - tory one , that goes chanting rimes and verses like priests and
spring	DATE	poets , or the analytical , labeling mind , that scours the country with a book , finding out what Linnseus ,
Audubon	LOCATION	, and Gray called things . ''

		He himself is rev - erent toward the whole '' kingdom of Out-of - Doors , '' which he says most of us do not enter because we go in too fast and make ourselves too obvious .

		And he assures us that even when we become real naturalists we must not expect often to have `` those rare moments of wide , free vision when we stand upon the heights '' ; for '' Pisgah came but once to
Moses	PERSON	, though his pathway ran forty years through the wil - derness . ''

		Mr. Sharp takes up explicitly , though in few words , the great arraignment which the other writers leave more or less im - 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, plicit -- the arraignment of the race that goes '' clothed in murder . ''

		The last pair of wood - cocks , which would have kept his marsh '' all wild and untamed , '' are gone , shot down by the pot-hunters .

		Little
Aix	LOCATION	, the wood-duck , whose mother was killed before she could take him to join in the fall migration , lived mate - less a dreary while in the swamp , and then dis - appeared ; for '' the gift of beauty is proving fatal to the wood-duck .

		He is so graceful , so beautiful in dress , that when any other duck would be passed by , he is shot , in season and out , just to be looked at , taken home , and stuffed . ''

		Most cutting of all , the author ex - plains that he finally refrained from killing the great black snake , '' the dragon of the swale , '' because the redbirds , bluebirds , and rabbits suffer comparatively little from him , having ' ^ worse enemies than the dragon , though he is bad enough . ''

		This love of the birds and beasts has its sor - rows , then , its baffling failures , its temptations to bitterness and despair , -- as indeed what love has not ?

		Is it therefore unworthy ?

		Truly not .

		The favors may be long to seek and not too explicit , but they are doubly sweet for their elusiveness .

		And the search is doubly precious because it has no end .

		If we under - stand rightly , we are glad to give ourselves to a devotion that passes our utmost endeavor , and are thankful that '' God who gives tfae bird its angaish maketh nothing manifest , But upon our lifted foreheads pours the boon of end - less quest . ''

		An American Animal , Book .

		* The demand for a one-volume account of American animals , convenient in form and popular in treatment , has been well supplied in the patient , wise , thorough , and witty work of Mr.
William T. Hornaday	PERSON	, director of the
New York Zoological Park	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sub-title of the book , '' A
Foundation of Useful Knowl	ORGANIZATION	- edge of the Higher Animals of North Amer - ica , '' is almost too modest a designation ; all it means is that in a day of specialization this work contains all the special knowledge that could possibly be contained in 450 octavo pages of small but clear type .

		A

		By
William T. Hornaday	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New York :
Charles Scribner	PERSON	' g Sons .

		covers the entire field of vertebrate animals , fish , flesh , fowl , and reptilian , not only in
North America	LOCATION	, where the work is done with all thoroughness within the limits assigned , but including enough of life elsewhere on the earth 's surface and in the air above and waters under the earth to leave a fully adequate im - pression of the whole science of vertebrate zoology .

		In his introduction , after discussing some technical details of nomenclature , Mr.
Horna	PERSON	- day contributes a few remarks headed ^ ' The Intelligence of Animals : A Warning , '' which have special application to the controversy that has been raging more or less harm - lessly of late over the writings of what may be called the neo-psycho - zoological school .

		Mr.
Hornaday	PERSON	does not believe that the average beast is of higher intelligence than the average American voter . ''

		The virtues of the higher animals have been extolled unduly , and their intelligence has been magnified about ten diam - eters , '' he observes .

		♦ ' The meannesses and cruelties of wild animals toward each other form a long series of chapters which have not yet been written , and which no lover of ani - mals cares to write . ''

		He then goes on to ex - cept certain stories from his general charge that most of this recent writing is a comming - ling of fiction and reality ; but it is note - worthy that in this connection he praises most where his own personal observations and expe - riences have been least extensive .

		It must , however , be quickly added that these observa - tions and experiences have been most wide , and that no small part of the charm of the book is due to the interspersal from opening to close of first-hand information .

		Mr.
Horn	PERSON	- aday has also a word of warning in regard to much of the work that is now being done un - der the generic title of '' nature study . '' ''

		Twenty-five years hence , '' he remarks in this connection , '' some of the courses of study of the year
1903	DATE	will be regarded as educational curiosities . ''

		He objects to the plan of begin - ning with the lower and less immediately inter - esting creatures ; and he inverts the process of evolution in his own work , beginning with the anthropoid apes and closing with the lancelets .

		In the course of the narrative all manner of superstitions are overthrown as far as may be , and some matters regarded as doubtful are given Mr.
Hornaday	PERSON	's full authority .

		The gorilla , for example , does beat its breast when enraged , as
Paul Du Chaillu	PERSON	said ; the puma is '' easily found by dogs , chased into low trees ,

		861 and shot without danger '' ; '' porcupines can not shoot their quills , not even for one inch '' ; the bear is seldom dangerous to man , and the deer family is exceedingly so at given times of the year ; hawks , with some notable exceptions , are beneficial to man , and the nighthawk is a goatsucker ; snakes are as '' free from slime as a watch-chain '' ; the living moose is really larger than any extinct Irish elk ; the sulphur - bottom whale is bigger than any animal the fossil remains of which have been discovered ; the rattlesnake not only grows two and three rattles a year , but the rattles beyond ten are discarded through wear ; owls not only do not live with prairie dogs , but are seized and eaten by the latter if opportunity presents ; hoop - snakes do not exist ; the gila monster is not poisonous to man ; the bat no more alights in human hair '' than the humming-bird '' ; there has been only one authentic case of a man 's death by a shark in American waters , and that was in in
1830	DATE	; and so on , through scores of equally interesting instances .

		The manner of treatment throughout is not merely interesting , it is exceediog witty and uniformly readable .

		For instance , in describing the sloths hunted in
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Hornaday	PERSON	, he says , '' Judging by the awful deliberation of those that we saw in motion , I estimated that a really swift sloth could travel half a mile in twenty-four hours , if not sidetracked . ''

		The only defects observable in the work are slight ; as for example in the omission of some common names such as '' milk-snake '' and '' snapping turtle . ''

		The pictures , most of them drawings by artists of repute , are numerous and excel - lent , and the original charts of the first value .

		It would seem that every effort had been made by the author to secure accuracy and modernity of treatment , and his book is altogether one to be prized on every account .


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the best novels published daring the past year or two by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a house that has always made a specialty of high-grade fiction , are now being reissued in popular editions at a low price .

		Among the volumes sent us , we note such ex - cellent stories as Mrs ,
Goodwin	PERSON	's '' White Aprons , '' Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's '' With Fire and Sword '' and '' Without Dogma , '' Miss
Charles	PERSON	's `` ' In the Country God Forgot , '' Mrs.
Crowley	PERSON	's '' A Daughter of
New France	LOCATION	, '' and Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's '' The Love Letters of the King . ''

		The books are clearly printed on good paper , well bound in cloth , and in most cases supplied with a frontispiece illustration .

		Those in search of desirable yet inexpen - sive fiction for vacation reading can not fail to find some - thing to their taste among the volumes in .

		this series .

		* Mr.
Douglas `` W. Freshfield	PERSON	's accoant of his joar - ney '' Round
Kangchenjunga	LOCATION	'' is a real contribu - tion to the literature of moantain travel and explo - ration .

		The author is one of the class of moantain climbers who look to the hills more for help than for information .

		`` I have always climbed '' he says , '' for scenery first , for science afterward , and -- let me add -- for what is included under the modern term < records ' last . ''

		Hence there is in his book an odor of the forest , a vision of rocks and snows , of lofty passes and bottomless valleys ^ rather than a desert of charts and maps .

		Mr.
Freshfield	PERSON	and his companions , Professor
Garwood	PERSON	and
Signer Y. Sella	PERSON	, journeyed through Sikhim and
Eastern Nepal	ORGANIZATION	, with the intention of making the tour of the great mountain
Kangchenjunga	LOCATION	, a feat that bad not previously been accomplished by
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans .

		They started from the last village of the
Teesta valley	LOCATION	, near the frontier of
Tibet	LOCATION	, crossed in a five-days ' march a pass of over twenty thousand feet , and within three weeks reached the village of Kangbacken in the forbidden land of
Nepal	LOCATION	.

		After ten days in
Nepal	LOCATION	the party returned to Sikhim , and skirted the southern flank of the mountain , -- thus accomplishing their aim .

		It was from the
Kangchen Glacier	PERSON	in
Nepal	LOCATION	that the author got his most glorious view of the
Kangchenjunga	LOCATION	group .

		With a reproduction of the magnificent panoramic - teleo photographic picture taken by
Signor Sella	PERSON	be - fore us , we read with interest these words of the author : '' It has been easy to catalogue the several parts that com - posed the astounding landscape before oar eyes .

		Bat it is , I fear , impossible to carry to the reader any notion of tbe * RoEND Kanochenjdnga .

		362 THE DIAJL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, general effect .

		The individaal features of the landscape are not unfamiliar to mountaineers ; the Himalayan griants are , with a difference , greater Alps ; ... but the scale was far larger and the impression left on the mind one of stupendous TastnesB .

		... It is no wonder that the Nepalese yakherds who penetrate to this spot should regard it as the special haunt of the spirit of the mountains , a place where ' Gods and saints dwell in great numbers . ' ''

		Aside from the interest of the book as a record of mountain travel , it contains some valuable observa - tions on the present relationship between British
India	LOCATION	and
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Freshfield	PERSON	, who accom - plished this trip in
1899	DATE	, makes some very clear and terse statements on the aggressive actions of the Tibetans .

		The volume is illustrated with the best pictures of mountain scenery that we have seen in many a day .

		For those who are interested in the strictly scientific phases of the region , there are excellent tentative geological and glacial maps by Professor
Garwood	PERSON	.

		Three newspaper owners of
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	, respectively , sent Mr.
Harry de Windt	PERSON	in
1901	DATE	on a trip '' to ascertain the feasibility of constructing a railway to connect the chief cities of
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
de Windt	PERSON	made a sim - ilar attempt in
1896	DATE	, but met with failure half-way , on the Siberian shores of
Bering Straits	LOCATION	.

		His sec - ond attempt was successful in that he accomplished his purpose , but not so successful in regard to prov - ing that his footsteps will be followed by a practi - cal line of railway .

		His account of the journey , as contained in his book entitled '' From
Paris	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	by Land , '' is graphically told , with a certain air of bravado that is not unpleasing .

		The party of three left
Paris	LOCATION	on
December 19 , 1901	DATE	, bound for
Moscow	LOCATION	, where they met with the usual initial delays ; but early in the following year they were on their way to
Irkutsk	LOCATION	, four thousand miles away .

		From Irkutsk they went to
Yakutsk	LOCATION	, '' the most im - moral city in the world -LRB- with a mental reservation regarding
Bucharest	LOCATION	-RRB- '' ; thence , by hard and starv - ing stages , they skirted the Arctic Ocean , and on
May 19	DATE	reached
East Cape	LOCATION	, on
Bering Straits	LOCATION	, where by rare good fortune they were helped across the Straits , and came within sight of their jour - ney 's end .

		From
Cape Prince of Wales	LOCATION	they came into the borders of the highly civilized surroundings of
Nome City	LOCATION	, thence to
Dawson	PERSON	, and thence to Skaguay by the familiar railway through
White Pass	ORGANIZATION	, on by water to
Seattle	LOCATION	and
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and by rail to
New York	LOCATION	, which latter city they reached
August 19	DATE	, having covered in all over eighteen thousand miles .

		We learn , from one of the many interesting and carefully compiled appen - dices , that the trip through
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	from
Irkutsk	LOCATION	was accomplished by the use of eight hun - dred horses , about eight hundred and fifty rein - deer , and over a hundred dogs .

		The volume is to be commended for its excellent illustrations , and especially for its unusually complete index .

		The volume entitled `` The Great North-West and the
Great Lakes Region of North America	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Paul Fountain	PERSON	, is a somewhat unusual one , both in its genesis and its execution .

		The author , when a lad of seventeen , made a series of rambling trips through the region adequately described in the title ; and now , nearly forty years after , he puts an account of his travels in print .

		His wanderings included the basin of the Great Lakes on both the Canadian ajid the American sides , the
Red River Valley	LOCATION	, the
Winnipeg	LOCATION	region ,
Ottawa River	LOCATION	settle - ments , the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, the
Ohio	LOCATION	, and the
Michi	PERSON	- gan '' districts , '' with a side trip into
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, where a Shaker settlement was visited .

		Mr.
Foun	PERSON	- tain , who prides himself on being a mere lover of nature , confined his rambles almost entirely to the wilds , and hence we have readable accounts of our backwoods life that has now almost disappeared .

		The book is really a medley of accounts of life among the lumbermen , the Indians , farmers , set - tlers , and trappers ; of bird and animal life ; of fish - ing and hunting trips ; of husking-bees and country frolics ; and of pungent , indeed rather peppery , comments on our national traits of forty years ago .

		There is certainly enough in the volume about our Yankee boastfulness , exaggeration , excitability , self-conceit , and squeamishness , to account for the author 's admiration for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's account of
America	LOCATION	.

		But we forgive Mr.
Fountain	PERSON	's restric - tions on account of their faint Borrovian touch .

		Perhaps no part of the book is more entertaining than the chapter describing '' Bees '' -- meaning such affairs as husking-bees , quilting-bees , and the like .

		One excerpt will indicate its quality . ''

		It was the time of the ' Indian Summer , ' a well-known and most delightful season in
North America	LOCATION	, always eagerly looked for ; and the husking took place in the open air .

		It frequently is performed in barns in the
winter	DATE	months ; but there is no fixed time for these * frolics ' as they are most generally termed -- the word ' bee ' being more in use among the lower classes , as I should call them ; but , in my early time at least , one had better have set a match to a barrel of gun - powder than to have spoken of lower classes in
America	LOCATION	.

		Yet there is no country in the world where there is a class held in greater contempt than the class that is dollarless in the States . ''

		Following this is a definition of a '' cob , '' taken from ''
Daniel '' Webster	PERSON	's dictionary !

		Mr.
William N. Armstrong	PERSON	, a brother of the late
General Armstrong of Hampden Institute	ORGANIZATION	, and a member of the cabinet of
King Kalakaua	PERSON	-LRB- the last king of
Hawaii	LOCATION	-RRB- , accompanied his royal master in the latter 's unique tour of the world in
1881	DATE	, and he now publishes an account of the trip in a volume entitled '' Around the World with a King . ''

		The party composing the royal retinue on this trip was certainly an odd one : a king of absolute power in his islands ; the author , an American , who was the
King 's Minister of State	ORGANIZATION	; Colonel
C H. Judd	PERSON	, the Lord
Chamberlain	PERSON	; and a bibacious German Baron for a valet .

		Their trip was modestly planned so as to avoid a possible snubbing from foreign roy - alty , yet in the ten months they travelled they were received with invariable honors by the rulers of the world .

		Mr.
Armstrong	PERSON	, as Prime Minister , evi - m
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 dently had his hands fall in keeping his Majesty in presentable shape , while the King himself re - turned to his dominions a sadder and a wiser man , convinced that his subjects were to be congratulated . ''

		They had enough to eat and wear , and they were cer - tainly happier than any people he had seen ; they were never in debt , because no one trusted them ; their kulianas -LRB- little homesteads -RRB- brought them a living ; they enjoyed music and out-of-door life ; he did not believe that one of his subjects ever - went to bed hungry ; no one ever robbed them ; they had no dyspepsia , which he said was common in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Armstrong	PERSON	had the wisdom to see the incon - gruities of such a journey , and the wit to nar - rate them in an unpretentious and entertaining manner .

		The book is illustrated with portraits of many royal personages of the period described .

		Very different from the foregoing is the account of a trip around the world given by Miss
Lina Boegli	PERSON	in her very readable book entiiled '' For - ward . ''

		A poor Swiss girl , living in
Austria	LOCATION	, full of dreams of world-travel , '' capable of conceiving mad ideas and of executing them , too , '' determines to traverse the globe , and allows herself ten years in which to do it .

		Moreover , she determines to earn her expenses as she goes , by school-teaching .

		Of a lively temperament , with a keen zest for sight-seeing and a will to do , she set out from
Cra	ORGANIZATION	- cow in
1892	DATE	, on the steamer '' Vorwarts '' -LRB- whence the title of her book -RRB- , going in turn to
Australia	LOCATION	,
Hawaii	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	; making long stays at
Sydney	LOCATION	,
Honolulu	LOCATION	, and
San Francisco	LOCATION	, teaching school at each place , and taking side-trips in vacation periods ; and finally ending her leis - urely but venturesome trip at
Cracow	LOCATION	in
1902	DATE	.

		She wrote of her journey to a friend as she saw the passing show , and now the account is published in its original epistolary form .

		Here is an item that will tickle the vanity of New Englanders : '' At last I have found the corner of the earth where I should like to settle down for the rest of my natural life ; that corner is
Concord	LOCATION	... Not that
Concord	LOCATION	is so very beautiful , -- I have seen thousands of places that are far more attractive ; but this one is just what I would like for a perma - nent home : a clean , quiet , restful village , right in the coun - try , and yet near enough to
Boston	LOCATION	... to keep in easy touch with the world .

		Moreover , the atmosphere seems impreg - nated with good , pure , noble thoughts . ''

		The chief interest of the book lies not so much in the descriptions of persons and places , as in the frank personality of the writer .

		Quite in contrast with
Miss Boegli	PERSON	's leisurely journey is Mr.
Jerome Hart	PERSON	's hop-skipand-jump tour through
Spain	LOCATION	, an account of which he pub - lishes under the title '' Two Argonauts in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		The two argonauts went into
Spain	LOCATION	from the north , crossing the Pyrenees with lingering looks on the fair fields of
France	LOCATION	; thence , after a glimpse at
Barcelona	LOCATION	, they hastened on to
Madrid	LOCATION	, where they saw the lighter side of Spanish life ; then on to sunny
Andalusia	LOCATION	, through
Cordova	PERSON	and
Grenada	LOCATION	, finally departing from
Seville	LOCATION	.

		The account of their jaunt was first published in the form of weekly letters to the
San Francisco	LOCATION	''
Argonaut	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		As sketches of travel , the book is light as air , -- the author frankly avers that the reader will find noth - ing in it about religion , revolutions , or politics , -- but the keen journalistic comments are frequently freighted with suggestive common sense , or en - livened by a touch of kindly good humor .

		An instance in point is Mr.
Hart	PERSON	's conjecture that the degeneration of
Spain	LOCATION	is traceable to the eternal rolling of cigarettes , the time lost by that pleasing occupation amounting to about '' forty million days ' labor every year ! ''

		The sub-title of Dr.
R. Logan Jack	PERSON	's `` The Back Blocks of
China	LOCATION	'' runs as follows : '' A nar - rative of experiences among the Chinese ,
Sifans	PERSON	,
Lolos	LOCATION	, Tibetans , Shans , and
Kachins	PERSON	, between
Shanghai	LOCATION	and the Irrawadi . ''

		This is sufl & ciently descriptive of a book relating the experiences of a party oi British travellers who , during the Boxer rising in
1900	DATE	, were compelled to leave the Land of the Sun by the back-door route .

		We believe that Dr.
Jack	PERSON	's record of the conditions and events in western
China	LOCATION	during the
Boxer	PERSON	difficulty is the only complete published account , and as such it has much interest .

		The party of engineers had been examining mining properties in the province of Szechuan ; but in the late
summer	DATE	they were forced to take flight from
Maha	ORGANIZATION	, in the valley of the Ya Lung , west of the city of
Ning Yuan	ORGANIZATION	, and they arrived at
Bhamo	LOCATION	on
October 21	DATE	.

		The hurry of the flight did not hinder Dr.
Jack	PERSON	from making accurate observations of heights , distances , and time , with geological notes ; but it prevented his making any detailed study of the people , among whom he stopped for only brief periods .

		While advocating the partition of the Chinese Empire the author says : '' I doubt , however , whether the resources of any
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean , Japanese , or
American Power	ORGANIZATION	are equal to the task .


Russia	LOCATION	, indeed , may be willing to take the burden , -- in a general way , she seems inclined to take anything she can get , -- but it would beggar her and paralyze even her mag - nificent organization , ... The province is the only real unit of nati onal life .

		If ever the provinces of
China	LOCATION	should assert the independence which they have practically achieved with - out knowing it , every nation which has an interest in progress , commerce , civilization , and peace , will do well to recognize them . ''

		The book bearing the title * ' Pioneering in Cen - tral
Africa	LOCATION	, '' written by the Rev.
Samuel Phillips Verner	PERSON	, brings before us strange lands , strange people , and strange experiences , in a thoroughly interesting and vivid manner .

		As a story of a missionary 's adventures , the volume is as exciting as one could well wish ; hair-breadth escapes are not few , and even the every-day life seems full of excitement of the unexpected and the unknown .

		Intermingled with incidents of adventure are de - scriptions of scenery well befitting the weird land of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Verner	PERSON	is appreciative of the won - ders of the benighted country , and loses few oppor - tunities to show his delight .

		Sometimes the scenes described seem almost too wonderful , the adven - tures too remarkable ; but Mr.
Verner	PERSON	's style is so 364 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, plainly narrative , and so evidently sincere , that one 's doubts fly before it .

		It is this same sincerity , al - lied with a humorous sense of the incongruous , that brings the African tribes in their pristine kindliness and blood-thirstiness so immediately before us .

		It is hardly necessary to add that the author 's primary purpose is to arouse interest in the missionary work being done by brave men in the heart of the Afri - can jungle .

		The very title of Mr.
Eugene Andre	PERSON	's volume , < ' A Naturalist in the Guianas , '' is a sesame to a world of adventures .

		The author , who for ten years has been a collector in
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Colombia	LOCATION	, tells in a remarkably simple style the story of his two trips up the
Gaura	PERSON	affluent of the
Orinoco	LOCATION	, the land of the fabled El Dorado , -- `` a region of impene - trable forests , of open savannas , mountains of fan - tastic shapes and surpassing grandeur ; a region of abundant rains and rapid rivers -- a region rich in bird , insect , and vegetable life , but difficult of ac - cess and deadly in climate . ''

		Mr.
Andre	PERSON	's first trip to the Caura river was in the nature of a pleasure tramp in search of orchids , with Turagua Moun - tain , the most important of the mountain masses in the region , as the objective point ; while his second and more hazardous journey was into the little known region of the
Merivari River	LOCATION	and
Ameha Mountain	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a naturalist , he of course took his keenest delight in the oddities of nature .

		One can readily imagine the pleasure afforded by a sight of the following improvised and untrained circus : '' On more than one occasion I observed capuchins per - form an acrobatic feat in the style of the leaping : somersaults from the
spring	DATE	board one sees at a circus .

		If a troop of these monkeys while travelling through the tree-tops came to a spot where the trees were some distance apart , they would run out to the end of some thin , pliable , but strong branch , and leap up and down until they caused it to sway violently ; then taking advantage of the momentum of the swinging branch they would clear the intervening distance one after the other , a feat which they would have been una - ble ^ to perform from a stationary object . ''

		But all was not a circus holiday .

		On the return trip , the work of months was lost by the wrecking of a boat containing valuable specimens and photo - graphic views , and the author 's extensive journal .

		With little food , and a good two hundred miles before them , the party of fifteen men set out to beat their way back to the nearest station .

		After twenty - eight days of suffering eight starving human beings dragged themselves into the settlement at La Prision .

		Mr.
Andrd	PERSON	tells his tale in such a pictur - esque way that one is tempted to give his account more than one reading .

		The fact that Dr.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	has written an appreciative preface to the volume is high commendation of its quality .

		`` This is
Illyria	LOCATION	, lady , '' the Captain informed
Viola	PERSON	, and from that time began
Viola	PERSON	's troubles in love .

		Likewise Miss
Mary E. Durham	PERSON	had many humorous affairs of the heart in her travels through
Illyria	LOCATION	, as recounted in a bright and thoroughly vivacious style in her volume entitled `` Through the Lands of the Serb . ''

		From her starting point ,
Cetinje	LOCATION	in
Montenegro	LOCATION	, where she received five offers of marriage in twenty minutes , to
Valgevo	LOCATION	in
Servia	LOCATION	, where she dodged a roomful of impe - cunious army officers each willing to become a
Benedict	LOCATION	, thence to
Belgrade	LOCATION	, where she escaped a handsome police officer who offered to clear a way for her through life , she made a triumphant tour through lands that have been the shuttlecocks of the nations .

		It is hardly fair to the author , however , to give the impression that her journey -LRB- sprightly as is her description of it -RRB- was a frivolous one , for she seems to have touched the life of the
Montene	PERSON	- grins and the Servians most thoroughly .

		She points out this interesting difference between the two nations : '' During all these years the Montenegrins have been learn - ing to obey while the Servians have learnt to oppose all forms of government .

		The subjects of Prince
Nicola	PERSON	are disciplined and self-respecting ; of those of
King Peter	PERSON	it has not been inaptly remarked that where there are four soldiers , there are five generals . ''

		We learn from a publisher 's note included in the present volume that
Miss Durham	LOCATION	is now in
Mace	LOCATION	- donia .

		It is to be hoped that she will publish an account of her travels there . ''

		In the Uttermost East '' is the title of one of the most substantial and instructive books on the Sibe - rian exile system and the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	question in gen - eral that have recently appeared .

		In addition to extensive travels in
Korea	LOCATION	,
Siberia	LOCATION	, and
Manchuria	LOCATION	, the author , Mr.
Charles H. Hawes	PERSON	, made a thorough investigation among the natives and the Russian convicts of the little-explored island of
Sakhalin	LOCATION	, lying to the east of
Manchuria	LOCATION	and the Amur re - gion , far beyond the terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway .

		As the first English traveller to explore the northern interior of the island , Mr.
Hawes	PERSON	is able to give us many new facts concerning life among the convicts in this far-away penal settle - ment , and regarding the customs and manners of the hitherto undescribed natives -- the
Gilyaks	PERSON	and the
Orochons	PERSON	.

		Concerning morality at this outpost of civilization he notes that '' there must be a larger number of crimes committed in proportion to the population on
Sakhalin	LOCATION	than anywhere else . ''

		In regard to the natives , we learn that the
Gilyak	PERSON	is short of stature , wiry , and spare of limb ; his com - plexion is tawny and gipsy-like but not yellow , and his hair , worn in a pigtail , is black .

		The Orochons , according to Mr.
Hawes	PERSON	, are in some respects supe - rior to the Gilyaks ; they are probably '' a branch of the great Tungus race of which the
Manchu	ORGANIZATION	is the most civilized , and the so-called
Tungus of Eastern Siberia	ORGANIZATION	the wildest representative .

		The Orochon is only a little less wild than the Tungus , but he ap - pears to have come more in contact with surround - ing tribes ... and to have been influenced to lead a rather less nomadic life than the original stock . ''

		The
Orochons	PERSON	are also superior to the Gilyaks as linguists , as hunters , and as traders .

		Mr.
Hawes	PERSON	has told his story well , and has height - ened the interest of his account by many helpful and
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 36 $ interesting sketches and photographs , and a com - plete map of his travels .

		Mr.
Bart Kennedy	PERSON	, who is evidently a man with an open mind and a spirit of camaraderie , tells us in his book entitled '' A Tramp in
Spain	LOCATION	'' of a roving pilgrimage from
Andulasia	LOCATION	to
Andorra	LOCATION	.

		His object was to get near the heart of Spanish life : * ' to go into and explore the towns , to go through the mountains , to tramp through country parts , to see the cathedrals and places of art on the way ; in fine , to see
Spain	LOCATION	from as many view-points as possible . ''

		Armed with a revolver , a knapsack , and a passport , he thus wandered through Andulasia and
Granada	LOCATION	, lands characterized by the spirit of '' manana '' and inhabited by a charming pleasure - loving people .

		In
Guadalajara	LOCATION	, the men impressed him as a '' fine lot of fellows , '' with broad and rather hard faces , suggesting the Scotch , -- such men as hardly belong to a '' dying nation . ''

		In
Catalonia	LOCATION	, the inhabitants are described as virile and energetic , with a hard look in their faces , but without the underlying suUenness that characterizes the faces of men in
Castile	LOCATION	.

		Throughout his book Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- nedy casts a rosy hue about the much maligned Spanish people , and he takes a particular pleasure in ridiculing Americans for pitying them .

		His impression of the working classes in
Spain	LOCATION	is thus summed up : '' I saw a working people who are better off than our own working people .

		A people with more to eat -- a people bet - ter housed -- sturdier people -- a healthier people .

		In fine , a people who got more out of life .

		They had plenty of bread and plenty of wine .

		They took it easy .

		They did not have to conform to that sinister and horrible paradox -- to kill one 's self to live . ''

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	relates his many interesting adven - tures in a decidedly personal manner , his style being an odd mixture of the garrulous , the affected , and the picturesque .

		Any book dealing with the
Balkans	LOCATION	is sure to prove of lively interest , and almost certain to con - tain a prediction of immediate trouble in a region where trouble is native to the soil .

		Mr.
Reginald Wyon	PERSON	's volume , `` The Balkans from Within , '' is no exception to the rule .

		The author , who spent sev - eral years in the
Balkan States	LOCATION	as a special corre - spondent , has made a sympathetic study of the vola - tile Albanians , Serbs , Montenegrins , and Bulgars , and has written a most readable book about them .

		He states that < ' The greater part of this volume is occupied with an endeavor to conjure up rough pictures of life amongst the sturdy and warlike inhabitants of certain
Balkan States	LOCATION	. ''

		That Mr.
Wyon	PERSON	has a most affectionate regard for these people , and a most fervid hatred for their oppres - sors , is evident on every page .

		In view of the great Eastern war now waging , the following prediction is pertinent : '' To a very great extent the immediate fate of the Bal - kans depends on events in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Over one hundred unusually good illustrations add to the attractiveness of the volume .

		The last book on our present list is the impor - tant two-volume work by Captain
Otto Sverdrup	PERSON	, entitled `` New Land . ''

		Captain
Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	, who will be remembered as Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's chief lieutenant in that explorer 's trip into the farthest north , made no attempt to reach the pole .

		His expedition , how - ever , was made in Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's famous ship , the '' Fram , '' this time fitted out solely for exploration and scientific purposes .

		With fifteen men Captain
Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	left
Norway	LOCATION
June 24 , 1898	DATE	, and returned in
September , 1902	DATE	, having spent four years of hard work in exploring the new land .

		The region trav - ersed and explored by the party covers an approxi - mate area of over one hundred thousand square miles .

		The area mapped by the expedition lies to the north and the east of
Greenland	LOCATION	, or more spe - cifially to the west of
Kane Basin	ORGANIZATION	and
Baffin Bay	LOCATION	, and to the north of Jones Sound .

		The northern shore of
North Devon	LOCATION	was also mapped .

		King Oscar Land , west of
Grinnell Land	ORGANIZATION	, and EUesmere Land , were explored ; EUesmere Land being crossed for the first time by any explorer .

		The islands to the west of King Oscar Land , and lying north of the
Parry Islands	LOCATION	and
King Christian Land	ORGANIZATION	, were named Amund Ringnes Land and
Ellef Ringnes Land	PERSON	, in honor of the men who bore much of the expense in fitting out the expedition .

		Isachsen Land was named in honor of
Captain Isachsen	LOCATION	, the cartographer ; and the last and largest of the islands in this new region , lying immediately to the northwest of King Oscar Land , is now called
Axel Heiberg	PERSON	Land , after Con - sul
Heiberg	PERSON	, who was the third man to share the expense of the expedition .

		Captain
Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	states the main problem of the exploring party as follows : '' In our over-land journeys from
Hayes Sound	ORGANIZATION	, we had observed that the country was indented by larger fjords , and it appeared to me that the best thing we could now do would be to ascertain whether or not these fjords were connected with
Norskebugten	PERSON	or
Greely Fjord	ORGANIZATION	, or whether there really existed a sound northward to Qreely Fjord . ''

		The problem was solved by
Captain Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	, who discovered the existence of a sound northward to Greely Fjord . ''

		Straight across the sound ... and as far north as we could see , the waterway was covered with pressed - up autumn ice , horribly difficult to make one 's way in , apparently , but little we cared for that .

		We had looked into the promised land .

		We gave a sigh of relief , one and all , and were as happy as children over it . ''

		This brief summary conveys no adequate idea of Captain
Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	's spirited and noteworthy account of his four years ' trials in the Arctic regions ; but it is all that our space will permit .

		The volumes are well illustrated with over two hundred plates and drawings , and are accompanied by a number of valuable maps .

		* In `` The American Prisoner '' Mr.
Eden Phill	PERSON	- potts gives us something more closely approaching the conventional romance than be has written hitherto .

		His work has still the idyllic quality , and is strongly flavored with the soil , but it has also the interest of ingenious and complicated plot and of the historical background .

		If his '' Children of the Mist '' and other earlier books brought him fairly into comparison with
Blackmore	PERSON	, our sense of his kinship with that writer is strengthened by the present performance , which portrays the scenes and types of character that
Blackmore	PERSON	loved , and tells a story almost as fascinating as ''
Alice Lor	PERSON	- raine '' or `` The Maid of Sker . ''

		The scene is Dartmoor , and the time that of the Napoleonic wars ; or , what is more to the point , of the unhappy war between
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It will be remembered that
Dartmoor	PERSON	was the site of a great war prison , where both French and Amer - ican captives were held in durance at the time in question .

		One of these captives , a lusty young Amer - ican sailor from
Vermont	LOCATION	, is the hero of the romance , the heroine being the daughter of an English gen - tleman farmer living thereabouts .

		Being a master - ful person , and holding the American rebels in de - testation , it is natural that he should oppose the aims of young love , and a pleasant complication results .

		The book is widely diversified in its inter - est , is not burdened with an intolerable weight of dialect , and belongs to the class of fiction which , while not failing in entertainment , is also literature in a fairly high sense .

		Another masterful person , thwarted by a roman - tic and disobedient daughter , is presented for our ao - * The American Pkisoneb .

		quaintance in ''
John Maxwell	PERSON	's Marriage , '' by Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	.

		The scene is the Protestant Ire - land of the north , the time the sixties and seventies of the eighteenth century .

		The coincidence re - ceives still further emphasis from the fact that the hero , although an Irishman by birth , becomes im - plicated in American history as an agent of the Revolution .

		The story of his marriage , and of the important consequences that proceed from it , we leave to the reader 's investigation , with the assurance that he will find the task agreeably exciting .

		The story is a capital one from every point of view , and we commend it with a good conscience .

		Dr.
William Barry	PERSON	is a novelist who must be reckoned with , although his work is very uneven . ''

		Arden Massiter '' was a story of such remarkable quality and romantic interest that the appearance of '' The Dayspring , '' a few weeks ago , aroused in us anticipations of the most pleasurable nature .

		They have not been altogether realized , for the work is rather confused in plan , and weighed down with episodes and situations that do not stand in very close organic connection with the plot , but there is no denying the brilliancy of its detailed execution , or the extraordinary energy and vivid - ness of the dramatic scenes which are presented as the climax in neared .

		For the rest , it is a story of the War of
1870	DATE	, of the Commune , and of the triumph of the Versaillais .

		The hero is an Irish refugee in
Paris	LOCATION	, who allies himself with the social - ist cause , and barely escapes with his life during those exciting
May days	DATE	.

		His love for a young widow of the noblesse causes duty to be thwarted by inclination , and gives him a di # Bcult course to steer .

		As is quite proper , a lucky escape from the difficulty is in the end provided , and we leave the happy lovers on the verge of a new life , look - ing westward across the seas for their future .

		No one who can appreciate romance of the better sort will regret having read this book , even if it does fall somewhat below the level of the author 's best achievement .

		`` The Red Leaguers , '' by Mr.
Shan F. Bullock	PERSON	, is the story of an imaginary uprising in the
Ireland	LOCATION	of the present or the future .

		The conditions are strictly modern , but beyond that general fact , there is no time-indication of a definite character .

		We learn just how the thing is to be done , as the rebel - lious Irishman pictures it to himself -- how the carefully-laid plot and oath-bound league lead to a concerted revolt in scores of towns at once , how the leaders seek in vain to restrain the passions of their men , how the country-side is deluged with blood , and how in the end the whole thing collapses through indecision and jarring counsels .

		The story is told with considerable spirit , and shows an intimate knowledge of Irish character as well as of the life of the peasantry .

		Despite their depressing atmosphere and their almost morbid point of view , the novels of Mrs.
Henry Dudeney	PERSON	are so remarkable that they must be reckoned with .

		This writer has heretofore shown

		THE DIAL 367 .

Hardy	PERSON	in the portrayal of rustic character ; she now exhibits in addition much of the power of
George Eliot	PERSON	-- not the creator of Romola and the people of
Middle	LOCATION	-
march	DATE	, but the painter of the '' Scenes from
Cler	PERSON	- ical Life '' and the author of ^ <
Adam Bede	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	's latest novel , `` The Story of Susan , '' takes us into the spiritually murky air of an English vil - lage of some sixty years ago .

		We use this form of description because the theme of the work is not 80 much a study of individual character as it is of a certain hard and unlovely type of religious bigotry , which merely makes life unnecessarily miserable , without offering any apparent compensations .

		Under such an influence a young silversmith and a lady 's maid -- the two leading characters of the story -- are baffled at every step in the endeavor to work out a normal existence , and their lives are blighted almost past the saving .

		A chastened hap - piness becomes theirs in the end , after long years of spiritual agony which are none the less real be - cause the result of artificial causes .

		They are humble folk indeed , but the author 's art makes them intensely alive , and far more significant in their relation to the essential issues of human fate than the high-placed figures that people the greater part of our popular fiction .

		Xbe book is art of a rare and noble sort , but hardly offers entertain - ment as that term is commonly understood .

		`` Yarborough the Premier '' is a novel of the English politics of to day -- or to-morrow -- written with a firm grasp upon the facts of contemporary public life , and carried to a striking conclusion .

		The leading character is a man who rises to power by the most unscrupulous methods , and is redeemed from utter baseness by the sole fact that a deep and genuine patriotism provides a sort of excuse for his course of trickery and deceit .

		In the end , the fruits of his triumph turn to ashes in his mouth , for he has a child whom he idolizes , and this boy , learning some of the secrets of his father 's career , condemns them with all the fearlessness of un - tempted youth , thereby embittering the last hours of the seemingly successful man .

		The novel is one of unusual strength , and is made all the more un - usual -LRB- considering its theme -RRB- by the fact that it is the work of a woman .

		We can hardly congratulate `` John Oliver Hobbes '' upon her latest novel , '' The Vineyard . ''

		To begin with , the title has no meaning whatever within the reach of our discernment .

		That , of course , would not matter were the story itself reasonably interesting , but it is not .

		Nothing more is given us than a study of the relations between a very commonplace Englishman and the two young women who alternately or conjointly enlist his affections .

		One of them appeals to his sentiment , and the other to his interest , and neither is made particularly attractive , whether as a personality or a study of character .

		Of course , there is a certain sort of cleverness and hard brilliancy about the work , but the performance is greatly inferior to what Mrs.
Cragie	PERSON	has shown herself capable of doing . ''

		Susannah and One Other , '' by
Miss E. Maria Albanesi	PERSON	, is a story of private life in modern En - glish society , and turns upon a rather singular complication .

		Susannah -LRB- who is the heroine -RRB- is persuaded by a wicked and worldly sister to pretend an engagement with a man whom she has never even seen .

		This is done to save a delicate situa - tion compromising to the wicked sister .

		But the engagement thus entered upon without any serious intention comes to have serious consequences .

		The man turns out to be worth loving by the heroine , and we soon suspect that he is the '' one other '' of the title .

		There are difficulties and misunder - standings , of course , but the end is satisfactory to the sentimental heart , and the book as a whole has a sort of unobtrusive charm that makes it pleasant to read . ''


Robert Cavelier	PERSON	'' is a romance , as few readers will need to be told , of the great French explorer who first sailed down the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to the Gulf , and added a new realm to the dominions of the French king .

		The book begins with the story of the youthful hero , in the character of a Jesuit novice , just ready to revolt from the discipline and methods of the order .

		He is speedily rescued from that captivity , and brought to
New France	LOCATION	, where we soon find him established in his seigneury of La Chine .

		Then follows the story of his return to the Court , and his acquisition of the royal authority for the carrying out of his great plan .

		His years in the Western wilderness are swiftly sketched , and we at last find him at the mouth of the mighty river , and witness his erection of the royal standard .

		The Jesuit intrigues which seek to thwart him through - out his career are made to contribute effectively to the interest of this simple and straightforward ro - mance , which may be commended in sober , although hardly in glowing , terms .

		A somewhat more pretentious romance of Amer - ican history is entitled '' When Wilderness Was King , '' the work of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	.

		This is a story of the
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	massacre of
1812	DATE	, told from a close study of the historical records available , and shaped into romantic form by means of the not uncommon accessories of homespun hero , courtly rival , and distressed maiden heroine .

		The historical theme has been used before , but not upon so large a scale as the present ; in fact , nearly the whole action of the story is concerned with the events of three or four days .

		Within this brief period , however , there is condensed excitement enough and to spare .

		The sort of thing may be easily imagined , for it has been done a hundred times before .

		The book is exceptionally pleasing in its manufacture , and is adorned with a series of noteworthy colored illustrations , the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Kinney	PERSON	.

		The peculiar type of novel based upon the in - tense rivalries of competition in the American in - dustrial and financial world has become a perma - 363 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, nent featare of our current fiction .

		The novels of every season now include several such works , and they are apt to be among the best of the yearly output .

		As a concession to prejudice , the love - interest is still allowed a certain place in the plot , but it is subordinated to the real interest of the ac - tion , which centres about some drama of industrial leadership , or clash of warring financial interests , or unholy alliance between commercialism and poli - tics .

		And , somewhat to our surprise , this new sort of story is as absorbing , in its way , as was the story of older fashion , which knew nothing of such con - ditions or of such a life .

		We have just been read - ing , for example , with deep and unflagging inter - est , Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	's story of '' The Grafters , '' a typical example of the kind of novel here consid - ered .

		It tells us how a young lawyer in a far Western city attacked the intrenched forces of financial and political corruption , and routed them after a desperate and intensely exciting battle .

		They had planned to steal a railroad and give the newly-discovered oil-fields of the state into the hands of a conscienceless monopoly .

		In assailing these dragons of a very modern type , the hero dis - played an energy and a resourcefulness that make the exploits of Siegfried seem but a tame achieve - ment .

		His final coup deserves admiration for its ingenuity and effectiveness .

		The book is written in a nervous and phonographic dialect , without any style worth mentioning , but well suited to the re - quirements of the scenes and the situation .

		It is rather too crowded with incident toward the close , and rather too technical in its phraseology for the average reader , but there is no denying the breath - lessness of the interest with which we approach the climax of its elaborate and skilfully-contrived plot .

		A second book of this same general type is '' The Great Adventurer , '' by Mr.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	.

		Here we have the story of a gigantic Trust and its organizer .

		It is a bigger trust than any hitherto created , a very trust of trusts in its far-reaching and comprehensive scope .

		After it has fastened its grip upon most of the industries of the nation and had its natural consequences of raised prices , labor troubles , and general public anathematiza - tion , its organizer comes to the conclusion that the industrial structure he has reared is a menace to the country 's safety , and sets about its disintegra - tion in his habitual masterly way .

		The story is a dull one , on the whole , although it has a certain share of ordinary human interests , including that of love , and although a gentleman burglar is found among the characters , contributing a novel and agreeable diversity .

		Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's new book is a great dis - appointment .

		< ' Sir Mortimer '' is called a novel on the title-page , although this is a misuse of the word , for the book is romance of the most evident kind .

		But that is a trifling criticism .

		Our disap - pointment arises from the fact that this accom - plished writer seems to have forgotten how to tell a straightforward story in fitting language .

		In this Elizabethan romance of adventure on the Spanish Main , she tells a story that is anything but straight - forward , that is thin in real texture , and that seeks to conceal its poverty of invention beneath a heavy load of rhetoric and verbal ornamentation .

		This affected euphemism is not a good imitation , and will deceive no reader of discernment .

		The trick of Elizabethan mannerism intrudes upon us at every point , clogs what action the story has , and leaves on the whole an unpleasant impression .

		As for the hero , we venture to think that so impossible a fig - ure has rarely been projected into a work of fiction .

		We are almost inclined to say that
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's first book was her best , and that she has steadily declined ever since .

		Certainly her '' Prisoners of Hope '' had real distinction of style and real fresh > ness of invention , and we doubt if she has quite equalled either in her later books .

		No season of American fiction would be complete without a romance of the Revolution ; for the pres - ent season the want is supplied by Miss
Mary G. Francis	PERSON	. ''

		Dalrymple '' is the title of the book and also the name of the hero .

		The period is between the evacuation of
New York	LOCATION	by the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	forces and the evacuation of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	by the British .

		During most of this time the hero is an in - mate of the prison-ahip `` Jersey , '' and it was for the special purpose of making her readers acquainted with the horrors of that particular form of durance that the author wrote her book .

		In this matter she has relied chiefly on Dring 's '' Recollections . ''

		The heroine , as usual , meets with the determined oppo - sition of the Tory uncle who has her in his charge , and is wooed in vain by a British officer .

		As usual , also , the hero and the British officer afterward meet on the field of battle , and the latter is defeated in order that his life may be magnanimously spared by his victorious rival .

		We should really feel de - frauded did not this situation occur at the proper juncture .

		Miss
Francis	PERSON	puts a good deal of reason - ably accurate history into her work , and her perform - ance is a fair average example of the class to which it belongs .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		The hero of the
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	's latest novel , '' Violett '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is the son of a man executed for the murder of the little girl whose kinsman , guardian , and heir he was .

		As the child grows up he displays softie - thing akin to genius as a musician .

		His first associations are with a family of music hall performers , -- father , mother , and daughter ; his next with the musically edu - cated and highly cultivated daughter of a neighboring clergyman .

		The action of the book , it should be stated , takes place on the English coast and in
London	LOCATION	.

		The boy , overshadowed by the horror of his father 's fate , naturally refuses to take the fortune for which the crime was committed , and this rejection breaks off the mercenary marriage with the daughter of the theatrical family , who promptly marries within the profession .

		The hero is taken up by a great master of the piano , a
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 369 man of genius rather than of character .

		The music hall girl is maltreated by her husband , and
Violett	PERSON	goes back to her .

		The end is tragical .

		It may be seen from this bald statement of the argument how much opportunity is given the author for noting the interplay of character coupled with environment , and probably no higher praise can be accorded her work than to say she has made all the resulting developments as con - vincing as they are interesting .

		After proving his knowledge of the life of the
New England	LOCATION	coast through a number of well written short stories and a book of verse , Mr.
Joseph C. Lincoln	PERSON	has now achieved an excellent piece of sustained fiction , • ` Cap'n Eri : A Story of the Coast '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Three old fishermen , of that
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	type which lends itself so well to genre work of this sort , are keeping house with - out feminine assistance in a manner so wholly unsatis - factory that in desperation they draw lots to see which one of them shall marry .

		The unfortunate one on whom this duty devolves advertises , with the assistance of his comrades , for a helpmate , and in response comes just the sort of woman no one could have expected under the circumstances , -- a thrifty and capable widow from a seaport not far away .

		She reduces the domestic chaos to order , but , through an accident befalling a neighbor , is compelled to remain in the house without any understanding from the shrinking swain who adver - tised .

		The comedy of this situation is abundantly re - lieved by a pretty , youthful love story , by the actuali - ties of life in a small village by the sea , and by the unfailing good sense and good nature of '' Cap'n Eri . ''

		An unusual tale of mismating and unhappiness is told by Miss
Katherine Maokay	PERSON	in '' The Stone of Des - tiny '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , in which a man of aspirations both humane and artistic is wedded to a sensual woman whose sole interest lies in matters of the body rather than of the soul .

		The man feels the growing interval between them , and endeavors to bridge it over .

		The wife makes no effort to restrain him at the end , though for a time the lures by which she had won him are tried until their inefficiency is demonstrated .

		The man 's mother is the best of the characters in the story , a high born and highly bred woman whose understanding with her son is perfect and whose influence is for good whenever it can be exerted .

		At the climax the wife , whose misfortune seems to be temperamental , falls in love with another , but refuses his advances because of her feeling of motherhood ; and the book closes with the problem decided , seemingly , by the man 's acceptance of all the consequences of his own error .

		Though brief the story has literary merit , and offers much food for thought .

		A straightforward historical romance constructed out of unhackneyed materials will be found in Miss
Josephine Caroline Sawyer	PERSON	's '' All 's Fair in Love '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The time is that of
James I.	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	, the scene for the most part the court of the regent of the northern kingdom , the
Duke of Al	ORGANIZATION	- bany .

		The characters are all of noble blood .

		The son of the
Earl of Douglas	ORGANIZATION	and the exiled scion of the house of
Percy	LOCATION	, Earl of
Northumberland	LOCATION	, are the joint heroes ; the daughter of the house of
Neville	LOCATION	, Earl of West - moreland , and an untitled descendant of a Scottish king are the heroines .

		The book concerns itself first with the fortune of one , then of the other pair , though all four personages are intimately involved from the be - ginning .

		There is a flavor of high chivalry in the con - duct of
Douglas	PERSON	, a sweet femininity about
Eleanor Neville	PERSON	, that are altogether pleasing , and the tale makes good and interesting reading . ''

		A Country Interlude '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is
Miss Hilde	LOCATION	- garde
Hawthorne	PERSON	's tale of a world-weary girl who , with her mother , after many years of fashionable life seeks refuge in their old home , far from city influences and life .

		At the time of her voluntary and most welcome exile the girl is betrothed to a man of great estates , a charming fellow of the pleasure-loving class , a man of affairs and not of sentiment .

		A neighbor who as a boy was a pet of the mother 's has grown to be a painter of marked skill and reputation in the intervening years , and bis friendship with the family is taken up again .

		The girl being a lover of birds and flowers , of sim - plicity and sweetness , the inevitable happens as grace - fully as needs be , the interval being filled in with a minor love story between the local clergyman and a fashion - able frivolous girl friend .

		The story , told throughout in the almost obsolete form of letters to a friend , is idyllic and charming to a marked degree .

		Politics is the dominant note in Mr.
Arthur Colton	PERSON	's `` < Port Argent '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , and something more than the ordinary philosophy that characterizes reform literature is to be found in the book .

		Mr.
Colton	PERSON	places political control of the Western city that lends its name to the book in the hands of a young engineer , a man who is used to getting work out of men .

		He continues to get work for the public good out of his henchmen , working with imperfect instruments toward a praiseworthy end .

		But in the process he has to turn sharp corners with his conscience .

		Though of vital importance , the point made is one little considered , especially by such men as are typified in this work in the person of a popular preacher-lecturer , unattached to any church but an ardent and uncompromising believer in ideals .

		There are other elements besides politics in the book , including love as a matter of course , with the young engineer and the lecturer as rivals for the hand of a girl steeped through comradeship with her father in the ideals of a passing generation of Americans .

		The reader of Miss
Margery Williams	PERSON	's '' The Pride of Youth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will experience a real sense of deprivation in that the promise of the opening scene , with its deliciously contrived situations and dialogue , should not have been a better foretaste of the quality of subsequent chapters .

		Yet , with this said , all the fault has been found that need be .

		A girl on the
New Jersey	LOCATION	coast , living a life in which everything grates upon her and tends to drive her to recklessness , meets a
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia newspaper man who is still in the '' literary '' stage of his journalistic development .

		.

		Really incapa - ble of comprehending one another , he with that vast ignorance of womankind that makes judgment so easy , and she with ideals that she drives herself to conceal only too effectually , they drift into what passes with both for love , and he drifts out again , -- all in the space of a
summer	DATE	's vacation .

		The interplay of characters upon one another is most commendably brought out , and constitutes the chief interest of a praiseworthy book .

		Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	's `` The Cost '' -LRB- Bobbs -
Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is if anything a profounder analysis of hu - man motives and character than any of this writer 's ear - lier books .


John Dumont	PERSON	and
Hampden Scarborough	PERSON	, men of strong yet opposite characters , are in love with
Pauline Gardiner	PERSON	.

		Knowing her parents ' well-founded objections to his suit ,
Dumont	ORGANIZATION	persuades her into a secret marriage .

		Not long after , she meets Scar - 370 THE DIAL -LSB- JuDe 1 , borough , and the two fall deeply in love .

		When the two men take up the duties of life ,
Dumont	PERSON	finds his abilities trend toward trust organization .

		Scarborough develops power as a public speaker , and takes the side of the man against the dollar .

		Pauline is forced to leave her husband through the openness of his wrong - doing , and he makes himself a mighty financial power in Wall Street .

		The scenes in which he is first over - thrown in the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	and subsequently recoups are among the most powerful in recent fiction , and with them may be named another scene in which
Scarbo	LOCATION	- rough is nominated as governor in spite of moneyed opposition .

		Those familiar with Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	's `` ' Conjuror 's House '' and * ' The Forest '' will find the same material used in them commingled in his latest work , '' The Silent Places '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story has to do with the pursuit of an Indian who , having made default in his debt to the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	in the far North - West , flees into the wilder - ness .

		One of the two couriers sent to bring him back to justice is a man old and wise ; the other is in the prime of manly strength .

		Through the recklessness of the latter , a young Indian girl escapes from the alien tribe into which she has been adopted , and takes up her path with the two whites .

		By reasop of this circum - stance an accident befalls the younger man , greatly delaying their search .

		The wonders of the northern forests through all of the four seasons , as well as the contrasts between youth and age , feminine devotion and masculine power , the intelligence of the Caucasian and the instinct of the Indian , are all finely drawn , while the knowledge of nature informs every page .

		Her hero in this case is a man of fine
Virginia	LOCATION	traditions , but some - what too preoccupied with his love for a charming girl to display these traditions in practical working for the benefit of his fellow-citizens .

		Most of the action con - centrates itself about the girl he loves , who is the daughter of a gentleman truck farmer aot far from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, himself amassing wealth rapid iy through his closeness to tide water and so to the
New York	LOCATION	market .

		Some of the difficulties presented by the negro problem appear in the book , as if to remind the North that its ignorance on specific points is profound .

		The sunni - ness and cheer of the South , as well as something of its shiftlessness , show here and there , and the atmosphere is unquestionably fully localized .

		There are several interpolated episodes not closely related to the rest structurally , and at the close the hero redeems himself by political activity .

		A social rather than a racial problem forms the theme of Mrs.
Mary Tappan Wright	PERSON	's ```` The Test '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , setting it far apart from its predecessor , * • Aliens . ''

		In this newer novel a young girl , affianced to an erratic but lovable fellow , yields herself to his desires on his plea that it will hefp him to walk the straighter by giving him a feeling of possession .

		This done , he drinks too much , falls under the temporary domination of a girl in a distant city who has always wished him for her husband , and marries her .

		His father has served as a senator of the
United States	LOCATION	, and has been utilizing the girl 's intelligent services in the care of his corre - spondence and the preparation of a history of his times .

		He stands her friend when the trouble comes , while her widowed mother , in outraged respectability , turns upon the girl and rends her .

		In the course of years the patient sufferer redeems herself in the eyes of the rest of her townsfolk , small-souled as most of them are .

		The situations in '' The Test '' are powerful and con - trolled , and the book deserves well of those with a taste for true literature .

		Ranging from
Nat Turner	ORGANIZATION	's negro revolt , through the entire course of the Civil War , Mr.
George Morgan	PERSON	has material enough for several volumes in • ' The Issue '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His characters , so far as the imagina - tive portions of the story are concerned , are Southera men and women of wealth and station , while historical personages are freely drawn upon for vraisemblance .

		The chief heroine -- one of several -- is a young girl left an orphan by
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's massacres , adopted by a rich planter , taken from him through a false assertion of parentage by a kinsman 's machinations , encouraged in Methodist exhorting , and at last becoming an army nurse .

		There is much fighting and some good descrip - tions of battles , culminating at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	; much love that fails to run smooth ; and considerable authentic history , -- including two or three brief sketches of Lin - coln , which are faithful , though not flattering .

		Regret at the untimely taking off of
Hugh Stowell Scott	PERSON	-LRB-
Henry Seton Merriman	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be enhanced by the perusal of a posthumous volume made up of short stories .

		Not one of the nineteen tales contained in • < Tomaso 's Fortune , and Other Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- fails to show the firm touch and literary quality with which this young man treated events that might otherwise have been dismissed as sensational .

		All manner of men in all sorts of places during the last century enter into these interesting pages , and with them women of nearly every rank in life .

		There is a manifest partiality for the Latin countries and their peoples , often presented in contrast with English folk abroad , the racial dif - ferences of temperament -- or the lack of it -- being contrasted with complete intelligence .

		The author 's standard of work in this volume is uniformly high , whether the medium be a novelette , a short story , or a mere conte .

		Out of the plains come the materials utilized to advantage by Mr.
W. R. Lighton	PERSON	in ```` Uncle Mac 's Nebrasky '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		It is of the old days when
Nebraska	LOCATION	was much larger than it is now and was still a territory on the borders of civilization that
Uncle Mac	ORGANIZATION	tells his yarns , which have everything in them that we are accus - tomed to regard as peculiarly Western .

		There is much humor of the broadest sort , and there are Indians galore , cattle thieves , marshals and sheriffs , adventures by flood and field , shooting and strategy , politics , tenderfeet , and all the apparatus necessary to bring out the characteris - tics of a typical frontier scene .

		Uncle Mac leaves the impression of being a good man to have on one 's side in an emergency , with a certain feeling of thankfulness that he is permitted to pass his age under conditions less strenuous .

		A great variety of well handled material has gone into the making of `` The Rainbow Chasers '' -LRB- Little ^
Brown	PERSON	,

Arkansas	LOCATION	, a terra incognita to the American novelist , is the scene of the opening chapters .

		The hero falls into evil ways , and flees from his home with the accusation of murder upon him .

		He becomes a ranchman , and purges his soul of its supposed guilt by long communings with nature .

		Later he leaves the employment he could not like , falls into a particularly well described fight with desperadoes , and begins his real career as a real estate

		THE DIAL 8T1 agent in a booming town near the frontier .

		Here he works out his salvation with the assistance of an excel - lent girl whom he has saved from death in a blizzard .

		Like so many contemporary American novels , the book is valuable as a study of men and manners of a day already passing .

		That
Russia	LOCATION	stands so friendless before the civilized world to-day is in great part due to the seventeenth century methods used by her government in dealing with the Jewish inhabitants of the land .

		In '' The Fugitive '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Ezra S. Brudno	PERSON	, a Jewish lawyer of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, presents a minute description of the horrors of the Kishienev mas - sacre , in which the hero of his most unconventional story plays an active part in the futile attempts at pro- tection made by his co-religionists .

		This hero is a Jewish student of theology , a mere child when his par - ents die as a result of Russian persecution .

		His career is traced through successive stages in
Russia	LOCATION	and Po - land , until he comes finally to the
United States	LOCATION	and finds peace in the successful practice of medicine .

		It is not as a work of fiction , but rather as a vivid recital of cold facts , that the book makes its main appeal .

		Irish stories of unusual worth , based upon the ancient religion of the country , are set forth by Mr.
Aldis Dun	PERSON	- bar in '' The Sons o '
Cormac	PERSON	, an ' Tales of other Men 's Sons '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A gardener from the '' ould turf '' is made to narrate them one by one , to the young sons of the house during their vacation , the me - dium being a rich and not always consistent brogue .

		Not only is the resulting series of tales of the ancient and almost forgotten gods excellent reading at just this time when the Irish language and traditions are excit - ing unusual attention , but they are worth knowing for their own sake as a permanent contribution to the best fairy stories of the ages , suggesting a wide and little - worked field .

		We earnestly wish for more of them in the near future from the same hand , and it would be a favor to the elders of those to whom they are more espe - cially addressed if their sources could be disclosed , assuming they are not purely Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	's inventions .

		It is curious how
America	LOCATION	, the home of the story of crime and mystery , has permitted the French and En - glish to develop her own literary invention .

		But Mr.
Melvin L. Severy	PERSON	, in `` The Darrow Enigma '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has done an interesting thing in bringing into abrupt contrast two men of the older and newer types , the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	of the plot getting the better of its
M. Dupin	PERSON	, who here becomes the villain .

		It might rationally be objected that in the development of the plot there is too much rambling over the earth 's sur - face , in an attempt to bring into the play of char - acters something of the quality of
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	's '' The Moonstone , '' with its oriental possibilities .

		Yet , in spite of its derivational character , the '' mystery '' remains a real one until near the end , -- which after all is the essential thing .

		Gardening and urban rusticity , now so popular ; love , which is always popular ; and ease of living , the great desideratum of most of mankind : these are the factors that act and react through Mr.
Halliwell	PERSON	SutclifiFe 's '' A Bachelor in Arcady '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , leaving an impres - sion so pleasant that one wonders that Mr.
Sutcliffe	PERSON	has not tried something of the sort before .

		Rural
England	LOCATION	, a young land-owner who likes to putter around his gar - den , bis father 's friend the squire , the squire 's daugh - ter , playmate of his youth , and the worthy couple that do the bachelor 's housekeeping and gardening for him , are the chief elements in the desultory narrative .

		There are reflections about many things , rambling disquisitions about nothing in particular , and some mild adventures that take on flavor by contrast , -- all going to make up a pleasant book .

		The joy of young life and high spirits are always manifest in Miss
Frances Aymar Mathews	PERSON	's work , and ``
Pamela Congreve	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is no ex - ception .

		The time is that of the
last quarter of the eighteenth century	DATE	, and the scene begins in rural En - gland , transferring itself quickly to the
London	LOCATION	play - houses , where the beautiful heroine scores a great success and is beloved of half the nobility -- half of its men , that is .

		She returns with some condescension the affec - tion of a duke , while a noble earl who has known her previous to her triumph endeavors to force himself upon her and , failing there , to carry her off by main force .

		Sprightliness is the best word to apply to the narra - tive , with its social and histrionic plots and counterplots , and its wits and beaux , courtiers and belies , for char - acters .

		There is a suggestion of a better natured
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	back of the hero of Mr.
van Tassel Sutpben	PERSON	's '' The Gates of Chance '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , with the further dif - ference that he is a
New York	LOCATION	man of wealth , leisure , unquenchable curiosity , and insatiable desire for ad - venture .

		He early picks up the young newspaper wri - ter who tells the story as it discloses itself in a series of seemingly unrelated episodes with eccentric , unfor - tunate , and criminal men and women , as well as with those in more normal circumstances , the whole coordi - nating at the close into a little love affair with the usual romantic conclusion .

		The book is wholly entertaining , and suggests a career for its author as a writer of thor - oughly modern American '' detective stories . ''

		So far as literary conventions permit , the author of the anonymous novel , `` I : In Which a Woman Tells the Truth about Herself '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , carries out the assertion of the title .

		She discloses the feelings of an ugly duckling changing into cygnethood as has sel - dom been done before .

		Most of the subsequent detail of the story , however , is devoted to telling the truth about her husband and about the wealthy man who sought to tempt her , and they are painted in no pleas - ant colors .

		When one recalls some of the greater books in which men and women have revealed their hearts such books as those of
Pepys	PERSON	and
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	, -- the real revelation of this newer tale dwindles into insignificance , and most readers will be disposed to resent the evident deception .

		Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	's '' Four Roads to Para - dise '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story of life in contem - porary
New York	LOCATION	, the scene shifting to
Rome	LOCATION	, and thence back to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The title of the book is based upon a quotation from the
Talmud	LOCATION	, used as a prologue : `` Four men entered Paradise ; one beheld and died , one lost his senses , one destroyed the young plants , one only entered in peace . ''

		A young widow , come in possession of a great fortune by her hus - band 's will , most of which will go to his blood kin in the event of her second marriage , is the principal fig - ure in the series of romances that make up the book .

		A young and spiritually ambitious clergyman of the English church holds the attention at first , but after he reads a letter entrusted to him by a dying woman for delivery to the widow , with whom he thinks himself in love , Mrs.
Goodwin	PERSON	very properly degrades him from his heroship .

		The book is one of merit .

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jane 1	PERSON	, Mr.
Herbert Quick	PERSON	's aptly named book , ''
Aladdin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , is the real romance of a firm of young men who undertake the booming of the city of
Latti	PERSON	- more , in the middle West , the period being some fifteen years ago .

		The partner who tells the story marries early in the narrative , and the thread of love that runs through the commercial and financial transactions there - after appertains to his old schoolmate and business asso - ciate .

		At the close of a period of remarkable growth and development , the hard times intervene to spoil the partners ' best laid plans , -- but not until they have ex - hausted all the possibilities in seeking to avoid the crash .

		A run on a locomotive made against time during the crisis forms a thrilling incident .

		In all of the fourteen stories that make up the con - tents of Miss
Frances Aymar Mathews	PERSON	's new volume , `` A Little Tragedy at Tien-Tsin '' -LRB-
Robert Grier Cooke	PERSON	-RRB- , there is a reaching out for the unusual and extraordinary that lends an aspect of originality to the entire book .

		Several of the stories , being those in the place of honor at the beginning of the book , have to do with Chinese life as affected by intercourse with Caucasians , and the strength and weakness of both races are presented im - partially .

		From these Chinese stories there is rather an abrupt departure to tales of rural
Canada	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and to others of an historical nature .

		Great versatility and marked talent characterize the volume as a whole .

		Short stories , most of them drawn from business life , make up Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	's volume called '' The Woman Wins '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The title is a shrewd one , founded on the fact that though all the woman wins in every case is a mere man , at some stage in the proceedings she evinces a distinct purpose not to let him get away .

		It is with telegraph operators that Mr.
Barr	PERSON	concerns him - self chiefly , a worthy body of men and women who have received little previous attention from writers of fiction .

		Lawyers come in also , one painter , a writer of tales , some stock speculators , an automobile manufacturer , and an engineer ; while the scenes vary from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, rural
England	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and even
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		There is a great deal accomplished in almost every `` tory , and every one of them is well put together and smoothly written .

		That familiarity with life in both
America	LOCATION	and En - gland is not as rare to-day as it was a brief generation ago is proved anew in Mr.
William H. Rideing	PERSON	's '' How Tyson Came Home '' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- .

		Tyson is English - born but bred in the far
West	LOCATION	, where he has stumbled upon a mine that makes him rich .

		He returns to the native land he has been idealizing through the years of exile , and there his ideals are cruelly shattered .

		The close of the book is not entirely conclusive , but several of the characters , notably the English girl and the Western girl who play so large a part in
Tyson	LOCATION	's devel - opment , are clearly and admirably drawn .

		It is not a pleasant picture that Mr.
Rideing	PERSON	draws of aristocratic society in
Britain	LOCATION	, though his animadversions are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently well-founded .

		A little city in the West , settled by
Easterners	ORGANIZATION	, is the scene of Mrs.
Sara Andrew Shafer	PERSON	's `` The Day before Yesterday '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is concerned with the life of a little girl , who has her share of the strange joys that fall to childhood , and even more than her share of kinsfolk to complicate and mystify her rela - tions to the universe .

		The word idyllic may best be used to characterize the story , though there is a deter - mination of character on the part of the small protago - nist that could scarcely be termed idyllic .

		Mrs.
Shafer	PERSON	's manner is unobtrusively psychological throughout , and her book has much of the peculiar excellence of Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's work in the same field .

		The title-story in Mr.
Charles Bloomingdale	PERSON	's '' The Failure '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a bit of twentieth century fatalism , the hero having every characteristic that should make for temporal success and with the power to enforce it .

		As a lad , in college , and in business , he comes close to attainment , but without gaining the crown of actual achievement .

		Unfortunately for the purpose of the tale , the author 's heart seems to have failed him at the close , and he gives his hero success in the love of a girl who , in similar case , had not before made the most of her own life . ''

		The Failure '' occu - pies about two-thirds of the volume ; the five remaining stories are little more than sketches , journalistic rather than literary in treatment .

		`` TheMicmac '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is a well developed bit of social drama , written by Mr.
S. Carleton	PERSON	.

		AH the ac - tion takes place in the
Maine	LOCATION	woods , where a young
New York	LOCATION	man of great wealth has spent his summers since boyhood .

		He has fancied himself in love with a young widow , but when she comes upon him under con - ditions wholly lacking in artificiality his liking turns to distaste , though in a moment of physical proximity he makes her an offer of marriage .

		Later he chances upon the daughter of a neighboring farmer , and nature strikes a spark between the two at first sight .

		In the serious comedy that ensues , a large swamp intervening between the young man 's habitat and that of his lover plays an important part .

		The book as a whole displays considerable talent .

		A party of young men sail down the
Mississippi	LOCATION	from some point not far from
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	on the
Ohio River	LOCATION	, and the account of their journey to
New Orleans	LOCATION	is pre - sented in '' The Ark of 1803 '' -LRB-
Barnes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
C. N. Stephens	PERSON	.

		It is in time for the hoisting of the stars and stripes over the newly acquired
Louisiana	LOCATION	Pur - chase that the young fellows arrive in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		They have many exciting adventures on the way , and prove themselves good frontiersmen by slaying Indians in open fight during their journey .

		The book is writ - ten for boys rather than for adults , and is notably free from love-making and giving in marriage .

		Miss
Clara Morris	PERSON	's latest novel has little in it to remind one of her former literary work , though it would not be difficult to trace analogies between her art as here displayed and the spirit that has animated her successes on the stage . ''

		Left in Charge '' -LRB- Dil - lingham -RRB- is a harrowing tale of farm life in
Illinois	LOCATION	before the war , in which a woman betrayed into a bigamous marriage in
Canada	LOCATION	comes with her little child to her sister 's house , finds herself cheated out of her patrimony by her kinsfolk , and is forced to do the most servile labor in return for her sustenance , in spite of the rapidly growing wealth of the family .

		The moral issue is distinctly complicated by the avaricious sister 's illness , and nothing whatever comes of the stolen inheritance of the heroine , however much insisted upon at certain stages in the narrative .

		`` The Wood-carver of ` Lympus '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a
Vermont	LOCATION	story by Mrs.
M. E. Waller	PERSON	, far out - side the common run of fiction .

		A powerful young farmer in the
Green Mountains	LOCATION	, ambitious for an edu - cation , is stricken by a tree be is felling and doomed thereafter to a bedridden life , his legs being quite im - potent .

		Interwoven with this are the threads of several other lives , all making it possible for the stricken young man to have his share of the great world 's interests and beauties .

		The Germans of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, commonly called the '' Dutch , '' have appeared but seldom in American fic - tion , though they have preserved through many gener - ations of life in the new world the habits and customs of the fatherland , and have invented a quaint jargon out of the vocabulary and idioms of both English and German which deserves the attention of writers of dialect .

		Miss
Helen R. Martin	PERSON	has made good use of this dialect , and of the hypertrophied thrift and reli - gious eccentricity of the people , in `` Tillie : A Mennon - ite Maid '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is excellent in its delineation of the high aspirations of the heroine , who makes her first appearance as a poorly clad and rudely spoken daughter of the people , the ideals of life waking in her through the kindly ministrations of her teacher , a
Kentucky	LOCATION	gentlewoman .

		An authorized translation has been made by
Sukae Shioya	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
E. F. Edgett	PERSON	of '' Nami-ko '' -LRB-
H. B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the best of the novels of
Kenjiro Tokutomi	PERSON	, himself one of the best-known of modern Japanese novelists .

		In spite of certain idiomatic diva - gations , the result is most interesting .

		The work is avowedly of the realistic school , and except for certain European suggestions of manner the theme is typically exotic , having to do with the intention of the mother of a young naval officer to put away his recently married wife , solely because she has become a consumptive .

		There is a tragic note throughout , but the story is told with much tenderness of feeling .

		Murder and sudden death stalk through the pages of `` A Broken Rosary '' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- , the work of Mr.
Edward Peple	PERSON	.

		An evil woman , an unscrupulous physi - cian , a hasty slayer of his friend turned priest , and one or two others of less consequence , contrive to keep the short narrative filled with all sorts of things , the time being that of the reign of Louis XV .

France	LOCATION	.

		There is , in fact , so much action that Mr.
Peple	PERSON	has no time to devote to graces of diction , but hurries his readers breathlessly through episode after episode to a problem left unsolved at the close . ''

		The Gordon Elopement '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the result of collaboration between Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Harry P. Taber	PERSON	.

		The plot is slight , the '' elopement '' being that of a husband and wife who , weary of keeping house and of being hospitable , flee to a hotel otherwise deserted though in complete running order .

		There they are joined by several others , one pair of whom fall duly in love , and there they all have a jolly good time , in which the reader can not fail to participate .

		The characters and situations throughout have a pronounced Stocktonian flavor .

		So simply and convincingly does Mr.

		These three young people , weary of city life and ways , resolve upon a '' return to Nature . ''

		During a vacation trip to the Catskilla they chance upon an admirable location , in the midst of beautiful scenery and a population near enough to be available and yet not imminent enough to be obtrusive .

		After a long period of patient and successful labor , they return with suflBcient means to go to work in earnest .

		The house is completed , barns and stables are added , more land is acquired and placed under cultivation , various live stock is bought and installed , and the money laid out so well that in the end the hard-working pair find them - selves in possession of a competency for life .

		These harmless , stupid crea - tures fall an easy prey to the hunter who has the hardihood to brave the dangers and take the risks of a winter journey over the treeless plains of the frozen north .

		The sport lies in reaching rather than securing the quarry .

		The chapters on the mountain goat and big-horn sheep are by Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, who writes with his usual dash and freedom of his own hunting days in the Teton range .

		There is a note of sadness in Mr.

		• i i cupy a place midway between the large scientific treatises and the smaller popular manuals , Prof.
John Henry Comstock	PERSON	and Mrs.
Anna Botsford Comstock	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, have prepared a volume entitled '' How to Know the Butterflies '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , the particular design of which is to provide an accurate yet not unduly technical aid to those who are taking up for the first time the fascinating study of these < ' frail chil - dren of the air . ''

		The authors have restricted their field to the
Eastern United States	ORGANIZATION	, but as the spe - cies described are of widespread distribution the book will serve its purpose in almost any section of the country .

		The first part consists of a general account of the butterfly , -- its relations to other insects , its structure , clothing , metamorphoses , and ways of life .

		Then follows a complete scientific classification of the various species , with descrip - tions concise in form yet full enough to enable the collector to identify his specimens with some degree of certitude .

		A separate section is devoted to the skippers , which , though commonly classed with the butterflies , the authors believe constitute a distinct superfamily .

		An important feature of the volume lies in its series of forty-five plates , made from life by the three-color process .

		Though it would be impossible to do justice by mechanical means of reproduction to the beauties of the butterfly , -- '' The velvet nap which on his wings doth He , The silken down with which his back is dight , His broad outstretched horns , his hairy thighs , His glistening colors and his glorious eyes , '' -- these attempts are at least successful enough to form a valuable aid to identification .

		A number of quotations from the poets relating to butterflies are scattered throughout the book , pleasantly diver - sifying its pages .

		S i .1 microscope in recent years , and the perfection of micro - photography , have brought within the reach of the amateur student of the minute things in nature a new world of wonders .

		One of these amateur naturalists , Mr.
J. J. Ward	PERSON	, of the
Birmingham Microscopists ' Union	LOCATION	, has util - ized a series of excellent micro-photographs of ob - jects ordinarily examined by beginners in micro - scopy , for the illustrations in his book on '' Minute Marvels of Nature '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This is in no sense a text-book or manual of microscopy after the man - ner of the encyclopaedic works of Pritchard and
Carpenter	PERSON	, but rather a brief popular description in untechnical language of such simple objects as may be examined with the microscope without the elaborate , expensive , and tedious processes of the modern biological laboratory .

		The book is there - fore written entirely for popular use from the point of view of the amateur , and is in no sense a scientific treatise .

		The chapters of the book are reprinted from various popular magazines of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, but the work is not in consequence of mere local interest , for the objects dealt with , or others similar to them , are of world-wide distribution .

		The reader is instructed in the anatomy of stems and leaves of plants , introduced to the beginnings of plant life , the structure of sea-weeds , and to the animal forms often regarded by the uninitiated as sea-weeds .

		The eggs of insects , the biting or suck - ing mouth parts which afford them weapons , the marvellous ribbons of teeth from snails , and the larva and imago forms of aquatic insects are all well illustrated .

Hubert	PERSON	's `` Liberty and a Living , '' the conditions deplored by the author at that time as tending to a perversion and waste of human life have increased many fold .

		Never before did we pay so high a price for the money we earn , our cities were never so overcrowded , our commercial activity has reached the status of a mania , and our national strenuousness in all directions has passed into a proverb .

		The new edition of Mr.
Hubert	PERSON	's book now published -LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	-RRB- has therefore a decided pertinence and timeliness , and its moral takes on a new emphasis in the light of present conditions .

		For those not acquainted with the book , it should be said that it is the work of a man who decides to discover whether existence is not pos - sible under more rational and congenial terms than are exigent in the life of a newspaper hack in
New York	LOCATION	.

		With his family he takes up a small country homestead on the
New Jersey	LOCATION	coast , and there con - trives , by gardening , fishing , bee-keeping , and other rural occupations , eked out with the modest earn - ings of his pen , to secure a due share of those things that make life really worth the living .

		His enter - taining account of how this was accomplished is not offered with the desire of gaining imitators , but merely as embodying some useful suggestions for those who would like to exchange the low ceiling of the city for the sky of the country without thereby subjecting themselves to physical or moral starva - tion .

		It is a worthy practical accompaniment to the eloquent theory of
M. Wagner	PERSON	's book on '' The Simple Life . ''

		The witchery of golf appears to full The royal game advantage in Mrs.
Charles T. Stout	PERSON	's for women .

		, ° > - , , .

		.

		- m - `` • ^ - n t volumeon `` Golf for Women -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , better known by her unmarried name of Miss
Genevieve Hecker	PERSON	, was the champion player among American women from
1901	DATE	to
1903	DATE	, and she has worked out the theory of the game with scientific precision from a practice that
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 375 seems to leave little to be desired .

		As a result she particularizes to an extent that supplies the veriest novice with a fund of information of the first value .

		Preliminary chapters on the implements of the game are followed by minute instructions for their discrim - inating use .

		Attitudes and the manner of holding the hands and swinging the clubs are not only de - scribed , but Mrs. Stout has been photographed and the photographs reproduced in her book in order to leave nothing in doubt .

		It may be said that in spite of the contortions seemingly essential to champion form , these pictures add greatly to the aesthetics of a game too predominantly Scotch to have in it much of beauty .

		In spite of its inclusive and en - cyclopaedic character the book lacks an index , which should be supplied in subsequent editions .

		By way of offset , to this deficiency , there is added a chapter of '' Impressions of American Golf '' by Miss
Rhona K. Adair	PERSON	, who has been three years the English and five years the Irish Open Champion among women .

		She has many pleasant thingstosay about
America	LOCATION	, and is evidently enjoying everything in her visit to this country -- with the exception of the recalcitrant and contumacious American caddy .

		`` Getting Acquainted with the Trees , '' A tree book y ^ j ^ ^ j
Horace McFarland	PERSON	, is a for bfgtmiers .

		• ' i i i i , book calculated rather to open the eyes , quicken the appreciation , and awaken the curiosity of its readers , than to furnish them with scientific information of a systematic and exhaustive variety .

		It consists of eight informal essays deal - ing with a few of our commonest native tree fam ilies .

		These are intended , so the author tells us , to be '' punctuated with tree walks , '' and they will cer - tainly add interest to such walks , particularly those of the
spring	DATE	and early
summer	DATE	, when the trees are in their too often unregarded blossoming .

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Farland	PERSON	modestly asserts that he is only '' a plain tree-lover '' ; he writes of what he has seen and en - joyed , and when occasionally he mentions some - thing that does not lie within his personal knowledge he advises his readers to investigate it for them - selves .

		His method will appeal to beginners in tree - study , and encourage many who have been repelled by its difficulties .

		Mr.
McFarland	PERSON	is an expert photographer , and has furnished his book with many artistic and interesting illustrations .

		-LRB-
Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A record of yachting in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is gratifying to note that the '' American Sportsman 's Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not to be given up wholly to an exposition of ways and means for taking life , but that American sport in its more manly and less sanguinary aspects is to be afforded some recognition .

		The first volume in this new section of the enterprise is Mr.
W. P. Stephens	PERSON	's '' American Yachting . ''

		The book is not , as might be expected , a hand-book of practical information for the yachtsman ; nor does it have much to say of the pleasures and benefit to be derived from this form of sport .

		It is rather an historical account of the development of American yachting , from the first definite records early in the
last century	DATE	to the present period of indisputable supremacy .

		The contests for the ''
America	LOCATION	'' cup of course form the main thread around which Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's narra - tive is closely woven .

		The account is one of great interest , and Americans may well take pride in its perusal .

		Three volumes of '' Pioneer History Stories , '' by Dr.
Charles A. McMurry	PERSON	, are published for use as school readers by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' Land and Sea , '' '' The Rocky Mountains and the West , '' and '' The

		The style of the books is simple and pleasing , and there are real illus - trations in abundance -- not imaginary pictures .

		A very timely book , by an author of authority , is ''
America	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	and the
Pacific	LOCATION	, '' with special reference to the Russo-Japanese war , by Dr.

		Dr.

Russia	LOCATION	: Her Strength and Weakness , '' and ``
Germany	LOCATION	To-day . ''

		Many readers forego the charms of
Horace Wal	PERSON	- pole 's correspondence because the mass of it is so great as to seem formidable .

		Such readers may be tempted by the small volume of '' Letters of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	'' just published in the ''
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	'' thin paper series , and im - ported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, The selection and editing are done by Mr.

		The text is printed from old-style type on hand-made paper , with rubricated initials , and a frontispiece and title-page bor - der engraved on wood by Mr.

		The poem itself is a plea for simpler and saner ideals of living , a creed that Mr.

		IS it a pleasant hoiu - with Nature you wish ?

		Or would you confirm a recollection of some point brought up during a recent outing , identify a species , or put your finger on some fu - gitive fact in Nature ?

Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	from ConnectictU to
Texas	LOCATION	and from

		The illustrations are magnificent and as true to life as art can make .

		I have never before seen such beautiful illustrations of nature in print .

		I consider that my money has been unusually well invested and sincerely hope that every American who has the preservation and knowledge of wild things at heart will purchase a set of these books .

		To any lover of nature these books will certainly prove a boon indeed .

		I expect to use them constantly , even in my professional work , and especially in my leisure hours in the woods and wilds .

		,405 THE
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	JUBILEE .

		The story is told of an estimable lady in one of our Western cities that upon a certain occa - sion when she was entertaining a German per - sonage of ancient and aristocratic lineage , she sought to impress him with the antiquity of her household belongings , '' All the furniture in thif diioing-rpQpi istirenty-jfiye yeara old , '' she said with an air of importance .

		But the distin guished guest somehow was not impressed as he was expected to be , a fact afterwards accounted for by one of his suite , who slily remarked that his master when at home was accustomed to dine in a hall of which the furnishings were upwards of a thousand years old .

		It is a very modest antiquity that is connoted by the term of a quarter-century , but some - times it is the best that we can do .

		Here in
Chicago	LOCATION	we can now and then `` point with pride '' to some object or institution that ante - dates the Great Fire -- and that means a full generation past , -- but any European can hum - ble us to the dust by a casual observation .

		The older sections of the country can do better than we , and when their commemorations of past occurrences have a national character we may lay some sort of claim to a share of the glory .

		In these matters , we are already on the eve of a long series of tercentenaries , and we doubt not that , when the time comes , the Da - kotas will be found taking a lively retrospective interest in the settlement of
Jamestown	LOCATION	, and
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	will share with
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in glori - fying the voyage of the
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have the right feeling about anniversaries , anyway , and it would be a cruel critic who should have the heart to scorn our well-meant endeavor to annex as much of the past as we may , and to brighten our young lives with the dim reflected splendors of the bygone ages .

		These remarks have been suggested to us by last week 's celebration at
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was only a jubilee -- a poor period of fifty years -- that was celebrated , and to reckon the exact term of half a century required some ingenuity .

		The history of the university began with that of
the State	ORGANIZATION	in
1848	DATE	; its fiftieth commencement was held a year ago , and the celebration of the present year is the fiftieth anniversary of that event .

		But there was a new president to be installed , and the proper year of jubilee had gone by without special observation , and it would not become us to carp at the slight chronological irregularity of the recent doings .

		We are glad that
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	had fiCty years -LRB- or more -RRB- to celebrate , and that the 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, occasion was taken to emphasize its past history and splendid growth .

		Did we not rejoice when our own
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	ended its first decade and celebrated its little ten-year term with a big demonstration ?

		And shall we not also rejoice in the half-century of the neighbor - institution , the pride of the
State	ORGANIZATION	with which our own fortunes came once so near to being joined ?

		The
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, without years approaching those of
Bologna	LOCATION	or
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, or even those of the three American institu - tions which have celebrated long-term histories -- sesquicentennial , bicentennial , or quarter - millennial , -- during the past two decades , has probably meant as much for the lives of the young men and women whom it has touched since its founding as any older university has meant for its students and alumni during the same period .

		It has reached out to the re - motest corners of a great commonwealth , dis - covered here and there the exceptional youth , held him for four years under its shaping influence , and sent him back to his special community with broadened outlook , higher ideals , and finer purposes than he had when he left home .

		A glance over the list of grad - uates for any two or three recent years will show better than verbal argument how wide - spread has been this educational influence .

		Hardly a town in the
State	ORGANIZATION	will be found unrep - resented ; it must be a small hamlet indeed that does not every year or two send its student or students to the central educational institution at the capital .

		Some students are attracted from outside
Wisconsin	LOCATION	also , but the number is small in comparison with that of the stu - dents whose homes are within the limits of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this respect , the contrast between the great
State Universities	ORGANIZATION	of the West and the great private foundations of the older East is very striking .

		To serve as the capsheaf of the educational system of the commonwealth , to unite its parts into an organic whole , and to reach out in all directions for the purpose of giving as well as of receiving -- these seem to be the true func - tions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	university , and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	has fulfilled them with singular thoroughness and success .

		It has joined practical with ac - ademic aims so wisely that it has won the con - fidence of the taxpayers of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, whose appreciation is evidenced every year by gener - ous appropriations .

		By thus shaping its course with an eye to its agricultural and mechanical coQstitueacy , it has showo something of the wisdom of the serpent , yet has not failed in its respect for strictly academic ideals .

		To the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	farmer it is an institution that is worth supporting because it pays , distinctly and directly ; to the country at large it is an institution which honors scholarship and helps the higher interests of civilization .

		The celebration of last week went o # F with the usual accompaniments of such functions , and some unusual ones determined by the ex - ceptionally beautiful situation of the university buildings .

		The new president was duly in - stalled in the office which he has already oc - cupied for some time , and the distinguished guests of the occasion were properly compli - mentary to the great institution of which he is the head .

		His own words were of a nature to reveal him as a man of broad views , and of ambitious ideals for the future of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		And surely a glowing forecast is permissi - ble in the case of an institution which numbers its students by thousands , which now has hun - dreds of graduates every year instead of the two who were graduated at the commence - ment of fifty years ago , and which has set so distinguishing a mark upon the character of the commonwealth which is honored by its presence .

		In closing these remarks about the institu - tion now fairly launched , with clear skies and prosperous breezes , upon its second half-cen - tury , we are bound to acknowledge our own debt to the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Dial has only a scant quarter-century of com - pleted history , but no year of that period has passed without substantial help from
Madison	LOCATION	.

		Presidents
Bascom	PERSON	,
Chamberlain	PERSON	, and
Adams	PERSON	are numbered among our most valued contrib - utors ; that great historical student ,
William F. Allen	PERSON	, made of our pages for many years a medium for the publication of his scholarly investigations and reflections ; while among liv - ing members of the faculty we are deeply indebted to the learned collaboration of Profes - sor
Jastrow	PERSON	, Professor
Ely	PERSON	, Professor
Haskins	PERSON	, Professor
Olson	PERSON	, Professor
Turner	PERSON	, Professor
Scott	PERSON	, Professor Sharp , Professor
Anderson	PERSON	, and others .

		To them , and to the institution whose reputation they have so worthily sus - tained , we extend our cordial greeting , and our confident hope that the
University of Wis	ORGANIZATION	- consin may during the coming half-century continue to extend its usefulness and its influ - ence at the constantly accelerated rate which seems to be warranted by its past and by the measure of what it has already achieved .

		* It is now some five years since the earlier volumes of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's great definitive edition of
Byron	PERSON	's works were reviewed in The Dial -LRB-
May 16 , 1899	DATE	-RRB- .

		Twelve volumes were then announced : six of Poetry and six of Letters and Journals .

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	has , however , given us the baker 's dozen ; and the thirteenth vol - ume , bearing the sub-title , '' Poetry , Vol .

		VII. , '' is now before us .

		This well edited , fully an - notated , richly illustrated edition affords both excuse and opportunity for taking a new sur - vey of
Byron	PERSON	, both as man and as poet .

		The six volumes containing the Letters and Jour - nals are perhaps the more interesting half of the work , not only because Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	is a sounder editor than is Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	, but also and chiefly because of the hundreds of hitherto imperfectly printed or wholly uncollected let - ters they contain .

		Here are twelve hundred letters -LRB- less two -RRB- , -- nearly twice as many as in the largest previous collection .

		These letters , with the full annotation and the index pro- vided by the editor , together with the numer - ous portraits and views , go far to make the reader acquainted with the man
Byron	PERSON	in his habit as he lived .

		The thirteenth and concluding volume con - tains '' Epigrams and Jeux d' Esprit , '' -- many of them hitherto uncollected and some ten hitherto unprinted .

		The frontispiece is a strik - ing portrait of
Ada Byron	LOCATION	, and there are other interesting pictures .

		Much more than half -LRB- 260 pp . -RRB-

		of the volume is devoted to an elab - orate '' Bibliography of the successive editions and translations of Lord
Byron	PERSON	's Poetical Works . ''

		Finally there is an index to the poetical works , almost as long -LRB- 100 pp . -RRB-

		as the index to the letters -LRB- 113 pp . -RRB-

		.

		Thus the student is able to look up any note in the thir - teen volumes , or any of the multitudinous allusions that crowd the pages of this poet .

		The critic notes faults and errors of detail , but it must be admitted that this edition is , on the whole , very successfully carried to completion .

		Were the editorial shortcomings of Mr.
Cole	PERSON	- ridge far greater than they are , the edition * The Poetical and
Prose Works of Lord Byron	ORGANIZATION	.

		would still be beyond comparison the best and completest .

		Such it is likely to remain , per - haps , until '' the inevitable German '' enters the field .

		If fame is anything , the
Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	shows that
Byron	PERSON	enjoys it beyond any other mod - ern poets save
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Goethe . ''

		Childe
Harold	PERSON	's Pilgrimage '' has been trans - lated into Armenian , Bohemian , Danish , Hun - garian , Swedish ; into Kussian .

		twice , into Polish five times , into Italian eight times , into French at least as often , while no fewer than eleven different translators have rendered the poem into German .

		The array of translations of '' Don Juan '' is , considering the great length of that poem , equally impressive : one into Servian , two -LRB- complete -RRB- into Polish , five or six into Russian , and so on .

		Says Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	in the preface : ''
Teuton	PERSON	and Latin and Slav have taken
Byron	PERSON	to themselves , and have made him their own .

		No other English poet except
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has been so widely read and so frequently translated .

		Of Manfred I reckon one Bohemian translation , two Danish , two Dutch , three French , nine German , three Hungarian , three Italian , two Polish , one Romaic , one Roumanian , four Russian ^ and three Spanish translations , and in all probability there are others which have escaped my net . ''

		One can not , of course , enter here upon an analysis of the qualities that have made Byron the poet of ''
Teuton	PERSON	and Latin and Slav , '' rather than of the race from which he sprang , whose character he reacted against -- and shared .

		This would be the subject of a study such as , now that
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	has laid down the pen forever , perhaps no surviving critic has the mental stature to undertake .

		For there is little agreement about the value of Byron 's poetry .

		The late Mr.
Henley	PERSON	thought
Byron	PERSON	the master-poet of his time ; on the other hand Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	professes to consider
Byron	PERSON	as not even a very good second-rate poet .

		Some go beyond even Mr.
Henley	PERSON	in laudation ; and now and then the querulous voice of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	seems to cry in the top of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's in disparagement .

		To the last-named critic , however , is reserved the distinction of suggesting that the whole continent of
Europe	LOCATION	has been the victim of a sort of insanity on the subject of
Byron	LOCATION	.

		I am not aware that Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	has ever avowed any doubt of his own entire critical sanity .

		The type is well known to alienists .

		What elements of permanence has the fame of Byron ?

		Must he , like the pseudo-Ossian , atone for excessive vogue in his own age by neglect in all succeeding time ?

		May he , like 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	,
Ossian	PERSON	, be safely skipped ?

		Or does the pres - ent critical edition , with its apparatus of notes and variant readings , point to his ultimate assignment to a secure and unchallenged posi - tion as a world-poet ?

		The fact that these are still debatable questions is in itself a verdict .

		The memory of man , which '' drags at each remove a lengthening chain , '' has already cut loose from much of the heated improvisation of
Byron	PERSON	's facile muse .

		Students now gravely set about reading
Byron	PERSON	as so much task - work .

		His brush is found coarse , his scenery spec - tacular , his sentiment operatic , his versing ^ slovenly , his satire too often personal and spiteful .

		It is pretty obvious that
Byron	PERSON	possessed more of energy than of philosophy , more wit than wisdom .

		His reader often concludes that he had more cleverness than character , -- a hasty judgment , surely , in the case of a man who gave his life for an ideal . ''

		Greater love hath no man than this . ''

		Even though he failed `` to see life steadily and see it whole , ''
Byron	PERSON	enjoyed clear glimpses .

		Certain things he saw and helped others to see .

		His proud and com - placent country has never forgiven him for aying bare to the derision of the nations her unseemliness , and has naturally made reprisal by laying undue stress upon the poet 's literary and the man 's personal sins .

		Time was when men , educated to look upon
Byron	PERSON	as false and dangerous , shook out his banner when they fancied themselves driven to break with so - ciety , -- much as in an earlier age one pricked a vein and signed an indenture for one 's soul .

		When , in a memorable essay , a sound and conservative English critic ascribed to Byron '' the excellence of sincerity and strength , '' and classed him with
England	LOCATION	's chief literary glories alongside of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, the gentle reader held his breath .

		That was a number of years ago , and we are now getting more familiar with the notion .

		Reviewing `` Don Juan '' to-day , one is struck not only with its fresh power , but with the very considerable in - sight it displays .

		Moreover , -- so decadent has literature grown , -- the thing does not appear as bad as one had thought , or hoped .

		Indeed , the jaded ear harks back with relief to the ■ clear notes of
Byron	PERSON	's horn , now that
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Euskin	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, '' The silenced quire , Lie with their hallelujahs quenched like fire . ''

		This is much , and I think not all .

		Even after
Oarlyle	PERSON	, there still remains in ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' a purgative principle that may have some effi - cacy in clearing our minds of cant .

		Does not the modern world , straining beneath `` the white man 's burden , '' afford a subject to the satirist ?

		The functions of the literature of our day are , so it would seem , to beguile our short leis - ures with the short story and our uneasy consciences with the sublimities of imperial - ism .

		In a time when the megaphonic voice of Kipling is raised only to glorify the subju - gation of the weak , may we not sigh for a Byron upon the opposition bench ?

		The satirist of
Castlereagh	ORGANIZATION	and the fat Regent would find , were he to revisit the world , abundant mate - rials for a continuation of his great poem of modern life in such incidents and shibboleths as the Yellow Peril , Benevolent Assimilation , the
March	DATE	of Civilization , the Boer War , the Pacification of the Filipino , the Peace Con - gress , the
Diplomatic Mission	ORGANIZATION	to
Tibet	LOCATION	, as well as in the grand international symphony of British Bathos , Russian Pathos , and
American Cant	ORGANIZATION	.

		That such a satire would do something to clear the moral atmosphere of our time , I for one can not doubt .

		To say this is virtually to concede such praise to
Byron	PERSON	as would per - haps have satisfied even his great hunger for fame .


Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	.

		A
Composite History	ORGANIZATION	or the Kefokmation .

		* In the preface to the first volume of the `` Cambridge Modern History , '' the editors stated that the novel feature of Lord
Acton	PERSON	's scheme lay in the use of specialists , by whom the various topics in each chapter of each vol - ume were to be treated ; and it was exactly for this specialized treatment that students of his - tory extended a general welcome in advance to the work itself .

		The first volume , on the Renaissance , largely fulfilled the editorial prom - ise , while the second in order of publication , on the
United States	LOCATION	, was at least divided among a large number of writers , although various opinions have been expressed as to the merit of their contributions .

		The third and latest volume , on the Reformation , distinctly departs from the original plan in that four authors have written eleven of the nineteen chapters , and while in two instances the chapters may be regarded as but formal divisions of a single *

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 topic , in the remaining cases there is no ap - parent foundation for any claim to so wide - spread a specialized knowledge .

		Thus Mr.
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	not only has four consecutive chapters dealing respectively with `` National Opposition to
Rome	LOCATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' '' Social Revolution and Catholic Reaction in Ger - many , '' '' The Conflict of Creeds and Parties in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' and '' Religious War in Ger - many , '' -LRB- sufficiently differentiated topics in themselves for several writers -RRB- , but also con - tributes a chapter on '' The Reformation under
Edward VI	PERSON	. ''

		With the exception of a chapter on Luther by the Rev.
T. M. Lindsay	PERSON	, the reformation movement in
Germany	LOCATION	is thus exclusively the work of Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	; and in place of differentiated specialized studies we have merely a new general history of the Ger - man Reformation by a single author .

		The Rev.
W. E. Collins	PERSON	has one chapter on '' The Catholic South , '' giving a combined treatment of
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Portugal	LOCATION	, and another on * ' The Scandinavian North '' ; while the Rev.
A. M. Fairburn	PERSON	writes on ''
Calvin	PERSON	and the Reformed Church , '' and on '' Tendencies of European Thought in the Age of the Reformation . ''

		The instances just cited indicate , then , that Ihe editors of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern His - tory '' have departed in the present volume from their original plan .

		Either specialized knowledge on sub-topics of the reformation period is rare in
England	LOCATION	, or the specialists have not been available .

		This defect is a seri - ous one , considering the avowed purpose of the work ; but in other respects the volume is still valuable at least for its combination of topics , showing a continuous development , and for its readableness .

		The best chapters are those by Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	on '' Social Revolution and Catholic Reaction in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
James Gairdner	PERSON	on
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, and by the Rev.
A. M. Fairburn	PERSON	on ''
Calvin	PERSON	and the Reformed Church '' ; the last-named in partic - ular offering an excellent generalization , with just enough exact detail to give solidarity , and showing much thought and study .

		Thus two at least of the very writers who have unfor - tunately been persuaded , or permitted , to un - dertake too wide a field , have contributed a specialized study in one portion of that field .

		In general a sharp line has been drawn be - tween theological and political movements in the reformation period , with the result that eminent men , like Luther , are frequently de - picted in contradictory colors .

		It is difficult to harmonize the Rev. Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's humble and truth-seeking Luther with the man ar - raigned by Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	, in connection with the Peasant Revolt , as '' not free from the upstart 's contempt for the class from which he sprang '' ; and several diverse opinions are expressed in as many chapters of Luther 's intellectual qual - ities .

		These , however , being matters of inter - pretation , rather add interest to the volume as a whole , and do not involve any marked dis - agreement as to historical facts .

		The service - ableness of the work for convenient reference is continued by the orderly arrangement of bibliographies into sections covering respec - tively documents , other sources , and secondary works ; by the comprehensive index ; and by a chronological table , including the years
1608	DATE	to
1564	DATE	.

		In general , then , the estimate here placed on this volume , is that while distinctly inferior to the first volume in one important feature , it is still valuable as a work both to be read and referred to by the general histor - ical student .

		It is to be hoped that future vol - umes will return to the higher standard set in the beginning .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Some Recent Railway IjIteratube .

		* Twenty years ago any orderly discussion of railway management or railway economics was as '' caviare to the general . ''

		There had been a period of railway pioneering -- which was closed in
1869	DATE	with the completion of the trans - continental route -- when the roads were not only popular , but were solicited to enter in and occupy .

		Any discussion that became public was concerned , not with principles and scien - tific laws , but with material ways and means .

		Then came a sudden awakening to the arbitrary and inequitable methods employed by these com - mon carriers , and for a few years the country was afflicted with a spasm of '' granger '' legis - lation .

		But this method defeated its own ends , and statutes were either repealed or became a dead letter .

		Then a period of state commis - sions succeeded , -- some advisory , on the basis *

June 16	DATE	, of the admirable
Massachusetts	LOCATION	experiment , but most of them '' with power . ''

		Taking this method of control '' by and large , '' the rail - road managers were restricted and exasperated unduly , and the shipping and travelling public were but little benefitted .

		Yet one great good was accomplished , - -- the public was being edu - cated into an enlightened interest in railway problems , and railway men were being forced into an intelligent recognition of public opinion .

		The growth of the country in the decade following the Civil War -- a growth that the railways made possible -- was along the lines of the national sentiment which the war had so intensified .

		Soon it was seen that the rail - way problem was one beyond the bounds of states and the mastery of state legislation and state commissions .

		In the height of the '' granger '' controversy , agitation began for some method of federal regulation .

		In
1872	DATE	President Grant brought the matter to the attention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and through a series of efforts , marked by the
Windom	PERSON	report , the
McCreary	PERSON	and Eeagan bills , and the Cullom report , that body came in
1887	DATE	to the adop - tion of the
Interstate Commerce Act	ORGANIZATION	.

		The general public breathed a sigh of relief , feel - ing that its troubles with the roads were ended , when in truth they were but entering upon a larger and more intricate experience .

		However , the railway had finally taken hold on popular imagination .

		A great literature concerning it arose .

		Not only were the pages of such journals as `` The Nation , '' `` The North American Review , '' and '' The Forum '' crowded with valuable discussions of railway matters , but a large number of books was de - voted to the subject .

		Even a considerable body of fiction has made this its field , includ - ing one of the most powerful novels of the close of the century .

		This literature is the product of the last twenty-five years , and in a large degree of the last fifteen .

		The pioneer work -- which is still a classic , for breadth of view and scientific insight , -- is `` Railroads , their Origin and Problems , '' published by
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, Jr. , in
1878	DATE	.

		This was followed in
1885	DATE	by President
Hadley	PERSON	's '' Railroad Transportation , its History and its Laws . ''

		So the path was blazed , and the mag - nificent railway library at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, with its thousands of critical treatises , its scores of railway periodicals , in several languages , and its great mass of reports and decisions , bears witness to the literary and critical in - terest that has been created .

		In
1902	DATE	Mr.
Harriman	PERSON	had an hour to give to
Stanford	LOCATION	, and when his cicerone had piloted him into this library , he left it only to catch the train .

		The three books named at the head of this article are reliable works .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	has covered the ground as no one before him has done , under the larger titles of the system , the service , the public , the state .

		Under the third title is an admirable discussion of competition , rates , pools , traffic associations , and monopoly .

		Under the last title is a good presentation of the independent system of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the state-aided systems of the continent ; as also of regulation in the
United States	LOCATION	by state governments , the
Interstate Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and , finally , by the courts .

		This last phase of control lacks but the recent
Northern Securi	ORGANIZATION	- ties decision to bring the subject to the present moment .

		In its resume , however , it is as re - cent as the Elkins law of
February 17 , 1903	DATE	, and contributes a valuable critique on the Trans-Missouri and other decisions that have extended , so unexpectedly , the anti-trust law of
1890	DATE	to the railways .

		Another chapter dis - cusses railway taxation , and the final chapter on '' the problem of government regulation '' decides for improvement in '' the methods and agencies of regulation now employed rather than to attempt the enormous task of purchas - ing and operating two-fifths of the railway mileage of the world . ''

		The greater part of the material contained in Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	's volume was published in a series of letters to '' The Times '' of
London	LOCATION	in
the first half of 1903	DATE	, Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	having spent four months in travel over nine thousand miles of American railway .

		The author , as a rail - way writer of long experience , is thoroughly conversant with his subject , and has a happy faculty of seeing and reporting things of prime importance .

		He has also a sane and tolerant judgment , and consequently has made a book that is both valuable and fascinating .

		It bids fair to take the same rank among British re - ports as do Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's '' American Common - wealth '' and the
Moseley	PERSON	industrial and edu - cational reports .

		He is '' to our virtues always kind , '' and yet sees no reason to disparage the good things in the English system for the sake of exploiting ours .

		Especially valuable in this respect is the chapter entitled '' Some Points of Difference . ''

		Track elevation at

		Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's little book is not so much for the million as are the two volumes just noticed .

		But Professor
Meyer	PERSON	has already become an authority on the special subject of which he treats , and the special student of rail - way problems will welcome his contribution .

		A portion of it has already been given to scholars in the pages of '' The Political Science Quar - terly '' and the `` Annals of the

		Whilst the body of the work is so made up , the author has rendered as im - portant a service in his own criticism , embodied in chapters on characteristics of legislation , for - eign side-lights , economic adjustments , leading principles of the decisions of the commissioners , commission , and courts , and the Cullom bill .

		* When
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	was contributing her vivacious reminiscences to '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' a quarter-century or more ago , she found occasion to say a few proper words of praise for her friend
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, whose genius she had been one of the first to appreciate .

		But the tribute , modest and de - served as it was , met with such pained remon - strance from its recipient , that at his request it was excised when the writer came to revise her work for publication in book form .

		Says Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	: '' He did not certainly knock me on the head with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's sledge-hammer , but he did make me feel painfully that I had been guilty of the impertinence of praising . ''

		Meanwhile
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	had bound up the maga - zine articles , and was lending the improvised volume to a few of his friends .

		in returning the book , complained of a strange lacuna therein , caused by the pasting of blank paper over some of the pages .

		It was in this manner that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	had obliterated the passage referring to himself .

		That such a man , one who could not bear to be talked about even among his intimate friends , should be made the subject of a ponderous biography is a destiny indeed ironic ; the more so as the task was wholly needless .

		As was proved by Mr.
John Glyde	PERSON	's innocuous effort of a few years ago , there is nothing essential in the story of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's peaceful life that does not find place in Mr.
Aldis Wright	PERSON	's edi - tion of the Letters .

		These volumes , eked out with glimpses afforded in the memorabilia of a few judicious friends , reveal the man so lumin - ously that a formal biography is as superfluous as would be a botanical analysis of our favorite nook of woodland .

		But the Omar cult is still inquisitive , and '' old Fitz '' must needs take his turn with the all-devouring biographer .

		A life more devoid of moving incident , more tranquil and sequestered in its outer aspects , would be difficult to imagine .

		So trivial even to himself seemed the details of his '' innocent far-niente existence '' that he never touched upon them in his letters without quaintly apol - ogizing .

		A pious pilgrimage to
Scott	PERSON	's haunts at
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, a visit to
Ireland	LOCATION	, a yachting cruise to
Holland	LOCATION	, -- these were the largest happenings of his life .

		In
summer	DATE	he was a great deal upon or near the ocean , which always held first place in his affections ; and now and then there would be an unwilling journey to
London	LOCATION	, or a renewal of the old college associations at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		But for the most part , the years were merged in a quiet pastoral of
Suffolk	LOCATION	lane and garden . ''

		You know my way of life so well that I need not describe it to you , as it has undergone no change since I saw you .

		I read of mornings ; the same old books over and over again , having no command of new ones : walk with my great black dog of an
afternoon	TIME	, and at evening sit with open windows , up to which
China	LOCATION	roses climb , with my pipe , while the blackbirds and thrushes begin to rustle bedwards in the garden , and the nightingale to have the neighbourhood to herself . ''

		And again : `` A little
Bedfordshire	LOCATION	-- a little Northamptonshire -- a little more folding of the hands -- the same faces -- the same fields -- the same thoughts occurring at the same turns of road -- this is all I have to tell of ; nothing at all added -- but the
summer	DATE	gone . ''

		Epics and two-volume biographies are not made from such stuff as this .

		If Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	's recently-issued work had been carried out in something of 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, the spirit and manner of its subject , we might partially forgive its lack of raison d'etre .

		But the genial and delicate charm of the Wood - bridge philosopher finds no echo here .

		As a biography , the book is formless and unillumin - ating ; the style is devoid of literary grace , and not seldom lacking in taste .

		The author 's judgments are often rash , and his deductions naive .

		He has evidently been untiring in his search for material ; but the results of this labor are singularly unimportant .

		We are told a great deal about
FitzGerald	PERSON	's neighbors , his brother and his brother 's servants , -- in all of whom we confess only a faint interest ; but to the existing portrait of the
Laird of Little	ORGANIZATION	- grange nothing essential is added .

		The
Lowe	PERSON	- stoft captain ,
Fletcher	PERSON	-LRB- the often-mentioned '' Posh '' of the Letters -RRB- , and
Mary Lynn	PERSON	, playmate of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's childhood , have been drawn upon at some length , but offer little to the point .

		We are able to gather , however , that '' Posh , '' whom
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	included with
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	as the three greatest men he had ever known , seems to have been rather unappreciative of his admirer 's real quality .

		In Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's preface there are promises of '' important revelations , '' dark allusions to `` unsuspected connections , '' and a dramatic assertion that the writer has '' laid bare the whole story '' of '' the great central circum - stance of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's life . ''

		We can find little in the body of the book to warrant these prophecies .

		An example of the '' revelations '' is presented in the author 's statement , unsup - ported by other authority , that
FitzGerald	PERSON	was for a time '' deeply in love '' with a grand - daughter of the poet
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	.

		This may or may not be true ; as given here it is no more than an interesting surmise . ''

		The great cen - tral circumstance of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's life , '' accord - ing to Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, was his friendship for
W. Kenworthy Browne	PERSON	.

		This he characterizes as '' one of the most remarkable friendships in literary history , '' adding further that `` to
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	,
Browne	PERSON	was at once
Gamaliel	PERSON	,
Jona	PERSON	- than , Apollo : the friend , the master , the god -- and literary history offers no parallel to the conjuncture . ''

		Every reader of the Letters who recalls that poignant account of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's visit to the dying
Browne	PERSON	will know how strong was the attachment between these two .

		Yet it was
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's great privilege that several such enduring attachments were his , -- all his friendships , as he has told us , were '' more like loves '' ; and in this light Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's theory seems fanciful and his superlatives remain unconvincing .

		In an appendix to his biography , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	presents with due flourish some '' hitherto un - published '' writings of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, consisting in the main of two poems rescued from con - temporary `` Keepsakes , '' and a series of `` word portraits '' of
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Bernard Barton	PERSON	, and others , found in one of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's copy-books .

		So feeble and unworthy are these compositions that Mr.
Aldis Wright	PERSON	's recent communication in '' The AthenaBum '' was hardly needed to convince the discerning that they were not authentic .

		The verses were written by the obnoxious individual , a prede - cessor of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, whose sim - ilarity of name was ever a thorn in the poet 's side .

		The '' word portraits '' were the work of a
London	LOCATION	'' graphologist , '' and had merely been transcribed by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		While Mr.
Wright	PERSON	presents a fuller account than has before been available of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's unfortunate marriage , we are grateful that he treats the subject with somewhat more than his usual discretion .

		It was a pitiable affair from any point of view , yet the issue was inevitable , and no trace of discredit may be attached to either of the two concerned .

		In the matter of religion , it would seem that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is not wholly in accord with the poet who has given us what has been called the highest expression of Agnosticism .

		He stamps with disapproval the reply of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to the
Woodbridge	PERSON	parson who called to express regret that he was never seen at church , -- '' Sir , you might have conceived that a man has not come to my years of life without thinking much of these things .

		I believe I may say that I have reflected on them fully as much as yourself .

		You need not re - peat this visit . ''

		A very proper answer !

		And yet that
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's was a deeply reverent spirit what reader of discernment can doubt ? ''

		It is He that hath made us , and not we ourselves , '' - -- no mere scoffer would have chosen such an in - scription to stand above his own grave .

		A number of entertaining anecdotes enliven Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's pages , and the numerous illus - trations -LRB- most of them new -RRB- form a feature of much interest .

		But at the end we lay aside the two bulky volumes , and turn again to the Letters , with much the same feeling that
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	must have experienced in escaping from the noisy futilities of
London	LOCATION	to the peace and fragrance of his own Woodbridge garden .

		And in so doing we realize anew how slight is the 19U4 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 need for any other biography of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	than the one he has himself given us .

		Not in minute descriptions of his homes and friends and serv - ants , but in such a glimpse as this , is the living man to be discerned : `` Here is a glorious sunshiny day : all the morning I read about Nero in Tacitus lying at full length on a bench in the garden : a nightingale singing , and some red anemones eyeing the sun manfully not far o & .

		A funny mixture all this :
Nero	PERSON	, and the delicacy of Spring : all very human however .

		Then at half-past one lunch on
Cambridge	LOCATION	cream cheese : then a ride over hill and dale : then spudding up some weeds from the grass : and then coming in , I sit down to write to you , my sister winding red worsted from the back of a chair , and the most delightful little girl in the world chattering incessantly .

		So runs the world away .

		You think I live in Epicurean ease : but this happens to be a jolly day : one is n't always well , or tolerably good , the weather is not always clear , nor nightingales sing - ing , nor
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	full of pleasant atrocity . ''

		Some New Theories or the
Earth	LOCATION	.

		* Since the days when
James II	PERSON	.

		commended to his faithful subjects
Burnett	PERSON	's '' Telluris Theoria Sacra , '' geologists have been busy with book - making .

		It is an intellectual eon , however , from the quaint imaginings of the close of the seventeeth century to the orderly presentation of a fully developed science in these early years of the twentieth .

		In the interim there has been many a treatise , each showing some advance in the science .

		Of these ,
Lyell	PERSON	's `` Principles of Geology , '' published early in the nineteenth century , forms the nat - ural starting-point for English students .

		In
America	LOCATION	we have had two notable and comprehensive summaries of the science of geology , -- that of
Dana	PERSON	, first published in
1862	DATE	, and that of Le Conte , in
1877	DATE	.

		Both were of first importance , and have profoundly influ - enced the thought of American scientists .

		To these two there is now added a third work , which it may be safely predicted will influence the larger audience of the present quite as fundamentally .

		Dana 's text-book was first of all a stratigrapher 's book , and was essentially concerned with results .

		Le Conte 's was a phi - losopher 's book , -- a philosopher in love with the doctrine of evolution .

		The
Chamberlin	PERSON	-
Salisbury	PERSON	text-book is something of each of these , but is before all else a teacher 's book , * Geology .

		By
Thomas A. Chamberlin	PERSON	and
Rollin D. Salisbury	PERSON	.

		Volume I. ,
Geologic Processes	ORGANIZATION	and their Besults .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:

		and is concerned equally with results and pro- cesses .

		The belief has long been firmly , if some - times sub-consciously , held that nothing is fit matter for text-book use until it has been so thoroughly tested and proved that it is dead and lifeless , -- till it has lost that element of novelty which contributes so largely to its interest .

		Yet all great text-books have disre - garded this belief , and have set new stakes to which the plodders of the profession should advance .

		The present work is not only no exception to this rule , but is a striking expo - nent of it ; and to the general reader the book will have its chief interest in this phase of the discussion , -- the unique hypotheses here presented .

		It will doubtless come as a shock to many to find the long-accepted Nebular Hypothesis not only here questioned , but confronted with a fully developed alternative , -- the planetismal theory .

		In the second volume , still in press , the full statement of this hypothesis is to be set forth ; but in the pages of the present vol - ume it is given in outline and many of its applications are made .

		The new point of view leads to many novel conceptions : there may never have been a liquid earth ; there is prac - tically no limit to the time the earth may have been inhabited ; past climates have been func - tions of the constitution of the atmosphere , and glacial and inter-glacial periods come and go as the air is poor or rich in carbon-dioxide ; the crumpling which produces mountains is the expression of locally accumulated horizontal stresses , while the big dominant movements of the earth have been vertical , and it is to them that appeal must be made for the criteria upon which world-wide correlations are to be based .

		These and many other changes must be made in current doctrine if the new hypothesis prove correct .

		In this work , both new and old theo - ries are stated side by side , and in comparing them the student enters at once into the circle of working geologists .

		He is trained in mak - ing discriminations , instead of being presented with neat packages of pre-digested food .

		The book is excellently printed , despite cer - tain minor imperfections .

		The margins are narrow , and there are the annoying errors in footnotes and in text incident to first editions .

		The illustrations , while lavish and well-chosen , are not always sufficiently described in caption .

		Yet on the whole the work is worthily pre - sented , and is as notable in appearance as in subject-matter .

June 16	DATE	, Books on Music and Musicians .

		* The second volume of the '' History of American Art , '' a series of books published under the editorial supervision of Mr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	, is devoted to
American Music	ORGANIZATION	, and is the work of the compe - tent historian and critic , Mr.
Louis C Elson	PERSON	.

		The idea of this series is to have each branch of art handled by a recognized authority on the subject , and by one who practices the craft whereof he writes , -- the whole to comprise a complete history of artistic development in
America	LOCATION	from colonial times to the
year 1904	DATE	.

		The first volume , '' The History of American Sculpture , '' by Mr.
Lorado Taft	PERSON	, has already been reviewed in these columns ; and the present work sustains the standard set by Mr.
Taft	PERSON	.

		In '' The History of American Music , '' the author has told of the beginnings , the foreign influences , the changes , the methods that have gone to the making of our national music , not only having in mind the question of its development , but the man - ner in which that development has been affected by persons , events , and compositions .

		He points out that in presenting such a history one ought , if following chronological sequence , to speak first of the songs of the Aborigines ; but while these are the earliest melodies that can be traced on this con - tinent , the music of the
North American Indians	ORGANIZATION	is responsible for very little of the composition of later times . ''

		The true beginnings of American music -- seeds that finally grew into a harvest of native compositions -- must be sought in a field almost as unpromising as that of Indian music itself , -- the rigid , narrow , and often commonplace psalm-singing of
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Elson	PERSON	lays stress on the fact that it was the music developed in
Puritan Boston	LOCATION	and in
Pilgrim Plymouth	LOCATION	which , although it had its origin over seas , soon became indigenous to the soil , and changed gradually from the style of its prototype , as in the Middle Ages the Gregorian chant changed in
France	LOCATION	and became the Cantus Gallicanus .

		The account of the relig - ious origin of American music is full of interest , and is illustrated with reproductions of quaint scores of early psalmody .

		The first of our native composers was
William Billings	PERSON	, who was born in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1746	DATE	.

		In his time , the chief music in
New York	LOCATION	was found in the Episcopal churches , and

Boston	LOCATION	, in
1827	DATE	.

		In the seventeenth and eight - eenth centuries instrumental music was by no means as common as vocal music .

		In orchestral work up to
1860	DATE	, there was more of ambition than of true achievement .


Gottlieb Graupner	PERSON	-LRB- who came to
Boston	LOCATION	in
1798	DATE	-RRB- is spoken of as the father of American orchestral music ; yet the present chroni - cler says this is true only in a chronological sense , and that as regards the establishment of a high standard of execution and the introduction of a true epoch of interpretation Mr.
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	deserves this honorable title .

		He and Dr.
William Mason	PERSON	, leader in early piano music , are credited with giving greater catholicity to the concert reper - toire .


Wilhelm Gericke	PERSON	,
Arthur Nikisch	PERSON	,
Emil Paur	PERSON	,
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	,
Fritz Scheel	PERSON	, and
Victor Herbert	PERSON	have also had much to do with keeping
America	LOCATION	abreast of
Europe	LOCATION	in the field of orchestra magic -- '' one of the brightest spots on the musical horizon in this country at present . ''

		The story of opera in
America	LOCATION	opens with a pro- duction of '' The Beggar 's Opera '' in
New York	LOCATION	as early as
1750	DATE	.

		To
New Orleans	LOCATION	belongs the credit of introducing operas of the French and Italian schools in this country .

		It is difficult to trace the inception of native opera .

		Mr.
Elson	PERSON	mentions `` Leonora , '' by
William H. Fry	PERSON	, as the first American opera of any musical worth ; this was followed by '' Rip Van Winkle '' by
Bristow	PERSON	, '' The Scarlet Letter '' by
Damrosch	ORGANIZATION	, and '' Alzara '' by
Paine	PERSON	.

		The course of the opera is minutely traced up to the time when Colonel
Mapleson	PERSON	was called from
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Theater in
London	LOCATION	to save the waning glories of the
Academy of Music	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, during the career of
Anton Seidl	PERSON	as a director , under the
Grau	PERSON	regime , up to the advent of
H. Conreid	PERSON	as manager of the Metropolitan and the representation of '' Parsifal '' on Christmas Eve ,
1903	DATE	, -- which he considers one of the epoch-mak - ing events in the history of music in this country , and perhaps even of international importance .

		Folk-music is traced from the days of the Ojib - ways ,
Omahas	LOCATION	, and Apaches , to the unhappy career of
Stephen C Foster	ORGANIZATION	.

		After recording the history of national and patriotic music , the author says : '' It is very probable that the giant strides made in composition in this country may very soon result in some other national song replacing those de - scribed .

		Among the many composers who are now creating a repertoire of important works in
America	LOCATION	, there must be one who will some day feel impelled to write us a true national anthem . ''

		In selecting five names as the chief composers of
America	LOCATION	, the author points out that four of the five have also been important factors in public musical instruction , -- Mr.
Paine	PERSON	being at the head of mu - sical training at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	at the
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397
New England Conservatory of Music	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Parker	PERSON	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
MacDowell	PERSON	at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	; while the fifth naan , Mr.
Arthur Foote	PERSON	, has thus far em - ployed his abilities as a teacher only in a private capacity .

		In the chapters devoted to orchestral composers , the author writes with thoroughness and sincerity .

		His experience as a teacher and director enables him to touch upon many works in manuscript form in a familiar manner . ''

		So long as we have a pub - lic not fully acquainted with the orchestral works of the great masters this -LRB- MS. form -RRB- must neces - sarily be the fate of the mass of American com - posers .

		But that acquaintance is being speedily made ; and we may hope that in the near future , instead of unnecessary repetitions of standard works or interpretations of the efforts of untried European fledglings , there will be a constant demand for worthy compositions of American musicians , lead - ing to their publication as well as their perform - ance . ''

		In speaking of a figure essentially American -- one who has probably had more performances of his works in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	than all other native composers , -- he recalls the fable of the bat among the birds and mice : '' The birds declined to associate with it because it was too much like a mouse ; the mice declined its com - panionship because it too closely resembled a bird .

		Some such dilemma confronts one in the classifica - tion of John
Philip Sousa	PERSON	.

		In
Germany	LOCATION	they hold his music so typically representative of
America	LOCATION	that they play his marches on international occa - sions , as , for example , the festivities connected with the
Wagner	PERSON	monument in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		In
America	LOCATION	his tunes are familiar to all classes , and many a musi - cian who knows that
Sousa	PERSON	does not belong among the great masters might be obliged to confess greater familiarity vrith the melodies of the former than with some of the themes of the latter .

		... To write stirring rhythms , melodies that one can not shake out of one 's memory , tunes that make the tired soldier walk and the popular concert audience tap their feet , is not given to everyone .

		America may accept
Sousa	PERSON	's remarkable capture of
Europe	LOCATION	with pleasure , without unduly exalting it . ''

		Opei'atic , cantata , and song composers are com - prehensively mentioned .

		Speaking of the late
Ethelbert W. Nevin	PERSON	, the author says that one can pay tribute to him as being one of the most poetic of American composers , and that to him might be applied the epitaph which Grillparzer wrote for Schubert : '' Fate buried here a rich possession , But yet greater promise . ''

		Regarding the question as to whether a woman can become a great composer , -- whether there will ever be a female
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	or
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	, -- Mr.
Elson	PERSON	says : '' In
Europe	LOCATION	most authorities have an - swered the question in the negative .


Carl Rein	PERSON	- ecke , long director of the
Leipsig Conservatory	ORGANIZATION	, once gave his views on this subject to the present writer .

		He believed that there was a point where women stopped in music .

		His experience was that , up to a well-advanced point in the intepretation of the ideas of others , the female student often out - stripped the male ; but in the highest realms of musical performance , where individuality needed to be blended with the text of the composer , there was a timidity that militated against progress .

		In the purely creative field he found scarcely any prog - ress comparable to that of the intelligent poetic male student .

		Svendsen in
Norway	LOCATION	, and
Gade	PERSON	in the Conservatory of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, long ago expressed almost identical views . ''


Ambroise Thomas	PERSON	once said to us : '' Your country seems to be the natural home of the soprano ! ''

		America has given more promi - nent operatic sopranos to the world than it has of pianists , organists , or violinists .

		Mr.
Elson	PERSON	suggests that it may be climate , it maybe food , or it may be heredity , that causes northern
Spain	LOCATION	to bring forth tenors ;
Switzerland	LOCATION	, male falsetto singers ;
England	LOCATION	, contraltos ;
Russia	LOCATION	, bases ; and
America	LOCATION	, sopranos .

		After taking up the question of musical criticism and authorship , the writer closes his work with chapters on '' The Musical Education of the Pres - ent '' and `` Qualities and Defects of American Music . ''

		He points out that while this country does not possess , and does not require , an endowed school of music under government protection , such as the Conservatoire at
Paris	LOCATION	or some of the con - servatories in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, or
Germany	LOCATION	, yet , through the philanthropy and the love of art of private individuals , large schools have been founded that have carried on the movement inaugurated in the
Boston Academy of Music	ORGANIZATION	, and by
Lowell Mason	PERSON	, over sixty years ago . ''

		The Americans , '' he says , '' may not be as musically gifted as the Italians , French , or Germans , but in the widespread study of the art , in great popular interest , in public festivals , the
United States	LOCATION	is abreast of some of the most cultivated European nations .

		It must be confessed , however , that in thoroughness of study , in the art of making haste slowly , and in the estab - lishment of concerted music in the home -LRB- probably the greatest factor in
Germany	LOCATION	's musical greatness -RRB- , the impatient energetic American has yet much to learn . ''

		Mr.
Elson	PERSON	's work gives us a fair statement of what has been accomplished in music in
America	LOCATION	.

		Judging by a retrospect of fifty years of musical endeavor , he considers the future full of promise .

		It is not hard to see that his work is that of a student as well as a practical musician .

		The vol - ume contains numerous photogravures and textual illustrations , and a good general bibliography , with an index .

		The name of
James Huneker	PERSON	is justly conspic - uous in the field of musical literature and criticism in this country ; but by nothing has he deserved his distinction more than by his latest volume , * ' Over - tones : A Book of Temperaments . ''

		It is a gal - lery of interesting portraits ; and the subjects are 898 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	^ , chosen with such regard for variety as to show the extent and quality of the author 's studies and sympathies .

		We have previously referred to Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's peculiar power of analysis , his well - balanced discrimination -- eulogistic without ex - travagance and critical without bitterness .

		The volume opens with an appreciative estimate of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	.

		Though shaded here and there with highly-colored rhetoric , it is written in the easy manner which betokens an affectionate ac - quaintance with the classic in music .

		During the present period of worship at the shrine of '' Parsifal , '' he challenges the accusation of artistic irreverence by plain statement : '' It behooves us to study Parsifal for ourselves , and not accept as gospel the uncritical enthusiasms of the Wagnerite who is without a sense of the eternal fitness of things .

		One ounce of humor , of common-sense , puts to flight the sham ethical and sham sesthetical of the Parsifal worshippers ... The composition is a miracle of polyphonic architecture -- and it is also the weakest that its creator ever planned . ''

		Other chapters of the volume are devoted to * ' Nietzsche the Rhapsodist , '' '' Anarchs of Art , '' `` Literary Men Who Loved Music , '' `` Flaubert and his Art , '' etc. .

		Someone has said that it is hard to sketch character without flippancy ; but in this study of temperaments the author has shown not only originality , but also a comprehensive un - derstanding of the art of music . ''

		The Act of Touch , '' by
Tobias Matthay	PERSON	, is an analysis and synthesis of pianoforte tone production .

		The work is divided into four parts .

		The first deals with the problem of pianoforte training , education in the art of tone production , muscular education , and the union of execution with conception ; the sec - ond part treats of the use of keys from their instru - mental aspect , touching upon choice of instrument , tone-exciters in the construction of the instrument ; the quality of sound , and the fallacy of key-hitting or striking ; in the third part , muscular discrimina - tion is proved to be urgent , and such questions as exaggerated finger lifting , arm-weight and correct finger technique are considered ; the fourth part is devoted to the aspects and details of position , with a glossary and summary of the main teachings of the work .

		As a technical work for teachers and advanced musicians , as well as for beginners who are in sympathy with the theories outlined , it will prove interesting and instructive reading .

		Miss
Rosa Newmarch	PERSON	's biography of
Henry J. Wood	PERSON	is the initial volume in the series of `` Living Masters of Music '' -- a series of monographs deal - ing with contemporary musical life , intended to furnish biographical studies of well-known repre - sentatives of all branches of the art , in which the aim of supplying full critical and expository com - ments is kept steadily in view .


Henry J. Wood	PERSON	, during his career as an orchestral conductor , has become the central figure in English musical life .

		Though born in
Newman Street	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-LRB-
March 3 , 1870	DATE	-RRB- , he is , in external appearance , more
Sla	ORGANIZATION	- vonic than English .

		And , in fact , an interesting feature of his work is the way in which he has assimi - lated the Slavonic spirit in music , and given to the compositions of the
New Russian School	ORGANIZATION	interpreta - tions which breathe the very atmosphere of na - tionality ; in the comprehension of the '' emotional realism '' which lies at the heart of all Russian art and literature , he is as Russian as the Russians themselves .

		The present monograph is character - ized by the analytical ability which was noticeable in the same author 's `` Tchaikovsky , '' and it is per - haps to be expected that she should fall under the spell of the personality of her subject , and that what she has written should savor , to a certain extent , of hero-worship .

		In his biography of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
J. Cuthbert Hadden	PERSON	has told the story of the musician 's life ^ simply , directly , and with a regard for facts .

		He has penned a picture of the man with the same power of analysis which appeared in Mr.
Jame '' Huneker	PERSON	's work on the same subject ; and has dis - cussed the composer `` without trenching on the ground of the formalist . ''

		The volume is illus - trated , and appears in '' The Master Musicians '' series .

		To trace the history of the organ , from the me - chanically blown trumpet of Ctesibius of Alexan - dria , from documentary evidence apart from the vague speculations of
Kircher	PERSON	and others , required painstaking labor .

		In `` The Story of the Organ , '' Mr.
C. F. Abdy Williams	PERSON	has given all the informa - tion that is really authentic , and rejected some that has heretofore been incorporated in similar sketches , but which the present historian regards as apoc - ryphal .

		The numerous illustrations and the elabo - rate appendix will be found invaluable to anyone directly or indirectly interested in the subject .

Albert H. Tolman	PERSON	's `` Views Illustrattoni of ^ - r i i r \ i t - < '' Shakespeare about Hamlet , and Other JliSsays criticism .

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- illustrates both the qualities and the defects of modern Shake - speare criticism .

		The first paper is an interesting , and for the most part sensible , review of the prin - cipal interpretations of Hamlet 's temperament .

		`` Shakespeare and The Taming of the Shrew '' ^ presents the arguments for the conclusion that only '' the Induction and the actual taming of Katharine by Petruchio '' are
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ; there is visible also the hand of a '' gifted cc-laborer '' that is so like the master 's as to deceive the very elect .

		It is suggestive that while Professor
Tolman	PERSON	refers te '' the great number of classical and learned allusions in the non-Shakespearian parts '' of the play .

		Dr.
Robert K. Root	PERSON	, in his recent admirable study , '' Classical Mythology in Shakespeare , '' points out that '' The Shrew '' is like all the undisputed works
1904	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL .

		399 of Shakespeare in being `` overwhelmingly Ovidian '' in its mythology . ''

		Shakespeare 's Love 's Labour 's Won '' is a full and valuable account of the debate concerning the identity of the mysterious play mentioned in the ''
Palladis Tamia	PERSON	, '' leading to the discreet conclusion of Professor
Wendell	PERSON	that `` the question can never be definitely settled . ''

		Two briefer studies , `` Hamlet 's ` Woo ' t Drink Up Eisel ? ' ''

		and `` Shakespeare 's Stage and Modern Adaptations , '' are of much interest ; a more elabo - rate series of '' Studies in
Macbeth	LOCATION	, '' with the excep - tion of the sections devoted to the
Weird Sisters	ORGANIZATION	, reminds us rather sharply of the sentimental pitfalls that the sanest Shakespearian commentator seldom wholly escapes .

		A suggestive essay on '' The Symbolic Value of English Sounds , '' a plea for ''
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	in a Literary Education , '' and a careful but uninspired study of `` The Style of Anglo Saxon Poetry , '' are the best of the remaining papers .

		It is difficult to see why the notes on
Lanier	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	, and English Surnames should have been included in the collection .

		The tone of the Shakespearian essays is refreshingly sober .

		There is little of the fanciful over-subtlety , the solemn abdication of common-sense , to which we are ac - customed in critics who honor the poet 's memory on the other side of idolatry .

		But we think that Professor
Tolman	PERSON	's sobriety forsakes him when he separates the Ghost 's mandate , `` Taint not thy mind , '' from the following , '' Nor contrive against thy mother aught , '' and concedes the possibility of the former referring to a conscientious scruple against murder .

		It seems clear that
Shakespeare	PERSON	accepted the '' ethical presuppositions '' of the old revenge-play , and expected his audience to do the same ; he was then prepared to motive the action according to the strictest laws of moral probability .

		In this he merely followed a custom as old as the -LRB-
Edipus Bex	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again , the `` instinctive poetry '' of
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's speeches is , we think , over-emphasized as a key to his character .

		Pater 's remark is in point : '' One gracious prerogative , certainly ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's English kings possess : they are a very eloquent company . ''

		It is hardly a distinction among Shake - speare 's heroes to speak exquisite poetry .

		The series of parallels -LRB- pp. 232 , 233 -RRB- that help to authenticate the Induction to '' The Shrew '' would be '' deadly '' in a sense not intended by the proverb , -- deadly to the cause they are meant to aid , -- were it not buttressed by firmer supports than they .

		We fail to see why it is more absurd to suppose that Shakespeare would adopt '' minute and unimportant phrases '' from an old play than that he would adopt them from an old
Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	, which he notably did in the trial scene in ''
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		A few details call for remark .

		The state - ment -LRB- p. 321 -RRB- that `` the syllable - ing was the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	patronymic suffix , meaning son of , and then descendant of , '' demands qualification .

		In these days of Biblical ignorance , it is hardly safe to refer calmly to `` the other name of the
Baptist	LOCATION	, Elias . ''

		Hfinferth -LRB- p. 374 -RRB- does not need the cir - cumflex .

		Finally , it seems to us rather a pity that English scholars should retain that comparative neologism , Anglo-Saxon , as applied to a language that was uniformly called English by those who spoke it .

		The book has no index .

		`` The House of Quiet : An Autobi - the7hu -LCB- - ui ography , edited by J. T. '' -LRB- Button -RRB- belongs to that numerous class of books written in the first person and edited by an ostensible third person , but of course not expecting to deceive anyone by the transparent artifice .

		The writer , a recluse and an almost lifelong invalid -- or , at least , for literary purposes we may so con - sider him -- tells a story of the inner life which bears the unmistakable marks of sincerity that always command respectful attention .

		Omitting certain irrelevant matters of family history , and sundry descriptions -LRB- when will authors learn to leave landscapes to their brothers of the brush and palette ? -RRB-

		, the book , despite an occasional indul - gence in obvious reflections , is well worth reading .

		The writer 's early difficulty in reconciling the de - terminism to which the intellect is forced to assent with the free-will which the whole moral and spir - itual nature so strenuously asserts , represents an experience that all really thoughtful persons have to go through sooner or later .

		To be sure , the de - sired reconciliation is never effected , but we learn to content ourselves with
Robertson	PERSON	's creed , -- '' that truth is made up of two opposite propositions , and not found in a via media between the two . ''

		As a sample of the wit and wisdom to be found in these quiet pages , let us take the '' vicious cir - cle '' of petty duties that fill the lives of most of us . '' '

		What are these fields for ? '

		said a squire who had lately succeeded to an estate , as he walked round with the bailiff . '

		To grow oats , sir . ' '

		And what da you do with the oats ? ' '

		Feed the horses , sir . ' '

		And what do you want the horses for ? '

		` To plough the fields , sir . ' ''

		Like
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, who wrote of a certain period of his life that his ideal was then '' defiled and polluted by literary ambition , '' our author holds that spiritual peace demands the sacri - fice of that and all other selfish ambitions . ''

		Not until a man can pass by the rewards of fame oculis irretortis -- ` nor cast one longing , lingering look behind ' -- is the victory won . ''

		It would be cruel and unfair to use the author 's own words , as applied to an earlier production of his , and call his book '' sauce without meat '' ; but should any reader find it richer in sauce than in meat , he must at least admit the excellence of the sauce .

		The hUtory of twenty-five years in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is nearly twenty years since the sixth and last volume of
Walpole	LOCATION	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	,
1815	DATE	to
1858	DATE	, '' appeared ; and since then , no satisfactory work has been produced in continuation of more recent English history .

		Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	's re - turn , therefore , to historical writing is sure to be welcomed , and in particular since he has chosen to 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, pick up the dropped thread where he left it , thus ofEering a connected history for the larger part of the nineteenth century .

		His present work , '' The His - tory of Twenty-five Years '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , covers the years from
1856	DATE	to
1881	DATE	, of which the two volumes so far issued extend to
1870	DATE	.

		As is indicated by the title , the author 's purpose is not to write exclusively of English history , but rather of general movements and events , throughout the world , in which
England	ORGANIZATION	had an essential interest and part .

		This was , in fact , a characteristic of the earlier work ; and there has been no change in the general method of treatment .

		Indeed , the most striking thing about the present work is that Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	has been able to resume so closely the style , spirit , and attitude of twenty years ago .

		The value of his work does not lie in any exhaustive research for remote causes , for such research would be necessarily futile as yet , but in the ability to group vividly the more open and public sources of movements , and to treat them with impartiality .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	gives all the necessary data for an exact general knowledge of his period , yet has the art of so combining that data with the expression of underlying ideal movements as to maintain a con - stant interest .

		In a word , he is both the popular and the reliable historian ; and when it is added that his voluminous footnote references are pur - posely selected with a view to their accessibility by ordinary readers and students , it is evident that his present labor will meet with a general welcome .

		r \ - r ^ / t '' Essays for the Day -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , three of which are reprints , and three are new .

		Especially timely in this centen - nial year of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's birth is his study of '' The Scarlet Letter , '' an essay naturally having to do chiefly with the ethical and religious import of the book .

		Indeed , all the essays are deeply religious in tone , but of a breadth and humanity that will make them attractive to a wide range of readers .

		* ' A Layman 's Reflections on Music , '' the layman being in this instance a clergyman , is profoundly suggestive .

		Not only does Dr.
Munger	PERSON	hold with
Schopenhauer	PERSON	that '' the world is embodied music , '' but he also believes music to be '' the type and ex - pression of the eternal world , '' and in affirming this declares that he is speaking with as much ex - actness as if he were dealing with weights and meas - ures .

		The first essay , on '' The Church , '' breathes a most liberal spirit , which is further displayed in the following chapter on '' The Interplay of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and Literature '' ; but after this fine advo - cacy of the most enlightened liberality in religion , the author surprises us by his word of eulogy for that canonized leader of a now outworn ortho - doxy ,
Athanasius	LOCATION	.

		There is just a possibility , too , that the essayist gives him more than his due in assigning to him the credit of '' fixing in the mind of the world a phrase of more worth than all litera - tures , -- Father , Son , and
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Without pausing to discuss this valuation of the dogma of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, one is led to query whether it is pos - sible that Dr.
Munger	PERSON	is here caught napping and is referring to the so-called
Athanasian Creed	ORGANIZATION	, well known for its detailed explanation of the three terms in question , but now no longer assigned to
Athanasius	LOCATION	, being , by both external and internal evidence , of demonstrably later origin .

		Probably not ; yet far worse blunders are not unknown to literature .

Thomas	PERSON	of English , R ,
Lounsbury	PERSON	's '' Standards of Pro- pronunciaiion .

		nunciation in English '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- with the hope of getting light on some disputed points in orthoepy will meet with disappointment .

		He will neither find general principles to guide him through the shifting quicksands of English speech , nor the author 's authority in support of any partic - ular pronunciation of doubtful words .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	maintains a strictly impartial attitude toward contending pronunciations , recording all without giving preference to any .

		In this book he sets himself the task of showing , in the first place , that no dictionary can be regarded as the ultimate standard of authority ; second , that not even the con - current voice of all the lexicographers can be taken as conclusive authority , since deviations from the established usage may creep in at any time and authorize pronunciations that now have no claim to acceptance ; and third , that under our present sys - tem of orthography , by which we have many differ - ent combinations of letters with the same sound , uniformity of orthoepy can never be realized .

		In support of these views , the history is given of some two hundred and fifty words whose pronunciation is either now a matter of dispute oj * which have undergone orthoepic changes .

		The majority of the words used as illustrations are in common use , and their biography is of interest to the general reader as well as to the student of language .

		Some of the most important orthoepic changes now going on in the language , such as the varying pronunciation of the long u , of the r , and the tendency toward the fusion of certain combinations of consonants , are not touched upon in this treatise .

		Letters of ' ^ ^ ^ '' Letters of Lord
Acton	PERSON	to Mary a brilliant Gladstone '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Englishman .


Herbert Paul	PERSON	, cover the period from
1879	DATE	to
1886	DATE	.

		They are chiefly interesting for the intimate view offered of the intellectual temper of Lord
Acton	PERSON	himself , though many brilliant and familiar characterizations of men prominent in political and literary circles add vivacity to the correspondence .

		Mary
Gladstone	PERSON	's letters are not given , and in consequence some allusions , possibly quite plain to the editor , who has taken his duties very lightly , are wholly blind to the reader .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	was unquestionably one of the most learned men of his time , -- so learned , in fact , that he shrank from attempting any really important work ,
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 401 not because be dreaded tbe labor itself , but because his view was so comprehensive that he was never satisfied with the materials at hand .

		In politics he was a consistent adherent of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, esti - mating his leader as one of the great men of history , yet critical of details .

		His letters -LRB- which
Gladstone	PERSON	himself did not read , save where they involved some direct criticism -RRB- are full of advice to Mary Glad - stone about the petty social amenities by means of which her father 's political course may be rendered more smooth , and of suggestions as to how this or that individual should be treated .

		Comparatively little is to be found in these letters bearing upon Lord
Acton	PERSON	as an historical student or as a religious controversialist .

		They are rather the letters of a brilliant independent thinker , chatting on events of present-day political importance , and descriptive of men of contemporaneous interest .

		Annals 0 / ^ private journal and a log-book an American have been utilized by that indefati - s `` a-captain .

		gable inquirer into matters of naval history , Mr.
E. S. Maclay	PERSON	, to make up a sketch of a hitherto unknown hero , Captain
Moses Brown	PERSON	.


Newburyport	LOCATION	, cradle of sea-dogs , produced this doughty captain , who sailed the seas in merchant - man , sloop , and man-of-war , for over half a cen - tury , finding at last a winding sheet and sailor 's burial within sight of his native shore .

		His adven - tures rival those of a romance .

		He was almost buried alive at sea , was cast away in a small boat for a week , boldly took an American vessel into
London	LOCATION	in
1776	DATE	, was afterward captured by the British , chased innumerable suspicious craft on the seas , and captured many vessels of the enemy .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	has made most of the scanty materials at his command , and throws no little light on many details connected with the naval history of the
United States	LOCATION	through this humble agent .

		The log of the `` Merrimac , '' commanded by Captain
Brown	PERSON	, affords a glimpse of the extensive reprisals against the French that were carried on in
1798	DATE	, and the close alliance between British and American vessels under the Jay treaty .

		Several sketch maps serve to locate the places in question , and a number of au - thentic illustrations add both pleasure and instruc - tion .

		While few may be prepared to share the author 's enthusiasm over the Yankee captain as a hero , all will enjoy reading of the old sailor 's ex - ploits .

		A date or two is incorrectly stated , but the context easily rectifies the error .

Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Oriental scholars were startled in
1902	DATE	by the discovery at old Susa of a strange monument of antiquity -- an obelisk of black diorite , on which was in - scribed , in archaic Babylonian characters , a long ancient document .

		This was copied and published by Professor
Scheil	PERSON	of
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	in
October , 1902	DATE	.

		It proved to be a code of laws of

		Professor
Robert Francis Harper	PERSON	, with the cooperation and assistance of his students and colleagues at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has now issued '' The Code of Hammurabi '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , embracing a facsimile of the original text , a trans - literation , a translation into English , an index of the laws , a glossary of the original words , and a sign-list of the original writing .

		The volume is a valuable addition to our literature of the ancient Orient .

		Its value is readily apparent when we con - sider that we have here a code of laws antedating the time of Moses by almost a thousand years .

		This priority , in time , of many laws similar to those of the Jewish lawgiver , points to a high state of civilized society in
Babylonia	LOCATION	before
Abraham	PERSON	left Ur of the Chaldees .

		It shows , furthermore , that there must have been court decisions centuries before such a codification as this could have been made .

		Their provisions are so full as almost to stag - ger our belief at the complications of the society of the twenty-third century B. C .

		The similarity of many of these laws to those of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	has given rise to a multitude of questions regarding the origin of the so-called Mosaic laws , and requires also a recasting of our interpretation of the language of the books of Moses .

		Apart from the great interest of the laws on their own account , there is material here for years of study , touching ancient history , civilization , and the Old Testament .

		Mr.
Gilbert Holland Montague	PERSON	's work on '' Trusts of To-day '' -LRB- Mc -
Clure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is of two-fold value .

		To the student of economics , it will recom - mend itself as a concise and scientific treatment of the trust problem in its most recent developments ; while to the more superficial surveyor of the subject it will appear an easy means of learning something of the nature of trusts , their history and their posi - tion in the modern industrial world .

		Mr.
Montague	PERSON	begins by tracing the development of industrial combination , and proceeds to discuss its various aspects .

		He lays some stress on the savings of combination in the marketing of the product , as distinguished from the savings in the production of output resulting from concentrated capital .

		After pointing out the evils in modern trust organiza - tions , he turns to the question of trust-regulation , and traces the various statutory remedies , from the
Inter-state Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Act of
1887	DATE	through the Nelson Amendment of
1903	DATE	.

		Although the reforms suggested within the last few years by Attorney - General
Knox	PERSON	and
the Industrial Commission	ORGANIZATION	are carefully elaborated , yet the reader is left unas - sured of Mr.
Montague	PERSON	's bare position on the sub - ject .

		While this result may be disappointing , it is in accordance with the author 's plan of writing the book , which was to present the facts as clearly and concisely as possible , leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions .

		Whitefield plays an important part in the narrative .

		The work is notice - able for its disinterested breadth of view and for its sober but hopeful outlook upon industrial rela - tionship .

		Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	's object in writing the book , as he states , is to consider methods of establishing industrial peace , and , more specifically , the problem of preventing strikes and lockouts .

		He discusses the various means available for the adjustment of disputes , -- collective bargaining , the sliding scale , conciliation , and arbitration .

		He advocates allowing labor and capital to settle their own differences ; yet at the same time he recognizes the public as the final arbiter between them .

		His chapters on the incorporation of industrial unions -LRB- a term he uses to include trusts and labor-unions -RRB- , and on the legal regulation of labor disputes in

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for the publi - cation early next year of a new automobile romance .

		In response to the demand for a popular reprint of General
Henry B. Carrington	PERSON	's '' The Battles of the American Revolution , '' Messrs.
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will soon issue a new edition of that work at a moderate price .

		In '' The Story of the Red Cross , '' to be published this month by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	,
Miss Clara Barton	PERSON	will give an account of the work of the
Red Cross Society	ORGANIZATION	, and of her own eventful experiences as its president . ''

		Radium and All about It , '' by Mr.
L. R. Bottone	PERSON	, is a pamprhlet publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It comes fairly up to its ambitious title , and presents the facts now known about the new element in lucid and not too popular style .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that the volume on
Georgia	LOCATION	in the '' American Commonwealths '' series is to be written by Dr.
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, author of a previous work on ''
Georgia	LOCATION	and State Rights . ''

		A volume entitled ''
Ruskin	PERSON	Relics '' has been pre - pared by Mr.
W. G. CoUingwood	PERSON	, and is published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a profusely illus - trated work , and the text is more interesting than one might imagine from a statement of its subject .

		An article by Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	on '' Some Italian Manuscripts and Early Types '' is an interesting feature of the
June	DATE	issue of '' The Printing Art , '' a magazine that steadily continues to make itself indis - pensable to all concerned with the field it covers . '

		`` Writings on
American History	ORGANIZATION	,
1902	DATE	, '' is the title of a valuable bibliography prepared by Messrs.
Ernest Gushing Richardson	PERSON	and
Anson Ely Morse	PERSON	, and pub - lished at
Princeton	LOCATION	by the
Library Book Store	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is very thoroughly done , and the compilers have supplied the titles with annotations judiciously selected and condensed from the leading critical notices of the works entered .

		Early in
September	DATE
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Miffiin & Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		will publish '' The Affair at the Inn , '' which Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	, the author of ''
Rebecca	PERSON	, '' has written in collaboration with three of her British friends , --
Jane Findlater	PERSON	,
Mary Findlater	PERSON	, and
Allan McAulay	PERSON	. ''

		Cornish Ballads and Other Poems '' is the title given to a new edition of the collected verse of
R. S. Hawker	PERSON	, the Vicar of Morwenstow .

		It is more complete than any previous collection of Hawker 's poems , and is judi - ciously edited by Mr.
C. E. Byles	PERSON	.

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	is the publisher . ''

		The Brownings and
America	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Elizabeth Porter Gould	PERSON	, is a publication of the
Poet-Lore Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is an interesting miscellany of facts relating to the early American appreciation of the two poets , their American friends , and their comments upon American affairs .

		After several years of labor , Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	has completed his arrangement and annotation of the Let - ters of
William Cowper	PERSON	, and the collection will be pub - lished in the early autumn by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition will contain letters wholly or in part new to the number of two hundred and thirty-seven .

		`` A Concise Dictionary of the French and English Languages , '' by Mr.
F. E. A. Gasc	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a small but thick book of nearly a thousand three-column pages , and the price is moderate enough to place the work within the reach of every beginner in the study of French .

		- '' The Dangers and Sufferings of
Robert Eastburn	PERSON	, and his Deliverance from Indian Captivity , '' is reprinted from the original edition of
1758	DATE	, and edited , with in - troduction and notes , by Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	.

		This is the first volume in a series called '' Narratives of Captivities '' projected and published by the
Burrows Brothers Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The famous
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , the use of which has hitherto been confined almost wholly to books issued by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, will be utilized in a special edition , bound in flexible leather , of the collection of '' English and Scottish Popular Ballads '' recently issued by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifilin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' series .

		The letters of
John Ruskin	PERSON	to
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, which are attracting considerable attention as they appear in the
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, will be published in book form by
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	next autumn .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	was
Ruskin	PERSON	's closest Amer - ican friend , and their correspondence , beginning in
1855	DATE	, continued practically until
Ruskin	PERSON	's death . ''

		The
John P. Branch Historical Papers of Randolph	ORGANIZATION	-
Macon	LOCATION	College '' are published annually by the history department of that institution .

		No. 4 of the series is now at hand , and contains four important contribu - tions -- three of them biographical in character , and the fourth a selection of articles reprinted from the ''
Richmond	LOCATION	Inquirer '' of nearly a century ago .

		A folio reprint of the minor works of Tacitus has lately been completed by Mr.
D. B. Updike	PERSON	at the Mer - rymount Press , and is now offered to subscribers in a limited edition of unusual typographical distinction .

		Early in the coming fall Mr.
Updike	PERSON	will have ready a volume containing
Ascanio Condivi	PERSON	's contemporary 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, biography of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	, as newly translated by Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	.

		In this work the '' Montallegro '' type , designed by Mr.
Home	PERSON	for the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	, will be used for the first time . ''

		The Better
New York	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
William H. Tolman	PERSON	and Mr.
Charles Hemstreet	PERSON	, is a sort of guide-book to the city , placing its main stress upon the various relig - ious , educational , and charitable agencies .

		The work is planned in eleven sections , thus making it a very practical aid to the investigations of the sociological student .

		It is published by
the Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	's `` ' Bird Center Cartoons '' have cheered and enlivened the readers of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune '' for many months past .

		They have recently been collected into a volume , supplied with a running commentary , and published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's text is quite as droll as his drawings , and the volume that contains them both is a source of unmixed delight .

		An interesting announcement comes to us from the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	of a series in preparation by that house devoted to '' French Men of Letters , '' planned on much the same lines as Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's great undertaking .

		Mr.
Alexander Jessup	PERSON	is named as general editor of the enterprise , and in the first two volumes to appear M. Ferdinand Brunetifere will deal with
Balzac	LOCATION	and Profes - sor
Edward Dowden	PERSON	with Montaigne . ''

		A
Manual of Pronunciation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Otis Asbmore	PERSON	, is a useful little book published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It gives in parallel columns a selection of words diversely pronounced , and with each word gives the pronunciation preferred by a number of standard dictionaries .

		Four American and six English authorities are thus referred to , making it possible to see at a glance what pronun - ciation of any particular word is favored by the weight of opinion .

		A volume upon the '' Elementary Principles of Eco - nomics , '' to which is joined a short sketch of economic history , is published through the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	as a text for school use .

		It is the work of Professors
Richard T. Ely	PERSON	and
George Ray Wicker	PERSON	, and presents in lucid form the principles of economic science as viewed by the most modern students of the subject .

		The book is well-appointed for educational purposes , and may be recommended for school use .

		The introduction by Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	to
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's forthcoming reprint of the Jour - nal of Sergeant Patrick
Gass	PERSON	will be devoted to an ac - count of '' The Rank and File of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Expedition , '' in which Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	presents whatever details are known regarding not only the doughty
Gass	PERSON	, but all the other men comprising the expedition .

		It is fitting that this should be done , as so much has been written of the Captains that the humbler figures of the others who by their devotion and bravery made the great journey a success have been somewhat obscured . ''

		The Statesman 's Year-Book '' grows a little stouter , and , if possible , a little more useful every year .

		The volume now before us is the forty - first annual publica - tion of the work , and is edited by Dr.
J. Scott Keltic	PERSON	^ with the assistance of Mr. I ,
P. A. Renwick	PERSON	.

		Its special feature is a series of statistical tables and dia - grams illustrating the development of British trade from
1860	DATE	to
1904	DATE	.

		The maps , also , bear largely upon this subject .

		The volume contains nearly fourteen hun - dred pages , and is published , as heretofore , by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Wilhelm Ltibke	PERSON	's '' Outlines of the History of Art , '' for many years one of the most popular , useful , and authoritative works accessible to the public , has been taken in hand by Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	, who has minutely revised it throughout , making of it a strictly new edi - tion and something more .

		As the editor truly says , `` the history of art which is possible to-day was un - thinkable in
1860	DATE	'' -- the date when
Lubke	PERSON	's ``
Grun	PERSON	- driss '' first appeared .

		In its present form the work consists of two very large volumes , and has many hun - dreds of illustrations .

		It is published by
Messrs. Dodd ^ Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of th `` most meritorious of the popular art series now issuing is ''
Newnes	ORGANIZATION	's Art Library , '' published in this country by
Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volumes on
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, and
Reynolds	PERSON	have already made their appearance , and others are in active prepara - tion .

		The text occupies but a few pages in each case , comprising a succinct sketch of the artist and a list of his principal works .

		The illustrations have foremost place in the plan , and are numerous enough to represent even the most prolific of painters with some degree of adequacy .

		In reproduction and printing , the plates are uncommonly good examples of half-tone work ; and in addition each volume has a frontispiece in photogravure .

		A work of unusual value and timeliness in view of the current discussion of American marriage and divorce problems will be published at once by the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	, in the `` History of Matrimonial Institutions , '' by Professor
George E. Howard	PERSON	, for ten years head of the
Department of History in Leland Stanford Jr.	ORGANIZATION	.

		University .

		This three-volume work pre - sents a complete historical survey of the development of the family as an institution and of the matrimonial practices that obtained in the various and typical stages of its growth , analyzing primitive customs and carefully tracing the evolution of the modern insti - tution .

		The history of marriage and divorce in the
United States	LOCATION	constitutes a separate part , and is the most complete presentation of the subject now avail - able .

		All the laws enacted in all the states since the Revolution have been examined , and the essentials em - bodied in an interesting narrative .

		The whole is sup - plemented by the most complete bibliography of the subject ever compiled , together with an index of the cases cited and a subject index .

		It is announced that a reorganization has taken place in the well-known house of
D. Appleton & Company	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Joseph H. Sears	PERSON	being appointed President of the corporation , to succeed Mr.
William W. Appleton	PERSON	, wha resigns the position to become Chairman of the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Charles A.	PERSON	and
Edward D. Appleton	PERSON	retire from the board , and are succeeded by Mr.
Sears	PERSON	and Mr.
George S. Emory	PERSON	, the latter being also made a Vice-President .

		The reasons given for these changes are that in view of the increasing responsibili - ties of Messrs.
Edward D.	PERSON	and
Charles A. Appleton	PERSON	as managers , respectively , of the
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	offices of the corporation , they find difficulty in attend - ing
Board	ORGANIZATION	meetings in
New York	LOCATION	, and voluntarily resign to make room for men on the ground .

		In assuming the Chairmanship of the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	, Mr ,
William W. Appleton	PERSON	will be so occupied with the work entailed by that position that he can not attend to the duties of the Presidency as well .

		The house of
Appleton	LOCATION	has had one of the oldest and most honorable careers of any in the American trade , and the best wishes of all will fol - low it tinder its new management .
