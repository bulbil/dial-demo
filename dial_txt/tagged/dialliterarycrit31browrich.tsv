		MR.
MOORE	PERSON	has much of the quality displayed by
James Lane Allen	PERSON	in the earlier work , '' A
Kentucky	LOCATION	Cardinal . ''

		The scene of his story is laid in the blue-grass region of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and his pages are rich with tender sentiment , shrewd philosophy , poetic feeling , and an exquisite humor .

		Those who have read his charming and pathetic short story , ''
Ole Mistis	PERSON	, '' will welcome his first novel , and new readers are sure to be delighted . ''

		Old Wash , '' the negro character who figures in some of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's short stories , reappears in this book .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has the happy faculty of expressing thought epigrammatically , as when he puts into the mouth of one of his characters , '' A truth fits every other truth in the world , but a lie fits nothing but some other lie made especially for it , '' a saying that surely deserves to live .

		L. de
V. Matthewman	PERSON	says , in the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Evening Telegraph : '' A story of marked originality , which will greatly interest those who can appreciate the quiet as opposed to the strenuous life . ''

		Not less charming than the story is the manner of telling .

		The shrewd , homely , common sense philos * ophy -- philosophy , not of books , but of life -- is refreshing . ''

		Those who love quiet and repose , who can feel the beauty and the power of Nature , who prefer the sunshot woodland paths to the rush of Broadway , will follow Mr.
Moore	PERSON	step by step with ever-growing delight .

		The woods and fields of
Tennessee	LOCATION	he trans - forms into
Arcady	PERSON	, and is the most delightful cicerone .

		It would be impossible to read a
< Summer Hymnal	ORGANIZATION	' understandably without learning and profiting much .

		Few , we think , who read the book once will be satisfied with one reading .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is to be congratulated on having given to the reading public a charming prose poem . ''

		The
New York	LOCATION	Journal says : '' The story that Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has told of a man who as a lad of fifteen falls in love with a girl of ten , and as a man fails at first to realize that he is still in love with her and so almost misses the happiness of bis life ; of a blind philosopher , who also loves this girl , Thesis , but sacrifices that love for his younger com - panion , and of a Summer outdoor life that is delight - ful , is something that few can afford to miss reading .

		It outranks `

		THE DIAL A Comparison of TWO GREAT NOVELS of the Civil War THE CRISIS and THE GRAPES OF WRATH -LRB- By WINSTON CHURCHILL -RRB- It is carious that two novels on the same general theme , by different aathors , withoat collaboration , and appearing simultaneously , should complement each other as do these books .

		By reading both a more complete knowledge of the war can be obtained than from many volumes of military history . ''

		The Grapes of Wrath '' differs in almost every respect from the conventional Civil War novel .

		Miss
Norris	PERSON	plunges her readers at once into the midst of the war .

		Her story opens in a
New Jersey	LOCATION	village in
1864	DATE	, and the reader follows the fortunes and adventures which give a more diversified picture of life in the North and South than any other story of the great conflict .

		By contrast , historically , with `` The Crisis , '' we find in '' The Grapes of Wrath '' full and vivid descriptions of the last year of the war in
Virginia	LOCATION	, from the opening of the Battle of the Wilderness to the Surrender , instead of scenes early in the war .

		In '' The Grapes of Wrath '' is a fine scene , graphically described , in which the heroine is present at a council of war of General
Lee	PERSON	and his staff .

		In another dramatic scene
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	tries to show President
Davis	PERSON	the absolute necessity of evacuating
Richmond	LOCATION	before it becomes too late .

		-LRB- By
MARY HARRIOTT NORRIS	PERSON	-RRB- '' The Grapes of Wrath '' has an air of reality that con - vinces the reader that most of it is taken from actual occurrences .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	describes fully the life of St. Loais just before the war and daring its first years .

		Miss
Norris	ORGANIZATION	describes with equal vividness those pathetic , thrill - ing days in
Richmond	LOCATION	before the surrender , the night of pillage at the hands of the mob , the entry of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	forces , and the last desperate battles of the dying Confed - eracy .

		There is a superb description , unforgettable in the impression it leaves , of the Wilderness through which our armies fought , inch by inch , against the intrenched South .

		Perhaps the most remarkable portion of '' The Grapes of Wrath '' is the long account of the
Union Captain Haldane	ORGANIZATION	's captivity in the abandoned mine in the
Wilderness	LOCATION	where a horde of negroes who had ran away from their masters had gathered , and lived collecting plunder and wealth of all sorts in preparation for freedom .

		We see the faithful neg ^ ro , but we also encounter the predatory negro , sacking houses , robbing the dead , plundering everywhere , and holding wild orgies .

		Obviously the author did not write it to please any - body , bat to give a trathfol picture of both sides in all their phases daring the most important year of the Civil War .

		1901 -RSB- THE DIAL '' The
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	has Just Published AN AMERICAN NOVEL .

		Two years ago Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' was published -- the most successful novel of its kind ever issued -- Two weeks ago to = day Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	published his new novel -- THE CRISIS THE BEST STORY THIS AUTHOR HAS YET WRITTEN During the past few weeks the publishers have been watching the comments of the Press with deep interest , and they have not yet seen a single adverse criticism .

		Out of the many notices already received , the publishers take the liberty of quoting a few OPINIONS OF THE PRESS : '' Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	has gained greatly in the power of making a character live and breathe before your eyes , and reveal its own personality through its part in conversation and through its deeds . ''

		--
Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The lore story is charmingly told .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	, it must be acknowledged , has scored a distinct success with this book .

		It is full of brilliant bits , clever epigrams , flashing analysis , and displays withal a broad grasp npon the meaning of things as they stood related to events and to history in those dark years of the nation 's travail .

		It is not too much to say that it is the best novel founded on the Civil War period that has yet been published . ''

		--
Brooklyn Daily Eagle	ORGANIZATION	.

		<< A book that presents the great crisis in our national life with splendid power , and with a sympathy , a sin - cerity , and a patriotism that are inspiring .

		TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 36 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 37 When the
Union League Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, last
February	DATE	, invited Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	to join in its annual observance of the birthday of
George Washington	LOCATION	, it made a singularly happy choice .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	is not only a finished public speaker , but he is also a his - torical scholar of broad-minded view , and a political philosopher of the first rank .

		Few Englishmen are as free from the insular preju - dices that are apt to warp the opinions of the best-intentioned of his fellow-countrymen , and in his mental bearing there is no trace of '' a certain condescension toward foreigners . ''

		He is , moreover , noticeable for a tendency to exalt the role of the great man in history , while free from the erratic temper of such men as
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, whose selection of figures for the illustration of this principle was sometimes peculiar .

		The wisdom which chose Mr.
Harri	PERSON	- son as the panegyrist of the first great American was as fully justified as that which has made him the most prominent figure in the approach - ing millenary of the first great Englisbman .

		When Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	returned to his own country , after remaining with us for several weeks , we confidently expected that he would have some '' impressions of
America	LOCATION	'' to give the English public , and would have felt keenly disappointed had he kept the impressions to himself .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, with the possible ex - ception of Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, has been the most distinguished of our English visitors since
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	viewed our civilization through his critical lenses , and , unlike Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	, he refrained from the rashness of dis - coursing beforehand upon what he expected to find in the New World .

		He was thus spared the awkwardness of correcting his a priori judgments , and he did not come to us as a critic who had already rubbed our fur the wrong way .

		There is no reason , then , why we should not give an open-minded greeting to his comments upon our society , and thank him no less for what he finds to blame than what he finds to praise .

		Fortunately for our pride , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, in his essay just published in '' The
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' finds comparatively little to blame in our national life as he viewed it , and when he does chide , it is so gently that it would need a very captious person to take offense .

		From 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the ordinary adverse prepossessions of our for - eign visitors he is noticeably free .

		He knows how to reckon at its true value the European legend of American life , knows how largely that legend is based upon our newspapers that do their best to misrepresent us , upon the snap - shot opinions of irritable tourists , and upon the eccentric conduct of some of our citizens when they find themselves in foreign parts .

		There is no parti pris in Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's estimate ; he came to us with candid mind , determined to report upon what he actually saw or dis - cerned to be the truth concerning us .

		Let us glance for a moment at some of his main conclusions .

		He is not misled by the mingling of nationalities that has produced the American people , but sees clearly that , with all the foreign strains in our population , we are essentially a people of English type , with English ideals of law , politics , and morals . ''

		The citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	is at heart much the same man as the subject of
King Edward	LOCATION	; the intellectual , social , and religious tone is nearly identical ; the proverbial differences we hear of have been absurdly exaggerated ... The American world is practically ' run ' by genuine Americans .

		Foreigners are more en evidence in
London	LOCATION	or
Manchester	LOCATION	, it seemed to me , than they are in
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, or
Boston	LOCATION	.

		... From
Long Island	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, from
Florida Bay	LOCATION	to
Vancouver 's Island	LOCATION	, there is one dominant race and civilization , one language , one type of law , one sense of nationality . ''

		Of
Chicago	LOCATION	, the city in which Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	first sojourned , and which he takes to be more typical of our civilization than almost any other , he has many interesting things to say .

		He does not find pork , grain , and anarchists to be its specialties , but rather education , and art , and social amelioration .

		`` Certainly , during my visit I heard of nothing but the progress of education , university endowments , people 's institutes , libraries , museums , art schools , workmen 's model dwellings and farms , literary culture , and scientific foundations .

		I saw there one of the best equipped and most vigorous art schools in
America	LOCATION	, one of the best
Toynbee Hall	PERSON	settlements in the world , and perhaps the most rapidly developed university in exist - ence .

		My friends of the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	, them - selves men of business proud of the city , strongly urged me to dispense with the usual visit to the grain eleva - tors and the stockyards , where hogs and oxen are slaughtered by millions and consigned to
Europe	LOCATION	, but to spend my time in inspecting libraries , schools , and museums .

		No city in the world can show such enor - mous endowments for educational , scientific , and chari - table purposes lavished within ten years , and still unlimited in supply ... The impression left on my mind was that the citizens of
Chicago	LOCATION	were bringing their extraordinary enterprise to bear quite as much on social , intellectual , and artistic interests as they con - fessedly do on grain , ham , steel , and lumber .

		They will have to do so if they are to hold their own in the future of civilization .

		For the manifest destiny of
Chicago	LOCATION	is to be the heart of the American continent . ''

		Of the future material supremacy of the American people , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	is as fully convinced as he is of the future predominance of
Chicago	LOCATION	among American cities .

		This supremacy is to result from our combination of large population , our educational agencies , our natural resources , and our social and politi - cal system , '' more favorable to material devel - opment than any other society ever devised by man . ''

		The writer goes on to say : '' It is a curious instance of the power of national egotism that
Europe	LOCATION	fails to grasp this truth -- that Germans , with their wretchedly poor country , narrow seaboard , and scanty rivers , ports , and minerals , still aspire to the first place ; that Frenchmen fail to see how their passion for art , rest , and home has handi - capped them in the race for supremacy in things ma - terial ; that Britons , in their narrow island and their comfortable traditions , will not recognize that the indus - trial prizes must ultimately go to numbers , national unity , physical resources , geographical opportunities , trained intelligence , and restless ambition . ''

		But the triumphs of civilization are not all material , as our latest critic knows full well .

		He admits that our libraries are magnificent , that our educational machinery is '' at least tenfold that of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, '' and that our reading public is enormous .

		With these patent facts , however , there goes the question whether '' this vast prosperity , this boundless future , rests upon an equal expansion in the social , intellectual , and moral sphere . ''

		We must agree with him when he answers this question by saying that '' they would be bold critics who should maintain it , and few think - ing men in the
United States	LOCATION	do so without qualifications and misgivings . ''

		The question can never be answered for good until our so - ciety is old enough to become organized in the sense in which the European societies are or - ganized , or until such organization shall have been clearly shown to be incompatible with the democratic ideal .

		At present , our society is `` young , inorganic , and fluid , '' our culture is widespread but superficial , polished conversa - tion is not a daily practice in many of our circles , and the sense of noblesse oblige , '' as a force constraining men in high office or in great social position , has hardly any equivalent in American life . ''

		A few other points made by Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	are well worth mentioning .

		He believes , for instance , that '' the standard of material well - being in the
United States	LOCATION	reaches for the masses of the laboring people a far higher and more permanent point than has ever yet been
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 attained by the laboring mass of civilized men . ''

		Speaking of the great fortunes that grow up in this country , he says that he '' saw nothing to suggest that wealth in
America	LOCATION	is worse acquired or worse applied than it is in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Perhaps the most pleasing of all his comments is the following : '' I received a deep impression that in
America	LOCATION	the relations of the sexes are in a state far more sound and pure than they are in the Old World ; that the original feeling of the Pilgrim Fathers about woman and about man has su # Bced to color the mental and moral atmos - phere , and to give all sexual problems a new and clear field to develop in normal ways . ''

		We call this a pleasing observation , not be - cause it flatters us , but because we believe it to be -- or , at least , to have been hitherto -- one of the fundamental facts about American society .

		It is , moreover , precisely the sort of fact to which the vision of the foreign visitor does not easily penetrate , although it is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of every Ameri - can who has grown up in an American home , gone through the American public schools , and familiarized himself with the characteristic productions of American literature and art .

		If Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, in the course of his two months ' stay , could realize this truth , our con - fidence in his judgments upon other and more doubtful matters should be considerable ; in a word , he is clearly of the observers who look beneath the surface of things , and whose opin - ions , even if formulated upon short notice , are bound to be treated with respect .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE SIMPLIFYING OF COLLEGE DEGREES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Ths Diai . -RRB-

		Hereafter the UiUTeraity of wiU confer only one degree , the
A.B.	LOCATION	, for ftll nndergrmdiute work .

		-- Neu : t Item .

		Something more than a hundred years ago a striking epigram , that all men are born free and equal , got into the head of a brilliant Virginian , and thence upon a bit of paper that afterwards became celebrated as the Declaration of Independence .

		It sounded so well that men took it up as a slogan of war and went through the Revolution with it on their lips .

		But , for all its attrac - tive sound , our ancestors could not convince themselves of its truth , and utterly disregarded it when they came to the task of setting up a government .

		The epigram , however , did not die , but lived on in the mind and on the tongue of many an orator who went about pleading for it in the name of the people .

		And thousands loved it , despite its neglect by the majority .

		Its devotees had almost beg ^ n to lose heart ; but now they may take courage , for the academic world has at last hit upon a plan whereby a beginning may be made toward putting it into practice .

		The plan is so simple , -- indeed , it is based on an axiom , -- that one wonders why it was not thought of long ag ^ .

		It is nothing more nor less than to recognize the fact that everything that equal men do is of equal value and should receive the same name .

		The honor of taking the lead in this movement must be given to the
University of Timbuktu	ORGANIZATION	.

		The process of reasoning by which the faculty of this institution were brought to rearrange their whole plan of collegiate work was very simple : Culture is acquired by a study of the achievements of mankind .

		Now all men are equal , consequently all their achievements are equal , and of equal cultural value .

		The college as an institu - tion of culture must recognize this fact and govern its courses accordingly .

		A necessary corollary is that free men must be allowed the utmost liberty in selecting and arranging their work .

		Of course only one deg ^ ree , the
A.B.	LOCATION	, which has always stood for the highest culture , will be given .

		Hereby the confusion arising from a multiplicity of degrees , which some regard as meaningless , and which at most merely indicate the lines along which a student has directed his work , will be avoided .

		Hereafter the
A.B.	ORGANIZATION	will simply mean that he has acquired culture by some one of the manifold combinations of studies possible , through a system of choice and chance , with a thousand or more subjects to choose from .

		It will be impossible in a brief paper to give even the names of the many courses now offered at this institu - tion , covering , as they do , five hundred pag ^ s of its last Register ; but the prospective student may be benefited by a perusal of one of the possible combinations .

		Many of the conrses offered require only two hoars per week , and are pursued only three months , in order that the student may have a still wider range .

		A series of lectures by noted specialists is arranged for each year , attendance upon which may be counted for a de - gree .

		The writer was particularly struck by two of the courses announced for next year , '' The Quintessence of the
Asymptote	ORGANIZATION	'' and < ' The Sweet Influence of the Pleiades . ''

		Some colleges looked upon this as a rather startling departure , and were a little slow to follow it at first .

		In particular , objection was made to the introduction into collegiate work of such subjects as Torts ,
Obstet	PERSON	- rics , and the like , on the ground that they were profes - sional .

		Such absurd objections , however , arose from prejudice due to long established custom .

		Many insti - tutions now recognize this fact , but are afraid to cut loose from their old moorings too suddenly .

		They an - nounce that only one degree , the
A.B.	LOCATION	, will be g ^ ven hereafter for collegiate work , and have gone so far as to say that some work which is commonly reg ^ arded as professional will be accepted for the last year 's work in college .

		However , this timidity is fast disappearing , and it is only a question of time when the absurd and arbitrary distinctions between professional and non - professional studies in their relation to culture will be abolished .

		`` Gardens Old and New . ''

		* There is in
England	LOCATION	a sort of out-of-doors magazine known as '' Country Life , '' which has been producing once a week forever a pleasant article on country house gardens -- illustrated , of course .

		Sixty of these , collected , constitute the present volume bound with the slightly obvious title `` Gardens Old and New . ''

		In a way , as a piiblication it may be consid - ered as the youngest and most charming de - scendant of such books as
Nash	PERSON	's '' Mansions '' and
Richardson	PERSON	's `` Historic Houses , '' having sprung directly from that union of architecture and photography so evident of late in combi - nations of pictures and chatter of notable dwellings .

		Some of these have appeared for their own interest , and many as backgrounds for the interest of some personality ; but such as they are , historic mansions have of late teemed to such an extent that one now rec - ognizes them rather wearily .

		Since
Nash	PERSON	has achieved a rare-book value in the market , and
Richardson	PERSON	is used as an historical document , it may be seen that we have been taking our houses seriously for a very long time , and it is consequently somewhat of a relief to take to the garden .

		This present collection , therefore , with its fresh-air quality -- its parterres , and rosaries , and general garden panorama -- comes to a welcome long preparing for it .

		A republication in
England	LOCATION	and an importa - tion in
America	LOCATION	, the critic 's relationship to the book is not the nearest , but is one remove , so to speak : since it is also published as a popu - lar volume , and is not aimed especially at land - scape architects and such , we may even take our gardens lightly , as gardens should be taken .

		The proper way to take a garden is , of course , to take it at five o'clock of a
summer	DATE	's afternoon , and to take it with tea .

		So , pushing open the window of any of Mr.
Nash	PERSON	's mansions , we will step out upon the terrace , and turning our backs on the stuffy world of furniture and interior decoration , survey the English out - of-doors of five o'clock and '' brillig '' when shadows grow longer and cooler , the intervals between distant noises lengthen , and the silver and the porcelain clink in polite sotto voce near by .

		* Gabde '' 8 Old and New :
The Country House	ORGANIZATION	and its Garden Environment .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	: Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has given well the at - mosphere of such a garden , in the '' Portrait of a Lady , '' in the chapter which introduces the Touchetts : '' Under certain conditions , there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the cere - mony known as afternoon tea .

		There are circumstances in which , whether you partake of the tea or not -- some people of course never do -- the situation is in itself delightful .

		Those I have in mind in beginning to un - fold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime .

		The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English country house , in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		Part of the
afternoon	TIME	had waned , but much of it was left , and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality .

		Real dusk would not arrive for many hours , but the flood of
summer	DATE	light had begun to ebb , the air had grown mellow , the shadows were long upon the smooth , dense turf .

		They lengthened slowly , however , and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source of one 's enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour .

		From five to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity ; but on such an occasion as this the true interval could only be an eternity of pleasure ... The house that rose above the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration , and was the most characteristic ob - ject in the scene I have attempted to sketch .

		A long gabled front of red brick , with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of picturesque tricks , only , however , to improve and refine it , presented itself to the lawn , with its patches of ivy , its clustered chimneys , its windows smothered in creepers .

		The front of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance front ; that was in quite another quarter .

		Privacy here reigned supreme , and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior .

		The great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains ; and the place was furnished like a room , with cushioned seats , with rich colored rugs , with the books and papers that lay on the grass . ''

		Then there is conversation , -- but one may not quote a whole chapter .

		What has been given is an accurate and sympathetic word-picture , giving in color the leisurely and sequestered delights which the book we are talking about shows in black and white .

		But in spite of this eminent example , and heedless of the well-known peaceful character of gardens , the gentleman who begins the book under review -LRB- and maybe ends it , for it contains anywhere from one to sixty anony - mities -RRB- plunges immediately into all sorts of controversy .

		He chooses , curiously enough , as a motto for this proceeding , '' Horas non numero nisi serenas , ^ ^ and then lines up land - scape gardeners and architects in opposition , and makes the peaceful English close the battleground of opposing schools , who tear up

		THE DIAL 18 each other 's shrubs by the roots , and call on the reader to decide .

		This seems to be not the nicest way to begin a book on gardens .

		Horas non numero if you like , nisi serenas that I insist on , -- and escaped to the pictures .

		These are charming and many , -- lawn and court , hill-side and bowling-green , ringed with moun - tain , moor , and sea ; gardens old and new , with much that is a revelation , especially in the old .

		Taken for the pictures , the book may be recommended freely , especially to the following people : First of all , to the minor architect , that it may cultivate in him a sense of mise - enscene .

		Secondly , to people who have no gardens and probably never will have any , especially school-teachers ; its charming sug - gestion of quiet and peaceful leisure being offered to them in the nature of a consolation for their over-crowded days .

		Thirdly , to those who have gardens .

		This recommendation is made with the conviction that , as heretofore , those with gardens will get the book , and those without will never see it .

		Last
Summer	DATE	, a small Italian child who lives on the
West Side of Chicago	LOCATION	, near
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	, invited someone there to come and see her garden .

		She led the way to the court-yard of the house , a space paved with brick , and not describable even by the most slip-shod as being with verdure clad .

		However -- such is youthful resource -- in the corner a brick was missing , and in its space she had planted a grain seed obtained from the feed-store next door .

		Placing her in class two of those I have named , she would undoubtedly enjoy the book -- and with equal certainty , it may be said , she will never get it .

		It is true , however , a logician might consider she had a garden .

		A point of interest to democratic
America	LOCATION	, for whose benefit the gardens are transplanted , may be derived from an analysis of the contents of the volume .

		Of the sixty-six private grounds described , three belong to dukes , one to a marquess , nine to earls , some half-dozen to baronets , and the rest to commoners , lieutenant - colonels , honorables , and clergy of various degree .

		This is quite a representative list , and as one turns the pages and passes from Chats - worth , the possession of a duke , to
Beaulieu	LOCATION	, the residence of a marquess , from this to Porches , the country-seat of a mere earl , con - descending even to the homes of baronets -LRB- baronets date only from the seventeenth cen - tury -RRB- , and finally sinking through the upper middle classes , in whose direction might one be supposed to break the tenth commandment ?

		In favor of the dukes and marquises and earls ?

		Not at all ; the haute noblesse do not seem to have much fun .

		It is not until one is well past the lower baronage , and is burrowing among the commoners , that the gardens one covets become frequent .

		These plain people have grounds that nestle snugly up to the house with a charming immediateness into which one can step from any door or window .

		They are also full of the most interesting things - -- pergolas , for instance , pleached alleys , sun - dials , yew arbors ; while the landscape of the upper peerage has much gravel , many mouldy classic statues , black slaves -LRB- a favorite but unsightly form of fountain -RRB- , bacchic vases , formal gardens , and geometrical flower-beds .

		The spaces around the great houses all seem -LRB- like
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , to dangle a well-known example -RRB- somewhat cold and bleak , with a remoteness altogether different from the coziness of the '' domestic boskage '' of the smaller and less stately houses .

		Of course , when a duke living in an artificial age pays no heed to the satires of Pope , but lays out his demesne in accordance with the arti - ficiality of the time , he does it on a scale of acreage and expenditure which means that his family or successors have this large , ugly thing '' for keeps . ''

		It is too big and costly to wipe out .

		With the smaller houses it is different .

		They can change in a generation , and from generation to generation preserve all that is worthy in tradition , and , like freedom , '' broaden down from precedent to precedent . ''

		Then you have your present properly backed up by your past , and can rest back comfortably supported by all the ages , instead of having to adjust yourself in a Procrustean manner to the measure of a period pilloried for your discom - fort .

		Such ducal gardens may have an his - torical value , as giving a sense of a certain age ; but the value of gardens is , after all , their value to life and to living , and however it has happened , the smaller closes here illustrated are , on this count , the more valuable .

		They are the ones to covet , to copy , to possess for the sheer delight in them ; and they are , hap - pily , the ones that may be coveted and copied and possessed with impunity .

		There is so much of consolation in this triumph of the intensive over the extensive , that I feel as though I had achieved almost the whole duty of a critic in pointing it out .

		SO small and insignificant a subject ? ''

		We open the volume , and are forthwith absorbed in the wonder and beauty of the facts and thoughts he presents .

		Here is no technical treatise on the builder of the honey-cell .

		The book strikes out an entirely new line in the narration of a story that has been ably rehearsed , in parts and in the whole , times without num - ber since Swammerdam began the tale in the seventeenth century .

		It is a mingling of the profound speculations of the seer , the magical visions of the poet , and the cautious conclusions of the man of science .

		As poet ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	deals with bees as `` The soul of the
summer	DATE	, the clock whose dial records the moments of plenty ; they are the untiring wing on which delicate perfumes float ; the guide of the quiver - ing light-ray , the song of the slumberous , languid air ; and their flight is the token , the sure and melodious note , of all the fragile joys that are born in the heat and dwell in the sunshine .

		They teach us to tune our ear to the softest , most intimate whisper of these good , natural hours .

		To him who has known them and loved them , a
summer	DATE	where there are no bees becomes as sad and as empty as one without flowers or birds . ''

		As seer , he remarks that '' In our endeavor to understand the intellect of the bees , we are studying in them that which is most pre - cious in our own substance : an atom of the extraordinary matter which possesses , wherever it attaches itself , the magnificent power of transfiguring blind necessity , of organizing , embellishing , and multiplying life ; and , most striking of all , of holding in suspense the obstinate force of death , and the mighty , irresponsible wave that wraps almost all that exists in an eternal unconsciousness . ''

		As man of science ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	proves his right to recognition by his grasp of the knowl - edge gained by previous observers of the apian tribes , by his own peculiar acquisitions , and by the concise , comprehensive , and uniquely charm - ing method by which he passes it all over to his unlearned reader .

		In the final chapter on '' The Progress of the Race '' he uses ingenious argu - ment to show how transition , even in the bee , '' is called for from a precarious , egotistic , and incomplete life , to a life that shall be fraternal , a little more certain , a little more happy , '' and concludes with the reflection that '' In a world where nothing save a few facts of this kind indicates a precise will , it is significant enough that we should see certain creatures rising thus , slowly and continuously ; and should the bees have revealed to us only this mysterious spiral of light in the overpow - ering darkness , that were enough to induce us not to regret the time we have given to their little gestures and humble habits , which seem so far away and are yet so nearly akin to our grand passions and arrogant des - tinies . ''

		Again a trite theme is handled in the volume on '' Moths and Butterflies , '' by Mrs.
Mary C. Dickerson	PERSON	, and again we are gratified by the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		15 : fresh and engaging form it is made to assume .

		The intent of the author is to win the interest of the elementary student in entomology , the boy and girl who in the schoolroom or in the
summer	DATE	vacation would penetrate somewhat into the secrets of insect life .

		The guide who here offers to open out the way reveals rare qualities for the accomplishment of her task .

		By close investigation in the field , the labora - tory , and the library , she has become an adept in the work .

		So at ease is she by reason of the insight long training has yielded her , we follow on with undeviating trust and admira - tion .

		By a clear and connected exposition of the life-history of a few of the most notable of our moths and butterflies , the structure and habits and faculties of this group are made visible almost as though we looked through the
$ ye	MONEY	and the microscope at first-hand .

		lUus - irations of a value equalling the text , clear-cut and original , accompany it all along , throwing light on the minutest details .

		The book closes with a chapter explaining the relationship of moths and butterflies , their classification and ancestry , and adding complete directions to the novice for collecting and preserving them .

		If they who seek recreation at the seaside would but vary the day 's conventional round with a little consideration of the marvels of animal and vegetable life that abound on the shores of the unfathomable ocean , life would be a dearer thing then and thereafter for the wholesome and inspiring influences brought into it .

		Pick up but one bit of weed washed up by the waves , examine it under the magni - fying glass , look searchingly but a moment into one of the pools held in the lap of the rocks , and if there lurk an atom of a naturalist 's enthusiasm in your temperament you will feel that for an instant the glories of another and • upper world have flashed down on you .

		Then you will possibly cast about for some under - standing of the curious things that have been suddenly revealed , the strange , weird , beautiful shapes and movements existing in this unknown realm .

		For such inquirers , there is enlighten - ment in a study of '' The Sea-Beach at Ebb - Tide , '' by Mrs.
Augusta Foote Arnold	PERSON	.

		A wide gleaner will he be who descries any of the lower forms of marine life that are not named and classified in this capacious volume .

		Its descriptions are definite and simple , and the co - pious and exquisite illustrations lend a valuable aid to the identification of puzzling specimens .

		The name alone of Mrs.
Mabel Osgood ` Wright	PERSON	is needed to draw attention to a new book .

		Praise may be reserved , for the versatile charm of this writer is thoroughly understood .

		Her love of nature in its varying aspects sets a gentle imagination aglow , and a trail of pleasant light is left on every page her pen passes over .

		Her latest work , picturing '' Flowers and Ferns in Their Haunts , '' has all the grace of the vol - umes that have gone before .

		It is set in the frame of a slender story , the characters of which afford occasion for diversity and individuality of ex - pression .

		We may believe it to be in the main a transcript of the writer 's actual experiences in her search for the wild growths of the field and forest .

		Every accessory was present to make these experiences a pure source of joy and of health , and so vividly are they reported that the reader shares in them to the fullest extent .

		Full-page plates of surpassing beauty , veritable leaves from the book of nature , are scattered with a profuse hand through the volume ; while a multitude of delicate drawings inserted in the text are equally true to life , having been traced directly over original photographs .

		An amiable companion to Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's volume is one which travels '' With the Wild Flowers from
Pussy Willow	LOCATION	to Thistle-down , '' by
Maud Going	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
E. M. Hardinge	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This work first made its appearance seven years ago , but its contents are still fresh in interest .

		They have a vital quality , and by careful re - vision are infused with the vigor and the aptness that befit the present hour .

		With much spirit and no little tact , a succession of the best-loved flowers that adorn the months from
March to October	DATE	are marshalled into line , and their distinctive features pointed out for our easier recognition , our deeper-seated admiration .

		Mrs.
Hardinge	ORGANIZATION	's discourse is based upon a genuine knowledge of botany , and is ornamented with the refinements of a picturesque and fluent diction .

		The '' Lovers of the Woods '' who slip the handy volume bearing that title into their pocket for reading in a quiet hour will serve themselves acceptably .

		The author , Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
H. Boardman	PERSON	, has pressed into it much of the true essence of woodcraft , the fragrance of which is so grateful to the appreciative .

		The woods of which he writes are not located .

		Woods are woods , as he rightly indicates , any - where from
Canada	LOCATION	to either coast ; and ' * all the exquisite refinements and amusements of the most highly civilized spot on earth can do no more '' to secure him comfort who enters their precincts with a reasonably expectant spirit .

		`` Absolute comfort for body and mind , '' he 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	.

		adds , '' is perhaps not the keenest enjoyment , but it is worth working for , and it can be had in the woods . ''

		It was to restore impaired health , we infer , that Mr.
Boardman	PERSON	took up for a time the pursuits of a woodsman , cheerily dispensing with the helps and diversions of society and relying upon himself for the pro- vision of the chief necessaries for the support of life .

		He learned the art from a past-master of woodcraft , and with good sense and high courage was at once an apt scholar .

		He has little direct communication with his reader , but through speech with his guide and an oc - casional chance comrade he betrays the fact that he is a man of culture , and addicted to pithy reflections . ''

		I 'd been careless , '' he makes a forest comrade say , '' and carelessness is the worst fault a man can have , except lyin ' about what he 's done . ''

		All that can be done by artist and artisan to perfect the externals of a volume has been done for the collection of '' Nature Studies in Berkshire , '' by Mr.
John Coleman Adams	PERSON	.

		The present is a new edition of the work which was fresh from the press
two years ago	DATE	.

		The price has been reduced one half , and still the book may be pronounced a volume de luxe , with its wealth of photogravures that deserve the rank of works of art from their skilful choice of subject and their delicacy and finish of execution ; and , with these , the harmon - ious details of print , paper , and binding .

		The text is the effusion of a poetic soul stirred by the romantic scenery of the Berkshire hills .

		One who has not fallen under the spell of the landscape in
Northwestern Massachusetts	LOCATION	might deem it a rhapsody ; yet no one can doubt it is the honest , as it is the impassioned , record of moods excited by rare passages of beauty in earth and sky .

		The trees , the brooks , the meadow lands , and the hillsides , with the drift - ing clouds and the floods of
summer	DATE	sunshine , are alike beloved by the writer , who paints their changing pageantry with sincere fervor .

		The camera has introduced a new and fruit - ful factor into the study of natural history .

		We are only beginning to test its usefulness , and yet the results already attained show the boundless possibilities of the instrument in the extension of accurate knowledge of the habits and the haunts of animals and plants with which there has been hitherto an obscure or misleading acquaintance .

		The ornithologist has been active in improving the opportunities the camera suggests ; but the one who at the present hour has accomplished the most inter - esting feats by means of it is Mr.
Francis	PERSON	-
Hobart Herrick	PERSON	, who has just given to the world his experience in photographing the '' Home Life of Wild Birds . ''

		It is safe to say his account furnishes a greater body of fresh and trustworthy facts regarding the be - havior of birds in the nesting season than has - been offered in any single publication for a considerable time .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's brilliant performance consists in bringing '' the mountain - to Mahomet , '' or , in plain words , in bringing a nest that is hidden by impenetrable foliage in a tree or on the ground , out into the open ^ where the eye of the camera can peer into it without obstruction .

		In the
last two summers	DATE	- he has thus placed under easy view twenty-six nests belonging to fifteen different species of birds .

		For example , a cedar-bird has built its home in a pine tree forty feet or more above the ground .

		The branch on which it rests is severed from the tree and fastened upon two stakes in an open field , four feet above the ground , and perhaps fifty feet away from its original site .

		Care is taken to effect this change - of location when the parental instinct is strong - ^ est -- that is , when the young are from four to nine days old .

		The parents are at first be - wildered and alarmed ; but the cries of their offspring lure them to the new situation , and soon they are feeding the chicks with their usual frequency and freedom of manner .

		A small green tent is now set up close to the nest , and in this concealment the observer watches the birds and photographs their every move - ment .

		It was Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's custom to spend the hours from nine o'clock in the morning to three in the
afternoon	TIME	, daily , within the tent -LRB- usually within a foot and a half of the nest -RRB- , using pencil and notebook and camera in swift and exact report of every attitude and event affecting the parents and young .

		This patient and industrious study was pursued until the fledglings were able to take wing and depart finally from the scene .

		The data gathered in such favorable circumstances could not fail to be rich in novelty and value .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's relation of the incidents observed is supple - mented by a series of reprints of his photo - graphs , which furnish much fresh evidence pertaining to the history of birds in the most important period of their lives .

		A life of five years of unalloyed happiness was the lot of '' Mr.
Chupes	PERSON	and Miss Jenny '' in the loving care of their gentle mistress -LRB- Miss
Effie Bignell	PERSON	-RRB- living in a college town in
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Chupes	PERSON	had fallen out of

		THE DIAL 17 the nest in the early pinfeather stage , and , despite the cries of mother robin and his own vigorous protest , was made captive and trans - ferred to a human habitation .

		It was a short time before he was quite at home in the new surroundings , and though allowed later the liberty of sallies out of doors , his affection for bis mistress had quenched the natural thirst ior freedom .

		In the autumn a companion of his own kind was found in the person of
Miss Jenny	LOCATION	, a neglected , caged prisoner , discovered in a baker 's den .

		How the two throve , how intelligent they proved , what individuality each possessed , and what endearing traits they dis - closed , is told in a way that could scarcely be bettered .

		It is likely to make the warm-hearted sigh for a pair of pet robins , yet there are pen - alties to be paid for such particular privileges , and it is quite as well , as a rule , to enjoy them in another 's experience , as Miss
Bignell	PERSON	has permitted her readers to do .

		One comes into quick communion with
Brad	PERSON	- ford
Torrey	ORGANIZATION	in any piece of writing , however sketchy , he affixes his name to .

		The element of personality is so strong in his utterances that he appears to be actually present in the fashioning of his sentences .

		It is difficult to understand why this is so -- perhaps because - what he says comes so directly and frankly from the heart , making itself felt as an exact repre - sentation of a true and simple selfhood .

		Add to this an indefinable literary charm , and his popularity as a writer is accounted for .

		His latest book contains a score of short talks about our '' Everyday Birds , '' which one is likely to meet in any ramble along country roads .

		The work is announced as of an elementary nature , prepared especially for children ; but one need not be dwelling in the period of adolescence to enjoy it from cover to cover .

		A notable feature of the book is the reproduction of twelve col - ored plates from
Audubon	LOCATION	.

		Twenty '' Bird Portraits '' by
Ernest Seton	PERSON	-
Thompson	PERSON	are sufficient of themselves to give distinction to a volume .

		These portraits have a vigor , a boldness , a certainty in the handling and a lifelike character which command instant consideration .

		They are allowed ample space in the volume , and are set in landscapes which give them an imposing effect .

		The descriptive text , by
Ralph Hoffman	PERSON	, is of secondary import - ance .

		So eloquently do the pictures delineate the separate features of the bird , the dominant traits in its character and environment , they can afford to dispense altogether with explana - tory comment .

		* Mr.
Henry P. Wells	PERSON	may not be as '' con - templative '' a man or as bewitching a writer as was
Izaak Walton	PERSON	, but he is certainly a fisherman of far more skill and experience -- for , as is now admitted , honest

Charles Cotton	PERSON	,

Wells	PERSON	certainly knows all that the most ambitious mortal need know about fishing , and his book on '' Fly-Rods and Fly-Tackle '' is an encyclopaedia in its kind .

		Fishermen need scarcely be told that the book has for nine years or so been perhaps the au - thority on its subject .

		They will at all events be glad to know that a new edition of it , re - vised , supplemented , and partly re-written , is now ready .

		How exact a man the author is , how honorably ambitious to add something to the sum of human knowledge , may be gathered from his account of a projected experiment -LRB- which we trust will one day be carried out -RRB- through which it was proposed to learn precisely ^ ' how lines , leaders , and flies appeared to trout under the varying conditions of light and water which confront the angler when rod in hand . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	goes on to say : '' My plan was to procure a diver 's outfit , together with the necessary skilled assistance , and at various depths beneath the surface of the water , and over light and dark colored bottoms , and in sunshine and shadow , myself impersonate a fish while a friend angled for me , as it were .

		Thus , and with the aid of telephonic communi - cation and a stenographer , I hoped in two or three weeks ' time to make quite an impression on the problem . ''

		The above '' experiment '' -- Mr.
Wells	PERSON	imper - sonating a fish and angled for by his friend , with full telephonic apparatus and a shorthand reporter on the bank -- would certainly be worth going miles to see , and public notice of its occurrence ought to be given .

		The text is pretty plenti - fully sprinkled with cuts of the right sort -- that is to say , of the purely illustrative and useful sort , -- and the frontispiece shows Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself , rod in hand , '' attending of his trembling quill , '' and pleasantly conscious of '' a bite . ''

		No angler , however experienced , need fancy that he can find nothing new in this suggestive -LRB- and not too big -RRB- book .

		But it is addressed chiefly to beginners , and contains mainly , the author says , such information as he would himself have most thankfully received during his novitiate .

		The advent of the golfing season brings with it a boon to the novice and to the player of average accomplishment , in the shape of a manual on '' Practical Golf '' by Mr.
Walter J. Travis	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Travis	PERSON	's name is , of course , a power on American links .

		He is not only a past-master of the manual dexterities of the great game , but a student of its theoretical principles as well .

		Your average '' profes - sional '' is usually a man of fine physical equip - ment , who plays largely by rule-of-thumb , trusting for results to the skill of practice ; one who can show you promptly in any given case how the thing ought to be done , but if pushed by the inquisitive tyro as to why it should be done in precisely that way and no other is often brought to a standstill .

		Not so Mr.
Travis	PERSON	.

		He has thought the game out .

		He can tell you why , if a stroke be played so or so , under a given set of conditions , it must theoretically be followed by such or such results .

		Mr.
Travis	PERSON	, in short , is a rational or reasoning golfer , who plays an intelligent and intelligible game .

		He is therefore well qualified to teach , and his book shows the due blending of matters of theory and practice .

		Ample and convincing directions are given as to stance and grip , the swing , putting , approaching , the choice of clubs , the construction of courses , handicap - ping , etc. .

		In an appendix one finds the Rules of Golf ,
Special Rules for Stroke Competitions	ORGANIZATION	, a Glossary of Technical Terms , and so on .

		Mr.
Travis	PERSON	being , like
Sarah Battle	PERSON	of immortal memory , a stickler for the '' rigor of the game , '' appends also those decent conventions known as the '' Etiquette of Golf , '' which , he adds ^ '' shall be as binding upon players as the other Rules of the game . ''

		The text is supplemented ' by many instantaneous photographs showing Mr.
Travis	PERSON	in a variety of contingencies doing the thing as it ought to be done .

		The book is actually instructive , and no golfer who means to master the game should overlook it .

		In '' an age of ell-wands and unjust bal - ances , '' as Carlyle genially called our trading - and money-getting times , the art of swords - manship is fallen in abeyance .

		The trick of fence is forgotten .

		The good knights are dust , , their swords are rust ; and if your neighbor offend you , you have him up in court , instead of pinking him , in a manful and chivalrous way , through the midriff .

		Some high-spirited Tybalts there are whose tastes revert fondly to the days of the duello , who make a cult of the sword , and would gladly refer their disputes to the issue of the wager of battle , were ic not for the unpleasant consequences attached by a huckstering and prosaic age to even such gen - tlemanlike breaches of the peace .

		Such a fine , medisBval soul , we take it , is Captain
Alfred Hutton	PERSON	, late of the
King 's Dragoon Guards	ORGANIZATION	, and author of the handsome volume now before us , entitled '' The Sword and the Centuries . '' ''

		The portrait of the author prefixed to the vol - ume , showing a keen , D'Artagnan-like visage , ^ with hawk 's eye , and waxed , up-turned mous - tachios , bears out our impression of his char - acter .

		Captain
Hutton	PERSON	has already published several other books on the weapon he so affects , notably '' Cold Steel '' and '' Old Sword-Play , '' ^ both of them works of authority in their field .

		One might think that he had by now pretty well exhausted his subject , if not his enthusi - asm ; but in the present volume we see how much freshness may be imported into a well - threshed theme , if only the writer changes his point of view of it .

		Captain
Hutton	PERSON	is still , as before , the historian and eulogist of the sword ; but his method now is , while recounting - the story of the development and manipulation of the weapon , to instruct his reader and en - liven his narrative by casting the latter mainly in the form of a chronological account of notable encounters exemplifying the practice of swords - manship , from the Age of Chivalry when great lords jousted at the barriers beneath the ap - proving eyes of beauty and royalty , down to the days of
Figg	ORGANIZATION	and
Sutton	PERSON	-LRB- arcades amhoy when prize-fighters slashed and maimed each other for the amusement of the assembled

		THE DIAL .

		19 brutes , titled and other , at Hoekley-in-the - Hole -LRB- frequented by
Pepys	PERSON	-RRB- and Mary-le-bone .

		Captain
Hutton	PERSON	's book , in fine , may be fairly characterized as a description , from a most competent and sympathetic pen , of the various swords used in civilized
Europe	LOCATION	during the past five centuries , and of notable and typical single combats which have been fought with them .

		The volume is suitably and attractively illustrated .

		While Captain
Hutton	PERSON	's hobby is the sword , that of Mr.
Walter Winans	PERSON	is the revolver .

		Captain
Hutton	PERSON	wants us all , for our health 's sake , to learn to fence ; Mr.
Winans	PERSON	, on much the same grounds , wants us all to learn to shoot .

		The Captain , on the whole , seems to have the better of the case , since public lon - gevity would hardly be promoted were every - body to take to peppering at a mark with a revolver .

		But be that as it may , there is no question that Mr.
Winans	PERSON	's sumptuous book on `` The Art of Revolver Shooting '' is a com - plete and authoritative manual which amply supplies the want of a work of the sort .

		Mr.
Winans	PERSON	's book is virtually first in its field , and it is not likely soon to have a rival .

		The author is , as every sportsman knows , the champion revolver-shot of
Great Britain	LOCATION	-- an `` artist , '' in fact , second only to the incomparable
Cheva	PERSON	- lier
Ira Paine	LOCATION	, whose recent death deprived the world of a man who could do things with a revolver which must have given him an ill repute in the days when the black art flour - ished .

		In Mr.
Winans	PERSON	he has found a worthy successor .

		As a pistol-shot Mr.
Winans	PERSON	began early -- as a small child in frocks , in fact , when , in lieu of a rattle , he had a pistol of the French Fiobert variety , with which he used to shoot at paper targets , '' snuff '' candles , knock over tin soldiers , and so on .

		The child was father of the man , and Mr.
Winans	PERSON	-LRB- now well along in years -RRB- has been popping away strenu - ously at a target ever since , bent on scoring as many bull 's - eyes as possible , and wasting no care on the minor concerns of life .

		Happy he who has a hobby , be it ever so small a one , and the time and means to ride it .

		Mr.
Winans	PERSON	's book is meant primarily to instruct , and he begins at the elements of his '' art . ''

		The evolution of the revolver is sketched , after which the leai-ner is told how to select , handle , and take care of the weapon .

		Special chapters are devoted to the
Bisley	PERSON	rules and competitions , to practice and training , to gal - lery shooting , stage shooting , trick shooting , game shooting , pigeon shooting , to shooting from a bicycle , and what not .

		In short , about every question likely to be asked touching the uses of the revolver is replied to clearly and authoritatively in this exhaustive book .

		We are glad to note that the folly of that large and jocular class of persons who can never see a pistol lying about without picking it up and pointing it at you , and who appear later at the coroner 's inquest with the old '' didn ` t-know - it-was-loaded '' plea , is attended to by Mr.
Winans	PERSON	, who of course -LRB- his home being a sort of arsenal -RRB- has had some narrow escapes from it .

		Mr.
Winans	PERSON	thus relates how he once left a revolver lying on the table in his
Bisley	PERSON	tent : `` Some visitors dropped in , one by one , to lunch .

		First came an elderly lady .

		She sat down near the table ; her eye fell upon the revolver .

		She instantly snatched it up with a laugh , and pointed it at me with , • I 'll shoot you ! '

		I made her put it down , and was explaining to her how injudicious it was to point a re - volver at anyone , how it might have been loaded , etc. , when in came a parson .

		He sat down and began talking pleasantly .

		Presently his eye caught sight of the revol - ver .

		Grabbing it , he shouted : ` Now I 'll shoot you ! '

		and pointed it at me , roaring with laughter .

		I locked up that revolver . ''

		Mr.
Winans	PERSON	's book is profusely and attrac - tively illustrated , and is an alluring one out - wardly even for those who care little for its theme . ''

		The Woman 's Book of Sports '' is a pretty and practical little publication , which the ama - teur sportswoman will do well to slip in her satchel when she goes for her
summer	DATE	's outing .

		The elementary features and principles of the outdoor games most affected by the gentler sex are clearly and attractively set forth , but the distinctive feature of the book is its treatment , from the woman 's point of view , of sports gen - erally supposed to be reserved for , or mainly enjoyed by , men ^ -- namely , football , baseball , yacht-racing , rowing , athletics , and so on .

		Technical terms are explained , and the main points of each sport made clear .

		The chapter on yachting has been especially prepared with an eye to the coming contest for the
America	LOCATION	's Cup , so that the reader may fully understand and enjoy the accounts of the race , or the race itself if she be fortunate enough to witness it .

		The chapters on Golf and Tennis are rudi - mentary , and the novice will find them useful .

		The book is well described as a practical guide by a practical writer for the amateur sports - woman .

		It is illustrated with full-page pic - tures appropriate to the text .

		* The extent to which modern methods of illustra - tion has developed finds no better proof than in recent books of travel .

		A few years ago the trav - eller was obliged to supply his own sketches , or let his book go forth with nothing more intimately descriptive than its text .

		To day there is no jour - neying without a camera , and the aspects of the remotest regions are made familiar even to the child who can not read .

		But it is this growing familiarity with the world as a whole which is , after all , the most wonderful thing .

		If the armies and navies of

		the opportunity is given for the real illumination of the darkest spots on the earth 's surface .

		The recent sending forth of emissaries from French , Canadian , and American newspapers to prove just how quick a girdle may be put around the earth , gives more than ordinary value to the Rev. Dr.
Francis E. Clark	PERSON	's < ' A New `` Way Around an Old World . ''

		One of the first of civilians , if not the very first , to avail himself of the possibili - ties of
Russia	LOCATION	's new Trans-Siberian railway , the outbreak of hostilities in
China	LOCATION	made the road un - available except for military purposes immediately after he had crossed into
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Clark	PERSON	is the President of the
United Society	ORGANIZATION	of Christian En - deavor , and his official presence was required in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	and , later , in
England	LOCATION	.

		He arrived in
Vladivostock	LOCATION	on
May 1 , 1900	DATE	, just as the ad - vancing season released the
Amur River	LOCATION	from ice and made the journey across
Siberia	LOCATION	by steamboat and rail then possible for the first time .

		He notes that the forging of this link makes a circuit about 22 000 miles long around the earth , all within the north temperate zone , 9,000 miles of this journey being by sea and 13,000 by land and river .

		The book is unpretentiously written , intensely sympa - thetic with Rus & ia , and rather remarkable for a calm incidental denial of all rights and virtues to the Chinese .

		In abrupt contrast with Dr.
Clark	PERSON	's superficial praise of
Russia	LOCATION	, based upon what could be seen from a car window or the deck of a river boat , are the observations of Mr.
J. Stadling	PERSON	in his '' Through Siberia . ''

		Well known as a traveller and sociologist in his own country -LRB-
Sweden	LOCATION	-RRB- , and long a student of
Russia	LOCATION	and its affairs , he undertook the explora - tion of the Siberian coast line on behalf of the Swedish Anthropological and
Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, of which
Baron Nordenskjold	PERSON	was then the chair - man , having for his chief incentive to this task the hope of finding some trace of the unfortunate An - dr ^ ti , his former associate .

		Mr.
Stadling	PERSON	left
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	on
May 1 , 1898	DATE	, reaching Sehigalova on the upper
Lena four weeks later	DATE	.

		Thence he took boat for the mouth of the
Lena	LOCATION	, 3,000 miles distant , intending to go overland by sledges to the
Lower Yenesei	ORGANIZATION	.

		At Kangelak , an island in the
Lena delta	PERSON	, the explorer was frozen in , within a short distance of the spot where the lamented crew of the '' Jeannette '' met their fate .

		Eventually he was able to make good his original plan , sledging across the tundra to the Anabar , to the
Katanga	LOCATION	, and over the Tamyr peninsula to the Yenesei , which was ascended in sledges over the ice , eventually reaching civilization , after a journey of 15,500 miles , at the close of the year
1898	DATE	.

		The realities of Russian maladministration , especially in refer - ence to the convict system , are prominent upon Mr.
Stadling	PERSON	's pages .

		Everywhere there is officialism and failure , with an appalling preponderance of crimes of violence .

		Among the natives of
Asiatic Siberia	LOCATION	the Russian influence has been even more
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 demoralizing , the exactions of the authorities having forced the unhappy people , in more instances than one , into cannibalism .

		The story is vividly told , and in convincing detail .

		Chungking , commercial metropolis of the Chinese province of Szechuan , lies 1.500 miles from the mouth of the Yangtzekiang , thus affording Mr.
Archibald Little	PERSON	a favorable starting-point for the walking-tour he describes in his '' Mount
Omi	PERSON	and Beyond . ''

		He began his journey on
July 7 , 1892	DATE	, and covered 1.300 miles in eighty days at a total - cost of about two hundred and fifty dollars , a con - siderable portion of the expense being incurred for the carriage of the cumbrous copper or silver cur - rency which he was compelled to use .

		Three weeks brought the pedestrian to the sacred mountain of the Buddhists , and his adventures there , while the priests were soliciting contributions in quite the manner known at home , are told with great good - nature and vivacity .

		He entered Thibet near Ta ■
Chien Lu	PERSON	, on the
last day of August	DATE	, after skirting the Snowy Mountains ; he remarks on the limpid beauty of the stream that runs through the town , and adds , '' Curious that the pollution of water , which is a sin against religion nearly throughout
Asia	LOCATION	, should be a matter of sublime indifference in ' enlightened '
Europe	LOCATION	and especially in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		In this region he found both Chinese and Thibetan Buddhist temples , the contrast being unfortunate for the Lamas , whose gloomy creed seemed to have made little impression on their merry followers , intercourse with whom Mr.
Little	PERSON	enjoyed greatly .

		Taking another tour over the same ground some years after , he observes : '' It is sad to one who , like myself , travelled in the province ten years ago , before this influx -LSB- of missionary bodies -RSB- , to note the difference .

		Then I never beard an uncivil word ; now one is constantly jeered at by the rabble , and a favorite amusement of the small boys in the villages around
Chungking	LOCATION	is to draw crosses in the path , hoping that the advancing pedestrian may not dare to tread on them .

		The erection by the missions in
Chungking	LOCATION	, in conspicuons sites , of strange-looking buildings , which interfere with the so strongly implanted fungshui superstitions of the natives , was one of the main causes of the Chungking riots of
1886	DATE	.

		What - ever be the cause , the temper of the people is entirely changed for the worse . ''

		Mr.
Clive Bigham	PERSON	's former books of travel , and his known experience as an attache of the British embassies at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	, and , until recently , at Peking , give his '' Year in
China	LOCATION	, 1899-1900 '' more than ordinary title to considera - tion .

		Throughout this work may be read the broad sympathies of a man of the world , his earlier train - ing as a soldier leaving him not without consideration for an enemy in the field .

		He was present at the advance upon Peking known as '' the Admiral 's Expedition , '' describing one of the
Boxer	PERSON	attacks upon the allies as follows : '' They came on us in a ragged line , advancing at the doable from a village some quarter of a mile to the left flank .

		Not more than a couple of hundred , armed with swords , spears , gingalls , and rifles , many of them being qnite boys .

		To Liiyone who had been some little time in
China	LOCATION	it was an almost incredible sight , for there was no sign of fear or hesitation , and these were not fanatical `` braves , ' or the trained soldiers of the Empress , but the quiet , peace-loving peasantry -- the countryside in arms against the foreigner .

		As they approached they dropped on their knees , lifting up their hands to heaven to in - voke the God of War , the chief of their Boxer free - masonry .

		Then they charged until they dropped again as oar volleys began to tell .

		In twenty minutes they were in full retreat , leaving some sixty dead on the field . ''

		Mr.
Bigham	PERSON	announces his intention to avoid politi - cal questions , and his book is a cheerfully written description of his journey from
Canton	LOCATION	to
Hankow	LOCATION	, to
Peking	LOCATION	, through
Manchuria	LOCATION	and eastern
Siberia	LOCATION	, through the Korean littoral to
Seoul	LOCATION	, up the Yang - tzekiang to western Szechuan and down the river again to Tientsin and
Port Arthur	PERSON	, the book con - cluding with a brief survey of the fighting around Peking , the campaign on the Amur conducted by the Russians , and the journey back to
Europe	LOCATION	over the Trans-Siberian railway .

		One of the general conclusions of the volume deserves citation : '' The European in considering the Chinese character should recollect that the Aryan and the Yellow races are physically and mentally distinct .

		What would appear truth and reason to one often seems folly and lies to the other .

		Our ideas of history , of ethics , of domestic life , and even our logic and system of reasoning , fre - quently run quite counter to what the Chinaman respects and believes .

		And our victories do not by any means convince him that he is wrong and that we are right .

		One should therefore guard against getting a wrong perspective of
China	LOCATION	and of its people by endeavoring to apply to them European standards of comparison . '' ''

		Japanese Plays and Playfellows '' is written by Mr.
Osman Edwards	PERSON	after six months ' sojourn in
Japan	LOCATION	, and is most entertaining , though necessarily superficial in its account of the native theatre , with which most of the book is concerned .

		However , superficial as it is , it has the merit of being told at first-hand , from personal observation and intimate conversations with native actors .

		The author dis - cusses the religious drama , still in the condition of the mediaeval miracle-play of
Europe	LOCATION	, and shows the difference between that and the delicate art of Mr.
Obojiro Kawakami	PERSON	and Mme.
Sada Yacco	PERSON	, this latter the first of her countryfolk to lay off the Elizabethan convention which denies women appear - ance on the stage .

		There is an entertaining little conversation reported with the celebrated
Ichikawa Danjuro	PERSON	, who represents the classic tradition of the Japanese stage , one question and answer reading thus : '' ' How is it you have avoided the master-passion of our
London	LOCATION	actors to become an actor-manager ? ' '' '

		I think a manager must be sorely tempted to put money first and art second .

		I often advise authors to make certain alterations in the play for which I am engaged , but the responsibility of entire management would distract me from the purely artistic aspect of representation . ' ''

		22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, A mach-needed explanation is made of the position of the geisha , and a chapter is devoted to the most striking phase of Japanese social naorality , in which Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	displays a sympathy as illuminating as it is rare .

		The book is one of real importance , being illustrated by twelve pictures in color by Japanese artists , delicious in design and execution . ''

		Sands of
Sahara	LOCATION	'' is the appropriate title given by Mr.
Maxwell Sommerville	PERSON	, Professor of Glyptol - ogy in the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, to a some - what formal account of a journey from
Syracuse	LOCATION	to
Algiers	LOCATION	, and thence through
Algeria	LOCATION	,
Tunis	LOCATION	, and
Tripoli	LOCATION	, by way of
Lambessa	LOCATION	,
Touggourt	LOCATION	, and
Temacin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book , while addressed to the sim - plest comprehension and rather didactic in tone , contains excellent descriptions of the Roman city of Thimgad and of the various tribes of Kabyles and Bedouins met on the expedition , with many curious instances of superstitions brought forward by the traveller 's quest for amulets among the na - tives .

		It is beautified by reproductions of photo - graphs , which have all the charm of finished pictures from an artist 's hand .

		A number of books concerning
Morocco	LOCATION	have been written by Mr.
Budgett Meakin	PERSON	, and these are now followed by '' The Land of the Moors '' from the same hand .

		Like ancient
Gaul	PERSON	, the book is divided into three parts , the first devoted to the natural and physical characteristics of northwestern
Africa	LOCATION	, the second to the political aspects of its various divisions , while the last , under the head of `` Experimental , '' contains accounts of journeys made through the territory discussed in the earlier part of the volume .

		The eighty-three illustrations from photographs are augmented by a map , the details of which are fully authenticated , leaving great areas as little known as any portion of the earth 's surface .

		One of the curiosities of geography is embodied in the author 's search for Miltsin , a mountain described early in the last century by an explorer , but now seemingly lost beyond the power of recovery .

		Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	's bicycle tour is described with much humor , one of the dialogues between the rider and an on - looker reading thus : '' < But what sort of beast are yoii riding ?

		We thought it must be '' a drinker of wind , '' ' -- whereby is denoted a certain fleet camel used on the desert , seldom seen now in
Morocco	LOCATION	. '' '

		Why , dear no ; it 's only a mule , a
Nazarene	ORGANIZATION	mule , you know , ' -- for everything outside
Morocco	LOCATION	is either called Roman or Nazarene . ''

		`` You don ' t mean to say so !

		How do you breed them ? '

		`` • < Well , you can see for yourself from its speed that its mother must have been a gazelle , and from these round parts and iron that its father must have been a reaping-hook . '

		`` A moment 's ` stare while trying to realize whether this could be the truth or not , and out they burst in a hearty laugh , for the Moors do enjoy a joke , and this was one which specially appealed to them , so to every new-comer it was repeated as fact in most solemn tones . ''

		The humor which is incidental in Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	's work is dominant throughout Mr.
Herbert Vivian	PERSON	's ^ '' Abyssinia . ''

		This is the third book of travel from this entertaining hand , and it is to be hoped that anyone who can extract so much amusement from sojourning in strange parts and share it so delight - fully with his readers may long be spared to wander over the least-known parts of the earth .

		Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	was long enough in the land of Prester
John	PERSON	ta reach the capital from
Aden	LOCATION	by way of
British Somaliland	LOCATION	, to interview
King Menelik	PERSON	, and return by the way he came .

		He prefaces his narrative of travel with a brief historical account of the Lion - Land , which unwittingly suggests a paraphrase of the freshman 's answer , '' As I understand the sub - ject of
Abyssinia	LOCATION	, it is a subject which is not well understood . ''

		He has a number of political con - clusions to draw , most of which are to the effect that
England	LOCATION	was wrong in surrendering any ter - ritory to the Abyssinians .

		His portrait of the King is well done : '' He wore clean bright blue woolen socks and new tennis shoes of a common kind , with the tongues hang - ing out and no laces .

		Over close-fitting white linen knickerbockers came a loose garment of handsome green and gold striped silk .

		It had long , tight sleevea buttoned at the wrists , and when he moved his legs I saw that the garment was lined with common calico .

		Under it he wore a white shamma with a red embroid - ered line near the edge , and over everything a black silk cloak with gold embroidery and small gilt buttons .

		On his head was a big grey felt hat with a high crown and broad brim .

		In his left ear was a diamond solitaire earring , about the size of a threepenny-bit and set in gold .

		This is worn in evidence of his Laving killed elephants , and only the royal family are permitted to - wear gold in any form ... , '' His face is not so much marked with smallpox as I had been led to expect .

		He is darker than the average Abyssinian , but his features are not those of a negro .

		His mouth , however , is quite negroid , and his thick lips wear an incessant grin , displaying large , very white teeth set loosely together .

		His small brown eyes wore an expression of fatigue , and what bhould be the white * of them were yellow .

		His forehead is narrow , but the upper part of his face appears to have much character and kindliness .

		His beard and whiskers are very close and curly , and inclined to be grey .

		His voice is soft and rather oily , without any vestige of the usual Abyssinian squeak .

		He speaks very deliberate ! -RCB- '

		, show - ing his teeth and tongue and wagging his head a good deal .

		He makes no gesticulations with his hands , ex - cept that he sometimes puts his finger-tips together .

		On the whole I should describe his as rather an eccle - siastical manner . ''

		While Great
Britain	LOCATION	was occupied with the burghers in
South Africa	LOCATION	, in the
spring of 1900	DATE	, .

		the
Ashantis	PERSON	took occasion to make a bold strike for independence , bursting into hostilities while the Briti & h executive , Sir
Frederic Hodgson	PERSON	, K.C.M.G.r Governor of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, was holding a `` palaver '' with the native kings at
Kumassi	LOCATION	-- formerly spelled
Coomassie	PERSON	.

		The attack was wholly unexpected and hardly prepared for , the Governor having taken hi &

		THE DIAL 23 wife with him on the journey .

		It is Lady
Hodgson	PERSON	who now writes an account of the beginning of the war , calling it '' The Siege of Kamassi , '' from the principal episode in it .

		The story is told with great spirit and simplicity .

		Lady
Hodgson	PERSON	describes what she saw , her hasband having made it his rule never to discuss political aspects of his duties with her , and her book is lacking in any account of the manner in which the revolt was finally crushed .

		Throughout the book there is calm and tacit denial of any right on the part of the Ashantis to govern and rule themselves , and instances of barbaric savagery to justify the British conquest are cited -- though it seems to be true that the presence of the English has led to greater bloodshed than was ever known in the land before their coming .

		The siege of Kamassi began on
April 25 , 1900	DATE	; Governor
Hodgson	PERSON	and his wife left it in possession of a small English force on
June 23	DATE	; and the siege was finally raised a few days later .

		Thirty-three Europeans , 720 Hausa -LRB- native -RRB- soldiers , and several thousand refugees were beleagured by many thousands of Ashantis , many of them well armed .

		The journey back to the coast was a most arduous one , and many deaths resulted from the progress through a hostile land .

		After concluding her story of her own adventures .

		Lady
Hodgson	PERSON	adds a chapter or two on the condition of the capital of the colony .

		So much has been written recently about the lack of capacity for improvement in the negro that a word from her may be quoted : '' I have met some charming -LSB- black -RSB- African ladies , and am glad to say that in my ten years ' experience of the Gold Coast each year improves the position of women , and to-day they -- I am speaking of educated women -- are not the slaves to their husbands that they were a few years ago .

		It has been most interesting to watch the growth and civilization of the community , and it really seems marvellous how
Accra	LOCATION	has advanced in the last few years , even in the matter of entertainments . ''

		Though '' S de Lights on the
March	DATE	, '' Mr.
H. F. Mackern	PERSON	's contribution to the history of the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, is not strictly a book of travel , it may be classed with the book preceding and with the later chapters of Mr.
Clive Bigham	PERSON	's work , being rather impressions received by a stranger and on - looker than a detailed narrative of hostilities .

		Mr.
Mackern	PERSON	is an American from
New York	LOCATION	, whose point of view is best told by himself in discussing the ardent admiration conceived for the
United States	LOCATION	by the British when they found the world against them in their conquest of the two Republics .

		Noting the enthusiastic twining together of the
Union Jack	ORGANIZATION	and the Stars and Stripes , he adds : '' Such proofs should be most gratifying to those of us who are broad-minded enough to grasp their true meaning , to those who think for themselves , and are not influenced by sensation-seeking editors or gallery - talking politicians ; even though some of the latter have poured out their eloquence in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, while lacking absolutely a clear understanding of the actual state of affairs in
South Africa	LOCATION	, which forced
Britain	LOCATION	into a war which she would rather have averted . ''

		But the pablic will not he fooled by these states - men who are ever on the look-ont to work on the sos - eeptibilities of the ignoiant .

		The men found pleading for the Boers are those who wanted to recognize the so-called Cuban Republic , even when the combined
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	and Xavy were not able to locate it ; the same patriots who , by their absurd notion of justice -LRB- to call it nothing worse -RRB- encouraged the
Phili	LOCATION	- pinos to shoot down our boys , and for the sake of such cheap notoriety as they can get , are willing at any time to embarrass the government . ''

		Though this would seem to indicate that Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- kern needs the experience of travel in
America	LOCATION	and acquaintance with the history of this country more than anything else , hia book will not be found lack - ing in a certain charm .

		He celebrates the war - correspondents in
South Africa	LOCATION	, more than a third of whom , he notes , were killed or incapacitated in the discharge of their duties .

		He was with General French at
Elensburg	LOCATION	, and saw the British flag raised over
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	and
Pretoria	LOCATION	.

		He has nothing but praise for the British , even to the point of stating that ' ■ Any remarks that may seem to be criticisms are not intended as such . ''

		Altogether the narrative is an excellent specimen of the work of a person unknown in our history for more than a century -- the American Tory .

		Worlds away from this Anglicized American in sympathy for the inhabitants of a foreign land , Mr.
Montgomery Carmichael	PERSON	has successfully in - terpreted for his readers the realities and idealities of no small portion of
Italy	LOCATION	in his charming book , `` In
Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		He feels at liberty to set forth differences not less than resemblances in national characteristics ; but he nowhere insists that failure to comply with British requirements constitutes in - feriority , and in more cases than one he actually conveys the impression that English-speaking people can learn much to their advantage from the Italian - speaking peoples .

		What he calls `` the conclusion of the whole matter '' is worth giving in full : `` With all his faults .

		In spite of all the difficulty we have in comprehending his character , In spite of contradic - tions , complexities , and crudities , the Tuscan is perhaps the most charming of all the children of
Adam	PERSON	, just as his country , in spite of all Its drawbacks , in spite of fierce heat , damp , sclrocco , tramontana , mosquitoes , and all the plagues of a vexatious bureaucracy .

		Is more nearly like the Promised Land than any other .

		Bat to live in that enchanted laud and dwell among its siren people needs an apprenticeship not easy to serve , and many a Philistine from beyond
Jordan	PERSON	cancels his arti - cles early in the apprenticeship and flees the country in affright or disgust .

		It is often only after years of hard service , constant uneasiness , and continual per - plexity , that the stranger sojourning in the land awakens one day to find that he is dwelling In Eden , and sees on all sides of him , living In the flesh and working In the spirit , characters and ideals which had dimly figured among the dreams he dreamt in the far-off days of his generous , romantic boyhood . ''

		It may readily be conjectured that the charm and glory of
Tuscany	LOCATION	is transferred to Mr.
Carmichaers	PERSON	pages .

		He has been content to let others tell of 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the obvious things , while he dwells on matters which until now have hardly been disclosed to us .

		The result is a book to keep , for its freshness of spirit and interest make it worth reading more than once .

		Without defining with scientific exactness the boundaries of the delightful country of which he speaks , Mr.
William A. Dutt	PERSON	makes the '' Highways and Byways of
East Anglia	LOCATION	'' very real to a dweller in a distant land , his pleasant text being interpreted and supplemented by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's delight - ful drawings .

		`` Some parts of
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
Suffolk	LOCATION	, and
Cambridgeshire	LOCATION	'' is the phrase which defines the limits of this journey of love , and though the author complains that his itinerary will be '' as re - markable for what it misses '' as for what it brings to his readers , these latter will find but little fault after enjoying the feast he spreads for them .

		Lit - erature and history have been drawn upon about equally to enrich and beautify the narrative , and it will be found a treasure-house of the things which are best worth knowing .

		The author says : '' I could never find it in me to decry East Anglian scenery because of its tameness ; rather , I could pity the man who is unable to discover in its quaint old - world hamlets , thatched farmsteads , and ancient shrines many elements of the picturesque .

		As for the historical interest of the district , it both gains and loses some - thing in that many of the events in which it originated occurred so long ago that they have become inseparably associated with romantic legends and untrustworthy traditions . ''

		The book has the rare merit of serenity , and is to be valued highly .

		This is to be an article of contrasts , for a more disheartening book than Mr.
Hesketh Prichard	PERSON	's `` Where Black Rules White , '' an account of a journey made by the author in the republic of
Hayti	LOCATION	, is hardly to be found among recent publications .

		It is a book of comparisons , and these not of what
Hayti	LOCATION	was aforetime and has now become , but what
Hayti	LOCATION	is and what the best civilization of the world has become .

		It is truly a tale , as the English author avers , of a people who '' are neither very brave nor very fierce ; not even barbaric ; merely barbarians . ''

		There is a detailed account of Vaudoux practices , and of official inefficiency , of militarism and the rule of might .

		The whites are feared , because the blacks believe them anxious to return them to slavery , -- so Mr.
Piichard	PERSON	informs us , -- and this is the only reason he can give for the curious blindness to a natural love for self-government that seems to be growing into an '' Anglo-Saxon '' idiosyncrasy , which he exhibits in the following words : '' The surprising part of it is that these negroes , who bear with incredible wrongs and tyrannies from their illiterate masters , would resent the mildest sway at - tempted by those not of their own race and color .

		The lowest of the people are as frantically opposed to an - nexation by a white Power as are the ruling classes . ''

		Mr.
Prichard	PERSON	's book bears out to the full some of the conclusions respecting the negro embodied in Mr.
Poultney Bigelow	PERSON	's '' The Children of the Nations . ''

		This , though it is all that its sub-title announces in being '' A Study of Colonization and its Problems , '' is based so largely upon the author 's extended travels and observations at first-hand that it may be included here as well as elsewhere . ''

		If many of my conclusions vary from those current , '' says Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	, '' it will be found that I have drawn less from official reports than from personal inquiry and observation . ''

		The result is one that possesses to an unusual degree the quality we all know and admire under the name of '' common sense . ''

		Eminently sane in most of his conclusions , there is an enormous extent of territory , almost the whole world outside of
Europe	LOCATION	, covered by Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's studies .

		Not only is the history of colo - nization set forth , in so far as it is pertinent at the present day , but the conditions of nearly all the colonies or self-governing nations which have sprung from them are exhibited as they are at the present moment .

		There is a personal tribute to the Filipino character in the too brief chapter on the
Philippines	LOCATION	, and the usual calm statement of American short - comings by which more than one member of the
Bigelow	PERSON	family has earned the gratitude of those among his countrymen whose esteem is best worth having .

		It is only in the chapter on '' The Negro as an Element in Expansion '' that Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	seems lacking in human sympathy , for in it he ad - vocates strongly what can be regarded as nothing less than qualified slavery for the American man of color .

		This , it would appear , is not to be done as a method of education , but because the negro race is inferior : '' Our first duty is to recognize the truth that the negro is not the equal of the white man . ''

		The question is too broad to be entered into here , but the statements of the book in this respect , like all its contents , deserve study .

		Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	enjoys a reputation deservedly great as a climber of mountains , and the fame gained from his previous exploits will suffer no diminution through the deeds set forth in his last book , on '' The Bolivian Andes . ''

		On
September 10 , 1898	DATE	, he reached the summit of Illimani in the
Cordillera Real	LOCATION	, about 22,000 feet above the level of the sea .

		Sorata baffled him on the first attempt , a heavy storm driving him from a point not far from its summit ; but he surmounted the peak known as
Anohuma	LOCATION	on
October 10	DATE	, the height attained being about the same as that of
Illimani	PERSON	.

		These were the real deeds of the journey to
Bolivia	LOCATION	, the other peaks ascended being much lower , and the service per - formed in relation to them being that of an explorer rather than a mountain climber .

		The book is ad - mirably written , and is filled with information con - cerning the native Indians and their somewhat desultory government .

		An account of a revolution that did not revolve very far adds to the interest of the book .

		It is admirably illustrated .

		Though the book is needlessly slight , it is really entertaining , human sympathy making ade - quate compensation for occasional flippancy .

		Another unpretending narrative of a trip to
Mexico	LOCATION	, preceded by one to the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	and thence southward , comes from the practised pen of Col.
A. K. McClure	PERSON	, the veteran editor and public official of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The book has for its title '' To the
Pacific	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' and though the country traversed is fairly familiar ,
Colonel Mc	ORGANIZATION	-
Clure	ORGANIZATION	's descriptions and impressions of it are pleas - ant and informing .

		An error -LRB- twice occurring -RRB- , in making the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe railway run through the Grand Canon of the
Arkansas	LOCATION	is to be noted .

		In `` The Niagara Book '' a number of distin - guished Americans have joined forces to describe the greatest of American spectacles .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has one of those pleasantly intimate descriptions of his journeys to the Falls which remind us of a no less genial if not so witty Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	; Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	gives '' Some Extracts from
Adam	PERSON	's Diary '' to ac - count for several things about
Niagara	LOCATION	; Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	popularizes the scientific aspects of the cataract so far as its geology is concerned ; and there are numerous other articles of interest mingled with instruction .

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		War has been adequately dealt with in imaginative prose .

		Taking his own city of
St. Louis	LOCATION	for the principal scene of his story , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has made a masterly reconstruction of its life during the years just preceding the outbreak of hostilities , as well as during the trying years of the war itself .

		The value of the book lies chiefly in its blending of a minute and intimate study of the conditions in the single State of
Missouri	LOCATION	with a vivid and passionate realization of the national aspects of the crisis in question .

		The spectacle of the house of the nation divided against itself is reproduced in miniature in the division of the individual families of a State whose sympathies were so nearly balanced that for a long time it was uncertain which side it would take in the impending conflict .

		That
Missouri	LOCATION	was saved to the Union Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	attributes mainly to the energetic action of General
Lyon	LOCATION	and to the German element in the population of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, an element inspired by the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	ideals of
1848	DATE	, and ready to fight once more in the defense of those ideals .

		As a story of private interest , '' The Crisis '' proceeds upon familiar lines .

		There are the two contrasting types of Puritan and Cavalier -- the one a young man who embodies the
New England	LOCATION	tradition ; the other a high-bred young woman of Southern extraction , the descendant , in fact , of the author 's own
Richard Carvel	PERSON	and
Dorothy Manners	PERSON	.

		Except for the special delineative skill exhibited in the present case , this story has been told a hun - dred times before .

		Likewise , the incidents of battle have a familiar guise .

		The generous rivalry between the Northerner and the hot-blooded Southerner , enabling the one to save the other 's life more than once , is an old enough story , as is also the story of the heroine , who struggles for years against an in - stinctive love which is at variance with all the traditions of her race .

		But the writer never allows us to forget the momentous issues that lie back of this network of individual relations , and , being himself of the younger generation that knows of the war only as recorded history , he can approach his subject with a due sense of its perspective , and re - main sufficiently objective to preserve his artistic poise .

		Besides the hero and the heroine , there are two other private characters that enlist our sympa -

		26 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, thies in a marked degree .

		One is
Colonel Carvel	PERSON	,
Virginia	LOCATION	's father , the embodiment of those admir - able traits which have always characterized the Southern gentleman at his best ; the other is the stern , almost fanatical , Northern sympathizer , Judge
Whipple	PERSON	, who faces the world with a front of granite , and whose heart is as tender as that of the great President to whom its full allegiance is given .

		We have reserved for the last what we have to say about
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	as he appears in this book .

		We meet him face to face upon two occasions -- once during the progress of the great debate with
Douglas	PERSON	, once at the close of the war , and on the eve of the tragic consummation of his career .

		But his presence is felt as a pervading influence throughout the book , and the author 's greatest triumph is found in the effective way in which he has dealt with the sacred memory of Lincoln .

		For it surely is a triumph to portray that personality in such terms of tenderness and reverence that the tears start unbidden with almost every mention of the name .

		We believe that this book will do more than all the histories to make the new generation understand the passion that inspired those days of the fifties and sixties , with their high purpose , their heroic resolve , and their moral fervor .

		Of late , the Republic seems to be forgetting the ideals that made of the Civil War so much more than a political struggle , and such a book as '' The Crisis '' can not fail to be productive of much good in reviving , not merely the memories , but the fine idealisms of the period in which it moves .

		Another young writer , Mr.
Owen Johnson	PERSON	, has taken the Civil War period for the subject of a novel , and has achieved a certain measure of suc - cess , although there is nothing about the book that is likely to make a lasting impression upon its readers .

		What is most noticeable is a sort of easy fluency , almost volubility , which permits a rather simple narrative to be expanded into a novel of some four hundred pages .

		The hero is a young man of Southern antecedents , who goes to
Cleve	PERSON	- land to carve out his fortunes .

		When the war begins , he is a successful man of affairs , and finds an opportunity for service to his country by accept - ing a post in the commissariat department .

		His honesty and personal courage enable him to thwart many a rascally contractor , and helps us to realize that laurels may be won upon other fields than those of battle .

		The title of the book , '' Arrows of the Almighty , '' seems to suggest a study in heredity , and this is doubtless intended by the writer , but we can not say that the problem is worked out with much distinctness .

		The opening chapters , des - criptive of the hero 's parents , and of his child life in
Maryland	LOCATION	, are much better than those that follow .

		They arouse , indeed , anticipations for the subse - quent development of the story that are doomed to disappointment .

		Mr.
William Farquhar Payson	PERSON	has found an in - teresting theme for a historical romance in the for - tunes of that famous Lost
Colony	ORGANIZATION	sent out by
Raleigh	LOCATION	in
1587	DATE	.

		In the matter of invention he has been greatly daring in one respect , for he has made no less a person than
Christopher Marlowe	PERSON	a member of the expedition .

		His story deals with exciting adventures on the voyage to
Virginia	LOCATION	, with Spanish intrigue to defeat the purpose of the colony , and with the long years of struggle , and hope deferred , and eventual failure on the
Island	LOCATION	of
Roanoke	LOCATION	.

		We owe him a debt of thanks for having `` rigidly suppressed '' the padding of '' manners and cus - toms '' that most writers make it a point of misguided conscience to put into such a work .


John Vytal	PERSON	, the hero of this romance , is a finely conceived figure , the very incarnation of Elizabethan strength and endurance , and the woman whom he serves and unsinfully loves proves a most acceptable heroine .

		This woman is the mother of
Virginia	LOCATION	Dare , the first English child born in
America	LOCATION	.

		As for the poet of '' Tamburlaine , '' we are glad to have him of the company , albeit at some strain upon the probabilities , and his speech and conduct are such as befit the man who , had he lived , might have dis - puted with Shakespeare the primacy of English song .

		Old
Manhattan	LOCATION	at the close of the seventeenth century is the scene of ''
Patroon Van Volkenberg	PERSON	, '' a historical romance by Mr.
Henry Thew Stephen	PERSON	- son .

		A Huguenot exile from
France	LOCATION	is the hero , and he comes to
America	LOCATION	in search of a sister who had been sold into service as a redemptioner in
New York	LOCATION	.

		He finds that she has met a mysteri - ous and tragic death at the hands of her master , the powerful and unscrupulous patroon who gives the book its title , and he seeks to avenge her .

		In the end , vengeance is left to
Providence	LOCATION	, for the patroon has a daughter , and -- well , we can imagine the rest .

		The story has a pronounced melodramatic flavor , and is replete with stirring incident .

		As a portrayal of the semi-feudal patroon system , it is interesting and instructive , and it shows us much of the diflBculties of the English rule in these early days when the civilization of the
New Netherlands	LOCATION	was rather Dutch than English .

		The redoubtable Captain
Kidd	PERSON	plays a minor part in this history , although he can hardly be said to appear as one of the characters .

		Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, during the past few years , seems to have taken the far West for his province rather than the middle West , which was the scene of his earlier novels .

		The change is for the better in itself , and has been accompanied by an increased strength both in grasp and in vitality .

		The finer graces of diction are probably beyond his reach , whatever the themes he may attempt , but he is acquiring a certain rough force and breadth of style that make his work impressive .

		He is fortunate , moreover , in the mountain setting of these later books -- `` The Eagle 's Heart , '' which we reviewed not long ago , and '' Her Mountain Lover , '' the occasion of the present remarks .

		He is imbued with a genuine passion for the hills , and the rough sincere types of character which that environment
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 27 seems to foster find in him a sympathetic inter - preter .

		He gets at times very close to the poetical mood , and his revolt from the artificial sarroandings of civilization becomes more and more pronounced .

		In '' Her Mountain Lover '' the scene , for the most part , is not the West at all , but the
England	LOCATION	of town and country .

		This appears to contradict what has just been said , but a word of explanation clears away the difficulty .

		His hero in the present • case is a rough Westerner , prospector and cowboy at once , who goes to
London	LOCATION	for the purpose of selling a mine .

		The impact of this strange figure apon English society provides the book with its substance , and
Jim Matteson	PERSON	so dominates every situation in which he is placed that all the English accessories of the story are just so much stage - setting for this one uncompromisingly far Western character .

		The difficult situation is very well managed , and
Jim	PERSON	more than holds his own upon all occasions .

		There are suggestions of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	in the story , and there is even a certain sort of grim humor , which shows that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has indeed developed .

		`` John Charity , '' by Mr.
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	, is a story that seems to have been written with an eye to the English public , and comes to our table heralded by a chorus of English critical trumpet - ings .

		And the opening chapters , placed in
England	LOCATION	, are so cleverly written in the familiar style of the English novel of adventure that it is not easy to realize that we are plunging into a story of Amer - ican life by a typically American novelist .

		Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	needs no introduction to our readers .

		We have had the pleasure of praising his earlier work ; we now have the pleasure of praising the present strong and well-constructed romance .

		It deals with
California	LOCATION	-- the
California	LOCATION	of the years just before the American occupation , the
California	LOCATION	of
Alva	PERSON	- rado and
Vallejo	LOCATION	, of aristocratic Spaniards and Mexican intriguers , of sen -RRB- ritas and vaqueros and priests .

		It is a highly colored romance , and its outcome is essentially tragic .

		The figure of
Alva	PERSON	- rado himself is studied with much skill and sym - pathy , while the appearance of
Thomas Larkin	PERSON	as one of the minor characters provides a suggestion of what is soon in store for the unhappy province , and casts a sort of prophetic tinge over the narra - tive .

		The '' American Novel Series , '' started by one of our most respected publishing houses at the begin - ning of the current year , and planned to include a new volume for every month of the twelve , is at - tracting much attention by the excellence of the books presented .

		The first two volumes of the series were reviewed by us some time ago , and were productions distinctly above the average of current fiction ; the volumes that have followed have proved to be better yet , and the promises made for the undertaking have been more than justified . ''

		Mar - tin Brook , '' by Mr.
Morgan Bates	PERSON	, is the first of the new issues to demand our attention .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	is a veteran journalist of the West , and has achieved some success as a playright , but this is tbe first novel from his pen that has come to our notice .

		Com - bining , as it does , the skill of the practiced writer with the refined experience of life that comes from many years of observation , it is a book that com - mands consideration , and deserves high praise .

		It is essentially a story of middle
New York	LOCATION	in the middle period of the century , with the Abolitionist agitation and Methodist revivalism for its distin - guishing features .

		We might have spared the latter of the two .

		which rather weakens the story , for its strength is found in its reproduction of the moral fervor of the movement in behalf of the slave -- its reanimation of the spirit of a time that to readers of the younger generation must seem to have been a part of the dark ages .

		It is well in these days of slackened national will and degraded political ideals that those years of storm and stress should be Titalized for us as has been done by Mr.
Bates	PERSON	; we need the contagion of the earnest and uncompro - mising spirit with which slavery was fought in the forties and fifties to arouse us to a sense of duties of our own time .

		The madness of imperialism that has taken possession of our people during these later years calls for a moral crusade as determined and as self-sacrificing as that in which our fathers were enlisted half a century ago .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	has written a novel of one figure , and almost of one idea .

		We have spoken of the idea ; let us say of the figure that it depicts a hero worthy of the championship for which he stands , a strong , simple , manly char - acter , whose development we follow from childhood up , and whose devotion to a sacred cause enlists our warmest sympathies all through the period of strife , and up to the final triumph of the idea to which all his energies have been devoted .

		Inci - dentally , we would like to say that the book reminds as in many ways of the best work of the late
Harold Frederic	PERSON	.

		It is not merely that it introduces us once more to the environment of central
New York	LOCATION	during the war period ; the resemblance goes beyond that , and includes the exhibition of many intellectual and moral traits that the author has in common with his late fellow journalist and fellow - worker in the field of fictitious narrative .


New York	LOCATION	is the scene of still another of the novels of the series now under review , but in the case of Mr.
E. W. Townsend	PERSON	's '' Days Like These , '' it is the city , not
the State	ORGANIZATION	, which circumscribes the field of interest .

		This is the first appearance of the creator of
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	in the character of a full-fledged novelist , and even those who have ad - mired him the most for his studies of metropolitan low life are likely to be surprised by the versatility of the present work , and by the resources at its writer 's command .

		The habit of journalism is in - imical to the cultivation of literary grace , and the finer qualities of style are still beyond Mr.
Town	PERSON	- send 's reach .

		But journalism has also its virtues , and '' Days Like These '' makes the most of them .

		surplusage .

		It is a story of marked realism , which is , however , of the good compressed sort , not the sort that runs to cataloguing and the multiplication of irrelevant and uninteresting detail .

		The story is compounded in about equal measures of the two sharply contrasting elements of
New York	LOCATION	society -- the life of the slums and the life of the regions in which wealth and refinement hold sway .

		Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	is intimately acquainted with both fields , and considers them equally interesting as subjects for the exercise of literary art .

		On the whole , his millionaires are somewhat less convincing than his ruffians and other figures of the slums , but all are studied carefully enough to excite and hold our attention , besides being brought into interesting re - lations by means of an exceptionally well-contrived plot .

		As a study of the various elements that enter into the social structure of the great city the book has more than superficial truth ; it seems to us to exhibit an unusual degree of social penetration .

		It is satirical , after the manner of Thackeray -- or , to take a closer parallel , after the manner of Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's trilogy of
New York	LOCATION	novels , -- but its shafts are not poisoned , and the author is prompt to give credit to the generous qualities that are somewhere stirring in the most selfish or depraved of his creations .

		He considers environment and education , rather than inherited viciousness , to be responsible for most forms of wrong living , and takes pleasure in discovering a soul of good in things and lives of the most evil seeming .

		He has written a strong human novel , faithful to the life with which it deals , enlivened by dry humor and dramatic incident , optimistic in temper , and free from explicit moralizing . ''

		Days Like These '' is one of the very best novels of the year .

		The third book in this series still remaining for notice is the work of a woman .

		Miss
Geraldine Anthony	PERSON	, and is entitled '' A Victim of Circum - stances . ''

		It is , like the one last mentioned , a story of
New York	LOCATION	society , although the action takes place largely at a country house on the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		We regret that so poor a book should have found admission to the series .

		It is not only amateurish in construction , with characters so much alike that it is almost impossible to disentangle them , but its substance is the merest frothiness , being dialogue empty of thought and chronicled doings devoid of the least vital human interest .

		A sort of cheap and slangy brilliancy is the cachet of this produc - tion , which represents about the lowest depth of vapidity that the novel of fashionable society is capable of reaching . ''

		The
Heritage of Unrest	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Miss
Gwendolen Overton	PERSON	, is a vividly realized narrative of the
Southwest	LOCATION	-- the Apache country -- in the days of Geronimo and Crook .

		The heroine is a waif of mixed Indian and American blood , adopted as a sort of ward by an army officer , who eventually makes her his wife .

		The study of her character , in which the savage instincts now and then find their way to the surface , despite the most thorough - going discipline in the ways of civilization , is ex - ceedingly well done , and makes us look forward with some eagerness to further work by this new writer .

		This is the personal sense in which the title of the book is justified ; but in a wider sense , the '' heritage of unrest '' may be taken as meaning ^ the national heritage that comes to us from our blundering and dishonorable treatment of our Indian wards .

		The writer is unsparing in her de - nunciation of our course toward these unfortunate creatures , and a fine contrast is afforded between the steadfast devotion of our soldiers to their task of stern repression , and the folly , or worse , that has really been responsible for the chief difficulties .

		.

		The scene of this story is not strictly that which Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	has made his own , but it is nearly enough that scene to invite a comparison , and this comparison may be best made by simply stating ^ that Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's work might be something like thia if it were stripped of humor and romantic glamour .

		The evident note of Miss
Overton	PERSON	's work is a rather bare realism , but we must respect it , for it is based upon a close acquaintance with the scene and the period .

		The
American Colonial	ORGANIZATION	period has proved unex - pectedly rich in the material for romantic fiction .

		Its annals are dull and uninteresting only to the undiscerning eye , and we have had of late numerous illustrations of the fact that it needs but a touch of the imagination to light up the history of our na - tional beginnings , and to awaken our deepest inter - est in the life of those early days .

		The latest novel to deal with this period is one of the best that have yet been produced ; it is entitled `` The Making of
Christopher Ferringham	PERSON	, '' and is the work of
Miss Beulah Marie Dix	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	is the scene of this story , and the time is that just preceding the Restoration .

		Christopher is a young Cavalier , possessed alike of the vices and the generous qualities of his class , sent to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	after the defeat of his cause , and placed under the tutelage of his uncle , a Puritan magistrate .

		His conduct is a stumbling-block and an offence to the godly townsfolk of
Meadowcreek	LOCATION	, and he seems , indeed , to be about as graceless a scamp as is often found anywhere .

		There is a young woman , how - ever , in his uncle 's family whose sympathies turn toward him in spite of herself , and it is his love for her that gradually transforms his character , and redeems him from his reckless mode of life .

		As the title informs us , the story is of Christopher 's '' making , '' by dint of his love and of the discipli - nary environment against which he vainly chafes .

		After a long series of escapades and exciting ad - ventures , he grows up to be a man in the best sense of the word , and is happilv united to the young woman who has been his good angel .

		The author 's study of the Puritan life and character is both painstaking and just .

		She does not spare its un - lovely aspects , but she recognizes at the same time its strength , and even the humanity that remains at its heart , in spite of its stern repression of most

		THE DIAL .

		29 of the Dataral instincts .

		Miss Dix has given as a deeply interesting book , rich in incident , and full - blooded in sympathy .

		It has about equal value as a - work of fiction and as a historical study of what is perhaps the most fascinating phase of our colonial experience .

		Miss
A. C. Laut	PERSON	's '' Lords of the North '' is a rather striking story of adventure in
British America	LOCATION	during the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		It has for its subject the rivalry between the two great fur-trading companies of the North , and pre - sents a vivid picture of the daring enterprise and reckless deeds of the men who were engaged in exploiting the commercial resources of the wilder - ness that stretches westward from
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay .

		There is enough of private interest and delineation of individual figures to furnish forth an interesting narrative , but the epic character of the struggle is what chiefly impresses the reader -- that , and the spacious atmosphere of the work , with the zest of living that such surroundings inspire .

		Of Miss
Margaret Potter	PERSON	's ' • The
House of Mailly	ORGANIZATION	'' we must say , in substance , what we said of her '' Uncanonized '' of last year .

		It is a work that exhibits a remarkable mastery of the required historical material , as well as the most painstaking construction .

		There is still much surplusage in the form of dialogue and description , making the nar - rative too slow in its movement , and depriving the reader of the sort of breathless excitement which he has a right to expect from a historical romance .

		The period is the
France of Louis XV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the reign in the royal favor of
Madame de Chateau	ORGANIZATION	- roux .

		The day of the Pompadour has not yet dawned , although that remarkable woman appears in the closing chapters .

		The hero is a nobleman who aspires to the love of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's favorite , and thereby incurs the royal displeasure .

		Banished from
Versailles	LOCATION	, with permission to return when he shall bring a wife with him , he goes to the Amer - ican colonies , and for about a third of the book the scene is laid in
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		This agreeable diversification is very well contrived , and the chap - ters that keep us in
Baltimore	LOCATION	are , on the whole , the pleasantest of all .

		A colonial maiden is intro - duced , and in her love the wounded heart of the hero finds solace .

		The final section of the story takes us again to the French court , where the beauty of the American countess wins instant ap - plause .

		This young woman has made a study of alkaloid poisons , and her special knowledge of the subject is turned to ingenious account .

		This sounds more melodramatic than it really is , but the use made of the episode , although skilfully contrived , introduces a hopelessly incongruous element into the romance .

		If we ask just what is lacking to this book of Miss
Potter	PERSON	's , with all its admirable qualities of description and characterization , the answer is easily provided by Miss
Bertha Runkle	PERSON	's '' The Helmet of Navarre . ''

		In this book we find the true spirit of romantic adventure , and just the sort of construc - tive skill that Miss
Potter	PERSON	has yet to learn .

		This is a book that one wants to read straight through ; the other is one of which the reading can be broken off almost anywhere , to be resumed at convenience , and without the sort of impatient expectation that is so considerable an element in the novel-reader 's delight .

		One thinks more of the story itself than of the painful conscientiousness of the telling , and we trust that with a little more practice in her art Miss
Potter	PERSON	will learn this secret also . ''

		The Hel - met of Navarre '' deals with the most fascinating period of French history , with the
League	ORGANIZATION	, and the B ^ arnais , and
Mayenne	LOCATION	.

		Many as have been the previous uses of this romantic material .

		Miss
Runkle	PERSON	's story manages to preserve the qualities of freshness and charm .

		It has amateurish qualities as well -- among them a fondness for bits of French which are usually more accurate than the souvent homme trahie which makes its luckless appearance in two or three cases , -- but it certainly is a remark - able work for a beginner , and one who is a young girl at that .

		Mr.
Christopher St John	PERSON	's novel , '' The Crimson Weed , '' takes its text from one of
Bacon	LOCATION	's essays . ''

		Revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more man 's nature runs to , the more ought law to weed it out . ''

		It is this crimson weed of vengeance , grow - ing up in the life of a man , the child of dishonor , that we are called upon to consider in the present instance .

		The hero is a youth of mixed Italian and English parentage , who learns the secret of his origin when he has come to manhood , and whose mind is almost wrecked by the discovery .

		His Italian mother is still living , an artist upon the lyrical stage , and his father is a prosperous English Academician .

		The hero himself has the tempera - ment of genius , and has developed remarkable apti - tudes for both musical and literary composition .

		But he so broods over the thought of the wrong that has been done him through his unhappy mother that he grows well-nigh distracted at the contrast between her life of bitterness and the worldly pros - perity of the man who deserted her so many years ago .

		He is on the point of taking vengeance into his own hands , when fate intervenes and puts an end to the scoundrel who has caused all the misery .

		The story is skilfully-constructed , and its pitch of passion is almost unrelieved from first to last .

		In the end , the blasted lives of mother and son ar6 restored to something like sanity , and the stormy prelude finds a peaceful close .

		It was inevitable that the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair should suggest a theme to some enterprising novelist , and we are glad that so clever a craftsman as Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	should have been the one to find inspira - tion in that tragedy of real life . ''

		Our Lady of Deliverance '' is the title of his story , which tells how a French officer is degraded and exiled through the personal malice of a rejected suitor for his sister 's hand -LRB- and fortune -RRB- , how an adventurous English - man falls in love with the sister and espouses the cause of her brother 's rehabilitation , how the neces - 30 THE DIAL
July 1	DATE	, sary pooof of his innocence is brought to light , the victim freed , and the villain circumvented .

		It is all made into a thrilling sort of narrative , with plenty of subsidiary incident , local character study , and general animation .

		It is not as good a story as Mr.
Oxenham	PERSON	is capable of writing , but it serves the purposes of entertainment so well that we will refrain from carping criticism .

		Dr.
William Barry	PERSON	is proving himself a novelist of admirable parts and amazing versatility .

		The religious and ethical prepossessions of his first books , `` The New Antigone '' and `` The Two Standards , '' gave place in ''
Arden Massiter	PERSON	'' to the romantic spirit of modern life as illustrated by the conditions of nineteenth-century Italian history , and that point has in turn given place to the Celtic glamour in `` The Wizard 's Knot , '' the author 's latest work of fiction .

		In this book we have the Irishman -- more or less concealed from view in Dr.
Barry	PERSON	's earlier books , -- with his sense of the haunting mysteries of the elements , his passionate attachment to his legendary birthright , and his primitive passions .

		The story itself is not without interest , but these extra-fictional qualities , which might be exhibited almost as well without attempt - ing to tell a story , are what give to '' The Wizard 's Knot '' its deepest charm .

		The author 's crisp and brilliant style , scholarly but without affectation , is a source of unfailing satisfaction , and would lend distinction to a much duller narrative .

		We do not place this book quite as high as ''
Arden Massiter	PERSON	, '' all things considered , but it remains nevertheless a noteworthy production .

		Mr.
Charles Marriott	PERSON	is a new writer , and his first novel , '' The Column , '' has been hailed in En - gland as a remarkable work .

		It is a novel of almost purely psychological interest , written in a style that arrests attention and occasionally puzzles it .

		There is a tendency toward something like preciosity in many of the sentences which consti - tutes Mr.
Marriott	PERSON	's chief defect as a stylist .

		Such a sentence as the following , while not so bad as to deserve the title of Meredithian , is not to be de - fended upon any theory of lucid construction . ''

		In spite of the pilloried names of sentimental history , and the prosier , though in a sense not less stimu - lating , records of the daily press , there still survives a popular and pathetic fallacy that the amateur of hearts abandons his desipience at the altar . ''

		It is only fair , however , to say that this is an extreme illustration of the author 's morbid shrinking from the forms of common-place utterance .

		As a rule , he succeeds in being perspicacious without reverting to hackneyed forms of expression .

		The work as a whole is amazingly clever , and its power of present - ing ideas and situations by means of suggestion rather than exposition is one of its most salient characteristics .

		The opening pages afford an excel - lent illustration of this feature of the book , and others may be found in abundance .

		Sometimes the suggestiveness is of such a kind as to stir into vibration the deepest chords of our consciousness .

		We must illustrate our meaning by an extract , premising that
Cathcart	PERSON	is a sculptor who lives in his own ideal world , making no concessions to the fashions of the hour , and that
Johnnie	PERSON	is a simple youth serving his apprenticeship in the art of the master . '' '

		Some of us , ' continued
Cathcart	PERSON	, ' have to stick up a motto to remind us of -- things ; but it 's better to have a live goddess .

		Have you ever read Dante ? '

		`` Johnnie made the unnecessary statement that he had not . '' '

		Well ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	wasn ' t a particularly happy sort of chap , -- a bit raw in places , and things hurt .

		When he was quite a youngster , he happened to see a little girl named
Beatrice	PERSON	.

		Nothing came of it , you know ; she grew up and married another fellow , -- very decent sort , I believe .

		Now Dante didn * t go bleating about or take to drink , or anything .

		He happened to be a poet ; and whatever be wrote be felt he had the eyes of Beatrice on him .

		His biggest work is all about Heaven and Hell , and it all leads up to
Beatrice	LOCATION	.

		It ' a done in such a way , you know , that the husband couldn ' t pos - sibly object ; in fact , be would feel proud , if he was anything of a sort .

		She died , you know , before
Dante	PERSON	wrote it ; but that did n't make any difference . ' ''

		Cathcart stared at the blank wall , and
Johnnie	PERSON	had a shrewd suspicion that there were others to whom death did n't make any difference . ''

		The book has for its heroine a girl of Greek - English parentage , an elemental creature of earth and air , who embodies an ideal of simple and wholesome living that is almost lost to our sophisti - cated civilization .

		Such a creature is not to be mated by a man of modern mould , and the tragedy of the book is found in her union with a man of superficial culture , a prattler about books and music , who can have no real sympathy with so sane and natural a character as hers .

		We think the author rather evades the difficulty of his problem , when it is once fully presented , by disposing of his heroine in such summary fashion , but we can appreciate the difficulty of his search for a logical outcome to so hopeless a situation .

Miss Maud Howard Peterson	PERSON	has g ^ ven an inter - national interest to '' The

		The ar - gument turns on the honor -- in the soldier 's sense -- of one of the two British officers , the American girl 's interest in both of them being almost equally balanced until one of them is proved unworthy .

		The manner in which he redeems himself in a cholera camp in
India	LOCATION	is well told , and the novel is much above the average in conception and execution .


Browning	PERSON	's poem of '' The
Potter	PERSON	's Wheel '' serves as a preface to the book , and the feeling in it is carried through the story .

		In selecting the time of
Shays	ORGANIZATION	's Rebellion in
1786	DATE	for the period of '' The Duke of Stockbridge '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the late
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	gave himself an opportunity to show with what difficulty the common people , who fought and won the Revolutionary War , reconciled themselves to the government by the rich and self-seeking which they had been forced to over - throw in good part in order to secure national inde - pendence .

		None of his former books show the author to such good advantage in the literary sense , and the work has merit as successfully interpreting the feeling of the period it deals with .

		It is an interesting and valuable contribution to the g ^ wing list of worthy American novels .

		Mr.
George Gibbs	PERSON	has written , and illustrated him - self , a novel dealing with the war between the French and Spanish in
Florida	LOCATION	and the vicinity , entitling it , `` In Search of Mademoiselle '' -LRB-
H. T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a great advance on the sea stories for boys which have heretofore formed Mr.
Gibbs	PERSON	's only contribution to literature , the selection of characters and time show - ing excellent judgment and the treatment being most interesting .

		The hero is an English youth who falls in love with a charming French girl of noble birth , whose family is devoted to the reformed religion .

		When the girl goes to the
New World	LOCATION	with others of her fellow-believers , the English youth is not far be - hind .

		In the story history and romance are pleasantly combined , and the pictures from the author 's pencil are really interpretive and attractive .

		Comparisons are odious , and that which the publishers institute between Mr.
F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	's new book ''
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	-- Comedian '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- and his earlier '' The Jessamy Bride '' seems to confirm the adage .

		A pleasant and seemly work , the later novel yet lacks the literary charm of the earlier one , and the sweet pathos which attaches itaelf so readily to the memory of Gold - smith is almost wholly wanting in the account of the rollicking
Nell	PERSON	.

		The story ends cheerfully , and the flavor throughout is that of a corrupt court and none too strict a stage .

		The tender romance so predominant in Mrs.
Kath	PERSON	- arine
Tynan Hinkson	PERSON	's former stories is not lacking in `` A Daughter of the Fields '' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which contains an excellent portrait of a young Irish girl , poor and proud , who returns from an education in
France	LOCATION	to conditions at home which force her into the active management of a farm .

		Her landlord is young , and in a short time ardent .

		The struggle between love and duty , and the continual interplay of sentiment , make the story sweet and true .

		It is a pleasant con - tribution to our knowledge of Irish country life .

		It is interesting to learn that there are more Uni - tarians in
Transylvania	LOCATION	than in the
United States	LOCATION	, and that the title of Dr.
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	's novel ''
Manasseh	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is `` Egy az Isten '' : One is the Lord , in the original .

		The translator from the original Hungarian , Mr.
Percy Favor Bicknell	PERSON	, relates these facts in his frank Preface , explaining also that he has greatly shortened and simplified his version as compared with Dr.
Jokai	PERSON	's own .

		What remains is nevertheless a well constructed story of love and war , replete with incident belligerent and romantic , and given added valne by the knowledge that there were in
Europe	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	men and women who were willing to shed their blood for that rational belief which is the finality of the Ref - ormation .

		America knows the Unitarian militant , bat rather as a moral than a physical force .

		Race distinct - ions between many conflicting peoples are here well drawn , and the work deserves a careful reading .


Maryland	LOCATION	is coming into its own with the colonial romancer -- Mr.
William Henry Babcock	PERSON	's '' The Tower of Wye '' -LRB-
H. T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- being the fourth or fifth story this year dealing with that pleasant common - wealth .

		We should like to see the one salient fact of the
Maryland	LOCATION	settlement , the proclamation of religions toleration for the first time in modem history , given more attention ; but Mr.
Babcock	PERSON	has chosen , instead , to emphasize the quarrels between the followers of
Lord Baltimore	LOCATION	and Secretary
Claiborne	PERSON	.

		It can not be doubted that his selection enables him to keep more closely within the limits set by convention for the co - lonial romance ; and he has done even better in making the wonderfnlness of the
New World	LOCATION	, as it appeared to these emigrant Englishmen , one of the notes of his argument .

		Too much episode not strictly connected with the development of her plot keeps Mrs.
Lacy Cleaver Mc	PERSON	-

Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- from being the story it might have been made .

		The yoang man she introdaces as her hero is a deputy

		He falls in love with a pretty girl of somewhat lower social status than himself , and the discovery of the '' moonshiner '' and the final surrender of the maiden to his suit come together in the closing chapter .

		The interval is filled up with stories of the war between the
States	LOCATION	, with the lynching of a negro in which all the '' best '' citizens of the countryside take part , and with adventures of several sorts .

		Few minor characters in history lend themselves bet - ter to a certain sort of romance than that of
John Gif	PERSON	- ford , who turned from being a cavalier officer to a pastorship in one of the straightest sects of his day , numbering
Charles Stuart	PERSON	and
John Banyan	PERSON	among his friends at the two extremes of his life .

Cotes	ORGANIZATION	, the author , is better known to both American and English readers as
Sarah Jeanette Duncan	PERSON	; and the chief value of her latest book lies in the new-world eyes with which she regards the rulers of the Indian Empire in the mountain resort which enables them to escape the heat of the plains , Mrs.
Cotes	PERSON	planted in her ''
Crow	PERSON	's Nest '' the seeds of a species of golden - rod that she had brought with her from
America	LOCATION	, and the account of the favorable reception accorded the new delicacy by the bees and butterflies makes inter - esting reading .

		It is somewhat anomalous to come upon a book which is almost wholly lacking in distinction so far as diction is concerned , yet shows from one cover to the other marked originality in the choice of its subject matter .

		Miss
Edith WyaU	PERSON	's `` Every One His Own Way '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made up of a series of instantaneous photographs of
Chicago	LOCATION	life , the subjects drawn largely from the points of contact between the older American and the newer foreign society of the city .

		Just as a kodak may grasp and bold a scene in which an artist finds delight , so Miss
Wyatt	PERSON	sets down little episodes of more than ordinary value to literature ; though , as in the case of the artist and the kodak , the means of conveying the episode hardly rises to the dignity of art .

		There is a tendency to mere clever - ness , too , which needs to be subdued ; yet the book is in many ways one to deserve attention .

		There is always danger of preciousness in the writings of Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, and `` The Love Letters of the King ; or , The Life Romantic '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not free from this fault .

		It is , indeed , the sort of book that only a poet -- a minor poet -- could write , filled with little love lyrics in a species of vers libre , and flavored with a transcendental passion , a love of love for love 's sake and not at all for the sake of the beloved .

		The moral , however , is wholesome , for the mild-mannered hero succeeds in divesting himself of the rather silly affair which fills up most of the pages and marrying a worthy woman .

		The style is rambling , but not incoherent .

		More than ordinary regret will be felt after reading '' The Grapes of Wrath '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that the author of the book , the late
Mary Harriott Norris	PERSON	, should have been taken away in what is evidently her intellectual and literary maturity .

		The story is an un - usually powerful one , concerning itself wholly with the period of the Civil War , and depicting life in a
New Jersey	LOCATION	village , at a
Virginia	LOCATION	country seat , among a secret settlement of contrabands , during the denudation of the
Shenandoah Valley	LOCATION	, and in
Richmond	LOCATION	just before and after its surrender .

		Apart from the broad opportunities thus given to interpret history , there is admirable de - velopment of character shown throughout the book , and the intricate romance element is well handled .

		The book is impressive and artistic .

		When Garcilaso de la
Vega	PERSON	discovered that his name was not in '' Who 's Who in

		As a result , after many years of further adventure he accumulated the material which
Miss J. Breckenridge Ellis	PERSON	has now set forth in her `` Garcilaso '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The narrative is a trifle uncertain in its pronouns , running from the first to the third person and back with bewildering speed , but it is sufficiently inclusive to take in a fight with a Moor , a voyage with
Columbus	LOCATION	, and several other things of the sort .

		There is an admirably contrived love-story along with the adventure .

		A careful study of character , the hero being a Jesuit priest who becomes one of that gallant band of mission - aries which Farkman celebrates , supplies the framework of Miss
Anna Farquhar	PERSON	's '' The Devil 's Flough '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , additional material for a background being drawn from the French Court of
Anne	PERSON	of

		While there is enough of the sword-and - cloak in the book to give it interest , the soul of it lies deeper than mere striking incident , and the develop - ment of
Gaston L'Artanges	PERSON	the roysterer , into Father
Gaston	PERSON	the missionary priest , is worth following .

		Though
New France	LOCATION	figures only in the concluding chapter , it affords a fitting close to a story of real merit .

		It is an account of a newspaper man , his delightfully feminine wife , and their quaint little son , all of whom move into the rural districts for the purpose of making money by not spending it .

		Everything happens at just the right time and in not quite the right way , but still with an ordered intelli - gence that sets the account of it in a world by itself .

		The contrast between the city man and the real farmer , the curious twist to the episodes , and the generally wholesomeness of Mr.
Preston	PERSON	's work , make his book a welcome addition to our
summer	DATE	reading .

		Easily surpassing all her previous work in merit is Mrs.
Schuyler Crowninshield	PERSON	's ''
Valencia	ORGANIZATION	's Garden '' -LRB- McClure -RRB- .

		The story is that of a little American maid educated in
France	LOCATION	, out of all knowledge of her native land , and married in a purely conventional way to a man old enough almost to be her grandfather , himself in love with a woman of his own age .

		Valencia has the most striking adventures , even though she is so far out of the work-a-day world in her husband 's old French chateau as to seem cloistered .

		The book is conspicuous in an almost insistent use of the French language .

		A real South African novel , not connected with the war between
Britain	LOCATION	and the burghers , is welcome at this time , especially when it has nothing to do with racial prejudice .

		Such a book is to be found in '' A Daughter of the Veldt '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by a new writer , Mr.
Basil Marnan	PERSON	.

		From it may be derived more of the facts concerning the factors now at work in that distant land than from many veracious histories , -- Kaffirs ,
Boers	PERSON	, and Britons appearing as they do in life , without exaggeration of either faults and virtues .

		The heroine is a girl reared in complete ignorance of her parents , though the striking prologue serves to indicate them to the reader .

		The manner in which , through her own sweetness and strength of character , she finally comes into the heritage she deserves , is excellently told , and the novel is a really striking one .

		Modern realism and historical romance are the two extremes which Mr.
Louis Evan Shipman	PERSON	has touched in his former writings , and his latest volume , '' The Curious Courtship of
Kate Poins	PERSON	'' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , arranges itself in the latter category .

		It is '' a romance of the regency , '' dealing with English society in the days of
Beau Brummell	PERSON	and his friend 's '' fat friend . ''

		Duels there are in plenty , and the outcome of the somewhat surprising wooing given the piquant heroine is made doubtful enough to satisfy the most ardent lover of suspense .

		Vivacity , and an exaggerated courtesy already old-fashioned , add to the attractiveness of the book .

		Mrs.
Reginald de Koven	PERSON	has aspired to high things in her story of Artaxerxes Lougimanus , called '' By the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		33 Waters of Babylon '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a tragical work with the final catastrophe omitted , a great deal of atmosphere whereby the luxury and ferocity of the day find interpretation , and an admirable plot , failing only in consistency through the failure to carry the tragedy on to a logical close .

		It shows great im - provement in method and manner over Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	's earlier book , though the style is not to be commended so highly as that of her translation of
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's '' An
Iceland	LOCATION	Fisherman . ''

		Mr.
Payne Erskine	PERSON	in '' When the Gates Lift up Their Heads '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has painted two characters , one of them a bright , ambitious , educated young gentleman , the heir to an aristocratic and wealthy g ^ ndmother , and the other a colored barber with a certain amount of energy but much more vanity and desire for show , -- leaving the reader to discover at the close that the two , as in
Mark Twain	PERSON	's book , were de - liberately exchanged soon after birth by the mother of the colored one .

		The book brings up a series of re - flections concerning environment which make it worthy of consideration , though it is rather more ambitious than successful when viewed as a work of art .

		The infamous treatment of American prisoners on board the floating prisons which
England	LOCATION	used for their retention during the Revolutionary War provides the leading episode in Mrs.
Sara B. Kennedy	PERSON	's '' Joscelyn Cheshire '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , her hero 's escape from it being sufficiently exciting to make the reader draw a deep sigh of relief when the pursued one is safe at last .

		The heroine , by way of variation from the prevailing type , is not a patriot , but a rabid little Tory .

		The heroine who lends her name to Mr.
Justin Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	's ''
Monouia	PERSON	, A Love Story of ` Forty - Eight '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is herself named from the province of
Munster	LOCATION	, as that word was anciently trans - lated into Latin .

		She is a finely drawn conception , and her father , brother , and lover , with whom the argument is chiefly concerned , share that distinction with her .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	is able to view the events of which he was formerly a part with the dispassionate eye of age . ''

		A Novel of Modern Diplomacy , '' the sub-title of Mr.
David Dwight Wells	PERSON	's `` Parlous Times '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , describes the volume with accuracy .

		A man has done a wicked thing , and its results follow him to the bitter end ; while two women , with character - istically uncertain motives and certain affections , serve to keep the catastrophe in doubt until the close .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	shows strength as well as skill in the handling of his unusual material .

		A curious proof of the popular acceptance of Diedrieh Knickerbocker 's veracious '' History of
New York	LOCATION	from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty '' is to be found in the '' publisher 's note '' pre - fixed to Mrs.
Jessie Van Zile Belden	PERSON	's '' Antonia '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein a careful explanation is made of the fact ` that early days in
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	were not lacking in the strenuous life .

		The novel is not , perhaps , the best proof of it , for , though there is an abundance of exciting incident , the story is told with a blandness which does not stir the blood .

		Ptwsibly it is the better
summer	DATE	story on that account .

		Through a misapprehension regarding the meaning of the word `` ' Maori , '' the fact that the scene of '' Another Woman 's Territory '' -LRB-
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is laid in
Australia	LOCATION	does not become apparent for some time .


New Zealand	LOCATION	being the most probable spot for Maori geo - graphical names to obtain currency .

		This apart , '' Alien '' has written a story of much force , involving great ques - tions of honesty and intellectual integrity , dealing with the development of a strong man 's character , and show - ing an insight into the feminine heart which stamps the author 's sex .

		That there should be so little flavor of the antipodes in the book , after all , simply goes to show that the problems worked out in it are not those of any one place or time , but of universal application . ''

		The Career of a Beauty '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a trifle disappointing , for all ''
John Strange Winter	ORGANIZATION	's '' author - ship of it .

		The book begins with one of those miscel - laneous families for which the author is famous , and this part is really the best of the story .

		When it gets to be a question of the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, so seriously overworked by British novelists of late , with a little telepathy run in for variety , the story becomes less fascinating .

		How closely the two branches of the English-speaking race on the passing frontiers of
America	LOCATION	and on the existing frontiers of
Australia	LOCATION	run together is made apparent through '' The Wisdom of Esau '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Messrs.
C. H. Chumley	PERSON	and
R. H. Outhwaite	PERSON	.

		The book is most readable , portraying as it does a bush fire -- the antipodean equivalent of our prairie fire , -- and , on the spiritual side , the play of almost unrestrained passion in a rude and pastoral civilization .

		It calls to mind the breadth of the literary field afforded by the continent of
Australia	LOCATION	, and how novel it all is so far as American readers are concerned .

		Though `` A Colonial Cavalier '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is assuredly a romance of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, its author , Mr.
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	, is a writer of too much skill to turn his argument upon matters of mere history .

		He provides an admirable background of fact , and his two young gentlemen and their two young ladies disport themselves before it with great vivacity and good humor . ''


Jack	PERSON	, '' one of his heroines , is a really lovable concep - tion .

		It is a pleasant story of Southern life daring troublous times .

		Mr.
Morgan Robertson	PERSON	has followed his saccessfnl volume of sea-tales by a more ambitious and extended work , '' Masters of Men , A Story of the
New Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Pag ^ & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Those who recall his earlier yarn of an officer and enlisted man in the service of the
United States	LOCATION	, who were '' shanghaied '' on one of those disgraces to the American flag which are known to sailors as '' hell-ships , '' will find the same theme used for the central episode of this novel .

		It is as engrossing as any book recently written for fully two-thirds of its length , and it begins to lose there because of the imagined need of bringing girls and love into the argument .

		We think Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is a writer sufiB - ciently picturesque and graphic to tell a rattling g ^ ood story without this element of romance .

		A sensational story which serves as the frame for an intelligent and instructive dissertation on important questions of the day has been written by Mr.
Frederick Upham Adams	PERSON	with the title , '' The Kidnapped Million - aires '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- .

		A wealthy young
New Yorker	ORGANIZATION	, who has taken up modern journalism for the fun in it , kid - naps the six richest men in the
United States	LOCATION	and con - veys them to a deserted spot which proves to be on the
Gulf	LOCATION	coast of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The party discuss financial and other topics with considerable acumen and entire free - dom , the views advanced being occasionally wild , but always intelligent .

		The book succeeds in conveying the bustle and eagerness which characterize a modem u THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, newspaper office to a really remarkable extent , and is both interesting and amusing .

		No one but a poet who has lived close to the heart of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	could have written such a book as '' The Heart of the Ancient Wood '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, its author , is to be con - gratulated for having so successfully translated the de - light of life in the wilds into literature .

		He has succeed - ed in doing a most difficult thing in this ; and one even more difficult in making sympathy for the brute cre - ation a sufficient rival to a human suitor in a woman 's love .

		The name of Mr.
Ellis Meredith	PERSON	is not known to the reader , but his tale of a modern
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' The Master-Knot of Human Fate '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , deserves attention none the less on that account .

		It is the story of a man and a woman left on an island after a cataclysm which has submerged nearly all the world except that part of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	on which they happen to be standing at the time .

		As Crusoe in his ship , so they , in a little house which survives to them , find the means for supporting life .

		The book has unusual merit , and the faults in it , such as that of insistent quotation , are abundantly criticized by the characters themselves .

		Mr.
Joseph Sharts	PERSON	shows a painstaking and a literary grasp that deserve encouragement , in his ''
Ezra Caine	PERSON	'' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though the book contains the autobiography of a maniacal murderer -- as displeasing a subject as could well be chosen .

		Brief as the story is , it still contrives to leave the impression that if such a person were to write down his inmost thought this is surely the manner in which he would do it .

		Credit for originality belongs to Ihe author , -- although the hor - ror essential to the narration keeps it from attaining any great height .

		War is always fascinating , even in its horrors ; and it may be surmised that the war of the American Revo - lution , being fought for as nearly just a cause as war may have on this earth , is popular on both accounts . ''

		Clay - ton Halowell '' -LRB-
R. F. Fenno & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Francis W. Van Praag	PERSON	, obtains more attention than war in its usual forms may command , because the plot turns so largely on the attempt of the hero to ferret out the treason which made Benedict Arnold infamous .

		A compound love-story runs through the book , with much plotting and counterplotting .

		Hypnotism of the most pronounced variety is the mystery behind `` The Mysterious Burglar '' -LRB-
F. M. Buckles & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and with that for the turning-point of his artless narrative Mr.
George E. Walsh	PERSON	contrives to keep his readers in doubt through the greater part of the story .

		The account is put in the mouth of a pro- fessional burglar who has been taken into the service of the mysterious one .

		Something seems incongruous in the latter 's proceedings , so the real burglar turns detective and eventually proves the truth of an adage too old to require repetition .

		The story holds the atten - tion and makes small demand on faculties likely to be benumbed by hot weather .

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's story of the
Mohawk Valley	LOCATION	during the Revolutionary campaign that led to the sur - render at
Saratoga	LOCATION	is called `` The Son of a Tory '' -LRB-
R. G. Badger & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and has rare merit among books of its kind .

		Its characters are alive , and bear a close resemblance to the men and women we know to-day .

		Nearly every historical romance read in late years em - phasizes the differences between the people of its day and those of ours ; Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	has preferred , rather , to lay stress upon the likenesses .

		Apart from the inter - esting episodes which follow the history of that time with substantial accuracy , this choice of treatment gives the book real distinction .

		Nothing has ever been gained by setting Revolutionary characters and Revolutionary times off by themselves ; much is to be gained by bring - ing them together .

		Our ancestors were men and women of like passions with ourselves ; and we can be grateful to the author for having shown them exactly as they were .

		Mr.
Clive Holland	PERSON	's '' Mousm ^ '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- has the good fortune to appear as the sequel to an earlier suc - cess , '' My Japanese Wife . ''

		The history of the little geisha girl is carried on from the time of her wedding , through a journey to
England	LOCATION	, and an enforced return to
Japan	LOCATION	due to the difficulties of the British climate .

		Mr.
Holland	PERSON	's book is an excellent antidote to
M. Pierre Loti	PERSON	's '' Mme.
Chrysanth	PERSON	^ me , '' being filled with bright humor and real sentiment .

		The loss of the '' Essex '' in
Valparaiso	LOCATION	, on
March 28 , 1814	DATE	, is the crowning episode of Mr.
T. J. Hains	PERSON	's sea - story , '' The Cruise of the Petrel '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has left the '' love interest '' where it belongs in a good sea-story -- entirely out of it .

		A pair of villains of the good old sort , and a cheerful suggestion of piracy , make the book undeniably inter - esting .

		Whatever the work of Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	may lack in other respects , it is always ingenious .

		In '' The Mystery of the Clasped Hands '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a wealthy English painter is sent a box containing the severed hands of a former model of his by way of wedding present , and it takes a modern
M. Dupin	PERSON	to unravel the problem of the sender .

		He is discovered , of course , after the usual process .

		The book is of the lightest sort .

		Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	is not as successful with '' Mon - tayne , or , The Slavers of Old
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- as with his stories for boys , chiefly because he uses much the same plan of construction and gives incident too high a place .

		The book , indeed , has enough action in it for three stories , and something like bewilder - ment follows the reader in trying to keep pace with it all . ''


David Harum	PERSON	'' is presumably responsible for `` John Winslow '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- , a mild reflection of the earlier dialect story of homely village worth .

		The author , Mr.
Henry D. Northrop	PERSON	, has discovered a worthy character in this later hero , and his story is well told .

		After wandering in the slough of Mexican politics through a thick volume , Mr.
Charles Fleming Embree	PERSON	returns to the better and more distinctive manner of his first book of stories in '' A Heart of Flame '' -LRB-
Bowen	PERSON	-
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is a passionate one of the Mexican frontier , -- priests , people , a sheriff 's posse , and an ex - ecution figuring in its pages , beside the strikingly con - ceived figure of the heroine ,
Ramoncita	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story has the merit of being inevitable , the scenes of blood and lawlessness being supported by the environment in the most essential manner .

		Mr.
Edwin Asa Dix	PERSON	has written of
New England	LOCATION	village life most acceptably in `` Old
Bowen	PERSON	's Legacy '' -LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The action turns upon the bequest of an eccentric person , and the types which the author draws of the various people who are involved in the final award are clear and distinct .

		A
One-Volume History of Our Country	ORGANIZATION	, which should be at once comprehensive , scholarly , readable , and exact , has long been a real need of the teacher , the student , and the general reader .

		A work giving within the compass of a single volume the salient facts in the wonderful development of this great nation -- a work which could be depended upon as a reference - book , which could be trusted as to the fairness of its treatment of the great questions which have arisen in our history , which should eliminate the unessential and present only the vital , which should be withal and above all in - teresting and entertaining , -- such a work could only be attempted by a scholar thoroughly equipped for his task by years of preparation .

		Dr.
Francis Newton Thorpe	PERSON	, historical student , lecturer , and author , has long been a recognized authority in the field of American constitutional and political history , and when some years ago this ac - complished man planned and began a one-volume history of the American people , there could be little doubt that he would consummate his work successfully and satisfactorily .

		That he has done so is now abundantly proved by the recep - tion given by the press to '' A History of the American People . ''

		Published but six weeks , the book has been noticed by the leading papers with uniform praise and commendation .

		From
Boston Journal	ORGANIZATION	,
July	DATE	j : `` It is a vast and puzzling task to tell in six hundred pages the whole story of the development of a mighty nation , but the reader of Professor
Thorpe	PERSON	's volume wonders how it could be better done ... The ag - gregate amount of the information which he compresses into this one book is astonishing .

		Nothing of real dignity and value seems to have been overlooked ... For the general library , and especially for the student in need of quick reference and verifi - cation , it is invaluable .

		The index is especially full . ''

		200fi00 Copies Already Published An American Novel Generously Received in
England	LOCATION	THE CRISIS By Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL	PERSON	NOTHING was more natural than that the American public and the American reviews should speak well of , even praise to the point of extravagance , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's new novel , '' THE CRISIS . ''

		That was to be expected .

		The story is most interesting , the love tale fascinating , and as a picture of the Civil War and its heroes the book has never been equalled , even approached .

		But with the cooler criticism of the English papers comes , we are glad to say , the best praise of the work .

		The
London Academy	ORGANIZATION	says in regard to '' The Crisis '' that Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	has not gone back .

		He will not be among those authors who achieve fame in a month , only to lose it again in a few years .

		He will always be a dignified and impressive figure in American letters , and his books will always have an immense sale .

		The
London	LOCATION	Spectator again praises the book highly , and says : `` We do not grudge Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	his popularity , but rather welcome it as an excellent sign of the times .

		For he has given us an exceedingly spirited , interesting , and right-minded romance of the Civil War , in which , while generously appreciative of the chivalry , the heroism , and the charm of the Southerners , always , from the dramatic and literary point of view , far more picturesque and engaging subjects than the
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	, he never falters a moment in his enthusiasm for the North .

		The true hero is
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and we have to thank Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	for a very honest portrait of that great man , and a most graphic account of the manner in which he conquered the admiration of the fastidious . ''

		In addition to these words of praise from our English friends , we can not refrain from quoting from a review from nearer home , which has just reached us : Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	, in The Outlook ^ says of it : `` The most important of all is Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's * The Crisis , ' which must rank among the foremost books of the year .

		No more realistic and sympathetic study of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	has been made than that which is presented in this book , and the figure grows upon the reader as he passes from chapter to chapter .

		The interest in Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's rare personality steadily deepens as one perceives underneath his homeliness the elements of power and the nobility of his character .

		No finer interpretation of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's spirit has ever been made than that which Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	makes in the few words he puts into
Lincoln	PERSON	's mouth in his interview with
Virginia Carvel	LOCATION	.

		It has ele - ments of originality and power , and is , above all , profoundly interesting .

		It possesses the great quality of interpreting American life from an intelligent American point of view -- a process very much rarer than most people think . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 58 NOTES 59 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 60 JOH N FI SKE .

		American scholarship soffers a serious loss in the death of
John Fiske	PERSON	, early in the pres - ent month , at the age of fifty-nine .

		Uis health had always been so robust , and his vitality was so seemingly inexhaustible , that the news of his sudden taking-off came to us with a shock , although an observer skilled in the lore of physiology might possibly have seen in the very massiveness of that frame , with its extra - ordinary capacities for the consumption of meat and drink , as well as for the exercise of both physical and intellectual activities , the sign of a development so abnormal that its powers of resistance must be weakened some - where , and would be in danger of giving way to some unusual strain .

		The strain came with the torrid heat that spread like a blanket over this country early in the present
summer	DATE	, and marked among its thousands of victims the distinguished historian and philosopher whose task is now completed .

		The leading facts in the life of
John Fiske	PERSON	may be stated in a few words .

		He was bom in
Connecticut	LOCATION	in
1842	DATE	.

		His true name was
Edmund Fiske Green	PERSON	, which he changed in boyhood to that of a grandfather with whom he went to live , thus acquiring the name by which he is known to the world .

		He was a child of extraordinary precocity , at the age of ten or twelve mastering subjects that are usuaUy re - served for the later stages of the education of young men .

		In this respect , his life suggests that of Cotton Mather or of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, and the stories told of the tender years of those worthies may all be matched in the records of
John Fiske	PERSON	's childhood .

		He went through
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	mainly as a matter of form , and remained in that institution after gradu - ation as instructor and as an assistant in the library .

		When about thirty years of age he became a professional scholar and man of let - ters almost to the exclusion of any other oc - cupation , although he continued to lecture , at intervals , for the rest of his life .

		During these years , he made his home in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, al - though he travelled considerably , both in this country and in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Such are the modest annals of this life of devotion to the things of 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, the mind ; what remains to be said of the man who lived it must relate chiefly to his ideas and the books in which they were expressed .

		Philosophy and history were the major pre - occupations of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	during his working years , and nearly all of his writings belong to the one or the other of these subjects , although now and then a book may be said to do hardly more than touch the fringes of either history or philosophy .

		This is true , for example , of the little book called '' Tobacco and Alcohol , '' a spirited polemic directed against
James Parton	PERSON	's '' Smoking and Drinking , '' which latter work was a most intemperate exposition of the ideas commonly misassociated with the name of temperance .

		It is also true of the volumes that are made up of miscellaneous matter , for many of the essays here included represent the author 's diversions rather than his serious pursuits .

		We are glad that he had diversions , for we owe to them much stimu - lating entertainment , such , for instance , as is provided by that brilliant study , published within the last few years , of the Shaconian delusion and its victims .

		Of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's two subjects , philosophy came first .

		He was a very young man when he made a visit to
England	LOCATION	, became acquainted with
Darwin	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, and returned home , his brain seething with the new evolutionary thought .

		Of this thought he became the leading American ex - ponent , and his '' Outlines of Cosmic Philos - ophy , '' published in
1874	DATE	, was a restatement of the Spencerian system that seemed to many readers an improvement upon the original , so greatly did Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's ideas benefit by the lucidity and literary art of his American dis - ciple .

		This work was supplemented in a way , some years later , by two small volumes en - titled '' The Destiny of Man '' and '' The Idea of God . ''

		These proved to be the most widely popular of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's writings , but his best friends , and those having the most intimate acquaintance with his thought , looked upon them as not altogether worthy of their author .

		In their attempt to reconcile the teachings of science with religious dogma these books , when carefully examined , seem flavored with soph - istry , and lend a sort of countenance to beliefs that are fundamentally inconsistent with the evolutionary doctrine .

		In a word , they pro- duce the impression of a writer who is not quite honest with himself , and is willing to make an intellectual compromise with a system of ideas that he is , as it were , under bonds to oppose .

		Even Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	felt called upon to protest against some of the religious impli - cations that his follower sought to fasten upon the synthetic philosophy .

		Nearly twenty years ago , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	turned his attention from philosophy to American history , and nearly all of his subsequent work was done in the latter field .

		Political philos - ophy served him as a bridge for this transition , and his book on '' American Political Ideas '' marked the turning-point in his career .

		He remained to the end essentially a philosophical historian rather than a historian of manners , or even of wars , and the drum and trumpet ideal was kept as far as possible out of his work .

		A masterly treatment of '' The Critical Period of American History '' was the first of the series of works which , although they seemed detached studies for a time , were gradually seen to take their places in what was to prove a systematic survey of our national records . ''

		The Beginnings of
New England	LOCATION	'' and '' The American Revolution '' soon followed , and the author 's design assumed solidity and continuity * Then came '' The Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, '' dealing with the whole period of exploration and determination of the coast-line of the New World .

		After this , the order of production became more logical , for the next works were ''
Virginia	LOCATION	and Her Neighbors '' and '' The Dutch and
Quaker Colonies	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Here the record ends , except for a detached study of a part o # the Civil War period , and a number of ad - mirable books for schools and young people .

		Taken as a whole , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's work in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can history gives us a fairly complete treatment of the subject from the time of the discoverers down to the adoption of the Constitution .

		It is brilliant work , fine in its literary quality , and remarkable for its judicial tone and its power to deal with conflicting opinions , deter - mining upon which side lies the weight of the evidence .

		It is work that fairly places the author among our great historians , in the group that includes
Prescott	PERSON	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	,
Bancroft	PERSON	and
Parkman	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	and Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	.

		The chief impression that is left upon the mind of one acquainted with Mr ,
Fiske	PERSON	's work in its entirety is that of a thoroughly sane and well-balanced intellect .

		There are so many instances of men who are clear-headed in the work that engages their best activities , yet who betray weakness in some other direction , that it is refreshing to come in contact with a mind which seems to have had no serious in -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 tellectual infirmity .

		The best of men are sub - ject to occasional vagaries , and one could make up a long list of able thinkers who have '' a screw loose '' somewhere , in whose mental armor there is some weak point .

		The vulner - able spot may be reached by spiritualism , or the single tax , or palmistry , or telepathy , or the delusions of '' Christian science '' and the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		From such vagaries of the intellect
John Fiske	PERSON	seems to have been absolutely free .

		His scien - tific and philosophical training was so compre - hensive , his sense of the value of evidence was so sure , his insight into all the methods of fraud and pretense was so unerring , that no form of pseudo-science could get a lodgment in his brain .

		He seems - to have taken the right view of every subject to which he gave his attention , the view , that is , which is sup - ported by the consensus of intelligent opinion among those who speak with authority .

		We can not call him an original thinker -- which might be doubtful praise , if we could , -- but we can say of him that he has had few equals in penetrative grasp and understanding of the more serious problems of modern science , his - tory , and philosophy .

		LIBRARY COOP ERATION .

		The
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	has just held its twenty-third general meeting , at ``
Waukesha	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		At the first meeting of the association , in
1876	DATE	, attention was directed to the possibilities of cooperation among librarians for the attainment of worthy ends not to be secured by individuals working singly .

		The early volumes of the '' Library Journal '' contain frequent contributions on this topic .

		In fact , the question has been always with the association .

		This principle of cooperation was applied to in - dexing , and
Poole	PERSON	's Index to
Periodical Literature	ORGANIZATION	, with its multiple supplements , and the
A. L. A. Index	PERSON	to
General Literature	ORGANIZATION	, resulted .

		Its appli - cation to reciprocal relations between libraries led to inter-library loans .

		Now the professor in an isolated Kansas college may pursue his own ad - vanced studies , because through his library he may borrow books from
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another phase of the larger library 's work for the smaller is seen in the many-sided developments of the travelling library idea as carried out by state libraries and library commissions .

		Prior to
1901	DATE	, seventeen states had made provision for the aiding of very small libraries and of communities with no libraries by the formation of state library commis - sions .

		The lessening of administrative expenses by printing and distributing catalogue cards to libraries through some central bureau was recognized as a desideratum at the outset .

		But obstacles were met in the varying sizes of cards used by libraries , and in difficulties of selection and distribution .

		Valu - able annotated bibliographies of selected titles on various subjects have been possible only through cooperation and the generous financial support of such friends of libraries as Mr.
George	PERSON	lies of
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The bibliography of American history is now half through the press .

		A factor destined to be powerful in many future cooperative undertakings for libraries came to the front at this conference -- the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its coming was greeted with the enthusiasm its importance demands .

		At the public meeting of the association the chief address was by the
Libra	PERSON	- rian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	, on '' What may be done for Libraries by the Nation . ''

		He defined his subject as what the nation as a unit acting through its central authority may do .

		He said , in brief : '' Only as assamed by a central aathority are some ander - takings possible .

		The federal ^ Yemment is already aiding libraries in varied ways .

		It encoarag : es the mannfactore of good books , it exempts from duty foreign books for libraries , it establishes bnreans of scientific research , it is the largest pablisher in the world , it uses a million poands of paper stock a year and dlstribates over three hundred thousand of its own issues , it has a clearing-house for duplicate
United States	LOCATION	documents , it is indexing its own publications , it maintains a bureau in the interest of educational institutions , and this bureau has brought out several valuable library publications .

		The government maintains its own great libraries ; for exam - ple , that of the Surgeon-General 's Office , whose elaborate catalogue has already cost more than
$ 250,000	MONEY	. ''

		But goyemment activities in behalf of libraries naturally centre in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was created as a legislative library , but it is now referred to as something more .

		Its building was paid for by the country at large , it is often alluded to as the national library of the
United States	LOCATION	, and such it may become .

		Its conditions difEer from those of the British Museum .

		There a student need not go over five hun - dred miles to reach his national library , here he may have to go three thousand miles .

		It should serve students in
Wash	LOCATION	- ington , it ought also to provide for scholars in the country at large by loaning books to them and by employing specialists to answer questions sent to
Washington	LOCATION	.

		To meet their needs , it should accumulate original sources , works of importance for occasional reference , the useless books that libraries in g : en - eral can not afford space for , and the general mass of books .

		All this involves the costly processes of cataloguing and classi - fication .

		Cooperative undertakings should have headquarters in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The Library of Cong ^ ress may provide a na - tional clearing-house for miscellaneous duplicates .

		Toward these things we are drifting .

		We have the building , the equipment , the books .

		The library contains seven hundred thousand volumes , and five hundred thousand other items .

		Its resources are not omnipotent but they are comprehensive .

		It is strong in
Americana	LOCATION	, political and social science , juris - prudence , learned societies and serials in general .

		As far as deliberate purchase is concerned two extremes are to be ab - stained from , books merely poptdar and those merely ctirious .

		Books are to be bought that will aid in the establishment of fact .

		The library has the org ^ anization , having now a staff of 261 persons , not including caretakers , printers , or binders .

		It has a division of bibliography , a bindery , and a printing office .

		But it has also a large arrear of work , including the classification and shelf-list , and the author and subject cata - logues .

		A library of reference books for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should be arranged , and the other libraries of the
District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	60 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, should be coordinated with the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and it should have a catalogue of all these libraries .

		In some re - spects the equipment is inadequate for these larger under - takings .

		Its authorities should consider what may be done in the distribution of printed cards to general libraries .

		It may become the bibliographic bureau of the
United States	LOCATION	and issue publications .

		If it is to be the national library , it should loan books to other libraries , serving the scholar through the local library , '' No greater boon could come to American libraries than the realization of the plans projected by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	for the development of the national library , and outlined in the foregoing brief synopsis .

		This library is the natural centre for all great biblio - graphical undertakings in this country , and the natural point of contact with international enter - prises .

		During the conference , an agreement was reached between Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	and the publishing board of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, and as a result the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	is to furnish its printed cards for distribution to other libraries .

		The details of the plan are still to be worked out , but it will certainly be of the greatest benefit to the libraries of this country .

		It means reduced expense and drudgery , and increased inspiration as a con - sequence .

		One of the older librarians even said that he could now depart in peace for he had seen cooperative printed cards established at the national library .

		Undoubtedly the general public cares very little about the details of library cataloguing and classi - fication .

		If it gets prompt service , it asks no questions .

		But it must be a matter of deep interest to scholars to see the librarians giving an increasing amount of attention to the expert bibliographical side of library matters .

		This tendency was very marked at this meeting .

		Two long sessions of one section were devoted to details of certain modifica - tions in cataloguing rules , the standpoint of the libraries for scholars being chiefly considered .

		Still another session was occupied with bibliography in its strict sense .

		Another indication of the same trend is the organization within two years of the
Bibliographical Society of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This society held an informal meeting at
Waukesha	LOCATION	, many of the non-resident members being present .

		The spirit there manifested will probably develop this into a national society in a few years .

		The full and fre - quent consideration of the problems of the small public library , with its abbreviated catalogue of books chiefly American , has been a necessity .

		The stress laid upon the books for children , and on children 's rooms , is as it should be .

		But the lack of the scholarly element in American library affairs has been unfavorably commented on abroad , even while the American success in practical library technique was freely admitted .

		This new emphasis on the scholarly side of librarianship is a welcome development .

		A period of library expansion is evidently at hand .

		The gifts to libraries from
June 1 , 1900	DATE	, to
July 1 , 1901	DATE	, include 405 separate gifts , amount - ing to
$ 16,130,220.12	MONEY	; and of these gifts , 394 are for libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The chief donor to libraries is Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, his benefac - tions amounting in this year to more than eleven millions .

		With princely gifts to libraries , with Dr.
John S. Billings	PERSON	as the new president of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, with cooperative cataloguing established on a basis never before possible , with scholarship receiving increasing rec - ognition in library affairs , the outlook for American libraries is heartening in the highest degree .

		DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF PHILANTHROPY , -LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I agree fully with what The Dial has to say about '' Prescient Philanthropy , '' in a recent issue .

		The fact that so many men of great wealth are directing a large portion of their fortunes into educational channels is indeed a cause for great satisfaction .

		Donations of this character form the nucleus of enduring monuments , and surpass , as it seems to me , gifts extending into any other field of human endeavor , however worthy in the abstract , in the intrinsic good that follows to the human race , I wish it were possible , however , -- and this is my excuse for this communication , -- to induce some of these liberal givers to make a more democratic distri - bution of their gifts ; to give , for instance , to such edu - cational objects and movements as will directly and immediately enhance the knowledge and the desire for knowledge of the common people .

		Here is , if you please , a comparatively un worked field ah initio .

		Here the opportunities for wise and judicious giving are simply inexhaustible .

		Let me particularize .

		What school district would decline a gift of a few hundred dollars , and meet the gift with a similar amount , for the purpose of establish - ing and maintaining a school district library ?

		How many of country schools , where the rudiments only are taught , have such libraries ?

		What municipality would decline a gift of a few thousand dollars for the purpose of establishing a public library and free reading-room , and would refuse to meet the gift with a similar ap - propriation from its own funds ?

		How many of the municipalities containing a population of , say , under five thousand persons , have such institutions ?

		The establishing of industrial schools in central locations , geographically and with reference to transportation facilities , and providing this education free to the worthy poor children of the locality , -- including free text-books , free apparatus , free clothing if necessary , and free tuition , -- offers a large field for public-spirited and liberal-minded citizens .

		These are but a few of the '' opportunities '' which the educational field presents .

		The number could be increased a hundred-fold .

		In a true democracy , like our own , is not large giving , in the manner indicated herein , more in keeping with the spirit of our institu - tions ?

		Does it not tend to advance the general welfare ?

		Is not the effect to promote the common weal ?

		THE DIAL 51 ^ fec ` gtbi go0ks .

		The Ixner IjTfe of the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The most difficult thing in writing and teaching history is to reproduce in imagination the '' mental furniture '' of a past age .

		It is easy to describe its houses and ships , its chairs , tables , and candlesticks , and the written de - scription may be supplemented by pictorial illustration .

		We can easily understand that railroads , telegraphs , and newspapers were wanting , and that their absence altered the external conditions of life .

		But we naturally think of the intellectual outfit of the people as differing but slightly from that of our own time .

		It is difficult to divest ourselves of the abstract ideas which we have imbibed from infancy , and to realize that they formed no part of the common stock of knowledge of the past .

		Still more difficult is it to substitute for these ideas the superstitions and delusions which men held in their stead .

		Our projection backward into the inner life of the period of American colonization is the task which Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	has set for himself in his '' Transit of Civilization from
England	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. '' ''

		Eclipses , parhelia , comets were danger signals hung out in the heavens as warnings .

		Logic was the only im - plement for the discovery of truth .

		Observa - tion was in its birth-throes .

		Medicines were recognized by signaturism ... Right and wrong were thought of only as the result of direct revelation ... Unless we understand these things , '' he says , '' we write the history of the seventeenth century in vain . ''

		The book continues '' The Beginners of a Nation , '' pub - lished several years ago , and forms the second volume in the author 's projected '' History of Life in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	divides his descriptive cata - logue of early colonial ideas into six chapters .

		The first sets forth seventeenth-century ideas of common things : the belief in astrology and the Ptolemaic system , the dread of comets and other portents , the notions of animal life and its generation by putrefaction , the marvellous tales that were believed about unicorns and basilisks , and the supposed control of human affairs by angels and witches .

England	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	in the
Seventeenth Centory	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		chapter treats of the medical notions of the period of settlement .

		Galen 's theory of humors and the doctrine of signaturism remained the basis of medical practice , and
Harvey	PERSON	's discov - ery scarcely found acceptance in the colonies during the whole of the seventeenth century .

		The medical remedies are described in detail : black powder of calcined toads , theriac of snake 's flesh , and other nauseous drinks and compounds derived from unspeakable sources .

		Of them all , the curious weapon-ointment , ap - plied to a weapon producing a wound instead of to the wound itself , and the sympathetic powder with which blood from the wound was treated , must have been the best because least harmful .

		Some competent physicians came over with the first settlers , but subsequently medical practice degenerated and medical knowledge declined .

		The third chapter treats of the adjustment of the English speech of the seventeenth century to colonial surroundings , of the application of old names to new things , the adoption of Indian terms , the development of local dialects and the beginnings of colonial literature .

		Of English writers of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan period , the colonists knew little or nothing .

		Shakespeare , Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	says , '' was never mentioned by any American writer of the seventeenth century . ''

		Under the title '' Weights and Measures of Conduct , '' the fourth chapter deals with social and religious ideas -- the reverence for rank , the supremacy of the church , the severity of the
New England Sabbath	ORGANIZATION	, the monstrous ideas of God , the heartless damnation of infants , and the literal application of scriptural texts to the affairs of every-day life .

		The fifth chapter , called '' The Tradition of Education , '' begins with a digres - sion on the origin of English schools , and then gives an account of their transfer to
America	LOCATION	, the beginnings of common schools , the outward traits of school life , and the founding of the colleges .

		The last chapter describes communal holdings and other forms of land tenure , the character and status of indentured servants , and the beginnings of African slavery .

		The life portrayed is that of
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, and the
New England	LOCATION	colonies , the other col - onies being reserved for a later volume .

		The work throughout is based upon original sources , and a great deal of interesting and valuable material is presented .

		A few points suggest comment .

		Dr.
Eggle	PERSON	- ston bases the common dislike of a census upon the disasters that followed
David	PERSON	's experiment .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, We are rather disposed to think that
David	PERSON	's example was used to bolster up an inherited aversion which antedated popular knowledge of the Scriptures , and in its origin was based upon the fear that an enumeration of the popu - lation was the prelude of further taxation .

		He derives the famous
Massachusetts	LOCATION	school law of
1647	DATE	from the rule laid down in
1560	DATE	in
Knox	PERSON	's '' Book of Discipline '' and its adoption in
1618	DATE	by the Synod of
Dort	PERSON	, although he admits in a note that '' the general responsi - bility of a corporate town as such for its school , where there was one , was a trait of English life . ''

		It was but a step further to require that the town should have a school .

		The connection with
Knox	PERSON	's precept may have existed ; but in the absence of proof that it did , it seems more natural to suppose that the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	act was a development , growing out of local needs , of the English precedent .

		Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	gives without comment the usual account of the in - troduction of slavery into
Virginia	LOCATION	by the Dutch .

		Inasmuch as the reliability of the account has been questioned and an earlier im - portation claimed , we would have expected a fuller discussion of the point .

		Taking the book as a whole , Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	does not seem to us to have succeeded in his purpose of presenting a clear-cut picture of the mental outfit of the early American colonists .

		This is due in part to the inherent difficulty of the task , but also in part to certain faults of arrangement and exposition .

		The machinery of text , marginal references , and supplementary notes or '' elucidations , '' is too complicated for a popular history and unduly divides the at - tention .

		A clearer impression would have resulted if part of the '' elucidations '' had been incorporated in the text and the remainder compressed into ordinary foot-notes .

		The text reads more like a transcript from an historical note-book than like a digested whole .

		It often jumps abruptly from one subject to another .

		At points it runs into digressions interesting in themselves but not very closely connected with the principal subject .

		At other points it omits important explanations which are es - sential to a clear understanding of the matter presented .

		In fact .

		Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	has so fully entered into the point of view of the earlier generation that he has to some extent lost sight of the mental outfit of the present one .

		Al - though compelled to make this qualification , we would not , however , have it obscure the many merits of the work .

Unhappy Queen	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Unless we would dispute
Lord Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's time-honored dictum that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well , we can not withhold our praise from Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	's life of
Sophia Dorothea	PERSON	, to whom he has deemed it worth while to devote a volume of nearly six hundred octavo pages .

		This painstaking record of court gossip and petty intrigue , unedifying though it is in many respects , yet serves to teach anew the lesson of Broome 's familiar lines : '' None are completely wretched but the great .

		Superior woes , superior stations bring ; A peasant sleeps , while cares awake a king . ''

		The story of this unfortunate princess has been so many times told , and is so well known to every reader of
Thackeray	PERSON	, of
Doran	PERSON	, and of
Macaulay	LOCATION	, that it is unnecessary here to retrace it even in outline .

		She has been judged with every degree of harshness and of lenity , although the weight of opinion is decidedly against her .

		The common verdict is probably that pronounced by
Thackeray	PERSON	, that she was `` the bad wife of a bad husband , '' and that she carried on a criminal intrigue with a man '' than whom a greater scamp does not walk the history of the seventeenth century . ''

		But when we remember who her husband was , -- the first of the
Georges	PERSON	, a man who , to quote
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's characterization , '' could not read a line of Pope , and who loved nothing but punch and fat women , '' -- we are more than half inclined to take
Doran	PERSON	's more favorable view of her conduct .

		In the matter of censure he contents himself with saying : ''
Sophia	PERSON	atoned for some possible indiscretion by a long captivity , the severity of which tended only to the purifying of her character . ''

		Between these extremes Mr.

Ahlden	LOCATION	, the scenes respectively of the princess ' youth , married life , and imprison - ment ; and now he would seem to have said the last word on the unhappy career of the '' uncrowned queen . ''

		Although as a rule he is very conscientious in citing his authorities , he occasionally has the air of embellishing his very readable nar - rative for the sake of effect .

		The reader would like to know , for example , whence he derives his minute account of
Konigsmarck	ORGANIZATION	's murder , an account differing in several details from the commonly accepted one , -- or , at least , ampli - fying it in a number of particulars .

		The sixteenth chapter opens with a statement at variance not only with previous histories of
Sophia Dorothea	PERSON	's life , but also with the writer 's own subsequent narrative .

		He tells us that for more than a year after her divorce the princess was detained in Hanoverian terri - tory , before being removed to
Ahlden	LOCATION	, in the domains of her father , the
Duke of Celle	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , according to the author 's own account , the decree of divorce was issued
December 28 , 1694	DATE	, and the divorced wife left Lauenau for Ahlden on the 28th of the following
February	DATE	.

		Such occasional slips , however , are pardon - able ; less so , perhaps , are certain other errors , attributable either to the printer or to the proof-reader , or , in too many instances , to the author himself .

		Drinking is spoken of as '' a very venal offence in those days . '' ''

		The effort it cost her to have made the visit '' and '' it would have been worse for her to have dissembled '' offend the lover of careful English .

''

		In a word , admirably though Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	tells his story , he seems occasionally to go out of his way to show how the King 's English should not be written .

		The tone of the secret correspondence be - tween
Sophia Dorothea	PERSON	and her lover
Konigs	PERSON	- marck may be inferred from what the author says in regard to the letters of the princess : '' Believing that she was writing to him alone , she pours forth her soul in absolute abandon - ment .

		She gives herself to him so completely , so unreservedly , and withal so intimately , that one almost shrinks from laying bare this con - fession of woman 's love for man . ''

		Many readers will wish that he had quite shrunk from laying bare so much as is disclosed in the two hundred or more pages of amatory outpourings .

		The dose is too strong and too copious to suit some tastes .

		But -- not to end this review with carping criticism on a work that has afforded the reviewer several hours of pleasant reading -- the book gives a vivid picture of the period and the country with which it deals , and is written with the pen of a conscientious historian .

		The new matter discovered and so ably used by the author helps to a better understanding of a too little understood character , and most readers will close the volume with gentler feelings for the unhappy woman whose pathetic story it tells .

Phillis Wheatley	PERSON	to
Booker Washington	LOCATION	, the Neg ^ o race in
America	LOCATION	has sacceeded in bringing forth men whom the country , at times spontaneously , at times in spite of itself , has been impelled to honor and respect .

		Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	is one of the most striking of these cases , and his autobiography is a partial history of the steps which made him a gronp leader , and the one man who in the eyes of the nation typifies at present more nearly than all others the work and worth of his nine million fellows .

		The way in which groups of human beings are led to choose certain of their number as their spokesmen and leaders is at once the most ele - mentary and the nicest problem of social growth .

		History is but the record of this group leadership ; and yet how infinitely changeful is its type and history !

		And of all types and kinds , what can be more instructive than the leadership of a group within a group -- that curious double movement where real progp-ess may be negative and actual advance be relative retrogression ?

		All this is the social student 's inspiration and despair .

		When sticks and stones and beasts form the sole environment of a people , their attitude is ever one of determined opposition to , and conquest of , nat - ural forces .

		But when to earth and brute is added an environment of men and ideas , then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take three main forms : a feeling of revolt and revenge ; an attempt • Up fbom Slavery .

July 16	DATE	, to adjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group ; or , finally , a determined attempt at self-development , self-realization , in spite of environ - ing discouragements and prejudice .

		The influence of all three of these attitudes is plainly to be traced in the evolution of race leaders among American negroes .

		Before
1750	DATE	there was but the one motive of revolt and revenge which animated the terrible Maroons and veiled all the Americas in fear of insurrection .

		But the liberalizing tendencies of the latter half of the eighteenth century brought the first thought of adjustment and assimilation in the crude and earnest songs of
Phillis	PERSON	and the martyr - dom of Attucks and Salem .

		The cotton-gin changed all this , and men then , as the
Lyman Abbotts	PERSON	of to-day , found a new mean - ing in human blackness .

		A season of hesitation and stress settled on the black world as the hope of emancipation receded .

		Forten and the free Ne - groes of the North still hoped for eventual assimi - lation with the nation ;
Allen	PERSON	, the founder of the great African Methodist Church , strove for unbend - ing self-development , and the Southern freedmen followed him ; while among the black slaves at the South arose the avenging
Nat Turner	PERSON	, fired by the memory of
Toussaint the Savior	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far , Negro leadership had been local and spasmodic ; but now , about
1840	DATE	, arose a national leadership -- a dynasty not to be broken .


Frederick Douglass	PERSON	and the moral revolt against slavery dominated Negro thought and effort until after the war .

		Then , with the sole weapon of self-defense in perilous times , the ballot , which the nation gave the freedmen , men like
Langston	PERSON	and
Bruce	PERSON	sought to guide the polit - ical fortunes of the blacks , while
Payne	PERSON	and Price still clung to the old ideal of self-development .

		Then came the reaction .

		War memories and ideals rapidly passed , and a period of astonishing commercial development and expansion ensued .

		A time of doubt and hesitation , of storm and stress , overtook the f reedmen 's sons ; and then it was that
Booker Washington	LOCATION	's leadership began .

		Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- ington came with a clear simple programme , at the psychological moment ; at a time when the nation was a little ashamed of having bestowed so much sentiment on Negroes and was concentrating its energies on Dollars .

		The industrial training of Negro youth was not an idea originating with Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	, nor was the policy of conciliating the white South wholly his .

		But he first put life , un - limited energy , and perfect faith into this pro- gramme ; he changed it from an article of belief into a whole creed ; he broadened it from a by-path into a veritable Way of Life .

		And the method by which he accomplished this is an interesting study of human life .

		Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	's narrative gives but glimpses of the real struggle which he has had for leader - ship .

		First of all , he strove to gain the sympathy and cooperation of the white South , and gained it after that epoch-making sentence spoken at
Atlanta	LOCATION	: '' In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers , yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress '' -LRB- p. 221 -RRB- .

		This conquest of the South is by all odds the most notable thing in Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	's career .

		Next to this comes his achievement in gaining place and consideration in the North .

		Many others less shrewd and tactful would have fallen between these two stools ; but as Mr.
Washington	PERSON	knew the heart of the South from birth and training , so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of the age that was dominating the North .

		He learned so thoroughly the speech and thought of triumphant commercialism and the ideals of material prosperity that he pictures as the height of absurdity a black boy studying a French grammar in the midst of weeds and dirt .

		One wonders how Socrates or St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assissi	LOCATION	would receive this !

		And yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his age is a mark of the successful man .

		It is as though Nature must needs make men a little narrow to give them force .

		At the same time , Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	's success .

		North and South , with his gospel of Work and Money , raised opposition to him from widely divergent sources .

		The spiritual sons of the Abolitionists were not prepared to acknowledge that the schools founded before
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, by men of broad ideals and self-sacrificing souls , were wholly failures , or worthy of ridicule .

		On the other hand , among his own people Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	found deep suspicion and dislike for a man on such good terms with Southern whites .

		Such opposition has only been silenced by Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	's very evident sincerity of purpose .

		We forgive much to honest purpose which is ac - complishing something .

		We may not agree with the man at all points , but we admire him and cooperate with him so far as we conscientiously can .

		It is no ordinary tribute to this man 's tact and power , that , steering as he must amid so many diverse interests and opinions , he to-day commands not simply the applause of those who believe in his theories , but also the respect of those who do not .

		Among the Negroes , Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	is still far from a popular leader .

		Educated and thoughtful Negroes everywhere are glad to honor him and aid him , but all can not agree with him .

		He represents in
Negro	LOCATION	thought the old attitude of adjustment to environment , emphasizing the economic phase ; but the two other strong currents of feeling , descended from the past , still oppose him .

		One is the thought of a small but not unimportant group , unfortunate in their choice of spokesman , but nevertheless of much weight , who represent the old ideas of revolt and revenge , and see in migration alone an outlet for the Negro people .

		The second attitude is that of the large and important group represented by
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	,
Tanner	PERSON	,
Chesnut	PERSON	,
Miller	PERSON	, and the
Grimkes	PERSON	, who , without any single definite programme , and with complex aims , seek nevertheless that self - development and self-realization in all lines of

		Indeed , it is doubtful whether so much of real value as to New Testament intro - duction was ever before brought within the limits of a volume of this size .

		In Christianity a personal devil , prince of darkness , emerges better defined than ever before .

		The real interest of the book and its more legitimate matter are found in the chapters from this point onward .

		The Devil of Christianity is sometimes a veritable Lucifer , almost an angel of light , a being so noble and passionate as to cause respect in spite of his wickedness ; commonly , however , as through the Middle Ages , he dwindles into a poor , harmless being , of little wit , the constant dupe and victim of the godly .

		The notion that persons sold themselves to the Devil is fairly discussed , with all the related matter of witchcraft .

		From the detection and pun - ishment of witchcraft , the author passes to the In - quisition , upon the horrors of which he dilates with evident gusto .

		After tracing modern conceptions of the Devil , especially as shown in literature and art , he closes with a discussion of the philosophical problem of Good and Evil .

		It is evident from this cursory statement of the author 's treatment that the book abounds in interesting matter culled from many sources and representing much labor .

		The author has shown great diligence in gathering illus - trative material , and it is doubtful if any such col - lection of ancient and modern , quaint and curious , picturesque and frightful pictures relative to the subject has been before offered to English readers .

		The actualities of the century just gone are disclosed with a touch which is rather wonder - ing than appreciative , affording a sufficient antidote to the duller forms of optimism .

		The treatment is rather logical than satirical , though this last touch is not lacking in such episodes as that which repre - sents the Utopians of the future as preserving a factory town , with all its nineteenth century soot and grime , starvation and wealth , piety and misery , as a horrible example for a civilization further ad - vanced to study and profit by .

		They went to seize the fabled metal veins Cipango ripens in her distant mines ; The trade winds bent their lateen yards toward The shores mysterious of the Western World .

		Each evening hoping for an epic mom .

		The phosphorescent azure of the sea Would charm their sleep with its mirage of gold ; Or , leaning o'er the caravel 's white bow .

		They saw ascending in an unknown sky New stars from out the depths of Ocean . ''

		Those who know the glorious alexandrines of the original , with their sonorous march and their magical charm , will not be greatly moved by such a trans - lation as this , but they will recognize that it does faithfully , within its limitations , about all that an English version could be expected to accomplish .

		Mrs.
Candace Wheeler	PERSON	's volume '' Content in a Garden '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is an exquisite creation .

		It is rare that a book is endowed with such complete and satisfying eharm .

		An artis ' t by nature and culture has set hand and thought to its production , and the result is an original and finished bit of work .

		We might call it a symphony in green , were the term not too pretentious for an effect so simple and unaffected .

		The entire book , except the paper and the print , is dressed in shades of chlorophyll , the substance which gives color to the stem and the leaf of the plant .

		The cover , the leaf edges , the drawings , the mar - ginal lines , are all in these soft , harmonious tints .

		Another pleasing feature is the novel arrangement of the text , which , confined to the inner portion of the page , leaves broad free spaces at the sides and bottom .

		These give room for
Dora Wheeler Keith	PERSON	's decorations , consisting of graceful sprays of flowers taken from specimens in the author 's garden .

		The text itself is the overflow of a woman 's delight in the manifold beauty pervading the floral kingdom .

		It is interesting and stimulating , impressing on the reader the happiness to be had in the possession of a garden , in the thought and the labor devoted to it , and in the possibilities of aesthetic development that arise from an intelligent study of the subject .

		To Mrs.
Wheeler	PERSON	a garden is a genuine art-work , after the manner of a painting , and in the massing and grading of colors should be as carefully and correctly studied .

		There is much valuable sugges - tion in her statements , and this , with their attractive setting , renders her book a veritable treasure .

		As was to be expected of a life of
Whittier	LOCATION	in the '' Beacon Biogra - phies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Pro- fessor
Burton	PERSON	's volume is a model of what such a brief biography should be . ''

		His career was broader than that of the recluse man of letters ; one in which life was reckoned as more than literature . ''

		A good thort life of WMUier .

		With this understanding of his subject the book has been written ; and the wholesomeness of
Whittier	LOCATION	' g family affections , his fine devotion to principle , his love of justice and of his fellow men , his delight in the music of words , are all shown as parts of a fine and true manhood .

		Critical conclusions in regard to his poetry are merely touched upon , but , notwith - standing the author 's sympathy with his subject , he is not blind to
Whittier	LOCATION	's limitations . ''

		* In his cor - respondence occur remarks to indicate that he looked at his literary work as an aside , the central thing being his work as a reformer '' ; and in some such fact as this we may find a great deal of the pathos of literary effort in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The frontis - piece portrait , -- not the one with which we are all familiar , -- shows a poetic face , fine , sensitive , spiritual ; but the shaping of a new civilization de - manded hard work of a more practical sort than the writing of poetry filled with beauty , and Whit - tier responded nobly to the more urgent need .

		There is a very engaging literary quality in Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's writing , and the details of a life in some aspects hard and barren here gain a new and gra - cious meaning .

		The dignity '' Home Thoughts `` by some unpre - andhappinetM tending person writing under the ojhomerXife , j ^ iji ^ `` Q m -LRB- ^ g
Bames & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not a startling book , or a deep book , or a re - markably original book , but it is a book of whole - some advice for those who care for the happiness of family life .

		The thirty-one essays making np the volume were printed first in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' and are therefore brief and to the point .

		Among them , '' T ^ e Homelessness of Certain Married People , '' '' The Lamentable Publicity of Modern Life , '' * ' Responsibility for Influence , '' and '' Era of too Plain Speech '' are especially full of thoughtful comment and wise counsel .

		A paragraph from the last of these may well be quoted : '' Nor does the plain speech of our day stop short with the discussion of disease : offences against morality are now considered entirely open topics of conver - sation .

		The ' touching of pitch ' has not ceased to be a clinging defilement , and no student of psychical conditions can possibly doubt that young minds shrink with less horror from those forms of evil which they are allowed to speak of freely to their companions , or in the family circle . ''

		This and much more in the book is well worth writing for those who are willing to pause for a moment in the hurry of life and give thought to some little things that are not unimportant .

		It seems quite fitting to find among these pages a chapter on Theocritus , the poet of the poor , and to turn from his Doric flute-scores to an appre - ciation of Montaigne that sends us all to dusty library shelves for the essays of that old writer .

		It was Mr.

		Yet he confesses to the keeping of many bird notes , to appear some day in a scientific report .

		We need not fear Professor Dry-as-Dust , or Old - Man - Afraid-of-his-Imagination , when it appears .

		A new volume The third volume of Professor 0 / the
CyeiopcBdia Bailey	ORGANIZATION	's `` Cyclop '' dia of
American of Horticulture	ORGANIZATION	.

		Horticulture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- brings the titles through the letter Q .

		These volumes have appeared with remarkable promptiiess , when one considers the enormous amount of detail they involve .

		To the systematist , the synopses o # certain important genera are of most interest ; but to those inclined to horticultural operations , some of the later titles will be found more important .

		The culture of Orchids is well presented by
Robert N. Grey	PERSON	; the
Peach	LOCATION	is treated by several experts , the general article being written by Professor
Bailey	PERSON	himself , and peach culture in the various notable regions being treated by different writers .

		The Pear and Plum are treated in the same way .

		Just at this time , titles that should attract considerable attention are those relating to the horticultural capabilities of
the Philippines	LOCATION	and of
Porto Rico	LOCATION	.

		General articles of special importance are found under the titles '' Physiology of Plants , '' by Dr.
B. M. Duggar	PERSON	of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, and '' Plant Breeding , '' by Mr.
H. J. Webber	PERSON	of the Depart - ment of Agriculture .

		The States whose horticultural possibilities are presented happen to be numerous in this volume .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It is now more than thirty years since Dr.
Alexander Campbell Fraser	PERSON	, then upwards of fifty years of age , prepared for the Clarendon Press his monumental edition of the works of
Bishop Berkeley	LOCATION	.

		The same scholar , now an octogenarian , has recently prepared for the same publishing agency a new and thoroughly revised edition of the writings of the great philosopher , believing , as do all students of the subject , that they still `` contain a word in season , even for the twentieth century . ''

		The new edition fills four volumes , and in - cludes much new matter that the past thirty years have brought to light . ''

		The International Year Book '' for
1900	DATE	, just pub - lished by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume that extends to considerably upwards of a thousand pages , the enlargement being due to the importance of the year in politics , both national and international .

		It is a very useful publication , now made increasingly so by the addition of an index , cumulative of the con - tents of the three annual volumes thus far published .

		Peculiarly valuable features are the fifty-page appendix on the '' Progress of the Century , '' and the twenty pages of tables from the Census of
1900	DATE	.

		The editor - ship is in the hands of Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	, with the assistance of the versatile Prof.
H. T. Peck	PERSON	-- and what he knows not , as the public is well aware , is not knowledge .

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	has undertaken a `` new and revised edition '' of his translations of '' The Prose Dramas of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, '' and the first volume , con - taining '' The League of Youth , '' has just been imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		This volume contains also a '' general preface '' to the series , in which the translator sets forth his ideas concerning the exact degree of colloquialism that is desirable in an English version of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's dramas of modern society .

		On the whole , in this revised edition , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has reverted to a somewhat more conventional manner than he saw fit to adopt ten years ago .

		The problem is no doubt a difficult one , and , as Mr.
Archer	PERSON	justly says , there are few models offered the English translator of the modern prose drama .

		Along with a very sensible essay on the
Historical Novel	ORGANIZATION	, Prof.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has put eleven others , also sensible , on such subjects as Romance against Romanticism , the
Study of Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, the Conventions of the Drama , and the Art and
Mystery of Collaboration	ORGANIZATION	.

		These essays are the work of a man who has given him - self to the service of literature , and his knowledge of life and of craftsmanship has a mature soundness that makes his papers represent very much more than the immediate labor of their composition .

		The essays are easy reading , not because they lack acuteness , but he - cause they are so unaffected and sensible .

		-LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Sons -RRB- .

		Mr.
Arthur B. Maurice	PERSON	has gathered together his articles that appeared in `` The Bookman '' in
1899	DATE	and
1900	DATE	, and published them in a volume entitled ''
New York	LOCATION	in Fiction '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is freely illustrated with views of places , chiefly houses , which have served as scenes for the fiction of more than a score of writers from
Irving	LOCATION	and
Cooper	PERSON	down .

		The book is interesting , partly because it identifies so many places that gain in significance from their use in fiction , and partly because it once more forcibly illustrates the old truth that writers of description do best , not when they invent , but \ ^ hen they write with their '' eye on the object . ''

		The latest French and German texts are the follow - ing : `` Voyages en Zigzag '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by
Rudolphe Topffer	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
A. R. Hope	PERSON	; `` La Fille du Chanoine '' and '' L'Album du Regiment '' -LRB-

		THE DIAL 69 XOTES .

		`` The First Steps in Geometry , '' by Messrs.
G. A. Wentworth	PERSON	and
G. A. Hill	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Frank J. Miller	PERSON	has jast published , through the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a school text of the '' Selected Works '' of
Ovid	LOCATION	, with notes and vocabulary .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition of Mr.
D. H. Montgomery	PERSON	's '' The Leading Facts of English History , '' a text-book so familiar and so well-approved by experience that no comment is necessary .

		The
Evanston Press Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish Volume II .

		of '' Sketches in
Purple	LOCATION	, '' being selected rhetorical exer - cises written by undergraduate students of the North - western
University	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
J. Scott Clark	PERSON	.

		`` The Close of the Middle Ages , 1273-1494 , '' by Mr.
R. Lodge	PERSON	, is the title of the third volume in the saries of '' Periods of European History , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We believe that with the ap - pearance of this work , the entire series of eight volumes is now on the market .

		`` The Bilioustine , '' Mr.
Bert Leston Taylor	PERSON	's amusing satire on the Roycrofters of
East Aurora	LOCATION	and their work , as originally printed in a
Chicago	LOCATION	morning paper , has been published in pamphlet form , in close imitation of an issue of '' The Philistine , '' by Mr.
William S. Lord	PERSON	of
Evanston	LOCATION	, 111 .

		`` The Discovery of the Old Northwest , '' by Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	, and '' Stories of Ancient Peoples , '' by Miss
Emma J. Arnold	PERSON	, are two new volumes in the '' Eclectic School Readings '' of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same publishers send us a '' Primary History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
John B. McMaster	PERSON	.

		We are glad to have a reprint -LRB- Oxford : B. H. Black - well -RRB- of the '' Practical Discourse on Some Principles of Hymn-Singing '' which Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	contributed to the '' Journal of Theological Studies '' for
October , 1899	DATE	.

		What Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	has to say upon the subject of rhythm and metric is always weighty , and our literature is notably deficient in competent discussion of these subjects .

		Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	's '' Talks on Civics , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume of discussions in dialogue intended for young readers and students .

		A good many matters of both government and law are presented in an exceptionally lucid manner , and the young man or woman who is repelled by text-books of the formal sort may be successfully reached by the ingenious conver - sational de vices of the present work . ''

		Corneille '' and '' The French Academy , '' by Mr.
Leon H. Vincent	PERSON	, are two small books recently pub - lished by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	seems to have in contemplation a series of essays upon the French literature of the great period , and a similar volume on '' Moliere '' is already announced .

		This field of criticism has been rather neglected by English wri - ters , and is deserving of much more attention than it receives .

		That enterprising
California	LOCATION	magazine , substantial and useful not less than ornamental and entertaining , '' The Land of Sunshine , '' begins with its
July	DATE	number a regular department called '' The Twentieth Century West , '' in which such large practical topics as
Irriga	LOCATION	- tion ,
Colonization	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , will receive special and compe - tent discussion .

		The articles will be by various writers , and the whole will be in charge of Mr.
Wm. E. Smythe	PERSON	, well known for his efficient service in founding our Na - tional
Irrigation Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and through his notable and convincing book on '' The Conquest of Arid America . ''

		There is great work to be done in these fields in the immediate future , and it is fitting that Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's magazine , as the representative one of the Western country , should take a foremost part in doing it .

		When we reviewed , not long ago , the autobiography of
William James Stillman	PERSON	, we did not expect soon thereafter to be called upon to record the news of his death .

		We trusted , rather , that many more years might remain to him , and the material for several more chapters of the autobiography .

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	died on the sixth of this month , at his home in
Surrey	LOCATION	, at the age of seventy-three , and the record of his busy and varied career thus stands practically complete in the two vol - umes that were so recently upon our table .

		The
Globe School Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of an '' Introduction to the Study of English Literature , '' by
Miss Vida D. Scudder	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a text-book for high school or college use , modern in its methods , fair in its judg - ments , and made exceedingly helpful to the teacher by its tables , references , and suggestions for class-room work .

		The text is readable -- almost too much so for the purposes of a school manual , -- and the ethical and social prepossessions of the writer enter into the discus - sion rather more fully than is usual in a work of this sort .

		The issue of '' Municipal Affairs , '' dated
March , 1901	DATE	, is a special number in the form of '' A Bibliography of Municipal Problems and
City Conditions	ORGANIZATION	, '' prepared by Mr.
Robert C. Brooks	PERSON	.

		It is a work of over three hundred large pages and more than twelve thousand entries , a fact which testifies most eloquently to the interest which the world is taking in the problems of municipal government .

		The work represents a great enlargement of the bibliography published four years ago , and is an indispensable help to every student of the subject .

		An interesting little compilation of '' Book Titles from Shakspere '' has been prepared and issued in a privately printed edition by Mr.
Volney Streamer	PERSON	.

		From this dainty booklet we learn that '' Hamlet '' has been drawn upon more frequently than any other of the dramas , about one-third of Mr.
Streamer	PERSON	's list being taken from that source . ''

		As You Like It '' is next in favor , followed closely by '' Macbeth '' and '' Othello . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	stands first in the list of authors who have laid
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	under contribution for title purposes , thirteen of his novels having been named from the plays .

		The
American Revision Committee	ORGANIZATION	have completed their work of revision of the
Holy Bible	LOCATION	, and it will be published by Messrs.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	& Sons ,
New York	LOCATION	, in
August	DATE	.

		Besides incorporating the Appendix in the text , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have bestowed much time in rectifying the errors , inconsistencies , oversights , and infelicities which have been detected .

		Moreover , inas - much as the American Revisers , in preparing the Ap - pendix of
1885	DATE	, aimed to reduce the differences to the lowest limit , they waived the larger part of their pre - ferences , many of which they regarded as of decided importance .

		This new edition will embody a consider - able part of these emendations , which represent the de - liberate preferences of the whole
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	, but which were not put into the Appendix .

		Carefully selected marginal references and concise topical headings have also been added .

		A remarkable romance , set in a fresh and picturesque scene .

		Mrs.
Peattie	PERSON	, well known throughout the middle West , is a writer of fine imaginative gifts .

		This engaging story traces , with originality and vividness , the develop - ment of a woman 's character .

		The main action passes in the great pine woods of northern
Michigan	LOCATION	, whose very spirit is caught in these graphic pages . ''

		The Beleaguered Forest '' is the consistent study of a woman 's inconsistency .

		It has the tough strength , the nigged morality , and the swift action of the strenuous life the author knows so intimately .

		A wide experience in traveling all over our dominions has given invaluable help in securing literary proportion , con - trast , and accent .

		For several years she has been a successful contributor to Western papers and to the leading American magazines .

		All this work has brought a goodly reputation as a capable and vigorous writer on Western life .

		The three hundredth issue of APPLETONS ' FAMOUS TOWN AND COUNTRY LIBRARY is signalized and adorned with a new and artistic cover design .

		This comely binding , which is the style in which the TOWN AND COUNTRY LIBRARY will hereafter appear , suggests the broad appeal of the series -- its popularity in the busy mart and in the shady mead far from the madding crowd .

		Following our custom of many years , we have prepared for this and the following num - ber of The Dial a condensation of the sum - maries of the year 's work in
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature appearing in '' The Athenseum '' for
July 6	DATE	.

		The articles this year are twelve in number :
Belgium	LOCATION	being dealt with by Pro- fessor Fredericq ,
Bohemia	LOCATION	by Dr.
Tille	PERSON	, Den - mark by Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	by
M. Pravieux	PERSON	,

Spain	LOCATION	by
Don Kafael	PERSON	Al - bamvia .


Sweden	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are the only two countries of literary importance which are not represented upon the present occasion .

		Professor Fredericq , writing of
Belgium	LOCATION	, deals first with the French writers , then with the Flemish .

		Among the former ,
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck occupies the place of honor with '' La Vie des Abeilles , '' which we have already had in an English translation .


M. Georges Eck	PERSON	- houd , fresh from a prosecution for immorality , from which charge he has been acquitted , '' ia now beginning again ardently '' with his '' Faneuse d'Amour . ''

		A few of the most im - portant books are these . ''

		Petites Legendes '' and ''
Philippe II.	PERSON	, '' both by
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	; ''
Poemes Agrestes	PERSON	, '' by
M. Joseph Liesse	PERSON	; ''
Trente Ans	ORGANIZATION	de Critique Litteraire , '' by the late
Gustave Frederix	PERSON	; '' Sainte-Beuve In - connu , '' by M. de Spoelberch de Louvenjoul ; '' Styles et Caracteres , '' by
M. Georges Le	PERSON	- grand ; '' L'Industrie dans la Grece Ancienne , '' by
M. Henri Francotte	PERSON	; '' Clovis , '' by
M. G. Kurth	PERSON	; ''
Les Boers	PERSON	et les Origines des Re - publiques Sud-Africaines , '' by
M. Jules Le	PERSON	- clercq ; '' La Grece Contemporaine , '' by
Baron Guillaume	PERSON	; '' La Chine en
1899	DATE	, '' by
M. Jules Duckerts	PERSON	; '' De Bruxelles a Karema , '' by
M. A. J. Wauters	PERSON	; '' Deux Ans au
Congo	LOCATION	, '' by M. Constant de Deken ; and a number of works on international law and comparative legisla - tion .

		In Flemish literature , the following are noteworthy : A work on old
Netherland	LOCATION	songs , by
M. F. van Dayse	PERSON	; a '' History of the Lit - erature of the Netherlands , '' by
M. Emile Deneef	PERSON	; '' Twenty Flemish Faces , '' by the Abbe
Hugo Verriest	PERSON	; and a book on
Henri Conscience	ORGANIZATION	,
Jan van Beers	PERSON	, and
Peter Benoit	PERSON	, by
M. Pol de Mont.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In Flemish belles-lettres we have '' Summertide '' and '' Summerland , '' by
M. Steyn Streuvels	PERSON	, a pastry cook by voca - tion ; '' A Lion of Flanders , '' by
M. Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	; and , among theatrical pieces , the `` Siddartha '' of the MM .

		Minnaert , and two realistic pieces called '' The Maker of Bricks '' 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, and `` The Poachers , '' both by
M. L. Scheltjens	PERSON	.

		Dr.
V. Tille	PERSON	begins his report from
Bohemia	LOCATION	with the following paragraph : '' Bohemian literature has been undergoing a crisis of transition for several years ; this appears just now very palpably in belles-lettres , and this year 's rather disappointing output does not point to any thorough change .

		The older generation has already passed its prime , and sums up its production by publishing various `` collected works ' or ' final editions ' ; in the youngest there is a ferment of new tendencies and fresh ideas , which , however , appear more in plans and attempts at finding out new ways than in the production of mature literary work .

		Foreign influences , Western as well as Russian , both in fiction and criticism , operating exten - sively by means of an unusually large number of trans - lations , are clearly visible in all our contemporary writing . ''

		All this leads to criticism , and in this field the influence of the
University	ORGANIZATION	is making itself felt . ''

		Mr.
Jaroslav Vrchlicky	PERSON	, the foremost amongst our poets , expounds in his university lectures the prominent epochs of Western literatures , adding at the same time copious specimens in his many translations , to which he has lately added a new volume of ' Artistic and Popular Poetry . '

		Other professors and lecturers sedulously cultivate literary history , and our recent
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	prospers well , especially in spreading the knowledge of Bohemian literature . ''

		The death of the poet
Julius Zeyer	PERSON	has been a '' great loss to Bohemian letters , '' and has occasioned numerous critical estimates of his work .

		The novel of the day '' has been influ - enced by foreign psychological and social romances . ''

		Among its representatives are `` Lights of the Past , '' by Mr.
Simacek	PERSON	; '' Re - bellion , '' by Miss
Bozena Kuneticka	PERSON	; and the `` Angelic Sonata '' of Mr.
Merhaut	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Vrchlicky	PERSON	is to the front in both lyrical and dramatic composition . ''

		The Water Fairy , '' a new opera by Mr.
A. Dvorak	PERSON	, is mentioned here , partly for the sake of Mr.
J. Kvapil	PERSON	's libretto , which is distinctly a literary work .

		Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	, speaking of Danish literature , reports a tendency of fiction to become his - torical , or otherwise objective .

		The veteran novelist .

		Professor
H. F. Ewald	PERSON	, has added ''
Lisbeth Torbensdatter	PERSON	'' to the list of his '' big historical novels . ''

		Works by younger writers include ''
Ale Langskjaegs Saga	PERSON	, '' by
Herr P. V. Hammer	PERSON	; '' Adelbrand and Mal - fred , '' by
Herr Jacob Knudsen	PERSON	; '' Crumlin '' -LRB- a Cromwell story -RRB- , by
Herr Carl Ewald	PERSON	; and ''
Enevold Brandt	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Svend Leo	PERSON	- pold .

		These are works of historical fiction .

		The novelists who have chosen to write of modern life have given us '' Daily Bread , '' by
Herr E. Soderberg	PERSON	; `` The Springs , '' by
Herr Z. Nielsen	PERSON	; '' The Unpardonable Sin , '' by
Herr E. Egeberg	PERSON	; '' Lille Rodhsette '' -LRB- Little Red Ridinghood -RRB- , by
Herr Henrik Pontoppi	PERSON	- dan ; ''
Seksten Aar	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Karl Larsen	PERSON	; and '' Deeds of the Heart , '' by
Herr Sven Lange	PERSON	. ''


Herr Mylius Erichsen	PERSON	has undertaken the task of describing in a large work the heath districts of Jut - land , which are now disappearing fast under the plough - share and the tooth of the harrow . ''

		Poetry has done better than fiction in Den - mark during the past year .


Herr Valdemar Rordam	PERSON	's '' Den Danske Tunge '' is a volume of noteworthy verse , '' pervaded by a remark - able sensitiveness , yet fortified by a manly spirit . ''


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	has produced an Icelandic drama called '' Half red
Vanroia	PERSON	- deskjald . '' ''

		Violin , '' a narrative in verse by Mrs.
Blicher-Clausen	PERSON	, is the work of '' the first female poet of any importance we have had . ''

		Two new translations of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are now in course of publication .

		In literary history , three important works are noticed : Dr.
V. Andersen	PERSON	's great biography of Oehlenschlager , Dr.
Schwanenfliigel	PERSON	's life of Bishop Mynster , and Professor
Bogh	PERSON	's biography of
Christian Winther	PERSON	.

		M.
Jules Pravieux	PERSON	's account of the year in French literature is long and interesting .

		He begins with the theatre , and the recent revival of M. Sardou 's '' Patrie , '' following by an ac - count of a play based upon Daudet 's '' La Petite Paroisse . ''


M. F. Vanderem	PERSON	's `` La Pente Douce '' is '' charming in its unerring analysis , the veracity of the characters , the sincerity of their actions , the grace of their talk . ''

		Of `` Les RemplaQantes , '' by
M. Brieux	PERSON	, we read -- '' The energy and occasional success with which
M. Brieux	PERSON	attacks the most burning questions of the hour are familiar .

		In this play he studies one of the evils of our society : he brings forward wives who leave their husbands , their children , and their village to go to
Paris	LOCATION	to take the place of mothers , to enter as • nour - rices ' into rich families . '' ''

		La Course du Flambeau , '' by
M. Paul Her	PERSON	- vieu , gets the most attention from the present writer . ''

		His mysterious and bizarre title is a reminiscence of a Platonic idea and of a well-known verse of Lucre - tius .

		Generations pass on the earth and transmit to each other the torch of life , like the runners in the ancient ceremonies : -- ' Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt . '


M. Hervieu	PERSON	, in a very close but simple action , of which the general effect is a little sad , has developed the idea that affection does not hark back ; that mothers love their daughters more than they are loved ; that the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 heart , like the mind , always looks towards the future ; that we are attached by a stronger bond to our children than to our parents ; and that , if a crisis in family life obliges us to choose between the two , we prefer to side with our children , as the law of nature has decided . ''

		Other conspicuous plays are '' La Veine , '' by
M. Alfred Capus	PERSON	; '' Les Medicis , '' by
M. Henri Lavedan	PERSON	; and * ' Pour I ` Amour , '' by
M. Auguste Dorcbain	PERSON	.

		In fiction , we have works by MM .

		Bourget ,
Zola	ORGANIZATION	, Theuriet ,
Rosny	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Pouvillon	LOCATION	, and others .

		No work by
M. Bourget	ORGANIZATION	shows more clearly the influence of
Taine	PERSON	than his novel '' Un Homme d'Af - faires . '' ''

		Le Fantome '' is a second novel by the same author .

		Of
M. Zola	PERSON	's `` Travail '' we read that it '' Is a vast poem celebrating human labour .

		Work is for the individual what fertility is for the species -- the means of existence .

		The thesis is developed on a large scale ; the volume is stuffed full of life , as usual with
M. Zola	PERSON	; it exhibits his great talents for descrip - tion , his art of evolving and moving masses of men ; but it is composed on too ample a scale , it shows sym - bolism grown gross , and carelessness in style . ''

		M. Theuriet 's novels are '' Illusions Fauchees '' and '' La Petite Derniere . ''

		The MM .

		Rosny have published '' Le Chemin d' Amour , '' a story of modern observation which has not , however , essentially '' altered their romanticism and pantheism . '' ''

		The book of
M. France	LOCATION	, *
Monsieur Bergeret	PERSON	k
Paris	LOCATION	, ' is simply a masterpiece , like its predecessors .

		Our language has never been so perfectly written , with such artistic avoidance of exaggeration , such sure ex - pression of thought in every detail .


M. Bergeret	PERSON	judges with clear-sightedness and moderation the troubles ' which
Paris	LOCATION	exposes to his view , and finds in the his - tory of olden time the explanation of almost every human circumstance .

		In `` Voeu d'etre Chaste , '
M. Pou	PERSON	- villon attacks a decidedly delicate and difBcult question .

		His work is beautiful , penetrating , sad , and movingly truthful , and his characters are vigorously conceived .

		Problems of conscience , painful and serious , are here well put before one , not as abstract theories , but as im - perious realities . ''

		Other novels are '' La Carriere d'Andre Tour - ette , '' by
M. Lucien Muhlfeld	PERSON	; ''
Une Flambee	LOCATION	d' Amour , '' by M. Masson-Forestier ; and '' La Fleur de Joie , '' by Mme.
Daniel Lesueur	PERSON	.

		The greatest of living French poets ,
M. Sally	PERSON	-
9	DATE	BS ^ B > J ^ VBbi ^ h 0WMV ' ■ * i5x > ^ = - ^ ^ ^ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ i '' In his ' Testament Po ^ tique ' of this year shows strong irritation against the innovators who are attempting to transform traditional metres ; and , although he is at pains not to be too rough with them , they have made him feel rather more than out of temper .

		He endeav - ours to set up against their pretensions a scientific theory demonstrating the excellence of the Parnassian metre . ''

		Other poetical productions are the `` Voix Humaines '' of
M. Louis Sauty	PERSON	, the `` Vers le Soir '' of
M. Albert Merat	PERSON	, the `` Fleurs d'Aube '' of Mme.
Madeleine Paul	PERSON	, and the '' Stances '' of
M. Jean Moreas	PERSON	.

		Literary history and criticism have rarely been better represented in
France	LOCATION	than during the past year . ''

		M.
Emile Boutronx	PERSON	has given ns the best and most profound study on
Pascal	PERSON	yet written .

		He has taken up his work in a spirit of respectful admiration , but he possesses the critic 's weapons , and it is as a learned scholar relying on documents that he has analyzed the * Provincial Letters ' and the ' Thoughts . '

		He has been careful not to yield to a common temptation and make
Pascal	PERSON	into a philosopher . ''


M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	has dealt '' With old poems and ancient legends in his ' Po ^ mes et L ^ gendes du Moyen Age , ' works which derive an agreeable flavour from their antiquity alone ; tales al - most infantine , but revealing ingenious meanings and far-off thoughts to those who can decipher and under - stand them .

		These bygone tales M.
Paris	LOCATION	tells with a delightful charm , a delicate sense of their intimate poetry , a reverential feeling which is contagious . ''

		Other important works in this department are '' Le Theatre Fran9ais avant la Periode Clas - sique , '' by
M. Rigal	PERSON	; '' Le Theatre Fran9ai8 et Anglais , '' by
M. Charles Hastings	PERSON	; a volume of essays by
M. Rene Doumic	PERSON	; `` Les Ecri - vains et les Mceurs , '' by
M. Henry Bordeaux	PERSON	; '' Les
Romanciers Anglais Contemporains	PERSON	, '' by
M. Blaze	PERSON	de Bury ; and two books on
Ras	PERSON	- kin , by MM .

		Jacques Bardoux and
H. J. Brunhes	PERSON	.

		Among books of historical scholar - ship , the following are important : ''
Fouche	PERSON	, '' by
M. Louis Madelin	PERSON	; '' La Noblesse Fran - 9aise sous Richelieu , '' by M. le
Vicomte G. d'Avenel	PERSON	; and '' Les Tron9ons da Glaive , '' by the MM .

		Paul et
Victor Margueritte	PERSON	.

		The last-named book has almost the interest of a novel .

		It is concerned with the war of
1870	DATE	, and '' revives with an intimate sense of tragedy events which did not seem capable of being represented except by large exterior masses . ''

		A few other works of scholarship may be men - tioned .

		They are
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	's '' Prob - lemes Politiques du Temps Present , ''
M. Emile Boutmy	PERSON	's ''
Essai d'une Psychologie Politique	ORGANIZATION	da Peuple Anglais au XlXeme Siecle , ''
M. Theodore Ruyssen	PERSON	's ''
Kant	PERSON	, ''
M. Jean Finot	PERSON	's '' Le Philosophic de la Longevite , ''
M. G. Dumas	PERSON	's '' La Tristesse et la Joie , '' and Mlle >
Lucie Faure	PERSON	's ``
Newman	PERSON	and the Oxford Movement . ''

		M. Pravieux concludes his paper with the following remarks : '' I can , at all events , attempt without undue temerity to discover the common tendency of writers of to-day .

		You meet , I think , almost everywhere an aversion to the conventional , the artificial , and a patient and per - 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, sistent search for nature , reality , and truth .

		Three writers , whose works in different degrees express this tendency , have left their mark on the living generation --

		Perhaps these three men will continue to influence the opening century .

		Perhaps their glory will be eclipsed by the arrival of some great genius who will open unexplored ways to the French spirit and will produce masterpieces .

		We must wait ; it is for the future to speak . ''

		The report of German literature made by Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	is concerned almost wholly with the drama , the novel , and the poem .

		The various departments of scholarship are not represented at all , and the only books dis - cussed outside of belles-lettres are the ''
Jugen	PERSON	- derinnerungen '' of
Herr Heyse	PERSON	and
Bismarck	PERSON	's '' Briefe au Seine Braut uud Gattin . ''

		Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	opens with such general reflections as these : '' The literary revolution which
Germany	LOCATION	experienced in the nineties directed the author only too vehemently to a diligent study of the external world .

		The contrary opinion is now gaining ground ; it is only in self - communion that the artist can unlock his world .

		The power of moving the souls of others is granted only to that which the soul has itself experienced .

		A dim con - ception of this new yet immemorial truth is now assert - ing itself high and low in our literature , and points the way to new aims .

		Already we speak of a New Ro - manticism ; but for the present that is merely a mean - ingless title for a newly awakened longing to which an adequate fulfilment has not yet been vouchsafed . ''


Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's ''
Michael Kramer	PERSON	, '' which has proved a failure on the stage , is thus characterized : '' Father and son , both artists , stand opposed to each other in this drama ; they divide the interest .

		The scanty action of the piece turns wholly on the son ; he is ruined by his want of energy and by his paltry ex - cesses .

		The physical deformity which has accompanied his entrance into the world has made him malicious and cowardly , reticent and mendacious .

		As far as the dra - matic action is concerned , the father is a mere specta - tor , but psychologically he stands in the centre of the play .

		The death of his son affects him as a psychical experience ; the majesty of death confronts him , and awakes in his bosom tones which have slumbered there for many a day ; with this grief his being ripens towards its consummation .

		One feels that the play was written for the sake of this inner revelation ; personal experi - ence is reflected in it and has taken shape perforce . ''


Herr Rosmer	PERSON	's '' Mutter Maria '' is another subjective play , a '' fairy poem '' of striking originality .

		`` It is a Song of Songs on motherhood ; in its pages the mother 's joy exults , the mother 's anguish mourns .

		An ice-maiden who dances with her sisters on the snow - peaks of a glacier , has been discovered by a huntsman , who has held her in his embrace and thereby kissed her heart to life ; he has fallen a prey to death as the result .

		Now she feels drawn towards the earth , and the sight of the Mother of God , hewn out of the rocks by a hermit , gives her the first presentiment of a new - born human perception .

		Death joins her on her journey towards the valley .

		She has to fight with him for the possession of her child when , solitary and forsaken , she sinks down by the wayside in the hour of giving birth ; she overcomes him .

		The consecration of motherhood comes upon her , but at the same time there awakes in her bosom the old , defiant , pagan sentiment of revolt against God ; the power of Nature , which , according to all the tradition of fable , knows naught of God , is strong within her . ''

		This is only a part of the story , the description is too long for full quotation .

		Of
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann 's '' Johannisfeuer '' we read : `` A young fellow who is betrothed to the squire 's daughter feels himself passionately drawn towards a young girl whom this squire has out of pity taken into his own house and brought up as his own child .

		On the Eve of St.
John	PERSON	the two , regardless of the vow they have taken , overstep the bounds of propriety , yield to their passion , and then -- separate once more in a feeble resignation , she to fare abroad , he to return to his bride . ''

		In spite , however , of the power of these sub - jective and symbolic productions , the writer is constrained to admit that an objective piece ,
Herr Erich Hartleben	PERSON	's '' Rosenmontag , '' has scored the greatest stage success of the year .

		Other plays of note are ''
Der Sieger	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Max Dreyer	PERSON	; '' De
Junge Goldner	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Georg Hirschfeld	PERSON	; '' Der Tag , '' by
Herr Stephan Vacano	PERSON	; `` Die Zwillingsschwester , '' by
Herr Ludwig Fulda	PERSON	; '' Hockenjos , '' by
Herr Jacob Wasserman	PERSON	; and ''
Der Retter	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Carlot Gottfried Reuling	ORGANIZATION	.

		It appears certain from the summary here presented that dramatic writing is now more than ever the vital form of German literary art , and that even
France	LOCATION	may soon have to look to her laurels in this field .

		In fiction ,
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	's ''
Aus Spjitherbsttagen	PERSON	, '' a volume of short stories , is called '' perhaps the most important appearance of the year . ''

		Next in importance is
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	's novel '' Freigeboren , '' which '' is perhaps his best work which he has given us -- his most inti - mate book , at all events . ''

		Other works of fiction are '' Die Geschichte der
Jungen Renate Fuchs	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Wassermann	PERSON	, -LRB- which makes one think of ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	'' -RRB- ; '' Der
Tod Georg	PERSON	's , '' by
Herr Beer-Hoffman	PERSON	; ``
Frau Bertha Garlan	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	;
Herr	PERSON	von Ompteda 's ''
Monte Carlo	PERSON	, ''
Herr von Polenz	PERSON	's '' Liebe ist Ewig , '' and
Frau Vie	PERSON	- big 's `` Das Tagliche Brot . ''

		Poetic energy in modern
Germany	LOCATION	is so absorbed by the stage that little is left for lyricism .

		The only volumes of verse that seem worth mentioning are the `` Reigen '' of
Herr Hugo Salus	PERSON	, and the `` Neues Leben '' of
Herr Karl Henckell	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 78 t ^ t ithj gooks .

		UNCIVILIZED `` Civilization . ''

		* Rarely or never does so much actuality creep into a history of any kind as Mr.
A. Henry Savage Landor	PERSON	has incorporated in his account of the proceedings of European nations , aided by the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, in
China	LOCATION	dur - ing the recent Boxer outbreak .

		With the best will in the world , few historians deal with such facts at first-hand and while they are still vivid in the memory .

		Writing in a closet , affairs take on another aspect , time is given for the working out of historical theories , and actuali - ties are made to conform to them as to the conventions and view-points of the age .

		Writ - ing as Mr.
Landor	PERSON	writes , -- himself an eye - witness , and in most cases , like ^ neas .

		a part of what he describes , -- the reader needs to do little besides make due allowance for the per - sonal equation , and the thing itself is within his grasp .

		Those who will read ''
China	LOCATION	and the Allies '' in the light furnished by the author 's former book , `` In a Forbidden Land , '' will find a large part of this personal equation already formu - lized .

		The rest of it may be pieced together from the pages of the latter book .

		A frank - ness of statement and an almost childlike reve - lation of likes and dislikes bear witness to Mr.
Landor	PERSON	's education away from
Saxon	LOCATION	reticence and self-containment .

		He attributes the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising wholly to what he calls the '' Lamas '' of
China	LOCATION	, the Buddhist priests of the nation .

		By attributing to these individuals all the evil qualities which human nature at its worst can take on , he contrives to throw the responsibility for Christian massacres and miseries wholly apon their shoulders .

		To make his point clearer , he refrains from dwelling on the provo - cations , in the way of land-grabbing and dis - regard of ancient superstitions , which , in the opinion of most thoughtful people , make the
Boxer	PERSON	movement a national one , animated by the same sort of chauvinistic patriotism which is being cultivated so sedulously by the govern - ments of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		It seems cer - tain that , even were there such beings as Chinese ' * Lamas , '' no preachings and pleas could have obtained so great a following for their anti-foteign ideas if there had not been fertile soil ready for the germination of the *

		seed he believes them to have sowed .

		In any event , travellers of authority , from the earliest days to so recent a book as Mr.
Archibald Little	PERSON	's '' Mount
Omi	PERSON	and Beyond '' -LRB- reviewed in The Dial of
July 16	DATE	last -RRB- , have borne abundant testimony to the radical differences between the Buddhism of
China	LOCATION	and the
Lama	LOCATION	- ism of Thibet and
Mongolia	LOCATION	, attributing to the Chinese priests professing belief in the doc - trines of Buddha a temperance in all things which contradicts Mr.
Landor	PERSON	's sensational statements and more sensational drawings .

		It would almost seem that here he is wreaking vengeance for the miseries he was forced to undergo in Thibet .

		The blame attached to the '' Lamas '' for the uprising is borne in part , however , by Sir
Claude Macdonald	PERSON	, British plenipotentiary at Peking , for not attaching sufficient importance to what Mr.
Landor	PERSON	perceives to be significant premonitions of approaching trouble .

		The attack upon this diplomatist is so bitter that it leaves an impression of personal animus .

		It would be unfair to the author to aver that such is the case , but it is certainly true of other men in the book who receive excoriation at his hands , the proof being from his own pen .

		The sufferings of the missionaries , which are set forth in considerable detail , go to show that no European nor American in
China	LOCATION	foresaw the extent of the revolt against foreigners and their ideas , plain as the indications of them now appear to be .

		The charity extended to the missionaries might have been granted to Sir
Claude	PERSON	, with advantage to the book .

		The first of the two large volumes which comprise the present work is taken up with the story of the march of the Allies to Peking .

		From its beginnings until Mr.
Landor	PERSON	rode by the side of the Russian General
Linievitch	PERSON	into the
Forbidden City	LOCATION	, the indefatigable his - torian was in the thick of everything , -- on the firing line , with the looters , in the camps , at th
$ head	MONEY	of the advancing column , always manifesting a ubiquity which must have been more than annoying to the commanders of the expedition .

		But it enabled the busy young man to secure photographs of actual scenes of plunder and carnage , which he reproduces here ; and war never saw its most hideous naked - nesses more boldly exposed , for civilization and Christianity to shudder over .

		The moral is as plain as that of the pictures of Mr.
Verestchagin	PERSON	painted in the
Philippines	LOCATION	within the twelvemonth .

		The same characteristic which leads men , 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, under the plea of patriotism , to conceal from the public eye things that need correction , has led to reports of looting on the march to Peking , in which each correspondent depicts his coun - trymen as blameless while all the other nations among the Allies were robbing the Chinese with both hands .

		This pot-and-kettle pro- cedure does not avail with Mr.
Landor	PERSON	, whose words become the more authoritative because he enters upon a general justification of all looting in the campaign , wherever prevailing and under whose hands soever .

		With satire wholly unintended , he even goes so far as to differentiate the various tastes in loot shown by the assembled Christians and Japanese .

		The French , it appears , desired food more than anything ; the Japanese , bric-abrac ; the Germans , substantial articles of many sorts ; the Russians , anything they could get their hands on ; the British Indians , fine textiles and embroideries ; and the Americans , gold and silver in lumps .

		The Americans , he avers , were the untidiest robbers of the crowd , picking up perhaps a priceless bit of porcelain and dropping it to the floor rather than make the exertion of replacing it on its shelf .

		Russians , the soldiers we place lowest in the scale of general intelligence , and Americans , the sol - diers we place highest , were the most complete devastators of goods and property of all sorts at
Tientsin	LOCATION	, where most of the plunder was secured .

		But here , as elsewhere , Mr.
Landor	PERSON	clears the skirts of the Russians from the charges of indiscriminate cruelty to natives made by correspondents of other nations .

		His words would bear more weight if he had not received the notable favor from the Russian commander which made him the first English - speaking person to set foot in the
Forbidden City	LOCATION	of Peking , just as his charges against the
American General Chaffee	ORGANIZATION	would bear more weight if that officer had not refused him the same privilege .

		The second volume is occupied with a day - by-day account of those beleaguered men and women in Peking whose sufferings were so acute and were borne with such sturdiness through the dismal weeks while the Allies were fighting their way onward .

		This , of course , is compiled from the accounts of others rather than given at first-hand ; but it bears evidences of thoroughness , and is not less in - teresting than the story of the march , though equally unpolished .

		Mr.
Landor	PERSON	pauses to wonder how it could be possible for the news - papers of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	to blazon abroad the death of the German Minister ,
Baron von Keteler	PERSON	, on
June 16 , 1900	DATE	, when his actual assassination did not take place until
June 20	DATE	, four long days afterward .

		The orig - inal news , Mr.
Landor	PERSON	says , was sent out from
Shanghai	LOCATION	or Chefoo , and evidences a con - spiracy which was not put into execution until later .

		It seems more likely that the story emanated from the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and was born , like the account of the
Russian de Giers	ORGANIZATION	's death by boiling in oil , in the brain of an imaginative newspaper writer named
Charles Douglas Almy	PERSON	, formerly in the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and stationed in Chinese waters .

		Mr.
Landor	PERSON	's book , large as it would have been if no extraneous matter had been included , contains a long account of his travels in
China	LOCATION	ten years ago , in the first volume , and an equally long history of the Ming dynasty , in the second .

		These portions , like the others , are wholly lacking in what is usually called style , but possess rugged force and unques - tionable interest nevertheless .

		The best chap - ter of all in point of picturesqueness and vigor , is given up to an account of the American assault on the gates of the
Forbidden City	LOCATION	.

		To the American soldiery is given credit for personal intelligence and valor , but for nothing else ; and in spite of the strong Russian pre - possession noted , the Japanese bear away the palm for soldierly bearing , general efficiency , and discipline , -- everything in short which goes to make up '' civilization '' in its belliger - ent and least lovely aspect .

		* With all the pains in the world , doubtless we never shall be able to '' account '' for genius in any shallow sense .

		Yet the modern scien - tific spirit , with '' heredity '' and '' environ - ment '' for its chief con jure - words , demands of biography that it shall give us every minutest detail , not only of the life of the genius him - self , but of his ancestors , collaterals , and sur - roundings of whatever nature .

		Formerly , a few lines and mere dates sufficed as history of parentage .

		Moreover , the kind of evidence admitted has * Shakespeare 's Family .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 76 changed entirely .

		Formerly , gossip and tra - dition , with liberal use of the imagination in making deductions , if they succeeded in work - ing up a life-like and '' readable '' tale , were not too closely scanned or investigated .

		Now , nothing is taken on trust , but all must be based on documentary evidence , with copious foot - notes for verification .

		Perhaps the most striking illustration of this change is furnished by the history of Shakes - peare biography .

		For two hundred and twenty - five years after the poet 's death , his dozens of biographers , from
Nicholas Rowe	PERSON	to
Charles Knight	PERSON	, accepted the
Stratford	LOCATION	gossip collected by
Betterton	PERSON	three-quarters of a century after
Shakespeare	PERSON	had been laid in his grave , and derived from it more or less conceivable ac - counts of what might have happened , what he probably did , the people he was likely to have known , etc. .

		This went on until about
fifty years ago	DATE	, when Halliwell-Phillips , ignoring the previous accumulation of hearsay and im - agination , issued a '' Life '' based on document - ary evidence of various kinds , chiefly registers of births , deaths , baptisms , wills , mortgages , and the like .

		Since that new departure , the trend has all been along the same line , until now we have an octavo volume of 250 pages devoted to ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	's Family , '' of which only about twenty-five pages - have to do with the man
William Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		Only a con - firmed Dryasdust would apply the word '' read - able '' to this work , yet every Shakespeare student will wish to have it in his library as a reference volume .

		There is almost no allusion to the plays and poems which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote ; it is in no sense a literary biography .

		Any expectations of this kind are banished by the Preface , wherein the author states : '' It is only the genealogical details of certain War - wickshire families of which I now treat , and it is only as an interesting Warwickshire gen - tleman that the poet is here included . ''

		Chief among these families , naturally , are the Shakespeares and the
Ardens	LOCATION	; but there is also much interesting matter relating to the
Hathaways	LOCATION	, the Quinceys , the Halls , and vari - ous cousins and connections .

		The origin of the name Shakespeare itself , though hidden in the mists of antiquity , is held to have been con - ferred in the first place for valor in feats of arms , and
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	is quoted in proof that it was so understood by his contemporaries .

		See - ing that no other poet of his time had an `` heroic name , '' doubtless the allusion in ''
Colin Clout	PERSON	's Come Home Again '' -- '' Whose Muse , full of high thought 's invention .

		Doth like himself heroically sound , '' -- refers to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		As to the much-disputed spelling of the name , the author adopts '' Shakespere '' for the early families of the period when spear was spelt '' spere '' ; and `` Shakespeare '' when spear was spelt '' speare , '' as it was in the sixteenth century .

		Moreover , this latter form was the Court spelling of the period , as shown by the first official record of the name ; and it was also the spelling suffered to pass by the author him - self in correcting the proofs of the '' first heirs of his invention , '' in
1593	DATE	and
1594	DATE	.

		The fact that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself sometimes varied , counted for little then .

		He might have held romantically to the quainter spelling of the olden time , as did many others , such as '' Duddeley , '' '' Crumwell , '' ''
Elmer	PERSON	. ''

		Conclusive evidence is brought to show that by the Spear-side the poet 's family was at least respectable , and that by the Spindle-side his pedigree can be traced straight back to Guy of
Warwick	PERSON	and the good
King Alfred	LOCATION	.

		For the chief original discovery claimed by our author is that she has found at last a defi - nite link of association between the Park
Hall Ardens	PERSON	and the
Wilmcote Ardens	PERSON	, and hence that the descent of Shakespeare on his mother 's side is from one of the most nationally interest - ing of all English families .

		Great Norman families who '' came in with the Conqueror '' are numerous enough , but there are few that claim to be '' merely English '' who have such a record to show as the Ardens .

		The first noble victim of the tyrannical
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	of
1583	DATE	was
Edward Arden	PERSON	, Sheriff of his county in
1575	DATE	.

		Whether or not , as the author suggests , '' it is more than probable that the active part that Sir
Thomas Lucy	PERSON	took in the arrest of
Arden	LOCATION	told more on the fortunes and feelings of young Shake - speare than the fabulous deer-stealing story , '' certainly the circumstances were sufficiently touching and tragic to have made a powerful impression on a sensitive youth of nineteen .

		Although the victim is praised by contemporary writers and was pitied by all
Europe	LOCATION	,
Froude	PERSON	and other historians have given small space to the cruel story .

		Our author condenses the account from the
State Papers	ORGANIZATION	thus : ''
Edward Arden	PERSON	seems to have been highly respected , but he had offended Leicester by refusing to wear his livery -LRB- as many of the gentlemen of the county were proud to do -RRB- and by disapproving openly of his rela - tions with the Countess of Essex before her husband 's death .

		Leicester waited his time ...
Edward Arden	PERSON	T6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, was a temperate follower of the old faith ; but his son - in-law ,
John Somerville	PERSON	, an excitable youth , seemed to chafe under the increasing oppression of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	and its adherents .

		The evil reports concerning the Queen and Leicester increased the friction .

		Shut out from travel or active exercise , as all Catholics then were by law , his mind seems to have given way in his sleepless attempts to reconcile faith and practice .

		He started off suddenly one morning before anyone was awake , and at the inns on the road spoke frantically to all who chose to hear , saying he was going to
London	LOCATION	to kill the Queen .

		Arrest , examination , imprisonment in the Tower followed .

		Thereafter went forth the mandate to arrest
Edward Ardeu	PERSON	, his wife , and his brother ,
Somerville	LOCATION	's wife and sister , and his wife 's grand-uncle .

		Examinations , probably under torture , followed fast on each other , and
John Somerville	PERSON	and the Ardens were found guilty and condemned to the traitor 's death .

		On
December 19 , 1583	DATE	,
Somerville	LOCATION	and
Arden	PERSON	were carried forth from the Tower to
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, in preparation for their execution on the morrow ;
Somerville	LOCATION	was found two hours afterwards strangled in his cell ;
Edward Arden	PERSON	suffered the full penalty of the law
December 20 , 1583	DATE	.

		Robert of
Leicester	LOCATION	had his revenge .

		Mrs.
Arden	PERSON	and
Francis	PERSON	, the brother , seem to have suffered a term of imprison - ment , and then to have been released ... The traitor 's lands , of course , fell to the Queen . ''

		The book makes some attempt to solve the mystery of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's occupations during those years of his early manhood when he went up to
London	LOCATION	seeking to make a place for himself .

		But nothing new seems to have been discovered , and all is still surmise , with a probability that his first firm step on the staircase of fame was taken in the publication of Shakespeare 's '' Venus and Adonis , '' by his old
Stratford	LOCATION	friend ,
Richard Field	PERSON	, in
1593	DATE	, and his first grip of success in his dedication thereof to the young
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume has fifteen illustrations , most of them familiar , but forever charming , since they are reproductions of such picturesqueness as the old Arden house at
Wilmcote	LOCATION	,
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	's cottage at
Shottery	LOCATION	, the
Snitter	PERSON	- field Church , and

		which , probably , in some degree , he must share the glory of English achievement .

		And for this knowledge he must resort to the anthro - pologist and the folklorist , who , fortunately , have not been idle .

		In Professor
Rhys	PERSON	's handsome volumes we have an invaluable collection of materials for the study of Celtic folklore , together with a discussion of some of the important questions connected with the subject , from one whose knowledge gives his words great weight , the professor of Celtic at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		No consider - able publication on the subject of
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	folk - lore has appeared since the modest volume of the late Rev.
Elias Owen	PERSON	-LRB- '' Welsh Folk-lore , a Collection of the Folk-tales and Legends of
North Wales	LOCATION	'' -RRB- , published in
1896	DATE	.

		In this volume Mr.
Owen	PERSON	confined himself to the fairies , stories of Satan , ghosts , witches , con - jurors , charms , omens , '' spiritualism , '' death portents , and birds and beasts ; reserving the holy wells for a later volume which he was destined never to publish .

		Professor
Rhys	PERSON	has restricted himself still more narrowly .

		He deals in the main only with the fairies and their kindred , witches and magic , the calendar , holy wells , the belief in submerged cities , cave - legends , and place-name stories .

		His material he has drawn from all over
Wales	LOCATION	, but princi - pally from the western counties of
Carnarvon	LOCATION	,
Merioneth	LOCATION	, and Cardigan .

		Flint and
Radnor	LOCATION	contribute nothing , and to
Montgomery	PERSON	he owes only a reference to
Owen	PERSON	's book concern - ing the corpse candle .

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	believes , however , that if the other counties were to be worked as thoroughly as
Carnarvon	LOCATION	has been , the results would be almost as rich ; the angli - cising counties have hitherto been disregarded from both Welsh and English points of view .

		Let us hope this theory will prove correct .

		Although Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	began collecting folk - lore more than twenty years ago , he has had cause to regret that he did not begin sooner .

		In many instances he could get only scraps of stories which it took him years to learn how to piece together .

		The causes of the disap - pearance of folklore from the principality have been interestingly discussed by Mr.
Hartland	PERSON	in his introduction to '' English Fairy and Other Folk Tales . ''

		In view of all the causes that have operated in
Wales	LOCATION	to root out the old beliefs , we are inclined to consider the present collection reasonably large .

		The chief obvious fault of this work is its inconsistent arrangement , partly by correspond - ents rather than by topics : a defect due to the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		77 manner in which the book grew .

		Portions of the material appeared several years ago in the publications of the Cymmrodorion and Folk - lore Societies ; and when the author came to re-arrange these papers for the present work , his materials had been greatly augmented , and he found that to re-cast the whole properly would require more time than he could then give .

		This drawback , however , we are glad to find has not kept him from issuing the complete work , which a full index renders usable .

		A large part of the work is given up to the fairies , '' the richest lode to be explored in the mine of Celtic folklore . ''

		The fairies largely originated , the author concludes , '' in the demons and divinities , not all of ancestral origin , with which the weird fancy of our re - mote forefathers peopled lakes and streams , bays and creeks and estuaries . ''

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	certainly makes out a strong case for this theory , in demonstrating the close connection of the fairies with rivers , green isles , the marshes , and the mountain mist .

		He is not blind , however , to the fact that the water - divinities can not be the fairies ' only ancestors .

		The fair water-goddesses can have little in common with the short , swarthy , '' stumpy men , occupying the most inaccessible dis - tricts '' ; and any theory which postulates a common ancestor for the Lady of the Van Pool and the thieving red fairies of Merionethshire is to be regarded with suspicion .

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	might perhaps have brought out more sharply than he has done the distinction between the fairies proper and the elves .

		It is really the elves whose ancestors are searched for in the discussion of race questions arising in connec - tion with fairy lore .

		In the swarthy fairies Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	sees the lowest stratum of the primi - tive population to which we can reach -- a dwarf race , possibly kindred to that found in
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		They were superseded by the Picts , of Libyan or possibly Iberian affinities , to which probably belonged the great family groups of the Mabinogion and corresponding Irish tales .

		This race in turn yielded to and probably amalgamated with the invading Goidelic and later Brythonic Celts .

		These , however , are only conjectures which Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	thinks may be established in the future .

		In the chapter on cave-legends , also , Pro- fessor Rhys returns to a favorite subject , the Arthurian story , pointing out that Welsh folk - lore represents
Arthur	PERSON	as passing in Faery the time which must elapse before his return .

		Lack of space forbids mention of many other inter - esting points .

		The book furnishes another good example of the light which folk-tales and beliefs under the analysis of a trained mind can be made to throw on the early ages of the world .


Clark Sutherland Northup	PERSON	.

		The Tribulations of a Princess .

		* It is now some two years since '' The Mar - tyrdom of an Empress , '' with its curiously intimate reminiscences of the hapless Elizabeth of
Austria	LOCATION	, created so widespread an interest both in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Speculation regarding the authorship and consequent au - thenticity of this memoir , rife at the time of its publication , will be revived by the anony - mous author 's recent venture , '' The Tribula - tions of a Princess . ''

		The publishers announce that the new book is autobiography ; but it is doubtful whether or not its thrilling narrative furnishes any solution , save that of a dilemma , for the problem of '' who 's who . ''

		For if we assume that the author is the grande dame of her story , five of whose portraits embellish the book , then half
Europe	LOCATION	should recognize her , and the secret of her identity , which she has naturally been so careful to guard , is , or will soon be , an open one .

		So this theory seems untenable , though the strongly-drawn person ^ ality of the princess , and the easy and familiar style in which her life-story is recounted , lend considerable color to its hypothesis .

		If , again , we regard the autobiography as wholly or in large part a fabrication , then of course all comment upon the relation between this and the earlier work is superfluous .

		And it is surely not as a mere side-light upon the other volume that '' The Tribulations of a Princess '' should be considered .

		To begin with , this book is far better written than the other .

		The rather prolix newspapery style of the

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, reader with a taste for history sugar-coated with couversation can gratify his longing .

		The present critic belongs , it may as well be con - fessed , to the other party , to whom it is a relief that here for the most part the skeleton of un - signed history -LRB- '' How much of this is only gossip of the antechamber ? '' -RRB-

		may be locked safely out of sight , and that we have merely a rapid and well-sustained narrative of Austrian and Russian court-life , which , according to his taste and as he weighs the evidence , the reader may regard seriously as strict fact or more lightly as fiction , with little to gain or lose either way .

		For in either case the Princess Marguerite -- known as ''
Muzzi	PERSON	'' to her Austrian and Russian friends , including the Czar -- is cer - tainly a fascinating personage who can look back upon a very eventful career .

		Her early life is passed in a chateau in
Basse-Bretagne	LOCATION	, where , after nine years of joyous , outdoor life , in close comradeship with her father whom she adores , she is suddenly informed by her tyran - nical Russian mother that she is a girl , and not , as she has always supposed , a boy .

		So Pierrot becomes
Marguerite	PERSON	, to her own , and somewhat also to the reader 's , bewilderment .

		This change and her father 's death are her first great sorrows , both terribly enhanced by her mother 's cruelly abrupt fashion of an - nouncing them .

		This mother is the bad angel of the chron - icle , the dominating figure of its first part . ''

		Talented , witty , with that sharp , caustic , merciless wit which often cuts like the lash of a whip , she was singularly entertaining and clever , and yet somehow I never felt easy when I was with her , and I avoided her as much as possible ... Yet I admired her deeply a distance , and used to be very proud when I heard com - plimentary remarks made about the perfection of her tea-rose skin , her flashing black eyes , and her long raven hair . ''

		This is the point of view of the child Pierrot , which changes first to a more firmly grounded distrust of the merciless and malicious beauty , and finally to bitter hatred and absolute es - trangement , after the full perfidy of her moth - er 's conduct in forcing her to marry an Austrian prince , twenty-one years her senior , whom she justly hates , dawns upon the sixteen-year-old
Marguerite	PERSON	.

		It is from this experience that the young prin - cess gets her cynical abhorence of all women save the
Empress Elizabeth	LOCATION	, whom she meets through her Austrian marriage , and who be - comes her only confidante .

		In spite of a dis - parity of years , there are many ties between them -- their love of horses and of the hunt , of the sea , the mountains , and the country , the bitter experience that came to each in youth , and the indomitable courage with which each is bound to front the world and cheat it if may be .

		A characteristic little scene between the two takes place one morning when ''
Muzzi	PERSON	'' has been disciplining an unruly steeple-chaser .

		The Empress rides up just in time to applaud her victory over the obstinate brute .

		** ' This is a very high-spirited horse , ' I said , laugh - ing a little , well pleased with such praise , ' but he is not really bad ... He understands every word one says . ' ''

		It was her turn to laugh .

		`` Get off , little one .

		I am going to have a try myself , ' she added , slipping from her saddle with that inimitable and exquisite grace of movement which was all her own . ''

		` Oh , do n't , please , ' I cried impulsively ; ` he is dangerous sometimes , and what a thousand shames it would be if he were to mangle you ! ' ''

		`` How about yourself , then ,
Muzzi	PERSON	?

		Would it not be a shame , too ? '

		she remarked tentatively , laying her narrow , slightly tanned hand on ' The Chief 's ' mane . '' '

		I would be glad if he did , ' I said , impulsively . ''

		The Empress looked at me wistfully , but she said nothing , and with a shrug of my shoulders I jumped down , and held out my hand for the reins of the superb hunter from which she had just dismounted . ''

		It is such perfect understanding and silent sympathy as this that wins the heart of the unhappy Xou ° & exile .

		Her love of lonely out-door life stands her in good stead when , soon after her marriage , she goes into camp with her husband on the desolate Austrian frontier .

		One day she absent-mindedly rides across the boundary , and is pursued by a fierce band of Cossacks , whom she escapes by making a fearful jump over a stream which forms the boundary-line .

		A day or so later , as she is dining out , a Cossack officer , '' not dreaming of course that the heroine thereof was sitting across the table from him , '' tells the story .

		He concludes his recital laughingly by saying : '' ' My men were quite staggered when they saw that pretty she-devil fly across the river as if both herself and her marvellous steed were endowed with wings .

		... I myself would give much to know who this little imp of Satan was . ' '' ''

		I was that imp .

		General ! ''

		mischievously announces
Muzzi	PERSON	; and the laugh is on the amazed officer .

		Another of
Muzzi	PERSON	's thrilling escapades is the mission she undertakes to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, to secure the release of an innocent man from
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		In her excitement she informs the Czar of all the Russias that he '' must do something '' for her protege .

		79 '' • Must f ' said the autocrat , drawing himself up and gazing at me with rising anger . ''

		The princess is angry too , but a moment later she sees the ludicrousness of the situation and succeeds in making the Czar see it too , so effectively that she and her servant are soon driving through the unbearable cold of a Siberian winter , carrying the Czar 's release for the convict .

		During all the years of her marriage with Prince
Karl	PERSON	, the princess is genuinely miser - able , in spite of the gay round of pleasure and excitement in which she lives .

		At last Karl falls in a disgraceful duel , leaving her free to marry a young Englishman .

		At this point the book closes , with a hint of more to come later .

		* The second volume of Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	's great Bible dictionary has followed promptly at the end of one year .

		The general plan and purpose of the Encyclopaedia was fully stated in a review of Vol .

		I. in The Dial of
March 1 , 1900	DATE	.

		The editors have varied slightly from the original plan , namely , to give an ex - position of the '' advanced criticism '' of the day .

		The second volume 's advance over its predecessor is in the direction of a still more radical position on many critical and doctrinal questions .

		Dr.
Cheyne	PERSON	's scholarship and literary skill have moulded the entire volume .

		Of the 559 signed articles , he wrote all of 322 , and parts of 47 others .

		These facts are ample proof of the critical ability and scholarship that stamps the work .

		His versatility is seen in the range of themes on which he writes , rang - ing from '' Iron '' to '' Faith , '' from * •
Jero	PERSON	- , boam '' to ''
John	PERSON	the Baptist '' and '' Judas . ''

		His straightforward , bold method of treating the text , his freedom to amend and change such readings as seem necessary to his critical judgment , are everywhere apparent .

		The opinion of others is respected , but Dr.
Cheyne	PERSON	as editor does not neglect to give utterance to the latest and most-advanced position on each theme treated .

		D.D. , and
J. Sutherland Black	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, LL.D , Volume IL , E. to K.
New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the most notable articles in the present volume are ''
Egypt	LOCATION	'' by
W. Max Miiller	PERSON	, '' Eschatology '' by
R. H. Charles	PERSON	, '' Gospels '' by
P. W. Schmiedel	PERSON	, ''
Israel	LOCATION	'' by
H. Guthe	PERSON	, ''
Jerusalem	LOCATION	'' by
G. A. and W. R. Smith	PERSON	and
C. R. Conder	PERSON	, and ''
John Son	PERSON	of Zebedee '' by
P. W. Schmiedel	PERSON	.

		The two articles , * '
Egypt	LOCATION	'' and ''
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, '' are espe - cially valuable from the historical and geo - graphical point of view .

		They give us the latest researches , and each is accompanied with a fine colored map -- a most welcome aid in a book like this .

		The longest article in the volume is '' Gos - pels , '' covering 137 columns , or more than 68 pages , by Prof.
Schmiedel	PERSON	of
the University of Zurich	ORGANIZATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		This article is very exhaustive .

		The author discusses the synoptic problem with great ability , but his premises and methods of reasoning will arouse sharp antag - onism .

		He proceeds on an assumption -LRB- col. 1872 -RRB- that from the outset would practically rule out the credibility of the gospels .

		The chronological matter is worthless , and the testi - mony of Christ 's disciples on the basis of the premise laid down above is always suspicions .

		But he does find nine passages which are credible , '' which might be called the founda - tion pillars for a truly scientific life of Jesus '' -LRB- § 139 -RRB- .

		His scientific life , from the drift and open statements of the article , would make him an extraordinary man , whom tradition has dei - fied and worshipped .

		The article on Jesus by the late Prof.
O. B. Bruce	PERSON	occupies but twenty columns , or ten pages , and is too brief .

		Its tenor is too ambiguous ; the author neither occupies the radical position of '' Gospels , '' nor that of the same article in
Hastings	PERSON	's '' Diction - ary of the Bible . ''

		One of the most useful aids to the
Bible	LOCATION	student offered in this volume is the superior grade of maps inserted in their proper places .

		These are elegantly executed and brought strictly up-to-date .

		The '' Encyclopaedia Biblica '' may not prop - erly be termed a dictionary of the
Bible	LOCATION	, but a register of the most advanced criticism of the day as set forth by Swiss , German , Dutch , British , and American scholars .

		This is now the established sphere of this work , rather than that of setting forth the consensus of progressive scholarship on all topics that are of value and interest in the study of the Scriptures .

Aug. 1	DATE	, Briefs on New Books .

		The name of Mr.
Martin A. S. Sp	PERSON	^ nthpfoX
Hume	PERSON	has already become familiar to the readers of popular history as a contributor to those publications which , issued in the form of a series , purport to supply historical information especially arranged for the general public .

		In
1897	DATE	he wrote a life of
Raleigh	LOCATION	for the '' Builders of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	'' series ; last year appeared his '' Modern
Spain	LOCATION	'' in the '' Stories of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' and now he comes forward again as the author of the first volume in a '' Great Peoples '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The only novelty claimed for this new enterprise by the editor , Mr.
York Powell	PERSON	, is that the various numbers are to be writ - ten by experts ; not by men of mere literary gifts , comparatively unfamiliar with the topics assigned them .

		This is a back-handed and seemingly unjust aspersion upon other similar series , and it remains to be seen whether the result shall justify the se - lection of the expert , for the editor disclaims for the series any intention of supplying exact history .

		It is , he says , '' not so much a set of political or military or even social histories , as a sequence of readable studies on the tendencies and potencies of the chief peoples of the world . ''

		If this is the pur - pose , the publication of Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's '' The Spanish People '' as the initiatory volume was not judicious .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	is unquestionably a careful student , thoroughly familiar with the field in which he labors , but he is writing too much and too rapidly .

		His ''
Raleigh	LOCATION	'' showed discrimination , and con - tained some new matter on the trial and execution of his hero ; his `` Modern
Spain	LOCATION	'' was without question a hurried labor indifferently performed ; while this last volume , though it gives evidence of the author 's knowledge and research , is on the whole less suited to the purpose of a popular series than was either of the other two .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	un - derstands , perhaps better than any other modern writer in English , the causes of Spanish develop - ment and decline .

		He appreciates the supreme importance of geographical and ethnological char - acteristics , without a knowledge of which the history of
Spain	LOCATION	is but a confused jumble of unreasonable contentions .

		He insists with truth that it was the individuality of diverse races in separate localities which gave to
Spain	LOCATION	the power and splendor of magnificent achievement under the direction of a wise government .

		He exhibits the Inquisition as , in the beginning , a creative , not a destructive , in - stitution , essentially popular with the masses , and working in harmony with individual initiative .

		Religious fanaticism was , in fact , as great a cause of national development in
Spain	LOCATION	as in
England	LOCATION	; but , unfortunately for
Spain	LOCATION	, the Inquisition ulti - mately destroyed its ally and became the tool of a despotic government .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	states these ideas , but states them piecemeal , in separated chapters and paragraphs , in the midst of a mass of weari - some details of the petty political mancevures , as - T/iree great democratic Americanx , sassinations , poisonings , or intrigues , with which Spanish history is replete , and the condensed re - counting of which serves only to confuse and weary the mind of the reader .

		The progress and develop - ment of the Spanish people are so brought out that the careful reader , with labored effort , may achieve a correct conception ; but the mass of detail and incident preclude a clear impression for the average reader .

		The author states that he has not written a history , but a general survey ; yet the text denies the promise of the preface . ''

		The Spanish People '' is essentially condensed history , accurate but un - interesting .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	is an expert in the sense of the editor 's announcement ; but a just criticism of this work must emphasize the fact that another form of expert ability is also essential in the writing of a work primarily intended for popular reading .

		At a time when Americans seem more than usually disposed to forget that they have a past from which the highest ideals ever known to a sovereign people are to be derived , the publication of three volumes in the `` Riverside Biographical Series '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , standing for as many phases of our national development , assumes educational importance .

		The volume on
William Penn	LOCATION	is by Mr.
George Hodges	PERSON	, who within his ratlier contracted limits contrives to paint a firm and well-realized portrait of a man whose example Americans have never departed from without harm .

		Penn dealt justly with the Indians , and was rewarded by their affection , re - spect , and fidelity .

		Most of all he was the first to announce the broadest principles of civil and reli - gious liberty in the organic acts he prepared for the government of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, a step in advance which his successors have yet to bring to perfect fruition .


Penn	LOCATION	is clearly seen as a religious zealot who tempered his principles by participation in politics , thereby extending the influence of those principles far beyond the sphere of his personal influence .

		He was loyal to his friends , and never thought them wrong , suffering rather all his life for the preservation of his ideals .

		-- Mr.
Henry Childs Merwin	PERSON	, in his sketch of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, has given the world a brief and fully sympathetic account of that great statesman which is free from adoration on one side and rancour toward
Hamilton	PERSON	and his followers on the other .

		Perhaps the final test of any writer 's comprehension of Jefferaonian principles is made by the acceptance of his polity that government should always stand in moral fear of the governed ; and here Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	does not waver .

		He is free to criticize
Jefferson	PERSON	both politi - cally and personally , following a useful precedent which has left the author of the Declaration the most human figure among the Fathers of the Re - public ; but his fine comprehension of the man and his acceptance of the doctrine of self-government make the book an illuminating one .

		Interesting at the present time is the first declaration of the policy known as the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, showing it

		to have limitations upon
America	LOCATION	as well as upon
Europe	LOCATION	in the phrase declaring the need for '' a meridian ... on the hither side of which no European gun shall ever be heard , nor an Ameri - can on the other . ''

		-- The volume on
Peter Cooper	PERSON	, by Mr.
Rossiter	PERSON	``
W. Raymond	PERSON	, lacks the sympathy for the political principles peculiar to its subject , notable in its predecessors ; but this is the only omission to be complained of .


Peter Cooper	PERSON	stands to-day as the American most noted for his intelli - gent benefactions to the cause of education , and the reason is made clear by his biographer .

		In giving , he did not deprive himself of a little of his substance , retaining more than sufficed for his needs , but rather pinched himself to give , -- accumulating by piecemeal , for example , the property on which the
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	now stands .

		-- in order to make his gift as efficacious as possible .

		Penn stands as the democrat of the colonial ,
Jefferson	PERSON	of the early national , and
Cooper	PERSON	of the first great commercial epoch in American history ; and all represent a vital and moving force and sympathy , without which the New World were the mere appanage , morally and socially , of the Old .

		The series on '' Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- has now reached the number of fifteen volumes .

		They are of very unequal merit .

		No one of them is without value : the great number of illustrations , the careful catalogue of works arranged according to galleries , the lists of dates and documents , -- these and one or two other fea - tures will always make them useful handbooks .

		For general convenience they seem to us to be rather superior to the Knackf uss series of Kiinstler-Mono - graphieu , some numbers of which have been trans - lated .

		The Knackfuss books have more illustrations as a rule , and cost less money ; but their arrange - ment is not so convenient , certainly for purposes of reference .

		So the present series is one which an art-student will want to have .

		Some of the volumes are excellent , as , for example , Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's monograph on
Velasquez	ORGANIZATION	, which we noticed some time ago .

		But other volumes are clearly not up to the mark , -- for instance , the volume on
Luca della Robbia	LOCATION	by the
Marchesa Barlamacchi	ORGANIZATION	, which ap - pears to us to lack any real appreciation of
Delia Robbia	PERSON	as it certainly lacks any excellence in pre - sentation .

		It is not clearly conceived , and it is expressed in very poor English .

		The cause of the latter failing may perhaps be that the lady is an Italian , -- we know nothing to the contrary , -- but even if this is the case , an English editor should have been careful to make the text comprehensible at a first reading .

		Somewhat more satisfactory , certainly better written , is the volume on Sodoma by the
Contessa Prinli-Bon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
`` Williamson	PERSON	, the editor of the series , has been more successful in his own books than in some of the others .

		The second of his own volumes , that on
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	, appears to be quite as good as the one on
Luini	PERSON	.

		Neither is of the highest kind of art criticism , for neither arouses much interest ; but both are of a kind very useful to the art-student who has gained elsewhere enthusiasm and appreciation of bis subject .

		More interesting on the whole , and not less critical , is the volume on Pintoriccio by Mr.
E. March Phillips	PERSON	.

		The subject is not especially fascinating , but it is so handled that we regret the author had not more important material .

		Mr.
A. B. Walkley	PERSON	, the author of ^ J ^ ^ ^ / ZL ^ `` Frames of Mind '' -LRB- published in
England	LOCATION	two years ago , and now imported by
M. F. Mansfield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is not unknown in this country , chiefly as one interested in what may be called new developments in literature .

		He furnished , for instance , an introduction to the trans - lation of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' Treasure of the Humble . ''

		His '' Frames of Mind , '' so far as this book records them , are mostly , though not all , induced by books and plays .

		We have , for example , short essays -LRB- the book is a collection of work already published -RRB- on
Pinero	PERSON	, and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	as a dramatist ; on
Forbes Robertson	PERSON	's '' Hamlet , '' and
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	's ; and notes on
Anatole France	LOCATION	in his `` Histoire Contemporaine , '' and on
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' Wisdom and Destiny . ''

		Not that Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	neglects older work , -- he is a good deal interested in Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, -- nor that his '' Frames of Mind '' are all literary , for not a few of them are reminiscences of holiday and travel .

		His book is amusing to one who is interested in the things he writes about , although he can not exactly be said either to strike any '' new note '' or to pre - serve the staid conventionality of the critical essay .

		These bits are the light-hearted and light-handed weekly writing for the newspaper of which there is so much nowadays , though not all of it is as good AS this .

		Now and then one comes across a good idea , although it is apt to belong to the thing dealt with rather than to the dealing with it , -- as in the conception of '' Hamlet '' as the curious , inquiring man of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Still , Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	is by no means without ideas , and his turning about of current literary themes may occupy a
summer	DATE	hour very pleasantly .

California	LOCATION	; addresses on various public occasions , educational , political , and literary ; and at least one speech of more than usual power , delivered at
Santa Cruz	LOCATION	on the day before the last Presidential election , in which radical ground is taken against the imperialistic policy of the present administration .

		The speech evinces careful preparation , and is in a sense a classic upon that still burning question of political ethics and policy .

		One of the interesting legal questions con - sidered by Mr.
Delmas	PERSON	was , whether a court has the power to make and enforce an order forbidding 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, the publication of the proceedings of a trial pend - ing before it .

		He contended that it had not , and was sustained in this position by
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of
California	LOCATION	.

		The case is fully reported in Volume 99 of the
California	LOCATION	Reports .

		His descrip - tion of a political '' boss '' before a jury is especially scathing , and his eulogy of the late United States Senator White is an eloquent tribute to an eminent statesman of the
Pacific	LOCATION	slope .

		The '' Speeches and Addresses , '' of which there are sixteen , show the author to be a lawyer of more than average ability , and to possess the power of oratory in a marked degree .

		His utterances are well worthy of preser - vation in this permanent form .

		The volume con - tains a good portrait of the author , and is published by

A. M. Robertson	PERSON	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Indeed , it is doubtful if completer literary expression could enhance the clearness of the outlines which the youthful author has chosen for his expression of undergraduate life .

		The ad - vantages of a coeducational institution over the unisexual type , like Vassar or
Harvard	LOCATION	, is manifest when it comes to the inclusion of a romance along with the more ordinary proceedings of a university , and Mr.
Lichtenstein	PERSON	has done very well in per - mitting a pretty love-story to attach itself to his narrative .

		In addition , there are pages of athletics , the hero being on the football team -LRB- in contrast with the college novels of a generation ago , which always made their principal character an oarsman -RRB- , and a chosen leader among his fellows , though without influence , either of money or social status , beyond his own personality .

		The rivalry with the neighboring
University	ORGANIZATION	founded by the late
Senator Stanford	ORGANIZATION	is made to lend interest throughout the work , and the part played by college customs , already crystallizing into institutions , finds expres - sion .

		At the same time the emulation in more quiet , and scholarly pursuits are not permitted to go by default -- though the interest here is by no means 80 great .

France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and far - off
Japan	LOCATION	, the architecture of which latter country receives sympathetic treatment at the hand of Mr.

		Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	's own historical knowledge and lucidity of statement appear to ad - vantage in this volume , both in the shorter defini - tions and descriptions and in sections of the articles on the architecture of a number of the countries referred to .

		Mr.
Blashfield	PERSON	's article on mural painting is interesting in its exposition of ways and means , and in the critical notes and comparisons .

		It is a long step from mural painting to house - drainage , but that a work like the present would be incomplete without treating of both serves to show the extent of territory covered in the practice of architecture .

		Mr.
William Paul Gerhard	PERSON	, in his article on house-drainage , suggests that the matter is of so great importance that it should be left to specialists .

		But in all large cities , and most small ones , the lines are laid down so rigidly in the sani - tary regulations that the architect and the sanitary engineer are held to about the same course of action .

		Mr.
Gerhard	PERSON	's article enunciates the prin - ciples and tabulates certain desirable and necessary data .

		The criticisms previously offered in these columns upon the execution and selection of certain of the plates and cuts used in illustrating the former part of this work hold , though perhaps not so broadly , in the case of the present volume .

		The article on
India	LOCATION	, the architecture of which is so distinctive in its character , is not illustrated at all , though the field is so fertile in beautiful and readily procurable examples ; while the architecture of
Mexico	LOCATION	receives abundant illustration , especially from the examples which might properly enough be given under the general head of Spanish Archi - tecture .

Hjalmar Edgren	PERSON	and
Percy Burnet	PERSON	, and pub - lished by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a welcome improvement upon school dictionaries of the ordinary type .

		It is representative of the best modem philo - logical scholarship , and its intelligent use of phonetic marks and other symbols makes possible the introduc - tion of a great deal of helpful information for which one would consult most dictionaries in vain .

		Stress is laid upon the three features of phonetic pronunciation , sound etymologies , and the dates of the earliest appear - ance of French words in the language .

		The editors have not been afraid of inserting proper names and irregular forms in the alphabetical series , for which many perplexed students will be grateful .

		We note one necessary criticism .

		A prefatory table gives us the astonishing information that `` five francs to the dollar is the par of exchange , which fluctuates from time to time . ''

		Now fluctuation is the one thing which is im - possible to a par of exchange , and the relation between the franc and the dollar is not to be expressed so simply as that .

		Einglake 's ''
Eothen	ORGANIZATION	'' forms a welcome volume in the ```` Temple Classics '' series , imported by the Mac - millan Co. . ''

		A
Laboratory Course	ORGANIZATION	in Plant Physiology , '' by Dr.
William F. Ganong	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new novel by Dr.
James Ball Naylor	PERSON	, author of ``
Ralph Marlowe	PERSON	, '' vrill be issued next month by the
Saalfield Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume III .

		of Dr.
Orello Cone	PERSON	's series of '' Inter - national Handbooks to the New Testament , '' including Hebrews , Colossians ,
Epbesians	LOCATION	, etc. , has just been pub - lished by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		`` A Little Book of Tribune Verse , '' by the late
Eugene Field	PERSON	, extracted from the files of the
Denver	LOCATION	'' Tribune '' by Mr.
Joseph G. Brown	PERSON	, is published by Messrs.
Tandy	ORGANIZATION	,
Wheeler & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Denver	LOCATION	.

		It is announced that the music publications of Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, including the '' Modem Music Series '' and its complementary books , will hereafter be issued under the imprint of
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,
Bnrdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Roswell Field	PERSON	's story '' The Passing of Mother 's Portrait , '' published in a recent issue of the '' Atlantic Monthly , '' is soon to be issued in book form by Mr. W ^ illiam
S. Lord	PERSON	of

		Crazes ,

		The book is excellently named , and plain speaking , combined with plain sense , are its conspicuous virtues . ''

		The Legend of Sir Lancelot dn Lac , '' by Miss
Jessie L. Weston	PERSON	, is Volume XII .

		of `` The
Grimm Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		The origin , develop - ment , and position of this work in the Arthurian cycle are the matters considered in this excellent monograph . ''


Japan	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' is a new monthly paper , edited by Mr.
Stanhope Sams	PERSON	, and published in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Its contents are half English and half Japanese , the latter , being printed in roman characters .

		Indeed , one of the chief aims of the paper is to popularize this particular innovation . '

		`` The Chevalier de St.
George	PERSON	and the
Jacobite Movement	ORGANIZATION	in bis Favour , '' edited by Mr.
Charles S. Terry	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	, is a narrative , ingeniously pieced together from contemporary sources , of one of the most fascinating movements in English and Scotch history .

		We are very much opposed to the abridgment of works of literature for school purposes , but if ever the process is justifiable , it is m the case of such a book as ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
C. H. Jones	PERSON	, at any rate , has thought the work justifiable , and has performed it with much skill .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers . ''

		The Current Encyclopedia , '' issued by the
Modem Research Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, is a new monthly publication designed to deal , in encyclopedic manner , with the topics that are uppermost in the public mind .

		It has the Rev.
Samuel Fallows	PERSON	for editor-in-chief , and has provided itself with an excellent staff of contributors .

		There will be two volumes a year , and the indexing will be cumulative until a volume is complete .

		The 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, first number , dated
July	DATE	, makes a very creditable showing , although history and politics seem to get a disproportionate share of attention .

		This inequality , we are promised , will be remedied in subsequent issues .

		Beginning with
September	DATE	, the publication of '' Shakespeareana , '' a quarterly periodical conducted by
The Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, will be resumed .

		The Society also announces its thirteenth publication , '' The Sonnets and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Rival Poet , with a Reprint of
Chapman	PERSON	's Related Poems , '' by Mr.
Arthur Acheson	PERSON	.

		The volume will be issued late in
October	DATE	, in the usual limited edition .

		A most attractive and satisfactory edition of the complete works of
Charles Stuart Calverley	PERSON	is pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in connection with Messrs.
George Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The volume contains a photogravure portrait , and an extended biographical notice prepared by Sir
Walter J. Sendall	PERSON	, editor of the `` Literary Remains of
C. S. Calverley	PERSON	, '' and a long - time friend of the poet .

		The report of the
Aguilar Free Library Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York City	LOCATION	for the past two years has just been issued , and shows a record of remarkable progress in an excellent work .

		The Society maintains four free libraries , which are mostly situated in poor and densely populated sections of the city , and which show a large increase in circulation each year .

		The open shelf sys - tem is now used in all of these libraries , and each one has a reference room and also a children 's room .

		Dur - ing the past two years 45,767 readers have made use of the main reference room .

		It seems that
John Fiske	PERSON	, at the time of his death , was at work upon ''
New England	LOCATION	and
New France	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, '' the one work needed to make his historical series practically complete from the Discovery to the Revolution , This work would doubtless have been finish - ed long ago had not the author 's attention been diverted by the enterprise called the '' History of
All Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' under the editorship of Professor
Wright	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		This series of volumes , twenty-four in number , will appear in the
Autumn	DATE	, and for it
Fiske	PERSON	wrote the three volumes devoted to the history of the New World .

		BRIEFER MENTION Ill NOTES Ill LIST OF NEW BOOKS 112 A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE .

		n.
Greece	LOCATION	is a country from which we do not expect much literary work of cosmopolitan interest , and the report by Professor
Lambros	PERSON	mentions hardly a name that is familiar to our public .

		One exception to this statement may be made for Mr.
D. Bikelas	PERSON	, who has formed a Society for Useful Books , '' with the aim of publishing a volume for the people every month .

		Well printed and bound , and very cheap , these books have been published in great numbers , and ought to encourage the taste for reading . ''

		Among works of scholar - ship , we may mention '' Greek Proverbs , '' by Professor
N. Politis	PERSON	; the concluding volume of a '' History of
Athens	LOCATION	under the Turkish Dominion , '' by Mr.
D. Kamburoglus	PERSON	; a '' His - tory of
Crete	LOCATION	from the Earliest Times to the Present , '' by Mr.
B. Psilakis	PERSON	; and '' Political Studies , '' by Mr.
Leon Melas	PERSON	, in which latter work '' the Bulgarian question and the privi - leges of the
Greek Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Turkey	LOCATION	are con - sidered . '' ''

		In the department of belles-lettres `` The Healing Plant of Love , ' by Mr.
G. Drossinis	PERSON	, a really fine novel ; the tender collection of verses • Alabastra , ' by Mr.
Johannes Polemis	PERSON	; and the substantial poems of Mr.
S. Martzokis	PERSON	, seem most worthy of mention .

		• The Death of the Palikares ' is a weighty poem by Mr.
Konstantin Palamas	PERSON	. ''


Heer Steyn Streuvels	PERSON	has already been men - tioned in these summaries by Professor Fred - erieq , and Mr.
C. K. Elout	PERSON	, writing from
Holland	LOCATION	, discusses him at much length as the one important new writer of the year . ''

		He is the true peasant 's poet , representing not the old
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	, unreal school , nor the modern , gloomy pessimism of which M. Zola 's ' La Terre ' is a grand expression , but a sound , warm-hearted , though cool - brained poetical conception of reality .

		He has neither enthusiasm nor disdain for the peasant ; he looks upon him as a thing of nature , which deserves our attention as much as a tree or a cloud or a meadow , and even more than these because there is a human sonl in the case ... Besides , this simple young Flemish baker has a language of his own .

		He knows Dutch very well , apparently , but he adds to it with archaisms and peasant expressions .

		His language is not Flemish , however , but most decidedly Dutch -- as sound and sane a Dutch as Vondel ever wrote , only with the great advantage of linguistic riches from neighbouring stores . ''

		96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	,
Heer van Eeden	PERSON	's '' The Limpid Lakes of Death '' is a novel which illustrates '' psychol - ogy , culminating in absolute ` pathology . '' ''

		The young lady who is the biproine of this novel ends in placid tranquility , after i > assing through the basest phases of a woman 's life .

		I ^ is , however , notice - able that van Eeden never passes the limits of decency in this book .

		An ultra-realistic aiitlor would , no doubt , have painted the abject doings of such a woman as his heroine in harsher colours .

		Van Etden is content with mere hints , and elaborates only the pathological side of the ease . ''

		\ Three rather important worlds of fiction deal with life in the Dutch Indies , j
Heer Couperus	PERSON	, in his ''
Stille Kracht	PERSON	'' -LRB- Sileijt Power -RRB- , '' Tries to present an impression of the sullen , passive resistance that colonial officials of ^ en meet with from the coloured population , and the mysterious powers this population employs , such as the inexplicable throw - ing of stones by invisible hands , to show that silent resistance .

		In the opinion of mapy Indian readers
Couperus	PERSON	has failed to give a strong Impression of these manifestations ; but his book has caused a certain sen - sation , as it treated a question which happened to be the topic of the day -- the influence of Indian climate , Indian surroundings , and Indian life on Europeans .

		Couperus seems to be one of those who consider life in the tropics a degrading influence on Suropeans , a vul - garization of the higher European character . ''


Heer B. Veth	PERSON	's '' Life in
India	LOCATION	'' is described as '' a perpetual depreciation of everything and everybody in
India	LOCATION	, an uninterrnpted series of sneers and harsh language . ''


Heer H. Borel	PERSON	's ''
Recht	PERSON	der Liefde '' -LRB- The Laws of Love -RRB- is the '' story of a young European woman in
India	LOCATION	, whose life at first slowly trickles away in the hot climate of a town on the Indian coast , but then gets a new impulse in the fresh air and the grandeur of the mountains . ''

		A few more novels are ''
Langs Lijnen	ORGANIZATION	van Gele - idelijkheid '' -LRB- Along Lines of Graduality -RRB- , by
Heer Couperus	PERSON	; '' Vlindertje '' -LRB- Butterfly -RRB- , by
Heer Borel	PERSON	; `` Getrouwd '' -LRB- Married -RRB- , by
Heer van Hulzen	PERSON	; and ''
Vreugden	PERSON	van Hol - land '' -LRB- The Joys of
Holland	LOCATION	-RRB- , by Heer Has - pels .

		The last named writer '' Is the literary leader of a new monthly which started a couple of months ago . '

		Onze Eeuw ' -LRB- Our Century -RRB- represents a reaction against the progressive views which our leading periodical , ' De Gids , ' has taken of late as regards social life and literature .

		There are a good many professors on the editorial committee , and the first articles were rather heavy , even to our Dutch taste . ''

		On the stage , the successful productions of the year have been '' Op Hoop van Zegen '' -LRB- Hoping for Luck -RRB- , by
Heer Heyermanns	PERSON	, and '' Vier Ton , '' by
Heer De Koo	PERSON	.

		Writing from
Hungary	LOCATION	, Mr.
Leopold Kat	PERSON	- scher reminds us that the author of '' St.
Peter	PERSON	's Umbrella '' is '' the very best of contemporary Hungarian novelists . ''

		This year he has pub - lished '' A Strange Marriage , '' his longest novel . ''

		An historical background displays the adventures and divorce of a couple forcibly married against their wish by a clergyman who had seduced the wife . ''

		Other works of fiction include ''
Budapest	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Tamas Kobor	PERSON	-LRB- the beginning of a projected series after the Rougon-Macquart pattern -RRB- ; `` The Struggle of the Huns , '' by Mr.
Gyula Werner	PERSON	; '' A False Legend , '' by Mr.
Akos Pinter	PERSON	; '' Swamp , '' by Mr.
Istvan Barsony	PERSON	; '' That
Ass Domokos	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Dezso Malonyay	PERSON	; ''
Egers Stars	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Geza Gardonyi	PERSON	; and many collections of short stories , the best of which are Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's '' Tombstone Album '' and Mr.
Herczeg	PERSON	's ''
Arianna	PERSON	. ''

		The last-named writer , with his '' Ocksay the Brigadier , '' a historical drama , '' has scored by far the greatest stage success of the year -- indeed , in the whole history of the Hungarian stage . ''

		Speaking of stage matters , it is curious to note that Shakespeare 's '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' which our own stage - directors never consider seriously , has had thirty performances during three months at the Hungarian National Theatre . ''

		In poetry there is only one volume worth mentioning -- Mr.
Emil Makai	PERSON	's ' Poet 's Fate , ' a collection of fine verse combining mastery in rhyming with beauty of thought . ''

		A goodly number of works in literary and historical criticism are mentioned , the most important being the '' Ro - mance of My Life , '' by Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	; ''
Yester	PERSON	- day , To-day , and To-morrow '' -LRB- essays on contemporary writers -RRB- , by Professor
Bela Lazar	PERSON	; '' Diderot Studies , '' by Professor
Alex	PERSON	- ander ; '' A Hundred Years of the History of Hungarian Art , '' by Mr.
Tamas Szana	PERSON	; '' The Hungarian Nation Past and Present , '' by Mr.
Elek Benedek	PERSON	; '' The History of Hungarian Costumes , '' by Mr.
Geza Nagy	PERSON	; '' An Inter - national World 's Academy , '' by Mr.
Florence Kemeny	PERSON	; and '' Education in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Geza Somogyi	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	opens his report of Italian literature in a somewhat depressed strain .

		The past twelvemonth , he tells us , '' Presents a meagre balance-sheet , without any import - ant literary gain .

		The reason for this state of affairs , which has been more or less persistent of recent years , may be political as well as social .

		A certain dissatis - faction permeates the air , and casts over everything a subtle prepossession which can not be explained , but which unquestionably lays hold upon writers and turns them aside from imaginative speculation .

		They are not even conscious of the features of the new forms of art
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 that are being elaborated by the new century .

		While afraid of seeming old , antiquated men of the last age , they do not see clearly even the outlines of the writing of the future .

		The social and political anxieties of the past fatal year , added to artistic uncertainties , have certainly cramped both the creative development and the native enthusiasm of authors . ''

		An interesting statement is that '' in
Italy	LOCATION	everything is done by means of a movement . ''

		The movement at present is in the direction of dialect poetry , recited in public by the poets .

		The idea was started by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Cesare Pascarella	PERSON	, '' a most original Roman poet , a born inter - preter of the soul of the Roman plehsJ ' ^ '' It is a pity that his ''
Serenata	PERSON	' and ' The Discov - ery of
America	LOCATION	' can not be translated into English ; but this is out of the question , since the Roman dialect that gives savour to the whole would be lost in the process .

		And yet something would remain -- the originality of the fundamental idea . '

		The Discovery of
America	LOCATION	' is narrated at a wayside inn by one man of the people to another -- told , that is to say , in the fashion in which a modern Roman labourer would re - count it , with a series of entertaining anachronisms .

		... These sonnets of
C. Pascarella	ORGANIZATION	constitute the most brilliant literary success of the year .

		Since every one understands the Roman dialect more or less , the theatres were crammed with applauding auditors to hear him recite .

		This year in
Florence	LOCATION	the local
Societk di Letture	ORGANIZATION	had the happy thought of introduc - ing not only
Pascarella	PERSON	, but also the best among the other Italian dialect poets .

		Their example was imi - tated by other Italian cities , with the result that this year our dialect poetry has been honoured and noticed as it never was before . ''

		Another phase of this movement is presented by the
Italian Popular University	ORGANIZATION	which brings lectures upon various subjects within easy reach of the masses , who prove eager to avail themselves of the opportunities for culture .

		Turning to books proper , the writer calls our attention to the '' History of Italian Litera - ture '' -LRB- an illustrated work -RRB- , by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		B.

		E. Percops ; Professor

Arrigo Boito	PERSON	, both issued by
Treves	ORGANIZATION	, of
Milan	LOCATION	, tie publisher who seems to have the monopoly of
Italy	LOCATION	's best poetic and imaginative pro- ductions .

		To speak adequately of these two works would carry me beyond the limits assigned to my re - view .

		I will therefore only say that the ' Canzone di
Garibaldi	PERSON	' and the ''
Nerone	PERSON	' are the two most impor - tant works issued this year , and that the number of copies printed has been as large as the authors expected .

		Both are virile and original productions that have g ^ ven rise to long and impassioned discussions . ''

		Works of fiction include ``

		The procession of Polish literature of the year , '' writes Dr.

		Sienkiewicz 's jubilee can be compared only with that of Kraszewski some twenty years ago ; and it is characteristic of the present con - ditions of literature that the authors to whom such universal -- one might almost say colossal -- admiration has been paid are both writers of romance . ''


Herr Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's romance , '' The Knights of the Cross , '' is justly characterized as inferior to the great trilogy .

		The piece was widely advertised by its numerous allusions to persons well known in the literary world , and with a large section of the public its patriotic tendency secured it a hearty welcome .

		Among the ranks of our moderns Mr.
S. Przybyszewski	PERSON	beyond question possesses the most dramatic talent ; his latest play ` The Golden Fleece ' gives ample proof of this , but owing to its unbounded pessimism and gloomy atmosphere it finds few ready hearers .

		The older-established and noted hands among our dramatists have not recently produced anything of special consequence . ''

		Contrary to the original announcement , an article on Russian literature , by Mr.
Valerii Briusov	PERSON	, has appeared in a later issue of the '' Athenaeum , '' and may now be summarized .

		The death of the poet
Soloviov	PERSON	is the heaviest loss of the year in
Russia	LOCATION	, and our chronicle opens with mention of this fact , and with some account of the poet 's characteristics .

		Soloviov was both poet and philosopher .

		`` In his philosophical works he wished to justify the greatest revelation of Christianity , the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead .

		His poetry also reveals his philosophical ideas ; they do not , however , coarsely obtrude themselves in his verses , but light up his crea - tions from within . ''

		The poetry of the year includes much note - worthy work , such as '' Houses on Fire , '' by Mr.
C. Balmont	PERSON	; `` New Songs , '' by Mr.
N. Minski	PERSON	; '' Illusions , '' by Mr.
C. Fofanov	PERSON	, and a volume by Mr.
Golenistchev-Kutuzov	PERSON	, who '' remains faithful to the tradition of Pushkin , '' and who is called '' the poet of Buddhist creations . ''

		In fiction , the name of Mr.
Maxim Gorki	PERSON	is just now obtaining vogue in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, which gives special interest to the following account of '' Trio , '' his latest production : '' He draws in it the fate of three boys who have grown up in an alley in the midst of poor people , mur - derers , thieves , and prostitutes .

		One of the boys ,
Hya	LOCATION	, is always seeking for truth : he possesses capacity , and endeavors to fight his way to a pure life -- to live in such a way that no one can look down upon him .

		The second ,
Pavel	LOCATION	, is a meditative and poetic soul .

		When he grows up he loves a girl named
Viera	PERSON	with all the blindness of passion ; he marries her , and she , wishing to help him , robs a tradesman , and is sent to prison .

		The third ,
Yakov	PERSON	, is an unconscious philosopher ; even when a boy he surprises his companions by his questions , wishing to ascertain whence everything comes .

		In the tale are all forms of sin and crime , but one poor woman inquires , ' Who will remember God , if it is not the sinners ? ''

		The style is unequal .

		It is unfinished . ''

		Mr.
D. Merezhkovski	PERSON	has published '' The Gods Who Have Arisen , '' being the second part of his trilogy of novels , and dealing with '' the renewal of paganism at the epoch of the Renaissance . ''

		The secular conflict of ideas between
Hebraism	PERSON	and Hellenism is the general theme of this colossally-planned work .

		The most important drama of the year is '' The Three Sisters , '' by Mr.
Anton Chekhov	PERSON	. ''

		In his usual masterly way he represents in it all the terror , all the helplessness , of Russian town life .

		Works of erudition and important enter - prises in translation are described at consider - able length , but we must pass them by without further mention , concluding with this paragraph of both literary and political interest . ''

		Literary society during the past year has been agi - tated also by events which have no immediate relation to literature , but concern prominent writers .

		The ex - communication of Count
Lyof Tolstoy	PERSON	has aroused in many a sympathy with the veteran , who has been per - secuted for his ideas .

		Mr.
Maxim Gorki	PERSON	has been im - prisoned for his sympathy with the outbreaks of the students .

		The same fate has befallen the publishers of one of the best magazines , ' Life , ' the publication itself has been suppressed by order of the Ministers , against which there is no appeal .

		A number of other writers have been banished from the two capitals , among them Mr.
C. Balmont	PERSON	, the accusation against him being that at a literary evening he quoted some verses which had not been previously submitted to the censor . ''

		We fancy there is some connection between this banishment and the fact that Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- mont has not written , as in former years , the review of Bussian literature with which we are now concerned .

		Last of all , we come to the Spanish review of
Don Rafael Altamira	ORGANIZATION	.

		As ever , the Spanish intellect runs largely to historical investigation , and the critical editing of the great writers .

		With all this we have no space to deal , nor with the department of periodical literature , which exhibits much vitality . ''

		Yet if this literary vitality is a good sign , we are dis - couraged by the disappearance within a brief interval of
Spain	LOCATION	's most distinguished writers , whose recent deaths form a national misfortune : Riano , whose merits are well known to the readers of the ' Athenaeum ' and the whole English public ;
Balaguer	PERSON	, the historian of
Catalonia	LOCATION	and founder of the beautiful Museo-Biblioteca of
Villanueva	PERSON	and
Geltrii	PERSON	; the
Marquis of Valmar	ORGANIZATION	, one of our soundest and most eloquent savants ; Campoamor , the most thoughtful poet that
Spain	LOCATION	produced in the nineteenth century ; and , lastly , just as I am writing this article ,
Leopoldo Alas	PERSON	, one of the most original and cultivated of our modern authors -- novelist , critic , and philosopher -- whose powerful imagination has made a deep impression on the generations that have succeeded the Restoration . ''

		Coming to belles letfres , we read that the name of
Senor Galdos	PERSON	has been the most conspicuous of the year , and one of his productions has made a great stir .

		It is '' His play ' Electra , ' which the Liberal party , and es - pecially the anti-clericals , have taken up as a flag under which to fight the leligious reaction which really exists among us and defeids itself by forbidding Catholics to enter any theatre vhere the work is represented . ''

		Senor
Galdos	PERSON	has also published a fourth series of his ''

		In the realm -RRB- f fiction there is one event of the first importance t `` chronicle , the reprinting of `` La Regenta , ' by the lite
Leopoldo Alas	PERSON	, which for many has proved a work aitherto unpublished . '

		La Regenta ' has been rightly cescribed by all the critics as one of the best Spanish njvels of the nineteenth century , and some say that if it were relieved of a few incidents it would be the best . '


Senor Echegaray	PERSON	has produced a play , * ' El

		HAS COLLEGE ENGLISH IMPROVED ?

		-LRB- Ti the Editor of The Diai . -RRB-

		Is the standaid of English composition at American colleges as high now as it was twenty years ago ?

		Can the college mau of to-day write as respectable English as the college man of yesterday vrrote ?

		With a view to obtaining a satisfactory answer to these questions , a request for a leply to them was sent to the principal American colleges .

		Replies were received from most of the institutions , including
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	,
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	,
Wesleyan	LOCATION	,
Union	ORGANIZATION	,
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	,
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	,
Middlebury	LOCATION	,

Bowdoin	LOCATION	,
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	,
Ober	PERSON	- lin ,
Dartmouth	LOCATION	,
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Rutgers	ORGANIZATION	,
Stanford	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Of the replies received , over eighty per cent , said that college English had improved ; twelve per cent. , that there had been little if any improvement ; while less than eight per cent , asserted that the standard of composition was lower than that of twenty years ago .

		Most of the last-mentioned class found a cause for this deterioration in the increased prominence given to scientific over literary training .

		In one of the replies stating that the standard was no higher , a somewhat novel view was taken of what is meant by `` the college man . ''

		The writer said : '' I suspect that • the college man ' writes no better English than he did .

		• The college man ' is an abstrac - tion , an average of the men attending our American universities .

		He is therefore composite in his nature , being so many parts student of the liberal arts , so many of law , of meidicine , of agriculture , of forestry , of civil and mechanical engineering .

		No doubt the engineering portion of ' the college man ' is growing proportionately to the literary portion .

		Moreover , a larger percentage of American youth is in college nowadays , which tends to increase the portion coming from homes in which the reading habit and literary tastes have not become hereditary .

		It may well be , therefore , that the propor - tion of college men who write correct English has been diminishing during these two decades which have seen 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, so great an increase in the enrollment .

		Nevertheless , I am much mistaken if the actual dumber of students possessed of literary tastes and abl i to write correctly is not as large as , indeed , larger thsn , ever before . ''

		A note of warning is possibly soinded in this reply from a prominent college professor '' If the college student of to-daji writes poorer En - glish than in former years , a thing jf which I am not quite sure , I should regard the fict as a part .

		of a movement all along the line .

		It seems to me the spirit of and hunger for scholarship is not so great as formerly : scholarship , and with it literary tasti and ability , is at a , discount , and society and athletics ire on top . ''

		Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	,
United St.tes Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, is of course uncommcnly well qualified to speak on such a subject .

		To a le ter requesting his opinion , he replied : `` In my opinion , the college man of to-day writes much better English than did the college man of twenty or twenty-five years ago , or than tie college man of my time , which was forty-three years ago .

		There is less bombast in the college writing If to-day , and less sophomoric attempt at fine writing ;| and the attempt to adorn one 's pages with quotatmns from classic authors has almost entirely disappear sd , whereas in the time of
Edward Everett	PERSON	it was considered to be the proper thing .

		There is a much richeir style used now , because there is reflected in the style of the man a much broader view of the world and a wider gleaning from literary sources . ''

		If one will take the trouble to eximine the back numbers of the college magazines and compare them with current issues , he will find that in the latter the thought is not only more vigorous but also better ex - pressed .

		Considerable weight should
Ibe	PERSON	attached to this evidence , for here , perhaps , may be found the best • expression of college literary life .

		The comparison is the more accurate , too , because actual specimens of the • work are before the investigator , thusj removing the tendency to overestimate the past while j underestimat - ing the present .

		The answer to the question , '' Is the standard of col - lege English as high now as it was in the past ? ''

		does not concern itself as to what this standard is -- whether it be high or low .

		If it be true , as some assert , that men in the senior classes of our best colleges can not write a letter describing a foot-ball game without mak - ing blunders that would disgrace a boy of ten years , what sort of a letter did the senior who belonged to the class of
1875	DATE	write ?

		Was it a worse or a better one ?

		Whether the present standard is as high as it should be , is quite another question .

		In the opinion , however , of those in a position to speak with authority , the college student to-day writes better English than did the average student of twenty or thirty years ago .

		The Greek Thinkers axd Their Environment .

		*
Zeller	PERSON	's
Philosophie der Griechen.	ORGANIZATION	, already cited by
Grote	PERSON	and the scholars of the last generation as the chief authority in its field , and growing from edition to edition till it now fills six stately tomes , is a noble monument of German scholarship .

		But however indispen - sable to the professional student , it is not a book that can be read .

		The want of such a work is now being supplied by the Austrian Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	in his
Griechische Denker	PERSON	.

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	, in addition to a scholar - ship long since proved and tested in special researches , possesses many eminent qualifica - tions for his task .

		To begin with , he is not a Hegelian , but studies the history of philos - ophy from the only point of view possible in the twentieth century -- that of entire sympathy with and frank acceptance of the fundamental postulates of modern science .

		Secondly , he is well read in French and English literature , and is in particular a student and admirer of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	; and Mill , as would be ad - mitted by those who think that they themselves have outgrown him , is most salutary reading for a German savant .

		Lastly , his style , though to English and French taste a little flowery perhaps , is vigorous , picturesque , and thor - oughly readable .

		His second volume , dealing chiefly with
Socrates	PERSON	and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, is now being published in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The first volume , which treats of the Pre-Socratics , lies before us in the English translation of Mr.
Laurie Magnus	PERSON	, revised and warranted by the author .

		The Pre-Socratic philosophers are one of the most fascinating and tantalizing of themes .

		Plato , as
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	says , makes great havoc of our originalities .

		But already in
Plato	LOCATION	's time , as Pater reminds us , '' the very air was sickly with cast-off speculative atoms . ''

		We can only discern faintly the outlines of the systems from which these atoms fell , and fancy that we detect , in isolated , pregnant , and picturesque sayings , the germs of all the philosophies and sciences of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		But the impos - sible task of reconstructing the systems and determining the logical sequence of their thought and the detail of their content still tempts some in each new generation of schol - * Greek Thinkers .

		THE DIAL .

		101 ars .

		Common as the tale has become by repe - tition , the story of these early Greek thinkers still thrills with fresh surprise everyone who is brought to a vivid and first-hand realization of its significance .

		How could they , amid all their first groping , ignorance , and helplessness , without libraries , laboratories , systematic rec - ords , or instruments of precision , -- how could they , amid all their necessarily childish guesses , divine so much ? ''

		Verily , '' says Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	, '' the pen of the historian might hesitate where to begin or end if he endeavored to write an adequate account of the inexhaus - tible range of fundamental truth contained in the exaggerated statements of Heracleitus . ''

		* ' Any history of philosophy , '' says
Emerson	PERSON	, '' fortifies my faith by showing me that what I had supposed were the rare and late fruit of a cumulative culture , and only now possi - ble to some recent
Kant	PERSON	or Fichte , were the prompt improvisations of the earliest in - quirers , -- of Parmenides ,
Heracleitus	PERSON	, and Xenophanes . ''

		When the old Ionian thinkers --
Thales	ORGANIZATION	, Anaximander ,
Anaximenes	LOCATION	, Heracleitus -- resolutely shut out from their minds the shapes , grotesque and obscene , fantastic and beauti - fully wild , that had held in thrall the imagi - nation of early man , and set themselves to inquire '' concerning nature , '' about the causes of each thing and the first principles of all things , then was the true re-birth and renewal of the human spirit -- a renascence such as the world has never seen in all the centuries since .

		Then the old songs of gods and heroes and demigods lost their spell , and the true hymn of man was chanted for the first time : '' His face is set to the east , his feet on the past and its dead ; The snn re-arisen is his priest , and the heat thereof hallows his head .

		His eyes take part in the morning ; his spirit ontsonnding the sea Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod or tree .

		Past the wall ansormoonted that bars out our vision with iron and fire He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and sons to conspire . ''

		Not at once was all this to be .

		There were to be many eddies and back currents in the stream of progress , long centuries when humanity wandered in the wilderness or went astray after false gods ; but the first authors of a rational conception of the world must be cred - ited in large measure with the fruits that it has brought forth .

		We shall not attempt to summarize Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's re-statement of this oft-told tale .

		As his title , '' Greek Thinkers , '' implies , he does not confine himself to the exposition of systems , but enceavors to replace the Greek philosophers in the intellectual environment that fostered th3m .

		He depicts for us the world of Homer c and Hesiodic imagination , traces the development of popular and mystic religion , orphisa and the belief in immortality , studies the process of ethical reflection and the growth of pirer moral ideals in poets and historians , and orings out more fully than has hitherto been done the contribution of Greek medicine to the creation of the scientific and philosophic spirit .

		In the effort to be enter - tertaining , he sometimes goes a little beyond the evidence in touches of picturesque detail or in the suggestion of modern parallels . ''

		Protagoras , wandering through the halls of the beautiful ard regular city built on the plans of Hippodamus , might converse one day with
Herodotus	PERSON	on questions of ethnology , and on another with Empedocles on problems of nat - ural science , '' -- only there is no proof that Protagoras ever visited Thurii .

		Empedocles may have taught the doctrine of four elements as a compromise between one and infinity be - cause '' he may have learned in the school of practical politics to appreciate the value of compromise . '

		But the world would not contain the books that might be made up of such pos - sibilities .

		Tbere is a profound impressiveness to readers of
Darwin	LOCATION	, in
Heracleitus	ORGANIZATION	's saying that '' war is the father of all things , '' espe - cially when taken in connection with the sequel : '' Some he has made gods , some men , some slaves , others freemen . ''

		But we can not infer , with Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	, that the old Ephesian conceived of the struggle for existence as test - ing and eliminating or preserving the qualities of mankind .

		The innocent fragment of Xeno - phanes , '' The gods did not show all things to mankind at the beginning , but in the course of time by searching they found out the bet - ter , '' is made to '' strike a note of strict scien - tific reason '' by the interpretation '' but they search for themselves until they discover the better , '' whereby the antithesis between `` in the beginning '' and '' in the course of time , or at last '' is altered to an antithesis between the help of gods and unaided human effort .

		Simi - larly ,
Xenophanes	ORGANIZATION	's poetical expression of a skeptical mood is interpreted as a demand for '' verification , '' in the sense of modem science .

		Empedocles 's isolated statement that bones con - sist of four parts of fire , two of moisture , and two of earth , is treated as a glorious anticipa - 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, tion of modern quantitative jhemistry .

		Two disconnected fragments of Hjracleitus are so phrased and pieced together as to yield the edifying scientific canon , '' Wj must not specu - late about the highest thing i in lightness of heart , '' ybr '' Punishment willlovertake the lie - smith and the false witness . ''

		The Darwinian survival of the fittest is deduded from Empe - docles 's account of the speedy perishing of the monstrous manhearted oxheaced shapes , with no warning that the thought s probably due to
Aristotle	LOCATION	, who merely usei the grotesque fancy of Empedocles to illuitrate the idea .

		There are other slight inaccuracies , due to the necessary foreshortening or tm effort to avoid controversy .

		But all together they need not impair the reader 's faith thai he has before him as accurate a history as n perhaps com - patible with a fairly brief and popular presen - tation .

		I After the stress laid on piysical science , and perhaps connected with itj the chief fea - ture of Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's liistory is the diminished importance attributed to
Parmen	LOCATION	- ides and the Eleatics -- the pHlosophers of Being and Rest .

		The traditional account is that after the failure of the old Ionian hylo - zoists the Eleatics introduced the notions of absolute Being and
Unity	ORGANIZATION	, and tie dialectic of pure thought , and that the greatj constructive thinkers of the fifth century , jErapedocles ,
Anaxagoras	LOCATION	, and the Atomists , b ^ lt up their systems with constant reference toj Parmenides and in partial acceptance or evasion of his conclusions .

		Professor
Gompeiz	PERSON	minimizes this influence of the Eleatics .

		All of the es - sential ideas on which the fifth century thinkers built he finds already in the old lonians -- the eternity of nature , the process of change , the reign of law , the quantitative persistence of matter in all , the qualitative persistence of matter in
Anaximenes	LOCATION	's doctrine that all things are air more or less rarefied or condensed , the idea of a vacuum through which particles of matter are evenly distributed in some un - known Pythagorean aimed at in
Parmenides	LOCATION	's polemic .

		To Parmenides he assigns the credit only of the sharper formulation of some of these ideas .

		And he is inclined to reject the traditional view that atomism was derived from this Parmenidean formulation .

		The atoms undoubtedly resemble the
Parmenidean Being	LOCATION	, except for their constant motion and multi - plicity .

		They are plenary being , unchangeable , devoid of secondary qualities .

		But this is no proof that they were derived from
Parmenides	LOCATION	, and there is no evidence , he thinks , of his - torical connection between the two schools .

		Pythagoreanism and the natural development of the old Ionian physics sufficed .

		For the rest , the great achievement of Leucippus and Democritus , he thinks , was not the invention of the atoms , but the proclamation of the great and still valid principle of the correlation of sensible qualities with quantitative and spatial changes and the distribution of matter .

		Atom - ism , not the philosophy of Anaxagoras , is the culmination of the Pre-Socratic philosophy .

		The true logical and chronological sequence is misrepresented if we put Anaxagoras last because he happened to live at
Athens	LOCATION	, intro - duced Nous or mind as a cosmic agent , and is alluded to by
Socrates	PERSON	in the Apology .

		The last chapters of the volume , dealing with the Sophists and the age of '' enlightenment '' and emancipation , are especially interesting .

		The general view is akin to that of
Grote	PERSON	.

		The Sophist is an estimable personage , '' half pro- fessor , half journalist . ''

		Protagoras receives the fullest treatment .

		Professor Gomperz sensibly rejects the ingenious attempts that have been made to construct for Protagoras out of the Theaetetus a profound psychology of relativism .

		He renounces from the start the hopeless task of reconciling the ingenious dialecticism of the Theaetetus with the edifying rhetorical Protagoras of the dialogue that bears his name .

		The doctrine of pure relativism attributed to the Protagoras of the Theaetetus is really , he thinks , the theory of Aristippus , whom as a contemporary Plato could intro - duce in colloquy with
Socrates	PERSON	only under an alias .

		The volume closes with an appreciative chapter on Thucydides -- in his own field , one of the greatest of Greek thinkers .

		The translation can be read .

		But in spite of revision by Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	, it is by no means fyee from errors .

		The German idiom shows through unpleasantly in some inaccurate or un-English turns of phrase , such as '' no more fortunate explanation , '' '' this plump in - vention , '' '' smooth account books , '' '' the omin - ous decree of history of which Xenophanes was a witness . ''

		The proof-reading of the proper names is careless , as is usually the case in English and American translations of learned German works .

		This is particularly unfor - tunate , because such books are intended for readers who may be misled .

		It is strange that reputable publishers are not more careful to seek expert aid in this matter .

Tble Relations of Geography anu History	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is a comparatively recent dictum that accurate geographical knowledge is not only important for , but absolutely essential to , a correct understanding of history .

		It is how - ever , so generally accepted a fact , that all historical studies of the last decade are charac - terized by a profusion of maps of all kinds as well as by ample discussions of geographical details .

		There are endless interesting and reasonable deductions to be drawn from an examination of physical causes ; but a danger - ous tendency has arisen , on the other hand , to extreme statement .

		The theory has been worked too hard , and conditions of climate or peculiarities of topography have been brought into service as a basis for wholly unwarranted conclusions .

		It is gratifying to find that the Rev.
H. B. George	PERSON	, in his '' Relations of Geography and History , '' has been careful to point out the limitations of geographical influence .

		In a chapter on '' Fallacies of the Map , '' after dis - posing of the frequent generalization that mountain ranges and great rivers have invari - ably determined the direction and extent of racial migrations and colonization , he takes up the more modern questions of so-called natural boundaries and of nationality .

		Natural bound - aries , says Mr.
George	PERSON	, furnished the plea upon which aggressive rulers claimed justifica - tion for cruel wars in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ; while nationality has been the excuse for the wars of the nineteenth century .

		Thus ,
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, in steadily push - ing the frontier of
France	LOCATION	toward the north - east , claimed the Rhine as a natural boundary ; yet the history of all great river basins estab - lishes the fact that both banks of a stream are more likely to be occupied by the same people , than that they shall form a barrier between hostile races .

		The plea was therefore purely arbitrary and unjust , yet it was effective in arousing national sentiment and patriotism .

		When
Germany	LOCATION	took
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	from
France	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	, one justification for the act was that she was restoring to the mother coun - try a province and a people forcibly torn from her centuries before .

		Here too the plea was effective in arousing the imaginative patriotism of the German people ; yet it stirred only bit - • The Relations of Geography and History .

		temess and antempt in the hearts of the inhabitants of the restored province .

		From these and man ^ other similar illustrations , the author draws the conclusion that natural boundaries thu ; far in history have been largely imaginative coiceptions without much founda - tion in fact , aid that nationality , of which so much has beei made during the last thirty years , while it is in truth a factor in the deter - mination of a state 's frontier , has been very greatly overesimated .

		The questicn of the influence of physical environment oa the development of sea - power , Mr.
George	PERSON	treats in much the same way .

		England is a great maritime nation , not merely because her people inhabit an island , but be - cause of many other forces -- political for - tunes , racial characteristics inherited from non-maritime ancestors , the appearance of great leaders or far-seeing statesmen .

		So , also , it is a common generalization that moun - tains give birth to ideas of liberty .

		But ex - amined in the light of exact history , we find that men who would not submit to be enslaved fled to the mDuntains , there to find more defen - sible homes , where they could maintain their cherished ideals of liberty .

		Freedom is the heritage of a race , not of a soil .

		However , Mr.
George	PERSON	has not devoted him - self exclusively to destructive criticism of the ideals of historical geography .

		On the con - trary , the larger part of his book is given , in a separate chapter for each country , to a sane , painstaking examination of the development of European states in the light of geographical influence .

		In these chapters he indicates and proves the importance of physical details in determining both wider race-movements and minor events and political happenings .

		He attacks masty generalizations , but he shows himself a careful student of the minute details of historical geography .

		Thus his book , while not suited to the general reader , may well serve as a condensed synopsis for teachers and stu - dents of historical geography .

Aug. 16	DATE	, Masters of French Li ?

		ERATirRE .

		* No other literature has inspir d such a wealth of scholarly and delightful criti ism as French ; and the fields into which
Prifessor Harper	PERSON	leads us , in his account of tie masters of that literature , have been parti jularly rich in yield .

		Literary art is studied s -LRB- systematically in
France	LOCATION	, principles and schods are of such vital importance to both auth r and public , that the great writers are of ; , peculiar and undying interest to all inteligent readers among their fellow countrymto , and a per - petual challenge to critic anl biographer .

		More than this , the atmosphere in which every French author is trained clingf to his works .

		As we read them , we who havelnever felt the heat of the conflict over literarylprinciple , and who probably are contented to read our En - glish authors without troubling curselves much over what school they belong tL even we im - bibe the critical spirit , find ourselves analyzing and defining , and welcoming eac \ new volume of essays on French authors with almost a French interest .

		The first of Professor
Harper	PERSON	's '' Masters '' is
Corneille	LOCATION	, the last is
Balzac	LOCATION	, and the literary development of the included t ^ o hundred years is outlined with sufficient -LRB- jompleteness to give value to the volume as al whole over and above that of the separate esteays .

		And yet each chapter stands by itself .

		1 Several are revised reprints , and the process o ^ unification has left traces in a few noticeable !

		repetitions from chapter to chapter ; but aa these em - phasize important points , they hate their ex - cuse .

		From beginning to end there is a marked growth from the general to the individual .

		First comes the broad sweep necessary to con - centrate the peculiarities of a great national literature within a thirty-four page chapter on '' The Place of French Literature . ''

		Next , is a chapter on `` The Golden Age of French Drama , '' the most broadly influential feature of the literary history .

		Then follow two chap - ters on '' The Revolutionary Analysis , '' giving the growth of the eighteenth century , grouped first broadly about Saint-Simon and Mon - tesquieu , then narrowly about
Voltaire	PERSON	, who as '' man of letters '' and semi-blind liberator of the human mind epitomizes the century .

		The remaining three chapters , on Hugo ,
Sainte	LOCATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	, and
Balzac	LOCATION	, are increasingly personal ; * Masters of French Literature .

		so that our interest seems to undergo a certain change as we read , -- or rather , perhaps , we feel that though we start at a definite begin - ning and go logically on , we end without having arrived at any particular result .

		The author has not attempted an introduc - tion to these masters .

		One can make their acquaintance , of course , only by reading what they themselves have written ; but having even slight acquaintance with them , one is sure to find much needed help and guidance in these chapters .

		For example ,
Sainte-Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's Cavr series are delightful reading from the start ; but if , as is quite likely , the reader is already familiar with critics like
Taine	PERSON	who have a manifest system , Sainte-Beuve will seem to him a sort of mosaic of a thousand gossipy bits put together without design .

		He needs to discover that Sainte-Beuve has an art which is more than a '' system , '' and Professor Har - per goes straight to this point and lightens the difficulty in a way that shows him a skilled literary guide .

		This picking out the crucial difficulty in the way of appreciating each author , and throwing needed light just there , is the most marked characteristic of the volume so far as it deals with individual writers .

		The chapter on Hugo of necessity recalls his varied literary life , especially the exciting times of the publication of '' Hernani , '' but the author skilfully steers straight through this maelstrom to centre the interest upon what he considers the most important phase of Hugo 's character . ''

		It is in itself a great achievement to have done so much honest work of a high character as Hugo did .

		It is no small distinction to have guided a people 's hopes for eighteen years from his island of exile .

		It is a noble end of a zealous life to have worn for fifteen years the crown of such a nation 's kingship .

		But when even these proud honors are forgotten , children 's voices will still repeat and men 's hearts still echo a hundred songs of the greatest lyric poet of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He recognizes the fact that '' foreign students of French literature are less likely to seek acquaintance with
Hugo	PERSON	's poems than with his plays and novels , '' and for that reason devotes the most important part of his chapter to the poems ; yet we can but regret that Les Miser - ables , Quatre-vingt-treize , and
Notre Dame de Paris	LOCATION	, the great works by which Hugo is gen - erally known out of
France	LOCATION	, had not received more attention , especially as they are often misunderstood and misappreciated .

		Yet Hugo is altogether too huge an enigma of force to be satisfactorily dealt with in one chapter , and it is of real service to focus the light upon that

		THE DIAL .

		105 phase of his character which marks all his works and has given them their enduring qualities .

		The chapter on Balzac is of somewhat dif - ferent character , inasmuch as it is more of an introduction .

		It is the getting started in read - ing this writer 's novels that is the difficulty the uninitiated feel and which Professor
Harper	PERSON	meets .

		The reader is disheartened when he faces the enormous mass of printed matter in the '' Human Comedy , '' and if he makes a beginning without a guide he is almost sure to find not genius but tedious disagreeableness .

		By excellent classification , and brief , apt com - ment .

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	narrows the '' Human Comedy '' down to what is really worth reading , and , largely by means of quotations from Bal - zac 's correspondence , he goes more deeply into the difficulty , and shows how the author was led now by his great genius , now by the vulgar commercialism of his time .

		In his preface .

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	says . ''

		So unified is French literature , so intimate are all the myriad relations of all its parts to the whole , that it is possible to gain a fairly comprehensive view of any one of its periods of development by considering a rep - resentative man of letters who was then the dominant figure . ''

		And again : '' This volume of essays , of course , makes no claim to give a general outlook over the two centuries which lie between
Corueille	ORGANIZATION	and
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		Yet the book may perhaps be regarded as an imperfect illustration of the method outlined above . ''

		The two centuries under consideration are peculiarly easy of presentation by this method .

		During nearly the whole of this time , '' classic '' principles reigned almost undisputedly ; the Romantic reaction which Hugo represents and the Realistic development which Balzac stands for can be understood only as they are set in relief against classicism ; and while these two writers were at the height of their influence , the critic Sainte-Beuve was showing his fellow - countrymen that the vital principles which have made the French masters of the art of writing and teachers of the world keep them all close kin to the classicists of the Golden Age .

		Down through the chapter on
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, the general treatment gives us something like completeness which makes us feel this unity ; but beyond there , the points of observation are too few for the increasingly rich landscape , and the relationship of one to the other and of each to the whole is left to blind inferences .

		The author recognizes this when he says : '' The absence of any substantive treatment of
Rousseau	PERSON	and hs followers would at once pre - clude pretentiois to systematic completeness . ''

		We can only vish the process of unification had been carried a little farther .

		But one thing we do ge with rather marked complete - ness considerii ^ the limitations , and that is a distinctly tangble conception of those broad characteristics which make up the peculiar spirit of Frenci literature .

		The first chapter outlines it , the others fill in the details .

		Here is the real valie of the book as a whole .

		These essayi are not overflowing with spon - taneous originality of conception ; what char - acterizes them rather , is a judicial weighing of conflicting opinions and eminently sane conclusions .

		The author has the rather rare virtue of unitiig to '' Anglo-Saxon deep seri - ousness '' ability to appreciate the fine artistic qualities of tie French .

		The finish of the sentences , the modelling of the paragraphs , the massing o : the chapters , are worth study - ing in themselves ; the choice of details and their logical development mark the master of exposition .

		Altogether there is simple straight - forwardness which may deceive the unappre - ciative , but vhich comes only from scholarly mastery of subject and form .

		* The concluding volumes of Mr.

Carthy	PERSON	's '' History of the Four Georges '' have recently come from the press , and although Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has associated his son with him in their preparation , and some fifteen years have elapsed since the publication of the initial vol - ume , there has been no departure from the former methods of treatment , and the interest is sustained to the end .

		While this work adds but little to our knowledge of one of the most dreary and least honorable periods of English history , the author has done a distinct service by conscientiously collecting a large amount of material from various sources and putting it into the form of a connected story .

		And he has done this with such good judgment and grace of expression , that he has imparted to the book all the freshness and charm of a work of fiction .

		Moi sover , Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	has apparently tried 13 perform the same service for the period of t e
Georges	PERSON	that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	undertook for the period of the Restoration , and not altogether without success .

		It was a favorite saying oi
Carlyle	LOCATION	, that true history was , after all , only ^ the connected biography of the world 's great men , -- a con - ception which Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	las apparently adopted in the preparation of this work , for the most of his material has been put in the form of life-stories of the greit leaders who shaped policies and gave tone !

		and direction to public thought and activitief .

		These bio - graphical studies are not seriously analytical , but are rather bright , sketchy jv ^ ord-pictures , which bring out in strong relief and vivid coloring the personalities of meir subjects , thrown against a well-defined background made up of the movements and poliaes to which their lives gave expression .

		Fejwr clearer or more striking character delineations can be found than some of those contained in this work , among the most notable oi which may be mentioned those of Lord
George Gordon	PERSON	,
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, and Charles F < lx .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's career might afford him some excuse for not always doing ^ .

		full justice to the home government when treating of her policy toward her dependencies .

		Bi | it , although his sympathies are evidently strongly enlisted , it would be difficult to convict him of unfair partisanship , even when treating of
Ireland	LOCATION	and her grievances .

		In dealing with the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Revolution , he denounces in no unmeasured terms the stupidity and malevolence of the
King	PERSON	and his advisers ; yet the most conser - vative Englishman of the day conld hardly find fault with his utterances , for they have come to be the well-established conclusions of history .

		The peculiarly just and sympathetic temperament of the author is again shown in that portion of the book dealing with the career of
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, in which he has departed widely from the policy of
Burke	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and many others , in striving to do justice to this brilliant and greatly maligned Englishman .

		Perhaps he has gone too far in his apology , but for this he may be easily par - doned when we remember the burden of in - famy under which the memory of
Hastings	PERSON	has so long labored .

		In conclusion it may be said that no one , however well-informed he may be , can read this work without gaining new and more vivid conceptions of many of the great men of the period which it treats , and a clearer idea of the motives and policies which dominated them .

		Studies in Educational , Problems .

		* One of the most helpful and suggestive educa - tional books of the past year is that by the late Professor Hinsdale on '' The Art of Study . ''

		It is written for the teacher , from the standpoint of the pupil , and aims at a definite end : to teach pupils how to study , rather than to store their minds with any particular stock of knowledge .

		The author holds that the failure of pupils in their studies is chiefly due , first , to their ignorance of how properly to attack a lesson ; and , secondly , to their inability to sustain the attack when once made .

		To over - come these errors and attain the end sought , the author demonstrates the proper relations that should exist between teacher and pupil , and then presents methods of establishing and maintaining these rela - tions .

		At the close of each chapter are suggested parallel readings designed to aid the student in comprehending its underlying psychologic prin - ciples .

		The entire book is clear , logical , and well written ; and if the principles embodied can become thoroughly understood and judiciously and ade - quately applied , it will do much to eliminate educa - tional waste and intellectual dissipation .

		For these reasons it merits a wide sale .

		107 I Teachers Series , '' edited by Professor
James Rus	PERSON	- sell .

		The volume is worthy of special attention , both because of its intrinsic merit and because it marks the beginning of a new pedagogic literature in this country .


Germany	LOCATION	has long had such a literature , but the American teacher has been com - pelled to feed upon scattered husks .

		The aim of the series is '' to discuss the educational value of each subject , the reasons for including it in the curriculum , the selection and arrangement of ma - terials in the course , the essential features of class instruction , and the various helps which are avail - able for teachers ' use . ''

		So far as the initial volume is concerned , this aim has been well sustained ; though one might wish that certain features had not been so dogmatically stated .

		The book is sane , scholarly , and exceedingly suggestive .

		It fills a long-felt want in our educational literature , and should be heartily welcomed by every teacher of the classics . ''

		Nature-Study and the Child , '' by Mr.
Charles B. Scott	PERSON	, is a contribution to the rapidly growing literature of this subject .

		The book gives a con - crete illustration of how Nature-study should be taught ; discusses its province , aim , and limitations ; its principles and determining method ; the method of studying material ; the expression work of the school ; the relation of Nature-study to reading , literature , geography , and arithmetic ; the selection and sequence of material ; and then outlines an eight-year course of study similar to that in the
Report of Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is the out - growth of the author 's long experience as teacher and supervisor in the public schools , and therefore has the wholesome tinge of the practical every-day workshop .

		Although the work suggested is still excessive , and emphasizes the subject way beyond its legitimate field , it is truly sensible and refresh - ing when compared with the great mass of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	- study literature .

		Dr.
Schaeffer	PERSON	's treatise on * ' Thinking and Learn - ing to Think , '' edited by Dr.
Brumbaugh	PERSON	, is a very sensible and attractive book , and strikes at the very heart of school work .

		It is the outgrowth of the author 's long experience , and bears on every page the stamp of the scientific practical school-man .

		From the kindergarten up through the high school , the complaint is everywhere made that '' pupils do not think , '' and the author attempts to show why this is , and how it can be remedied , by giving a careful analysis of the psychologic bases of good thinking .

		The entire book is clearly written , richly and pointedly illustrated , and , while not a profound work , is well calculated in matter and treatment to prove most helpful and stimulating to the great mass of teachers .

		One of the most wholesome of recent books is '' Education and Life , '' by President
Baker	PERSON	.

		It is composed of papers and addresses delivered at various times and before different audiences , ^ nd therefore has no centre of unity .

		Its general tenor , however , may be summed up under two heads : first , the welfare of society and the safeguard of democracy demaid that , while our educational aims must remain ida , l , all education must be brought into closer sympathetic relation with the problems of every-day life and the second is a vigorous pro- test against wha is called '' soft pedagogics , '' or , in the author 's vords , '' false interpretation of the doctrines of pleisure , pursuit of inclination , pun - ishment by natiral consequences , and following lines of least res stance . ''

		While one may not agree with all of the conclusions reached , the book is incisive , scholary , and timely , and should be care - fully read by every thoughtful educator and citizen . ''

		Education tnd the Philosophic Ideal , '' by Dr.
Horatio Dresser	PERSON	, is a strong inspirational book .

		It is not put forth as a mere educational discussion , but rather as at appeal , through education , to all that is noblest ii life .

		It holds that every teacher must understand life , philosophically and spirit - ually , in order to be of greatest service ; and then proceeds to demonstrate this through its various chapters .

		The book is charmingly written .

		Professor
Young	PERSON	's volume on '' The Teaching of Mathematics in the Higher Schools of
Prussia	LOCATION	'' is a valuable addition to American pedagogical litera - ture , and American students may well study it .

		It reproduces , in a clear and lucid manner , the exact class-room work of the German master , and shows wherein his methods differ from those of the Amer - ican .

		With the Germans , the teacher is the great central factor ; with the American , the text-book plays the leading role .

		With the German method , the teacher teaches ; with ours , he hears reciMtions .

		The superiority of the former method is clearly pointed out ; and in order that the subject may be more easily understood , the book is prefaced by a brief exposition of the entire German school-system .

		The appearance of Professor
Shaw	PERSON	's '' School Hygiene '' in the '' Teacher 's Professional Library '' is still another evidence of the growing interest in the important subject which it treats .

		The book sets forth concisely and accurately the conditions which surround the great mass of school-children , and then proposes measures for the protection and -RSB- -RRB- romotion of their physical and mental health .

		The matter presented is in the main a clear re - statement of accepted facts , except the chapters on Eyesight and Hearing , and on
Handwriting	LOCATION	, which are new , scientific , and exceedingly valuable .

		If the facts and suggestions contained in this book should be thoroughly comprehended and persistently followed by teachers and school authorities , it would prove of inestimable service to the home , the school , and the state .

		All such literature should be warmly welcomed .

		Another volume of the series just named is that by Professor Redway on '' The New Basis of Geog - raphy . ''

		As the title indicates , the book is some - what of a departure from the geographic conceptions still so largely in vogue throughout this country .

		The matter presented , however , has long received due attention from the best schools and universities 108 THE DIAL .

Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , could hardly be said to be compre tensive if meas - ured by the period of time covered but it has been at least a courageous thing to amplify into the pro- portions of a book the very brief Recounts of the last relatively unimportant ten yearei of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign .

		These years have commonlylbeen disposed of in a few sentences , or at the most in a chapter , by general historians ; while Mr.
Hime	PERSON	's account is limited to a scientific examination of the plots , in
England	LOCATION	and out of it , for the restoration of Catholicism and the overthrow of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	in favor of Philip II .

		or some Spanish protegee The sources of this labor comprise both older an ^ well-known works , and those more recently discovered docu - ments of which the author has been ` so diligent a student , as the Spanish manuscripts | -RRB- f
Simancas	PERSON	.

		These latter , together with Irish Stat ^ papers , the latest volume of the Venetian papers , the
Hatfield	PERSON	papers , and unpublished documents in the Archives Nationales at
Paris	LOCATION	, have supplied a wealth of ma - terial which Mr.
Hume	PERSON	has analyzed and arranged in such fashion as to furnish for each plot and intrigue a connected and authoritative account .

		The result , then , is the elaborately detailed descrip - tion of plot after plot , or plot within plot , and intrigue upon intrigue , for the greater part of the five hundred pages of the book .

		It is unnecessary to say that such a work does not appeal to popular taste , though the author 's style of narration seems intended rather more for general than historical readers .

		Yet , while episodal history may not be interesting in itself , without earnest workers in that field accurate history of a more readable character could not be written ; and considered in this light , Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's present volume merits the highest praise .

		In it he has given us absolutely accurate knowledge , in so far as his sources afford informa - tion , of the Catholic conspiracies from
1593	DATE	to
1603	DATE	.

		A perusal of his volume will show that the hopes of
Philip	LOCATION	and of the extreme Catholics were far from being destroyed forever by the defeat of the Armada of
1588	DATE	, and that
Puritan England	LOCATION	was many times in serious danger after that date ; that
Philip	PERSON	himself was less a fanatical Catholic than a scheming despot grasping at power ; that
James	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	plotted with all parties , and de - ceived all in turn ; that
Essex	LOCATION	and
Cecil	PERSON	fought each other as bitterly , though as secretly , as they fought the common enemy ; that spies invariably betrayed their employers ; and that
England	LOCATION	was saved to the Reformation more through the Puritan temper and enthusiasm of her people than by the genius of ruler or of statesmen .

		In one minor point only does the author 's judgment seem open to criticism , and that in connection with a subject which has not called for any extended statement .

		Ralegh , in the attack on
Cadiz	LOCATION	, is represented -- as is usual in histories of that event -- as reconciling Essex and
Howard	PERSON	, and persuading them to an immediate attack .

		Then , leading the advance , '' he struck straight as a hawk at its quarry , at the two greatest ships of the Spanish navy . ''

		The incident is unimportant in itself , but upon it
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	's repu - tation as a naval commander largely rests ; and Mr.
Julian S. Corbett	PERSON	, in '' The Successors of Drake , '' working in the same period and using largely the same sources as Mr.
Hume	PERSON	, has effec - tually destroyed even this slight foundation for
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	's naval fame .

		It is probable that the present work was already in press before Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	's book appeared , for the impression otherwise re - ceived from every page of '' Treason and Plot '' is that of a laborious , exact , and discriminating study of all available sources and authorities .

Marie	PERSON	of the earlier volumes , -- mor - bidly analytic , passionately self-confident , inordi - nately vain alike of her beauty and her talents ; absorbed to-day in her gowns , her dinners , or her lovers whom she did not love , -- to-morrow hang - ing , breathless if half-scornful , on the praises of the art critics ; stung continually by the gadfly ambition , and driven to '' touch everything '' and leave something before the dying out of the candle that is '' cut in four and burning at every end .

		But Art just consists in making us swallow the commonplace by charming us eternally , as Na - ture does with her eternal sun , and her olden earth , and her men built all on the same pattern . ''

Europe	LOCATION	, begun by Mr.
Grant AUen	PERSON	, only four volumes had been issued when his labors were cut short by death .

		A fifth volume , called `` Cities of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , similar in scope and purpose to its predecessors , has been well done by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's friend , Dr.
Greorge C Williamson	PERSON	.

		The cities chosen are MUan ,
Verona	LOCATION	,
Padua	LOCATION	,
Bologna	LOCATION	, and
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		Differing widely in customs , dialect , art , and gov - ernment , as these cities have done in the past , often at war with each other and with the great Imperial power that sought to weld them into one whole , each naturally possessed its own individuality , which is reflected in the buildings and paintings that remain within its walls .

		Dr.
Williamson	PERSON	's little book undertakes to impress upon the tourist what are the characteristic features of each of these places , and therefore to direct him to what he must certainly see in order to comprehend the spirit of each individual place and to gain an intelligent idea of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The finest brick architecture of
Italy	LOCATION	is to be seen at
Verona	LOCATION	; the work of Giotto can only be understood after a visit to
Padua	LOCATION	; Francia can only be studied in
Bologna	LOCATION	; the art of mosaic has its finest example at
Ravenna	LOCATION	; and so each town has its own supreme attractions .

		For those who go to
Europe	LOCATION	with an honest and reverent de - sire to learn what they can from the Old World , this scholarly and convenient handbook will be found a desirable supplement to the invaluable
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		The Eebrev , and '' '' ^ ^ ^ Origin of Republican Form of the AmerieoK Government in the
United States of Commonwealth	LOCATION	.

		America '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a thoughtful discussion of the effect which religious ideas had in the shaping and practical working of our present form of government .

		The author , Mr.
Oscar S. Straus	PERSON	, adduces some cogent reasons for maintaining that the
Hebrew Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, which embraced that period of the history of the children of
Israel	LOCATION	from the Exodus to the selection of
Saul	PERSON	as king , presented the model of a Democratic Republic to the early fathers of
America	LOCATION	.

		He says the central or national government of this commonwealth was divided into three departments , namely : the Chief Executive , who was called Judge or Shophete ; the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, Sanhedrim or Synedrium ; and the
Assem	PERSON	- bly , which was tie popular branch of government .

		He introduces topious illustrations from the Old Testament to slow that this ancient government was not a goveriment by priests , or a purely relig - ious commonwalth ; the fact that , with the single exception of Eli no priest was ever elected to the chief magistracy during the entire period of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, opposes any such interpretation .

		Mr.
Straus	PERSON	does not claim that '' the structural parts of our form of government were derived from what was believed to be the components of the
Hebrew Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	but only that this Scriptural model of government , which was democratic , as distin - guished from kiigly rule , had a deep influence upon the founders of our government , and prepared the minds of the people , especially in the
New England	LOCATION	colonies , so that they not only longed for , but would not content thtmselves with , any other form of government thin that form which had the divine sanction , the gtvernment of the Hebrews under the Judges . ''

		The volume before us is the second re - vised edition oi Mr.
Straus	PERSON	's work , it having been first published m
1885	DATE	.

		The present edition con - tains an histoneal essay by the late
Emile de Laveleye	PERSON	, the eminent Belgian publicist .

		The sug - gestive value of this book to the student of Amer - ican history engaged in making original researches can not be too strongly emphasized .

		There is a decided demand for a Coim ^ t ^ ^ .

		history of the
United States	LOCATION	, mid - way in size between the high-school texts and the larger histories , and broader in treat - ment than either of the volumes of the '' Epoch Series . ''

		Many people desire to read some history of their country , but can find no very satisfactory account of ' .

		he Colonial period , and are appalled by the bulk of Schouler ,
McMaster	PERSON	, or von Hoist , covering the period of Independence .

		A good re - view of both periods , moderate in compass and developing the underlying causes that have brought us to our present position , would be useful in many ways .

		We have thought that the numbers of Put - nam 's '' Story of the Nations '' series on '' The Colonies '' and '' The
United States	LOCATION	, '' which have for some time been announced as in preparation , might meet this demand .

		The number on '' The Colonies , '' by Miss
Helen Ainslie Smith	PERSON	, has recently been issued in two volumes .

		The result disappoints our anticipation so far as the earlier period is con - cerned , since the book is not strong enough for the purpose indicated .

		The author has emphasized the '' story '' idea by striving to make the narrative as entertaining as possible , and in this has fairly succeeded .

		Unfortunately , a faulty arrangement of matter spoils the effect .

		Anyone who hate under - taken to present the history of the English Colonies in
America	LOCATION	knows the difficulty of correlation .

		Sometimes the streams run in separate channels , sometimes unite for a while in one combination , and later divide and form other combinations .

		The best that can be done is to treat the Colonies no THE DIAL -LSB-

		in natural groups down to the Fench war , and after that to treat them as a whoh The method of this work is to take each
Colonj	ORGANIZATION	in the acciden - tal order of settlement , and to gi ^ 3 its story sep - arately from start to finish .

		Ths ; the history of the Revolution , divided in this wai into twelve or thirteen parts , can not be satisfactoi ^ , goes without saying .

		Other parts of the work mfEer similarly from its artificial arrangement .

		One of the best as we I as the briefest of the numerous biographies of
George Eliot	PERSON	is the sne written by
Miss Clara Thomson	PERSON	for the seiies of `` West - minster Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Mamard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


George Eliot	PERSON	's outward surrounding , from girlhood on , had a great influence in determiiing the setting of her novels ; while her inner life lad a powerful force in shaping the actions and Motives of her characters .

		Her religious opinions lave been vari - ously judged and misjudged , passing as they did from extreme evangelicalism in you h to positivism in later life ; but her attitude as a \ ihole is happily characterized in one of the concludiig pages of the book before us : `` Throughout theSe changes of opinion she retained what were her \ ^ mo8t striking characteristics , -- her intense desire \ to raise the level of life , to awaken the spiritual Consciousness of her contemporaries .

		Her very -LSB- negation of orthodox creeds increased her passion for humanity ; and the conviction that there could lie no further compensation for present pain inspired her with an intense longing to help the losers in life 's war , and to insist with increasing solemnity on the inexorable law of consequences . ''

		An ample chronology at the beginning and a bibliography at the end of the volume are additional features of excellence in this small book .

		I In Mr.
C. L. Stainer	PERSON	's iollection of rnvTctZli .

		the '' Speeches of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we have an historical source-book of the best type , with all the scrupulous accuracy of modern scholarship .

		The manuscripts of the period have been carefully examined , and the existing reports of the great orator 's speeches have been followed with literal exactness .

		Not only are those speeches given of which reports are to be found , but the '' substance '' of a large number of other and less-known speeches is given .

		In his Preface , the editor discusses the question of the fidelity of the reports that have come down to us , and gives incidentally some idea of the Parliamentary reporting of the seventeenth century .

		`` On the whole , the general conclusion must be that the original reports of these speeches are missing , that many circumstances doubtless conspired to make them difficult to decipher , and that there is no very great reason to suppose that our translations or copies of them are necessarily accurate .

		We must make the best of the texts left to us , but they do little justice to the man who seems to have been the greatest orator of his time . ''

		The book is thus a valuable aid to the study of the history of
Cromwell	PERSON	's day , and of that leader of men who was in so many ways the embodiment of the best spirit of his time .

		As an accompaniment to the recent lives of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, it is essential to the real student of biography .

		The reader can not but wonder and regret that so little remains of the words of one who played so prominent a part dur - ing this important epoch of Parliamentary history .

		The publishers have given the book an attractive dress , and there is an excellent body of notes .

		We give but half praise , though that rS & 7 not faint nor grudging , to Mr.
E. M. Clerke	PERSON	's '' Fable and Song in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of his two objects , neither seems to us quite attained , although both offer something of interest .

		Where he had in mind the tracing of the antique , the classical element in the mediaeval legend of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	as it took literary form in the epics of Boiardo and
Ariosto	PERSON	, he had a subject in which we hold it quite impos - sible for anyone but a genius to be '' exhaustive and scholarly '' and at the same time to attract and fascinate the reader .

		Mr.
Gierke	PERSON	disclaims the first of these objects , but in such a subject one can not really leave the feeling for scholarship and completeness entirely behind .

		As a result , the first part of the hook is sometimes interesting and sometimes correct , but often quite superficial and often dull .

		Further , when we get on in the book toward the end we rather miss the continuity in subject that the author has in mind in dealing with some subjects in more modern Italian litera - ture .

		But here , as in the earlier part of the book , there is a good deal in one place or another that one likes to turn over .

		The terror of mosquitoes .

		Popular interest in mosquitoes has been greatly increased by recent discoveries which have shown how these insect pests may carry disease and how they are primarily responsible for the ravages of malaria .

		Dr. L. 0 .

		Howard , of the
United States Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment of Agriculture , has rendered the public a great service in preparing for general use his book on '' Mosquitoes '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which treats of the life-habits of these creatures , details the method by which some diseases are carried by them , and gives a simple outline of the classifica - tion of the known North American forms with especial attention to the characteristics of the dan - gerous species .

		The successful efforts which have been made in some localities afflicted with mosqui - toes to relieve the plague are reported , and prac - tical precautions are set forth for the use of homes and communities in protecting themselves from the annoyances and dangers which these little pests bring .

		The facts contained in this volume should be in the possession of every household , and the book should form a part of the equipment of campers and travellers .

		THE DIAL 111 RovMtUie
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		There is no city in old
Scotland	LOCATION	that is so attractive to the traveller as
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		He is not satisfied with one day 's sojourn , nor can he as easily leave at the end of the first week as he could the first day .

		He wants to spend several weeks and '' do up '' the city .

		Mr.
John Geddie	PERSON	's '' Romantic Edinburgh '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a treasure for just that man .

		The book , with its scores of illustrations , takes the reader into every part of that historic city , and displays with wonderful historical knowledge the persons and events connected with this and that old close or house .

		The ravines , the streams , the crags , the fortresses , all stand out with great vividness .

		The
Walter Scott	PERSON	enthusiast , the admirer of
David Hume	PERSON	, the follower of
John Knox	PERSON	, the lover of
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, will all find food for their enthu - siasm in this noble old city .

		Mr.
Geddie	PERSON	has laid all the past of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	under tribute to his pages , and has made a volume of eminent usefulness .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Newson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish two series of modern language text-books , German and French , respectively , that seem to us particularly commendable .

		Each series contains three volumes -- a '' First French Book , '' a '' Second French Book , '' and '' French Daily Life , '' -- the German set being similarly divided .

		The text , even in the book for beginners , is wholly in the foreign language , and requires that language to be spoken in the class-room from the start .

		A good many modern ideas have been embodied in these books , which aim to effect the reforms in teaching sought for by such men as Professor
Victor	PERSON	, and such societies as the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion Phon ^ tique Internationale .

		A Swiss teacher ,
M. Alge	PERSON	, is primarily responsible for the plan of this series , and the American editor is Mr.
Walter H. Buell	PERSON	. ''

		Hamlet '' and ''
Romeo	PERSON	and Juliet '' are the first two volumes of '' The
Dowden Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' published by the
Boweu-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This edition is in handsome library form , and each play will have a volume to itself .

		The aim of the editor -- who is no other than Professor
Edward Dowden	PERSON	-- has been to provide a scholarly text , to supply such notes as the cidtivated reader really needs , and '' to exhibit the variations from the editor 's text which are found in the primary sources in so far as those variations are of importance for the ascertainment of the text . ''

		Each volume has a critical introduction by the editor .

		These books are printed in large clear type , and the edition is in every respect ex - ceedingly attractive .

		Mr.
John La Farge	PERSON	's series of lectures given at the Metropolitan Museum at
New York	LOCATION	, seven years ago , has been newly reprinted with the title '' Considera - tions on Painting '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These lectures deal with such subjects as '' Personality and Choice , '' '' Sug - gestion and Intention , '' * • Illusions , '' '' Sincerity , '' etc. .

		From the nature of the case , the tone is somewhat pedagogical , but Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	's utterances on art sub - jects carry a weight and interest for others as well as students .

		Notes .

		Mr.
Alan Sanlers	PERSON	is the author of the '' Elements of Plane Geometry '' published by the

		The Guilfoid Speller , '' by Messrs.

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` ' The

American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a work in three mrts , each occupying a separate volume .

		`` The Wife -RRB- f Bath 's Tale : Its Sources and Ana - logues , '' by Mr ,
G. H. Maynadier	PERSON	, is a new volume of the ''

David Nutt	PERSON	. ''

		The Proven ^ l Lyric , '' by Professor
Lewis F. Mott	PERSON	, is a lecture delivered before the Comparative Litera - ture Society , aid now published in a neat volume by Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	.

		`` The Book jf Asparagus , '' by Mr.

		It is the first volume of a new series , edited by Mr.

		Tennyson , '' by Mr.
Morton Luce	PERSON	, is a '' Temple Primer , '' following Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	's '' Dante '' in what we hope will prove a series of volumes devoted to the great poets .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		/ The '' Hand-Book to the Pan-American Exposition , '' published by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a con - venient guide for the tourist , and is supplemented with a section , almost as necessary as the main part of the work , upon Niagara Falls . ''

		Poetry for Poetry 's Sake '' is the title of a pamphlet printed at t \ e
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains the inaugural lecture of Dr.
A. C. Bradley	PERSON	, delivered last
June	DATE	upon the occasion of his first appearance as Pro- fessor of Poetry in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The success of Mr.
B. L. Taylor	PERSON	's '' Bilioustine '' has been so pronounced that Mr.
William S. Lord	PERSON	, the publisher , now announces a limited edition de luxe of this clever parody -- if it be possible to parody the grotesque forthpnttings of the self-acclaimed philos - opher of the '' Philistine . ''

		M.
Jules Verne	PERSON	's ''
Uue Ville Flottante	PERSON	, '' abridged and edited by Mr.
C. Fontaine	PERSON	, and a volume of '' Lec - tures Historiques '' upon `` Le DLx-Septieme Si ^ cle en
France	LOCATION	, '' edited by Misses
Delphine Duval	PERSON	and
H. Isabell Williams	PERSON	, are two recent school texts published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs. Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of '' Seven Great American Poets , '' by Miss
Beatiice Hart	PERSON	.

		This is a book for school use , and
Poe	PERSON	is placed , very properly , as one of the seven -- the other six being those universally accepted .

		The treatment is primarily biographical , and secondarily critical , while extracts are supplied in generous measure .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	make the interesting announcement '' that their publishing department will hereafter be under the full management of Mr.
F. G. Browne	PERSON	, for the past twelve years business manager of The Dial .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	comes to his task well fitted by temperament , training , and business experience to undertake the responsibilities of his position . ''

		Those who have had business relations with The Dial during 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, the period in question will understand how well these words describe Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's qualificatims for the work which he has now taken up , and will onfidently await the new impetus that his management will give to the publishing department of that old and dignified house .

		`` Jesus fra Nazaret Set med Nutidiojne , '' by
Herr Sigurd Trier	PERSON	, is a pamphlet that cones to us from
Copenhagen	LOCATION	.

		The `` modern eyes '' vith which the figure of Jesus is viewed are oi the son that reject the supernatural in order to find a deeper mman meaning in the personality of the founder of Chistianity .

		The writing is temperate in tone , and rather persuasive than aggressive in manner .

		The
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	hav `` added to their ' * Religion of Science Library ''
Bisaop Berkeley	PERSON	's `` Three Dialogues between Hylas aid Philonous . ''

		This work , of course , is one of the cli.ssics of philo - sophical literature , but roost people know it by name only , and have little idea of its literay charm or of its logical cogency .

		No one has ever improved upon
Berkeley	LOCATION	's statement of philosophical nealism , and it remains the best of all books for openisg the mind to the fundamental truth of metaphysics , i The publishers of
Edgren	PERSON	and Burnets '' French and English Dictionary '' take exception to cor recent criti - cism of that work .

		The passage to whi * h we objected is .

		the following : `` The ` par ' of French exchange in
New York	LOCATION	is five francs to the dollar .

		It fluctuates by eighths of centimes . ''

		Quoting this , we condensed it slightly , making it read : '' Five francs to the dollar is the par of exchange , which fluctuates jrom time to time . ''

		Admitting the literal inaccuracy iof the quota - tion , we are unable to detect any essential difference between the two forms .

		The substitution of '' which '' for '' it '' makes absolutely no change in the construction of the passage , and the contention that the pronoun refers to '' French exchange '' alone is quite untenable .

		The '' ' par ' of French exchange '' is the subject of both sentences , for the term '' par of exchange '' is as insep - arable a compound as '' man of war . ''

		Ct -RRB- nsequently , both sentences , as they stand in the '' Dictionary , '' are wrong .

		The first is an inaccuracy , since the `` par '' in question is 5.18 - -RCB- - .

		The second is an absurdity , since a '' par of exchange '' can not fluctuate .

		Amid the ebb and flow of literary fashions , biog - raphy , one of the earliest forms , has maintained a steadfast and increasing carrent of interest .

		Dar - ing the last half-century its appreciation , formerly stable but restricted , has pervaded the wider reading - public .

		Nearly twenty-five years ago an English critic sought to explain the '' temporary rage '' for biography , and prophesied its speedy retreat into its former channel , reserved for scholars and critics .

		This `` temporary rage '' proved only the influx of a popularity which has grown without abate , until biography to-day ranks a close second to fiction .

last year	DATE	the issues of let - ters and memoirs outnumbered the records of pre - vious years by more than a hundred volumes , and elsewhere was a corresponding increase .

		At the public libraries , the demand for biography is fast rivalling that for fiction ; as additions to private li - braries , these life-narratives outrank fiction , poetry , and the essay .

		The line of demarkation between literary forms is becoming less distinct .

		There are extremists who prophesy its ultimate abolition between prose and poetry .

		Carrent drama and fiction are already cor - related and sequential ; history , biography , and crit - icism are verging toward common ground .

		With the exception of a few volumes of constitutional trend , exampled in the work of Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, latter-day history seems destined to fulfil the doc - trine associated with
Carlyle	PERSON	's name and become `` biography of great men . ''

		French history of the Revolution and the Empire has never been so viv - idly presented as in the biographies of Von Hoist and
Saint	PERSON	-
Amand	LOCATION	; the lives of Lincoln and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	form popular histories of the Civil War .

		The present - day enthusiasm over historical romance may be largely traced to this interest in biographic history .

		The charm of ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' resides in the pho - tographic studies of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Arnold	LOCATION	; the most effective scenes in `` The Crisis '' are the revelations of the many-sided nature of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		This infusion of biographic motive into many branches of literature , and the demand for remin - iscent material , is partly due to the consistent de - velopment of biography ; in part , it may be traced to the realistic and individualistic tendencies of the age .

		In a true sense all literature is biography -- the presentation of life .

		From the earlier to the later times , humanity has been divided into two classes with unequal ratio : the smaller division -- in
Aristotle	LOCATION	's phrase `` the contemplative '' -- have 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, been students of the generic problems of life , phil - osophy in its accepted meaning ; the larger circle , or `` the practical , '' synthesize universal life through the individual , and the prevailing note of current civilization is individualism .

		The greater works of early biographical literature were collective .

		Caesars ,
Saints	LOCATION	,
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	,
Martyrs	ORGANIZATION	, were portrayed in group pictures , designed to show their kingly eccle - siastic or pietistic traits .

		Individualism and truth often suffered under such mode ; qualities were strained to make them eligible for inclusion .

		Cur - rent biography , as a rule , is distinctive rather than collective ; the tendency of the day is to aggregate , not to minimize , volumes .

		Occasionally a uniform series of current biography is so elongated that the biographer 's imagination and apotheosis alone award his subject entrance into the arena of state - craft and letters .

		Among collective biographies , two at least have become classics : the immortal '' Lives '' by
Plu	ORGANIZATION	- tarch , well defined as `` the pasturage of noble minds , '' and '' The Worthies of
England	LOCATION	, '' so faith - fully `` endeavoured '' by
Thomas Fuller	PERSON	and pub - lished posthumously in
1662	DATE	.

		This monumental work marked an advance in both method and pop - ularity ; the latter resulted from the former .

		The plan was broad , even democratic , while the style had the vitality of the present rather than that of the stately encomiums of the past .

		The great philosophic movement of the eighteenth century produced , as one exponent , the
Biographical Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of
England	LOCATION	and the
Biographie Universelle of France	ORGANIZATION	.

		Combining the critical and romantic , they popularized biography and gave it two quali - ties of modern forms -- realism and vivacity .

		There are three classes of biographers to-day , and their distinctive qualities may be traced to both evolution and environment .

		One class are urged by ambitious , too often mercenary , motives ; and they may treat subjects wholly alien to their tastes and powers .

		They `` read up '' for their tasks , sometimes exhaustively , more often superficially .

		Lacking any sympathetic interest , they assume a pert , critical tone , and often desecrate facts and the memory of the dead .

		The second class , more com - mon in the past than in the present , are incited by didactic and ethical motive .

		Occasionally , among current volumes , is such an aim discerned , openly or covertly urging imitation , not seeking illumin - ation .

		The tendency now is to submerge the eth - ical beneath the pictorial , to enable the reader to gain the lesson intuitively , not emphatically .

		The recent life-records of
Kingsley	LOCATION	,
Drummond	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son , and Farkman , are masterly sermons on cour - age and aspiration .

		The recital of the histories of Mirabeau or
Byron	PERSON	, without a single commentary , afford ethical warnings as strong as the intellectual stimulus .

		Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	happily mingles the pictorial with the confessedly didactic , in both his - tory and biography , as his lives of the French Revolutionists and the recent study of Cromwell attest .

		The third class of biographers include all those influenced by pure elegiac truth .

		Their biographies are epics and elegies as truly as `` The Odyssey , '' '' Moschus , '' or `` In Memoriam . ''

		From historical interest or personal friendship their memories are filled with incident and inspiration which they would combine into a memorial .

		Reverent love is the key-note of such biographies , and truth and justice are the major strains .

		Among memoirs of this type , four volumes of the past possess per - ennial charm , --
Boswell	PERSON	's
Johnson	PERSON	,
Lockhart	PERSON	's
Scott	PERSON	,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's Arnold , and Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's Char - lotte
Bronte	LOCATION	.

		They are both models and silent censors of current biography .

		Undoubtedly , a part of the fame of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's work was due to its ap - pearance after a season of dry , pedantic biography .

		It heralded a new portrayal of man 's life in its entirety , interpreted by loving insight ; the vain , loquacious fop became exalted into `` the prince of biographers . ''

		His source of incidents was largely conversation ; from this variety of oral revelations he constructed a volume as unique in its origin as it was vital in its potency .

		Lockhart made liberal use of letters and journals ; Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	and
Dean Stanley	PERSON	formed mosaics of memorials and letters , and this method became the favorite with modern biographers .

		A list of recent works testifies to the use of this material in title and sub - stance : '' Life and Letters , '' '' Letters and Me - moirs , '' -- such are the interwoven phrases .

		The outburst of criticism which served , as is often the case , to popularize the work of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	and the subsequent volumes of
Froude	ORGANIZATION	's
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Cross	ORGANIZATION	's
George Eliot	PERSON	, aroused a discussion , not yet silenced , regarding the use of epistolary matter .

		The recent publication of the
Browning	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Bismarck	PERSON	, and
Victor Hugo Letters	PERSON	has still further agitated the critic 's mind .

		There are misanthropes who deride everything that wins popular favor .

		As biography has become vital and thrilling through the media of letters and personal reminiscences , such critics aver its deterioration , and refer its popularity to '' that appetite for slander which is common to all the sons of Adam , though kept down , like other vulgar appetites , by the influence of edu - cation and manners . ''

		The earlier writers used let - ters in the few instances where they existed , but their quantity was so scanty that the narratives be - came documentary and inferential in tone .

		When
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	published the Letters and Speeches of Crom - well , in
1845	DATE	, he placed new value upon such ma - terial , and by personal photograph revealed the man , who could no longer be veiled as soldier , dic - tator , or regicide .

		Current biographies are still documentary , but they are photographic rather than conjectural .

		If one questions the legality of use of letters and journals , one must inquire the primal purpose of a biography .

		It is not to eulogize , not to moralize , not to satirize , but to portray the true character in its entirety , to show the many-sided humanity in private no less than public life .

		Such biography
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 meets two distinct social characteristics of the pres - ent : individualism and altraism .

		The man in his inner aspirations , faults , and hidden virtues , is por - trayed , no less than man as part of the great social organism ; we seek to find the animating and com - pulsive forces behind the public work .

		If , then , the purpose is to show the truth , without smirch of burlesque or veneer of eulogy , of a surety letters form the authentic material .

		With the journal , they represent a confessional of aims , moods , affections , faults .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	wrote to his sister : '' It has been a hobby of mine , though perhaps it is a truism and not a hobby , that the true life of a man is in his letters ... Not only for the interests of the biography , but for arriving at the inside of things , the publication of letters is the true method . ''

		Against this popular form of epistolary biography three arguments have been deduced .

		First , mal - contents affirm that the public has really no interest in the inner life of a celebrity , and that such demand for information has been created by mercenary , sensation-loving biographers .

		While supply may occasionally create a fleeting demand , such reversion of law seldom sustains a long life .

		Undoubtedly the publication of the letters of Chesterfield and
Cromwell	PERSON	and
Walpole	LOCATION	created an interest in such material ; but if such letters had not stimulated the readers , the demand would not have become the present-day clamor .

		Second , it is claimed that , even if such material does please the public , the substance is mere purility , and does not ensure a judicial knowledge of the character ; in fact , that the reader 's pruriency may be pampered , but his mental and spiritual nature receives no betterment .

		The answer to such censure lies in the corrective force of many current biographies , compiled from private epistolary sources , often published with re - luctance as defense against calumny .

		Such has been the reverent mission of Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's '' Mem - ories . ''

		The publication of Thoreau 's '' Familiar Letters '' revealed the hidden heart of of the poet - naturalist , and annihilated forever the charge of cold , hermit-like character .

		The tragic anxieties of
Lanier	PERSON	, and his mystic , unwritten songs , that moan for utterance through his letters , tell the story of his life as no biographer could do .

		The third objection to the use of letters demands more consideration , -- '' the breach of social pri - vacy . ''

		This phrase suggests one great stigma upon the present age .

		Independence is still each indi - vidual 's possession ; privacy seems fast becoming obsolete .

		Four decades ago
Dickens	PERSON	suffered , as nearly all celebrated visitors have suffered since , from
America	LOCATION	's disregard of private rights and seclusion .

		It seems one of the results of extreme democracy that equality and fraternity exclude secrecy .

		This defiance to all decent reserve , this prurient curiosity regarding individual tastes in all commodities from books to cheese , has encouraged the publication of some private letters wherein sacred delicacy has been violated with no return other than scandal and degradation .

		To assume , however , that the larger proportion of letters and journals , when published , violate privacy and de - grade the reader , is an extreme and false conclu - sion .

		The readers of
Froude	ORGANIZATION	's
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Kingsley	PERSON	's Memoirs , or the Love - Letters of the Brownings or
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, do not rank among the sensation - loving public that scans the personal gossip of the yellow journals or gloats over the last erotic novel .

		The readers of biography , as a rule , bring a rever - ential spirit ; the personality of the subject becomes vital to them , and a sense of friendly relation ensues .

		This question of propriety must be submitted to the tact and good taste of the editor .

		In spite of the world 's great elegies , there will always linger in some sensitive minds a doubt whether it is not an artificial form , wherein the poet '' Loves to make iiarade of pain .

		That with his piping he may gain The praise that comes to constancy . '' ''


Margaret Ogilvy	PERSON	'' is a tender , exquisite memorial to motherhood , yet many questioned before they read it -- never afterwards -- if its publication did not suggest a slight irreverence toward the most sacred of human bonds .

		It is true that
Browning	PERSON	wrote , -- '' God be thanked , the meanest of his creatnres Boasts two sool-sides , one to face the world with .

		One to show a woman when he loves her , '' -- but he did not affirm that the latter phase should be hidden from those who sought with loyal sin - cerity to know the entire man .

		To publish such letters during the life-time of their authors would violate dignity and personal reserve .

		Death hal - lows such memorials , and bestows upon them an illuminating vitality at once universal yet reveren - tial .

		Severe is the task allotted the modern biog - rapher who utilizes internal material .

		A truthful portrait does not consist of a series of instantaneous photographs .

		Many trivial incidents are not rep - resentative of the true rounded character .

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	says , with force : '' An editor is not a sweep , and , by the love he bears the author whose fame he seeks to spread abroad , it is his duty to exclude what he believes does not bear the due impress of the author 's mind . ''

		Biographies of the fervid eulogistic type are still occasionally found among current volumes , showing that their inoculation has not caused entire preven - tion .

		Such volumes in the past have called forth answering depreciations , and the pendulum has been long in finding balance .

		Volumes of argu - ment and decades of transforming judgment have been required to recover from the severe and reac - tionary estimates of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	and
Southey	PERSON	.

		A peculiar temptation assails the family or intimate friends to exclude significant defects .

		A taint of inadequacy must cling to a volume of current biography with this confession in the preface : '' The writer of this memorial has not thought it necessary to call at - tention to defects in the character she has sought to portray . ''

		Modern biographical subjects have greatly ex - 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ceeded the limits of the past .

		The subjects of earlier portrayal were men or women of some special era , -- leaders of some political or religious movement , --
St. Augustine	LOCATION	,
Mahomet	LOCATION	,
Turgot	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	, Wa8h - ington .

		The spread of social democracy gave new interest to wider types of humanity , and the age of industrialism has further expanded its confines .

		Carlyle wrote , in his Life of Sterling : `` I have remarked that a true delineation of the smallest man , and his pilgrimage through life , is capable of interesting the greatest man . ''

		Some of the most charming biographies of recent times have made alive some humble , uneventful life , with latent ele - ments of nobility and genius .

		Beside the volumes of letters of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Wellington	LOCATION	recently published , are large volumes devoted to the lives and letters of the Earl of
Selborne	LOCATION	,
George Borrow	PERSON	, and
John Donne	PERSON	.

		The average reader who vaguely recalled the last writer as a satirist and poet , quoted often by
Lowell	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	, could scarcely pre - dict such a charming and ennobling life-record as that written by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	.

		One of the most un - selfish of lives was that of
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	, and her inspiration and self-effacement have brought to her a merited and tardy fame at the hands of biographers and editors .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	delighted to vivify recondite characters from past history and art , and ``
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean '' is a monument to his vivid analysis and matchless style .

		When Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	translated the '' Journal Intime '' of
Frederic Amiel	PERSON	, she gave English readers a wide acquaintance with a life singularly unknown yet re - plete with grandeur and poetry .

		Current biography is sufficiently varied to satisfy the demands of this complex age of realism , science , and romance .

		As the subjects are extended in num - ber , and the incidents are expanded to include '' the round of littles That large life compound , '' 80 the forms of modern biography are most diverse .

		The reminiscent and anecdotal type , largely ob - jective , dating back to
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	and
Pliny	LOCATION	, is yet among the modes of to-day , but it has been ex - panded to give psychologic emphasis to the periods of adolescence and early manhood , which in the past received scanty notice , in the zeal to recount mature deeds .

		A few critics scoff at such '' puerili - ties , '' but this is an age of child-study and the public greet such anecdotal morsels with avidity .

		They supply the fiction element , and at the same time proclaim the scientific perspective .

		The memory of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's mother and her `` serial stories '' is of vital import in tracing the novelist 's impulse .

		The little
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, at nine years of age , making a funeral-pyre of lead-pencils and cinnamon-sticks , reciting the speech of Dido , and offering upon the altar of childhood her pet doll , is a significant pro- phecy of the imaginative , brilliant , neurotic woman .

		In some few recent biographies there is a tendency to submerge the serious life-purpose beneath excess of episodal trifles ; anecdote and witticism are only marginal readings , and a wise biographer has ulte - rior aim beyond a collection of after-dinner stories .

		In all subjective biographic forms , letters , journals , personal memoirs , the subject is his own photogra - pher , yet the editor must carefully adjust the focus and plates that the man may be revealed in his true entirety .


Phillips Brooks	PERSON	well emphasized the triple relationship in all biography , -- the conferees being the subject , the author , and the reader .

		In the best works of past and current times , the subject has the vital and undisputed right of way .

		While the editor or narrator should be in the background , and the personal element should be eliminated as far as pos - sible , yet the presence of a loyal , gifted compiler will be subtly felt upon every page .

		The tendency of current biography is to include rather than ex - clude the medium of narration , with a distinct loss of dignity and perspective .

		In no other branch of literature is greater responsibility thrown upon the reader .

		His part is to become accordant at once , to `` enter the heart and mind '' of both subject and guide .

		A reader 's mental and moral calibre are easily recognizable in the lasting impression from some carefully-edited biography which portrays all phases of its subject .

		The reader whose memory retains most vividly the picture of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's warts and
Carlyle	PERSON	's dyspepsia , who has classified
Cole	PERSON	- ridge and DeQuincey and
Rossetti	PERSON	as opium-eaters first and authors second , who recalls only the awk - ward himsquerie of Lincoln and
Grant	PERSON	, whose only interest in Landor was aroused by the apocryphal story that in a passion he threw his cook out of the window , -- such a reader has written his , or more often her , own character-analysis .

		Biography is too sacred and dignified a literary form to meet the vapid tastes of this class of readers ; it demands broad and sympathetic intellection .

		In spite of the increased scope and forms of biography , some historic and literary characters defy any dramatic or vivid presentation ; toward others , the readers of all decades assume a hostile tone or an unconscious prejudice .

		Shakespeare the man is still unknown , for he has left few '' human documents '' for reproduction beyond his general portrayal through his works , where it is still impos - sible to distinguish the subjective touches from the objective mastery of mankind .

		Readers will never feel sympathetic admiration for
Smollett	PERSON	,
Godwin	PERSON	, or
Southey	LOCATION	; while
Shelley	PERSON	and
Burns	PERSON	and Irving gain warm friends in each generation .

		Recognizing the superior artist in
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, the interest in his life pales before the casual narrative of Beethoven , -- '' O Psalmist of the weak , the strong , O Troubadour of Love and Strife . ''

		The humanity of a subject , rather than his intellect or his genius , assures his strongest popularity .

		Many lives that do not readily yield to extended biography are admirably adapted to brief critique or miniature sketch .

		Current literature abounds in such volumes , a distinct form of later biography .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 The studies of Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, Mr.
Hatton	PERSON	, and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	belong to the realm of criticisna more than of biography , if one is to retain the land - marks of the past .

		The biographic , in condensed studies , has its model in '' Yesterdays with Authors . ''

		The pithy , sentient essays of
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Saintsbury	LOCATION	,
Lang	PERSON	, and
Birrell	PERSON	, and the later political interpre - tations by
McCarthy	ORGANIZATION	, Lodge , and
Higginson	PERSON	, com - mingle the narrative and critical elements .

		The popularity of such volumes attests their adaptation to the crowded days of the present , with the de - mand for the essence and the kernel which the scholar shall extract for the public .

		Charming as are such succinct essays , -- and they have that double charm of the evanescent which Poe empha - sized , -- they should serve their full purpose as suggestion and temporary enjoyment , or as source of those clever anecdotes and hon-mots which add zest to criticism in general conversation .

		There is meagre danger that they will usurp the place or time devoted to careful life-studies ; they are tooth - some entrees , well suited to the clever , rushing age that has produced them .

		Nearly all of the most popular biographies of the last few years have con - sisted of at least two large volumes ; the '' Life and Letters of Spurgeon , '' which won enthusiastic read - ing and ready sale , aggregated over two thousand pages in four bulky volumes .

		Perhaps this is merely a device of the publishers in this mercantile age which guages a book 's success by aggregations in pages and copies sold , which too often confuses the '' big '' with the great ; yet there seems also a healthful sign in the earnest and responsive reading of voluminous editions of the more serious and in - structive literature .

		Biography is the true link between the past and the present , and its universal favor is assured .

		Current issues from the press deal with characters of all ages .

		New lives of
Robespierre	LOCATION	and
Danton	PERSON	,
Jeanne D'Arc	PERSON	and
Cromwell	PERSON	,
Milton	PERSON	and Shake - speare , '' The True
George Washington	PERSON	'' and '' The
Many-Sided Franklin	PERSON	, '' studies of Da
Vinci	PERSON	, Ru - bens , and
Turner	PERSON	, -- one might recount scores of volumes , yearly reclothing past scenes and charac - ters to suit the tastes of this composite age which exacts vitality , accuracy , and literary judgment .

		With reverent skill and scholarship , writers of diverse creeds are awakening a world-interest in the greatest narrative of all time , the life of Jesus .

		Current biography is an antidote to the enervating tendencies of much current fiction and drama ; it is one of the safeguards against neurotic , thought - less reading ; it is recreative , but it is also stimu - lative ; to form a taste for biography should be one of the primal aims of parent and teacher .

		Through - out life it ministers to the higher emotional and mental natures ; on its pages we read the vital lessons of humanity , -- '' There is no life of a man , faithfully recorded , but it is a heroic poem of its sort , rhymed or unrhymed . ''

		The
Selborne Naturalist	ORGANIZATION	.

		* What is the secret of the popularity of `` The Natural History of
Selborne	LOCATION	, '' that it should have passed through more than eighty editions in little over a century , and still remain the great classic in its kind ?

		It appeals not merely to English readers , whom we may suppose to be generally familiar with the plants and ani - mals it discusses , but almost equally to Ameri - cans , who are to some extent without this advantage .

		The explanation lies probably in the fact that the author was a prince among observers , and that he set down simply and without self-consciousness the results of his observations .

		That he was a poet , too , as well as a naturalist , helps to explain the charm of his book , unless indeed it be true that no ar - dent lover of nature can fail to be also a poet .

		A certain stiffness of style characteristic of the period is , we must admit , manifest in his pages ; but still they hold the attention .

		Those who have the best things to tell us seem to have as well the best way of telling them .

		Like many another masterpiece of litera - ture , '' The Natural History of
Selborne	LOCATION	'' was begun more to amuse its author than with any thought of publication .


Gilbert White	PERSON	's turn for metrical composition early inspired some of his friends with high hopes for him as a poet ; but he disappointed them , and devoted himself to studies which , in the end , won him a far more enduring fame than any they could have predicted for him .

		His uneventful life was passed almost wholly at '' The Wakes , '' his modest place at
Selborne	LOCATION	.

		Except for the year -LRB- 1752-3 -RRB- of his proctorship at
Oxford	LOCATION	, he seems to have stirred but little abroad after taking his degree .

		He was a victim of coach - sickness , so that his quiet seclusion was partly forced upon him .

		He held an
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	fellow - ship for fifty years , relinquishing it only at his death in
1793	DATE	.

		His admirers must regret that he incurred the odium of being a sinecure non-resident and pluralist .

		Nor does his pious descendant and biographer succeed in clearing him .

		He rather befogs the whole matter .

		Though he assures us repeatedy that his great - grand-uncle was blameless , and that he never accepted any of the college livings offered him , * Thb Life and

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, yet he distinctly tells us that
Gilbert White	PERSON	did accept the small living of
Moreton Pinkney	ORGANIZATION	, tendered him by
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	, and that he hired a curate to discharge its duties .

		For twenty-five years , too , he himself was curate of Faringdon , still residing at
Selborne	LOCATION	; and all the while he continued a fellow of
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	, and a non-resident one at that .

		What in the name of honesty does the author mean by as - serting , in the footnote to page 100 , Volume I. , that his ancestor never accepted a college liv - ing , and then , only three pages farther on , calmly recording the fact of his '' taking and holding with his Fellowship the small college living of
Moreton Pinkney	ORGANIZATION	'' ?

		The sum and substance of his labored apology seems to be that
Gilbert White	PERSON	did only what fellows be - fore him had done , and that he suffered no qualms of conscience for it .

		His best friend ,
John Mulso	PERSON	, the holder of several sinecures in the church , approved his conduct , and White was content .

		He certainly was not a rich man , as has been alleged ; but we wish he had avoided even the appearance of evil .

		The work before us is made up largely of extracts from the naturalist 's diaries , his letters , and his friends ' letters to him .

		Thus it serves as an admirable supplement to the '' Natural History , '' and helps us to know the man him - self .

		In his Kalendar , under date of
August 20 , 1765	DATE	, we have him as a keen-eyed observer of all that met his notice . ''

		The water wag - tail , '' he says , '' seems to be the smallest En - glish bird that walks with one leg at a time : the rest of that size and under all hop two legs together . ''

		Again , dipping at random into the letters , we find the poet .

		The following , from a letter to a nephew , has a savor of its own : '' Blank verse is , no doubt , when well conducted , full of dignity ; but then perfection in that way is so rare , that we never had but two or three poems that were worth reading .

		A desire of raising the diction above prose pushes men into fustian and bombast .

		Even the great
Milton	PERSON	, the father of blank verse , is not always free from this vice ; but ransacks the whole circle of sciences for a set of hard words and rumbling terms that make his readers stare . ''

		Another letter , dated
July 1 , 1776	DATE	, contains this item of historic interest : '' As I was visiting
last Tuesday	DATE	at Bramshot I saw on the
Portsmouth	LOCATION	road
Burgoyne	PERSON	's light horse march - ing down to embark for
N. America	LOCATION	: the horses were fine , and the men fine young fellows ; but they all looked very grave , and did not seem much to admire their destination .

		The
Atlantic	LOCATION	is no small frith for cavalry to be transported over .

		The expense will be enormous ! ''

		Mulso 's letters to White are good reading .

		It is a pity that
White	ORGANIZATION	's to Mulso are lost .

		A little touch of character is betrayed by the fact that while Mulso always addressed his friend as '' my dear
Gil	PERSON	, '' the latter would never descend from his high stilts , but , as we are told , invariably began his replies with '' my dear Sir . ''

		Even when writing to a nephew , he sometimes used this form .

		It is another trait of his character that he would never sit for his portrait , having been to some extent disfigured by the smallpox in his student days at
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		Consequently the many good illustrations contained in the Life include no likeness of
Gilbert White	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Though partial deafness overtook the natu - ralist in
1774	DATE	, and somewhat crippled him as an inquirer into nature 's secrets , he pushed his work on to its final publication
fifteen years later	DATE	.

		In
January , 1788	DATE	, he writes that he has put his '' last hand '' to the book , but that the index still remains to be prepared , -- `` an occupation full as entertaining as the darning of stockings . ''

		Writing to the Rev.
Ralph Churton	PERSON	, in
August	DATE	, he says of his book : '' The fate of my work is now determined ; and as the tree is fallen , it must lie .

		My brother and nephew have spared no expense about it , and particularly on the engravings , which have cost a considerable sum .

		This book will as you suppose not be published until autumn , when the town begins to fill .

		In the interim the author will be in no small a squeeze ; and will feel like a school boy who has done some mischief , and does not know whether he is to be flogged for it or not . ''

		The work was well received from the first .

		Dr.
Scrope Beardmore	PERSON	,
Warden of Merton Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, in speaking to a nephew of the author , made the following prediction : '' Your uncle has sent into the world a publication with nothing to call attention to it but an ad - vertisement or two in the newspapers ; but , depend upon it , the time will come when very few who buy books will be without it . ''

		In seeking to account for the remarkable success of the `` Natural History , '' Mr.
Holt	PERSON	- White says , among other things : '' Its author did not , as a boy and young man , enjoy the benefit of any instruction in the facts of science ; instruction which would in our time be dignified with the name of a scientific education ; but his reasoning faculties were strengthened and improved by the study of the classical languages , which not only introduced him to the noblest literature , but also taught him to be logical and careful in thought , and accurate in state - ment .

		* It is certainly not extraordinary for beings of large discourse to look after as well as before , but there is something mildly amusing in the disposition to make progress move by centu - ries , and especially the centuries that end in cyphers .

		So long as the creation stood un as - sailed at the year four thousand and four
B.C.	LOCATION	, the Teutonic tendency to pursue the history of even the newest thing out back to chaos could be tolerated if not always cultivated .

		But now that the beginning of things has had such ter - rific set-backs that a thousand years are but as yesterday , we must draw the line somewhere when we attempt to take stock .

		And after all , however it may seem that we discover breath - ing-places and post-stations in the development of nature and society , every seeming beginning is but the climax and close of some other move - ment , and one method of parceling out time and progress is at bottom quite as arbitrary as any other .

		The writers of the articles in the books be - fore us plainly feel the awkwardness of start - ing from the line .

		Most of them reach back for a flying start at least to the
last quarter	DATE	- pole of the eighteenth century , and one or two even return to the dewy dawn of memory .

		As - tronomy alone , and very properly too , seems to have had any regard for dates ,

		ress , and can be recommended as most genuine instruments of culture to those who will read them with care .

		It is one of the most serious drawbacks of our specializing age that each tenth of mankind is as a rule too ignorant of what the other nine-tenths are doing and think - ing about .

		While this knowledge can indeed be obtained by a wide and constant reading of periodical literature , it is just this reading for which the busy man lacks time .

		And , besides , one year brings announcements of achieve - ments and discoveries which the next year re - verses and ridicules .

		Only the specialist is competent to sift year by year the solid and permanent from the transient chaff .

		In these volumes , and so far as they cover the field of human interests , we have this work done for us by competent judges , and in terms intelligible to all .

		It is the ambition of the man of cul - ture to be reasonably well-informed on all im - portant fields outside his special profession or interests .

		These volumes afford him an oppor - tunity to obtain this information under intel - ligent guidance and within practicable propor - tions .

		And not only will the reading furnish the desired information , but the comparison and the differing methods of the two volumes will afford ground for many interesting observa - tions regarding the scope of human interests and the differing emphasis placed upon them by different men .

		For instance , the first of our two volumes contains articles on the following subjects : Evolution ,
Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	, Archaeology , Astronomy , Philosophy , Medicine , Surgery , Electricity , Physics , War ,
Naval Ships	ORGANIZATION	, Liter - ature , Engineering , and Religion .

		While there is no subject here on which the citizen of the world will not wish to be informed , no one can help wondering at the curious order of the topics and at the many staring gaps in the list .

		Electricity receives a chapter in addition to physics , and surgery in addition to medi - cine ; while commerce , sociology , history , gov - ernment , and the arts , aside from literature , are ignored .

		Each of the topics named is treated by a single eminent writer , including such names as
Wallace	PERSON	,
Mahan	PERSON	, and
Lang	PERSON	, ex - cepting religion , which confesses its peculiar standing in the world by requiring consider - ation from four different points of view , and a space of 127 pages as compared with 40 for the average .

		The method of the second volume differs at the very beginning , in attacking the task in eight larger groups of subjects : Law and Gov - 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, eminent , History , Sociology , Literature and the Fine Arts , Education and Science , Applied Science ,
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	, and The Science of War .

		As will be seen , this plan includes the topics omitted from the plan of the other volume , but in its turn it ignores philosophy , archaeology , and religion , save for a single article on Evolution and Religious Concep - tions , although these topics might have found room under one or another of the larger heads .

		Neither volume touches the sciences of phil - ology and psychology , in both of which the nineteenth century made marvelous achieve - ments ; nor charities , nor penology , nor social - ism , all of which have been paramount inter - ests with the foremost rank of mankind during the past hundred years .

		Our second volume has no less noble a list of contributors to display than the first , among them
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	,
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	,
Horace White	PERSON	, and
Kenyon Cox	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it has , on the whole , a more local , a narrower , point of view than the first volume .

		With all the neglect of great and absorbing subjects , it yet has the heart to furnish articles on The Gold Standard and Gold Production ,
The Development of Steel Manufacture	ORGANIZATION	, American Life Assurance , '' Psy - chical Research , '' Printing and Railroad Econ - omy .

		A notable peculiarity of the general plan of the second volume , which should almost re - ceive recognition in the title of the book , is its distinctive Americanism .

		Eight or nine of the thirty-seven articles are expressly limited to the American side of the subject , while many more are treated with more or less special ref - erence to the American point of view .

		Thirty of the thirty-seven writers are Americans - There is perceptible , also , a little more of the tendency to glorify the century just past , to the discredit of earlier times .

		Among so many vastly interesting topics by such eminent authorities it would lead too far to attempt detailed comment .

		The reading of them ought to make a profound impression of gratitude and optimism , not one of mere infla - tion and conceit , at seeing ''
Wie	PERSON	wir 's dann zuletzt so herrlich weit gebracht . ''

		If some chapters make this impression of gratitude more than others , they are probably those on medicine , surgery , and astronomy , in which both volumes have a somewhat similar story to tell .

		Both are well printed and worthy of preservation as well as careful reading .

		The
Paston Ijetters	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The
Paston Letters	ORGANIZATION	are far from being the annals of a quiet neighborhood , although the familiar correspondence of an English family whose position was originally that of small gentry .

		For their time is those eventful years in English history when the white rose of
York	LOCATION	and the red rose of Lancaster were dyed a common color on
Wakefield Heath	ORGANIZATION	and Bos - worth Field .

		The intense human interest of these famous letters has commanded the admiration of read - ers ever since
John Fenn	PERSON	edited them , -- or , rather , those then known , -- in
1787	DATE	.

		It re - mained for Mr.
Gairdner	PERSON	, in 1872-5 to give them to the world in what then seemed as complete form as could be hoped for , since some of them were supposed to be irretriev - ably lost .

		At first sight , the present set of volumes would seem to be a reprint of that edition ; but a more careful examination dis - closes that this is not the case .

		An entirely revised preface and introduction have been pre - pared , and the welcome information is given that above a hundred newly-discovered letters have been added .

		The story of the errant ways of the leaves of this famous correspondence is told by the editor in the preface .

		Between this and the supplement of letters hitherto unedited is the admirable historical introduction .

		Our knowledge of the social life of the men and women of the Middle Ages is not great ; but so much is known that it is not for us to cast imputation upon either our forefathers ' knowledge or their culture or their attainments in the fifteenth century .

		In an age of blood and iron , like our own , they yet felt that the essence of civilization was not in material in - vention or mere political achievement , but in the sway of principles of mind and heart .

		The amount of education possessed by the common people of
England	LOCATION	in that day was not slight .

		Mr.
Gairdner	PERSON	truly observes that `` These letters show that during the century before the Reformation the state of education was by uo means so low , and its advantages by no means so exceptionally distributed , as we might otherwise imagine .

		For it is not merely that Judge
Paston	PERSON	was a man of superior cultivation , and took care that his family should be endowed with all those educational advantages that he had possessed himself .

		This was no doubt the case .

		But it must be remembered that the majority of these letters were not written by members of the

		All could write letters ; most persons could express themselves in writing with ease and fluency . ''

		In
1479	DATE	,
William Paston	PERSON	, a lad of ninetecD , is at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	`` versifying '' in Latin hexameters and sending his effusion to an elder brother for criticism , which implies a classical training in the latter also .

		Sir
John Paston	PERSON	's library contained -LRB- and his letters show that he read them with pleasure -RRB- Chaucer 's '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' '' The Legend of Good Women , '' '' The Parliament of Birds , '' ' • La Belle Dame Sans Mercie , '' and
Lydgate	PERSON	's '' Temple of Grlass , '' though the circumstance that one of the landed possessions of the family , the manor of
Gresham	LOCATION	, had been purchased from the son of the first laureate , may have increased Sir
John	PERSON	's interest in that poet .

		The Shakespeare scholar will be even more interested in these letters , for in their pages Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	-- or
Fastolf	LOCATION	, as the name is properly spelled -- appears in veritable reality , not as a type of the pseudo-chivalry of the fifteenth century .

		Judge
Paston	PERSON	was executor of Falstaff 's will , and the latter left his fairest po8session ,
Caister Castle	ORGANIZATION	, to him , with the understanding that the property be ultimately devoted to the founding of a college wherein were to be maintained `` seven priests and seven poor folk . ''

		The spirit of the will was faithfully kept by his ex - ecutor , who , finding it impracticable to found an independent institution in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, devoted O ^ ister to the support of
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	.

		If
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	perverted Falstaff in order to point the moral of decadent feudalism , yet in one particular he was not altogether unfaith - ful to his character .

		Falstaff -- yet Shallow more so -- was fond of interlarding his con - versation with legal terms .

		His numerous let - ters to Judge
Paston	PERSON	regarding the execution of his will attest his familiarity with the intri - cacies of the law touching property .

		The claims of property are continually thrust upon the reader of these letters .

		Betrothal or marriage where the question of dowry was not considered , even between those outside the aristocracy , were deemed scandalous , and the finer sensibilities of both men and women were singularly blunt .

		Yet they were not without sentiment .

		The love correspondence of
John Paston	PERSON	and
Margery Brews	PERSON	is a curious com - pound of sense and sentiment .

		The girl 's father long held back with reference to the match .

		Writing to the elder
Paston	PERSON	, he says : '' The cause of my wryting un to yow , at thys tyme is , I fele wele ... that ye hafe undyrstondyng of a mater , whech is in commynicacyon tochyng a maryage , with Godds grace , to be concluded betwyx my saide cosyn yowr broder , and my doghter
Margery	PERSON	, wheche is far commonyd , and not yyt concluded , ner noght schall ner may be tyll I hafe answer from yowe . ''


Margery	PERSON	was loyal to her father 's wishes and the custom of the country , but her woman 's heart was sad at times . ''

		If that ye hade not halfe the lyvelode that ye hafe , for to do the grettest labur that any woman on lyve myght , I wold not forsake yowe , '' she writes on
St. Valentine 's Day	DATE	, to '' My ryght welebeloved Voluntyn . ''

		The quality of the sentiment of the fifteenth century seems hard to us .

		We may admire more the simplicity and honesty of the people as a whole .

		One
John Gy wne	PERSON	, a servant , finds a purse on the highway near
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and sends it to his master at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	to know if any of his knowledge , or any other , have lost such a purse , and that the tokens thereof being told he shall have it again .

		An unknown man , evidently young , writes to his friend in
Lincoln	LOCATION	, who is of superior station , in a letter of straightforward friendship and manly purpose : `` A man shall never have love of God , nor love nor dread of good men for miskeeping of much good as though it were his own ; but where it is truly dealt with and goodly disposed then followeth both great merit and worship . ''

		Space fails to tell of the minute things of interest in this correspondence .

		The student of economic and social history , the purely po - litical historian , the genealogist , and the an - tiquarian will all find a mine of profitable study in these pages , which so conclusively prove that history is not the study of dead peoples but the mirror of humanity .

		134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, of
Edward John Phelps	PERSON	, Diplomat and States - man , '' which is now before us .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	was so prominent a public char - acter up to the time of his demise , and his views on burning questions of the hour were so well known , that the thoughtful reader of the present day will be glad to possess those views in a convenient and enduring form .

		But the volume will serve another end .

		It will stamp the author and his opinions as worthy products of the best of which American insti - tutions and American life is capable , and it will pass down to future generations the pa - triotism and scholarship of one of the first men of our time .

		In his address before the
American Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	, on Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	and the constitutional law of his time , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	brought out what he conceived to be some of the true elements of greatness in the great jurist .

		These utterances were so original , so comprehensive , and so eminently fair withal , that they won for the author the highest en - comiums from this very conservative body .

		Here is an illustration : `` ' It is not , in my judgment , as a great judge merely , or in comparison with other great judges , that Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	will have his place in ultimate history .

		The test of historical greatness -- the sort of greatness that becomes important in future history -- is not great ability merely .

		It is great ability combined with great opportunity , greatly employed .

		The question will be , how much a man did to shape the course of human affairs , or to mould the character of human thought .

		Did he make history , or did he only accompany and embellish it ?

		Did he shape destiny , or was he carried along by destiny ?

		These are the inquiries that pos - terity will address to every name that challenges per - manent admiration , or seeks a place in final history .

		Now , it is precisely in that point of view , as it appears to me , and I venture to present the suggestion , that adequate justice has not yet been done to
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has been estimated as the lawyer and the judge , without proper consideration of how much more he accomplished , and how much more is due him from his country and the world , than can ever be due to the mere lawyer or judge .

		The assertion may per - haps be regarded as a strong one , but I believe it will bear the test of reflection , and certainly the test of reading in American history , that , practically speaking , we are indebted to
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	for the American Constitution .

		I do not mean the authorship of it , or the adoption of it -- although in that he had a considerable share , -- but for that practical construction , that wise and far-seeing administration , which raised it from a doubtful experiment , adopted with great hesi - tation , and likely to be readily abandoned if its practical working had not been successful , -- raised it , I say , from a doubtful experiment to a harmonious , a permanent , and a beneficent system of government , sustained by the judgment and established in the affection of the people .

		He was not the commentator upon American constitution law ; he was not the expounder of it ; he was the author , the creator , of it .

		The future
Hallam	PERSON	, who shall sit down with patient study to trace and elucidate the constitutional history of this country -- to follow it from its origin , through its experimental period and its growth to its perfection , to pursue it from its cradle , not I trust to its grave , but rather to its immortality , -- will find it all , for its first half - century , in those luminous judgments in which Mar - shall , with an unanswerable logic , and a pen of light , laid before the world the conclusions of his court .

		It is all there , and there it will be studied by future gen - erations .

		The life of
Marshall	PERSON	was itself the constitu - tional history of the country from
1801	DATE	to
1835	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	discusses the American Com - monwealth in a lengthy essay , taking as his text some views expressed by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	in his book on that theme .

		There is much food for thought and investigation in this paper .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	is inclined to the opinion that many of the evils of representative government are the '' outcome of a vicious and altogether unneces - sary enlargement of the electorate , '' and '' are not the natural consequence of free institu - tions .

		American politics have simply been de - based and corrupted by admitting to the right of suffrage the class who are utterly unfit for it . ''

		He argues that '' if from every constitu - ency there was eliminated every man who could not prove , by his neighbors , that he had the reputation of a decent and respectable life and character , public affairs would be improved thereby .

		The demagogue would , of course , ob - ject to this .

		The material thus excluded from the electorate is his stock in trade .

		But his loss would be the nation 's gain .

		Representative government would rise , as political handicraft declined . ''

		This is not the place to discuss these views at length .

		It is enough for our present purpose to say that the history of municipal experiment shows the necessity of some such radical change as is here suggested .

		These utterances empha - size the courage of Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	, as well as the constructive quality of his mental fibre .

		The volume is replete with thoughts that could well pass as maxims .

		We will quote only a few : • ' The gift of prophecy is mercifully withheld from man .

		Hope , kindlier than prophecy , stands in the place of it , -- the just and reasonable hope , instructed by what has gone before . '' ''

		The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything . '' ''

		There is no ultimate support for law but in na - tional enthusiasm .

		It must appeal to the heart as well as to the reason . '' ''

		The test of all political theories , however erudite and plausible , must be found in experience . '' ''

		No demagogue , no self-seeker , no man who ' f ol -

		THE DIAL 186 lows for a reward , ' has ever struck an effectual blow for liberty or has advanced the cause of human freedom a single step . ''

		The book is prefaced with an appreciative memoir by the Hon.
John W. Stewart	PERSON	, ex - Governor of
Vermont	LOCATION	.

MOWRY	PERSON	.

		Recent Fiction .

		* The Indian seems to be coming back into Amer - ican fiction .

		By this we mean , not the Indian of to-day , as he is depicted for us by those writers of the younger school who have observed him at first hand in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, nor the Indian in his char - acter as a victim of corrupt politics , as he is pre - sented in the stirring pages of ''
Ramona	PERSON	, '' but rather the Indian of the earlier time of which
Cooper	PERSON	wrote , the Indian of romance proper and of the heroic age of the American pioneer .

		Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	brought back this type of Indian for our sympathy and admiration in her vigorous portrayal of life in colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	, and we have just now two historical romances , strikingly similar in theme , which serve to recall the youthful days in which we read , with breathless attention , of the last of the Mohicans , and the tragedy of the dark and bloody ground .

		Mr.
Burton Egbert Stevenson	PERSON	's '' A Soldier of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' is not altogether an Indian story , but its chief interest centres about
Braddock	PERSON	's ill-fated expedition , and the savage strategy which struck with panic and disaster his unfortunate fol - lowers .

		Colonel
Washington	LOCATION	figures pleasantly in this narrative , although the post of hero is reserved for his imaginary friend
Stewart	PERSON	, who takes an active part in the campaign , and at once wins mili - tary renown and the love of the charming heroine .

Joseph A. Altsheler	PERSON	, whose name always guarantees a vigorous and manly tale , true to the essentials of historical fact , and of sustained and exciting inter - est. .

		This is a romance of the campaign against the Indians at the close of the eighteenth century , the campaign which seemed to end in disaster with the defeat of
St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	's forces , but which achieved a lasting success a few years later under the leader - ship of
Anthony Wayne	PERSON	.

		One of Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	's earlier heroes again occupies the foreground in this book -- the
John Lee	PERSON	who suffered unmerited dis - grace through the villainy of a relative , and who left the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	army to seek his fortunes in the
West	LOCATION	.

		As the central figure in the present tale , he achieves distinction in border warfare , and the stigma is removed from his name through the devoted efforts of the courageous woman whose love he has won .

		The scene of his restoration to rank and honor in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, after his return from the field of
Wayne	PERSON	's victory , is highly thrill - ing , and must be reckoned one of the author 's most successful efforts . ''

		D'ri and I '' is a particularly obnoxious title for a book , and creates an initial prejudice not easy to overcome .

		Since the story is written by Mr.
Irving Bacheller	PERSON	, and follows close upon the success of ''
Eben Holden	PERSON	, '' it is assured of a numerous clientele of readers , and no title could interfere greatly with its vogue .

		It begins like its predeces - sor , with a man and a boy , working their pioneer way through the wilderness of northern
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is needless to add that '' D'ri '' is '' Eben '' under a new name , but practicing the old rustic speech and the old homely philosophy .

		The time is early in the present century , and the chief incidents are more or less directly connected with the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The book is one of detached episodes rather than a continuous narrative of organic plan , and we must say that the episodes themselves , although

		136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, strikingly unhackneyed , are far f rona being distinctly worked out .

		In fact , the story bears marks of undue haste in its preparation , and moves along with little regard for either unity of design or finish of execution .

		The book has a noticeably pretty cover , and shows otherwise marks of the good taste that characterizes the recent work of its publishers .

		Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	's novel , ''
Henry Bourland	PERSON	, '' de - serves to share the favor which the public has been bestowing on '' The Crisis . ''

		It is a novel of almost the same period , and almost as good .

		There are certain tricks of craftmanship which Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has learned to perform more successfully than Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	, but the two books are about equally matched in their consciousness of the deep gravity of the historical period with which they deal , and in their power to interpret the passion of the Civil War to the generation that has grown up since the days of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		The differ - ence is that Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	writes with Virginian sympathies , and the lost cause does not seem to him to have been a wholly unrighteous one .

		Another difference is that ''
Henry Bourland	PERSON	'' is only fairly well started when the surrender of Lee 's army is reached , for the novel is concerned less with the war itself than with the period of reconstruction that followed .

		There are several indications in both serious and fictive recent literature that the time has come for a true appraisal of the life of that period in the South , of the acts and devices by means of which the white man regained his political ascendancy , and saved civilization from an intoler - able menace if not from an irretrievable disaster .

		The means were not those which honorable men like to use , but when civilization itself seems to be at stake , even honorable men will not reckon the cost of saving it too closely .

		This novel stands with Mr.
Page	PERSON	's '' Red Rock '' as a vivid picture of the struggle against scalawags , negro politicians and white carpet-baggers , and we do not believe that either novelist has colored his canvas unfairly .

		But it remains true that we can not touch pitch without defilement , and the most impressive moral lesson of
Virginia	LOCATION	history is unfolded in the story of
Mahone	ORGANIZATION	's conspiracy against the honor of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Readjustment the wise called it , but the world knows that it was repudiation .

		With this subject the latter chapters of Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	's book are concerned , and we can not help tracing its con - nection with the episodes of illegal voting and intimidation of which we have been reading a little earlier .

		Mr.
Frank Norris	PERSON	has evidently determined to become the
American Zola	ORGANIZATION	.

		The brutal realism of his first books indicated a marked intention of fol - lowing in the footsteps of his French prototype , and all that was needed to make the parallel complete was the invention of some large scheme of social portrayal which should link together a series of semi-independent novels .

		Such a scheme he has now elaborated , and the general subject of the pro- jected series is indicated by '' The Epic of the Wheat , '' its collective title .

		Three books are planned , dealing respectively with the production , the distribution , and the consumption of our chief agricultural product .

		The first book of the series , '' The Octopus , '' is a story of the struggle between the wheat-growers of
California	LOCATION	and the railroad company upon which they are dependent for access to their market . ''

		The Pit , '' taking us to
Chicago	LOCATION	, will follow ; and `` The
Wolf	PERSON	, '' shifting the scene to
Western Europe	LOCATION	, will complete the trilogy .

		This is a large conception , and Mr.
Norris	PERSON	has dealt with its first phase in a manner that can not fail to win respect and even admiration , in spite of the defects of a method that is essentially inartistic .

		With him , as with
M. Zola	PERSON	, realism means the piling up of great masses of trivial fact , reporting in place of true characterization , and the enforce - ment of his argument by the bludgeon rather than by the rapier .

		Allowing for all that may be urged against the methods of railway companies in gen - eral , and in particular against the methods of the corporation that has held
California	LOCATION	within its con - stricting tentacles , we think that Mr.
Norris	PERSON	has shown himself too evidently a partisan of the agri - culturist , and has failed to deal impartially with the forces that contend for mastery in his pages .

		If only he had given the devil his due , we might be willing to admit the diabolic character of the cor - poration which he assails ; as it is , we are rather inclined to sympathize with the octopus , which stands , after all , for practices that come within the form of law , whereas the practices of the wheat - growers stand for the most part without the law , and illustrate nearly every form of violence and anarchy .

		If the writer means to preach anything , it is that a certain degree of outrage justifies indi - viduals in taking the law into their own hands , and this is the most dangerous sophistry that now con - fronts our civilization .

		We have little doubt , for example , that if Mr.
Norris	PERSON	were writing of an earlier generation in
California	LOCATION	, he would be on the side of the Vigilance Committees rather than on the side of law and order .

		But his book is made an impressive one by virtue of its mere bulk and overwhelming particularity , as well as by certain dramatic episodes that are presented with remark - able vividness and intensity of feeling .

		And the vein of mysticism that crops out here and there is not only distinctly Zolaesque , but also provides a welcome relief from the oppressive atmosphere of the narrative .

		A not dissimilar theme has been chosen by Mr.
Charles K. Lush	PERSON	for his novel called '' The Auto - crats . ''

		In this book the allied forces of capital and corruption are shown at work under municipal conditions , and the struggle is between the people of a great Western city and the franchise-grabbers who operate the system of local transportation .

		The methods employed by the traction companies to enrich themselves by means of iniquitous legis - lation are laid bare with merciless surgery , and those of us who live in cities know only too well

		THE DIAL .

		137 how trathfal is the analysis .

		Mr.
Lash	PERSON	brings to his task both knowledge and sincerity , and adds a fine element of indignation to his account of the situation described .

		These are qaalities that win oar respect , althoagh we feel all the time that the writer has little of the novelist 's essential equip - ment .

		His characters are abstractions , and his powers of invention are far from remarkable .

		If the problem with which he is concerned were not one of vital present interest to our civic life , he would have no close hold upon his readers as a 8tory-t `` ller .

		We follow him with absorbing inter * est , but it is the same kind of interest with which we should follow a history of
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	or of the operations of the late
Jay Gould	PERSON	.

		It is not the interest of art , but of politics or of sociology . ''

		The Puppet Crown , '' by Mr.
Harold MacGrath	PERSON	, is a story of romantic adventure fashioned after the model of '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' and not greatly inferior to that entertaining production .

		The scene is a small kingdom in
Southeastern Europe	LOCATION	, invented for the occasion , ruled over by a weak monarch , and menaced by a neighboring state , to which , in fact , it is mortgaged .

		There are two heroes and two heroines .

		The former are an Englishman of fabulous wealth , intent upon saving the kingdom for its people , and a dashing young American dip - lomate .

		who scents danger from afar , and always finds himself in the thick of it .

		The heroines are the princess of the kingdom and the beautiful bat unscrupulous duchess who sways the fortunes of the rival power .

		The story is extremely animated , and presents a bewildering succession of intrigues , and adventures , and hairbreadth escapes .

		It is envel - oped in a semi-humorous atmosphere , but , on the whole , takes itself seriously enough to appeal rather deeply to the sympathies .

		It is one of the best of the class of romances to which it belongs , and we confidently recommend it for good
summer	DATE	reading . '

		* Graustark , '' by Mr.
George B. McCutcheon	PERSON	, is another romance of the same general type , only in this case the writer has thrown all considerations of verisimilitude to the winds , and indulged in the fan - tastic license of the newspaper reporter .

		It is one of the larkiest of tales , made racy by slangy speech and houffe invention .

		Curiously enough , this story , like the one before mentioned , deals with the for - tunes of a petty state in the same part of the world , mortgaged to an unfriendly neighbor , and rescued from its difficulties by the daring of the young American who becomes enamoured of its princess . ''

		The Kidnapped Millionaires , '' by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Upham Adams	PERSON	, is an audacious story of the capture of half a dozen of our wealthiest men , their conveyance on a private yacht to an inaccessible spot on the Mexican coast , their stay in this en - forced seclusion for some months , and their event - ual escape and safe return .

		Incidentally , the book is a picture of the most lurid form of journalistic enterprise , a graphic account of Wall Street in its most exciting phase , and a serious discussion of the trast problem , together with its possible solution .

		The book teems with actuality , and makes an in - teresting story , except for the chapters in which the trusts are dealt with , and these may easily be skipped .

		The personalities concerned are so thinly disguised that no difficulty is offered in attaching to the figures their real names .

		Such a cognomen as
Andras Carmody	PERSON	speaks for itself , and we quickly recognize
Simon Pence	ORGANIZATION	when he tells us that he stops his clock every night to save it from wearing out too fast .

		The taste of this sort of exploitation of well-known characters is rather dubious , but Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is so effective a narrator that much may be forgiven for the sake of his interesting inventions .

		Without any pretence to the possession of literary art , '' The Kidnapped Millionaires '' provides ex - cellent entertainment , and even food for serioos thought , in the case of the financial questions brought under discassion .

		The book written by Mr.
Arthur R. Ropes	PERSON	and Miss
Mary E. Ropes	PERSON	, entitled ' * On
Peter	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, '' is a somewhat belated narrative of the Russian revolutionary movement in the early eighties .

		In fact the book was planned as long ago as that , which accounts for its rather old-fashioned man - ner .

		These nihilistic plots and counterplots , with their natural outcome of criminal act and merciless suppression , have lost most of their freshness for twentieth centary readers , and it requires an effort to think back to the period in which they were essentially real .

		Much extraneous matter is here united with the nihilist framework of the story , and there is very little organic connection between its several parts .

		In a number of cases , our inter - est gets well started in some particular direction , when we find that we are pursuing a by-way of the narrative , and our attention is sharply diverted .

		We can not say much for the book as a whole ; it is too loose in construction and too rambling in style to prove effective .

		Two or three fairly strik - ing dramatic situations help the interest out , bat they are not skilfolly welded into the substance of the story .

		A woman of country breeding and little educa - tion , but of finely-endowed character and marked physical charm , finding herself rather thoughtlessly married to a man who turns oat to be generally worthless , besides specifically anfaithful , she de - termines to leave him , and seek to earn her own living .

		Coming to
Chicago	LOCATION	, she finds employment in a publishing-house and a long struggle with pov - erty begins .

		Presently , she finds herself drawn into the companionship of a young man who occu - pies a responsible position with her employers , and love appears as the natural sequence of their re - lations .

		They decide to live together as man and wife , and are successful in imposing apon society .

		The man has refinement and generous impulses , but the weakness of his character is such that when the worthless husband dies , the relation is not immediately made legitimate .

		The realization of this despicable trait in the man to whom she has given herself determines her upon a second separa - 138 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, tion , which is about to be accomplished , when the man is aroused to a sense of his dastardly conduct and makes what atonement is in his power .

		This is '' The Story of
Eva	PERSON	, '' told for us with much art and sensibility by Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	, who has made a clear advance upon his earlier work .

		It is all skating on thin ice , no doubt , but the situation is a perfectly legitimate one for a novelist , and Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has treated it with good taste , and with no touch of offensiveness .

		He has pathos at his com - mand , and the gift of vivid sympathy .

		His method is one of minute realism , but we hasten to add that it is the realism of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and not that of
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		Indeed , as much might be inferred from what we have already said .

		The character of the heroine is presented with singular charm , and even the hero is made to seem deserving of a sort of qualified forgiveness before we take leave of him .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	always contrives to tell a good story , and to secure a certain artistic finish in the minute details that is a constant source of sat - isfaction to the critical reader .

		In '' Pro
Patria	ORGANIZATION	'' he has told an even better story than is his wont , having for his theme an attempt of the French gov - ernment to invade
England	LOCATION	by means of a secretly - constructed tunnel beneath the English Channel .

		How this attempt was discovered by an officer of the English army , and foiled by his persistent , and for a time unthanked , vigilance , is the plot which we are invited to contemplate .

		The weak point of the story is that it requires us to believe that a work of this gigantic description , involving the united efforts of thousands of men , could be carried nearly to completion without the secret 's leaking out .

		This inevitable difficulty is fairly realized by the author , who does his best to give an air of probability to the situation , but it remains a nearly insuperable difficulty despite his best efforts .

		Another thing that strains credulity is the fact that the warning of the English officer is unheeded by the War Depart - ment ; such carelessness would b6 simply impossible , no matter how preposterous seeming the tale brought to the attention of the officials .

		But the story re - mains a good one , for all of this inherent flaw , and we have enjoyed it thoroughly .

		Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	once more gives evidence of his remarkable versatility in `` The Luck of the Vails , '' which is as different as can be from '' Dodo , '' on the one hand , and from his novels of the Greek war of liberation , on the other .

		It turns out to be an essentially melodramatic novel of En - glish life , involving the fortunes of a young noble - man , whose life is menaced by the ingenious machinations of the hoary-headed scoundrel who , in the event of the hero 's death , will succeed to the estate .

		Failing to thwart the proposed marriage of
Lord Vail	LOCATION	, this interesting and subtle contriver of villainies seeks to do away with him in a surprising variety of fashions .

		An ancestral jewel has an inscription warning the possessor of danger from frost , fire , and rain .

		In seeking to ally himself with the fate that hangs over the young man 's head , the villain invokes all three of these agencies , one after another , and only a series of happy acci - dents prevents his fell purpose from being accom plished .

		We must say that a hero who is so dense to the warning suggestions of his friends , and who remains unsuspicious of the person who thus seeks his life , hardly deserves the luck which attends him throughout the history , but since the story could not exist at all without this requirement , and since it is a rather thrilling story to read , we must accept this weak feature for the sake of the strong ones .

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's '' Lysbeth '' must be de - scribed as a pot-boiler .

		It has not even the imper - fect powers of imagination and characterization that saved his earlier books from being mere rub - bish , and of historical atmosphere there is hardly a trace , although the scene is laid in one of the most fascinating of historical periods .

		Briefly , it is a tale of the Spanish persecutions in the Nether - lands , and has all the stock figures that we asso - ciate with this hackneyed setting .

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has enough invention to keep the story going , and that is about all we can say in his favor .

		One of the most entertaining of the many novels written by the late Grant
Allen	PERSON	will be found in ''
Linnet	PERSON	, '' a romance of the
Tyrol	LOCATION	in particular , and cosmopolitan
Europe	LOCATION	in general .

		It is the story of a Tyrolese girl who becomes a famous singer , and of an English poet and composer who loves her in her primitive unsophisticated days , who is separated from her by her marriage with her mercenary manager , and who , when the husband is conveniently disposed of by the very useful vil - lain , achieves the desire of his heart .

		Linnet is a singularly charming person and she at once wins her way to a place in .

		our affections .

		A capitally conceived secondary figure is that of the hero 's friend and companion , a critic whose glib speech and pretentious assumption of omniscience furnishes entertainment at all times , and who turns out to be a cad of the basest type .

		The neatness of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's craftsmanship and the ingenuity of his in - vention were never better displayed than in this bright and animated story .

		A novel by the author of '' The Gadfly '' is sure to attract attention , and we opened Mrs.
Voynich	PERSON	's ''
Jack Raymond	PERSON	'' with high anticipations of pleas - ure .

		They were not rewarded , for the book is about as unpleasant a performance as we have met with of recent years .

		To say this is not to deny it the possession of much force and feeling ; un - fortunately , these qualities are exhibited in connec - tion with a story that has little unity of design , and that is based in considerable part upon motives of perverted sexuality . ''

		There are some vices whose grotesqueness stirs us more deeply than downright atrocities , '' says Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, writing of the '' Con - fessions '' of
Rousseau	PERSON	, and the text is suggested to us by more than one episode of the book before us .

		We do not wish to take a narrow view of any form of art , but if ever the rule of reticence demands obedience , it is in such matters as these .

		The value

		THE DIAL .

		139 of ''
Jack Raymond	PERSON	'' consists almost wholly in its sympathetic study of the temperament of the youth who is the principal figure .

		A number of translations , more than usually in - teresting , call for mention before the close of this review .

		First of all , there are three books by the veteran Hungarian novelist .

		Dr.
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	.

		`` The Day of Wrath '' is a story written more than half a century ago , when the pace of fiction was still set by the fashion of German romanticism and when the author , saddened by the failure of the Hungarian revolution of
1848	DATE	, was disposed to take a gloomy view of life .

		It is essentially the story of a peasant uprising in rural
Hungary	LOCATION	, brought about as the natural consequence of a pestilence , when unscrupulous agitators played upon the super - stitions of a credulous folk .

		It is a lurid and ex - travagant tale , abounding in horrors and heroisms , and like most of the author 's books , racy of the soil upon which the scene is laid .

		The translation is slovenly to a degree beyond excuse .

		Dr.
Jokai	PERSON	's ''
Manasseh	LOCATION	'' is a novel of somewhat later date , with a more cosmopolitan cast , although the most striking chapters take us to
Transylva	ORGANIZATION	- nia and among the '' Szeklers , '' or frontiersmen , who long resisted the Austrian domination .

		The principal characters are Unitarians , which accounts for the real title of the book , '' Egy az Isten , '' mean - ing '' One is the Lord . ''

		It seems that there are something like seventy thousand Unitarians in
Transylvania	LOCATION	, the sect dating from a grant of re - ligious toleration in the sixteenth century .

		Histor - ically , the story takes us to the fifties , and the bat - tle of
Solferino	LOCATION	comes into one of the later chap - ters .

		We regret to note that the translator has seen fit , or been constrained , to abridge the narra - tive extensively , which we can not believe is a justi - fiable thing to do .

		The third of Dr.
Jokai	PERSON	's novels before us is one of his latest productions , having been translated from the manuscript under the author 's supervision .

		It is entitled '' Dr.
Dumany	PERSON	's Wife , '' and is of the period culminating in the war between
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		A publisher 's note tells us that the author was born in
1825	DATE	, and is now sixty-six years of age -- two statements difficult to reconcile .

		The first lines of the story itself tell of a traveller who took the
St. Gothard	ORGANIZATION	road for
Paris	LOCATION	at a date preceding by several years the opening of that road for traf - fic .

		A little later in the book , when we are pre - sumably in the sixties , we meet with amateur pho - tographers -LRB- long before dry plates were invented -RRB- , and come upon discussions of such things as the simian descent of man and the insidious doings of microbes .

		The author has frequently displayed his magnificent disregard of historical facts , but his anachronisms are not usually quite so evident as these .

		The story is essentially a modern one in both incident and feeling .

		It is picturesque , melo - dramatic , and full of the national spirit of
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Like most of the author 's works , its inventions are quite untrammelled by any considerations of prob - ability , and the cost is never counted when a bril - liant effect is to be reached .

		His work is always more suggestive of the `` Arabian Nights '' than of anything in modern fiction .

		In
Hungary	LOCATION	, we are told , the stories of Mr.
Kal	PERSON	- man Mikszath are almost as popular as those of the more widely famous writer we have just been considering .

		Upon reading '' St.
Peter	PERSON	's Umbrella , '' the book with which this writer is now introduced to the English public , we can easily understand its success .

		It is a quaint , whimsical narrative of life in a Slovak village , with much folk-lore and local coloring , rich in a shrewd sort of philosophy , and brightened by flashes of the most unexpected yet unmistakable humor .

		The story itself is of the slightest , and there is little attempt at serious char - acterization , but upon the thread of his invention the author has strung such a succession of pretty pictures and witty remarks that the interest is not allowed to flag for a moment .

		We feel that a real treasure has been unearthed for as by the transla - tor of this delightful book .

		M. de
Soissons	LOCATION	, prefacing his translation of `` An - ima Vilis '' from the Polish of
Miss Rodziewicz	LOCATION	, declares it to be his purpose to supply a corrective for the false impressions of
Siberia	LOCATION	that many peo - ple get from melodramatic books about nihilists and from '' cannibalistic newspaper articles . ''

		Here is a story that has nothing to do with dungeons and con - spirators , with the
Third Section	ORGANIZATION	and administrative exile .

		It is a story of the real Siberians , of their struggle for a livelihood under difficult conditions , of the monotony of their lives , and of the ordinary human and domestic relations .

		There are no verv striking figures in the book , and the story , as such , is hardly worth considering .

		But truthfulness to life and sincerity of purpose are apparent in its every line , and the writer is one well deserving the acquaintance of the English-speaking public .

		In * '
Sigurd Eckdal	PERSON	's Bride , '' the author ,
Herr Richard Voss	PERSON	, has evidently been inspired by the ill-fated Andree expedition .


Sigurd Eckdal	PERSON	, with a single companion , starts to discover the
North Pole	LOCATION	in a balloon .

		The companion , who is the rejected lover of
Sigurd	PERSON	's betrothed bride , returns alone after a year or more , and reports that
Sigurd	PERSON	, confronted by failure , has thrown himself from the balloon .

		In fact , the companion has murdered him .

		After a while , he persuades the bereaved `` bride '' to marry him , but his conscience allows him no rest .

		Oppressed by the burden of his aw - ful secret , he makes a written confession of the crime , without , however , intending that any one shall read it .

		But death overtakes him unexpect - edly , in a great fire at
Throndhjem	LOCATION	, while he is heroically engaged in saving lives .

		Thus doubly a national hero , his fame seems secure , but his widow , discovering the fatal confession , feels it her duty to proclaim the truth to the world .

		The iron - ically tragic situation thus created is exceedingly powerful , and the writer has a firm grasp of its psy - chological capabilities .

		Incidentally , the book por - 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, trays with much impressiveness the dreariness of life in the north of
Norway	LOCATION	, and in this respect is strik - ingly like the Siberian novel previously mentioned .


Signora Serao	PERSON	's `` The Land of Cockayne '' is a story of
Naples	LOCATION	, and of the evil effects of the
National Lottery	ORGANIZATION	upon the characters of a people without self-control .

		Her canvas is a crowded one and includes all the types of Neapolitan society , from the humblest to the most aristocratic .

		The realism of the story is of the sort that accumulates all the minute details conceivable , and leaves the reader to select for himself those that are signifi - cant .

		But there is no denying the power of this gifted writer or the faithfulness of her depiction of the life that she knows so well .

		In its character as a tract , or a crusade , the book deserves to rank with `` Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin . ''

		It has the same faults of vehemence and exaggeration , but it also stirs the conscience in the same way .

		The lottery evil may be a far less serious menace to the social welfare of the nation then is here assumed , and yet deserve the most energetic and impassioned measures for its suppression .

		Still , a book goes artistically wrong that shows us hundreds of people who make gam - bling the principal object of their lives , yet none of whom ever draw prizes .

		The odds strongly favor the government , no doubt , but there are still many chances to win ; otherwise the Neapolitan folk could not be presented to us as rational human creatures .

		Last upon our list of recent translations comes the '' Labor '' -LRB- Travail -RRB- of
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		It is a far cry indeed from the Rougon-Macquart books , with their accumulation of repulsive details , to this lyrical exaltation of the dignity of toil , to this impassioned presentation of the noblest ideals of social justice and the solidarity of mankind .

		The author does not escape from his earlier methods , however , for he still gives us interminable technical descriptions and family histories .

		But his spirit is a new one , or rather it is a spirit not readily to be found in the books that first made him famous , although we suspect that it better represents the man behind the work than all the realistic elabo - rations of '' L'Assommoir '' and '' La Terre . ''

		As a matter of fact ,
M. Zola	PERSON	is of the romantic school by instinct , and has now given up the attempt to suppress his true character .

		The essential purpose of '' Labor '' is to present the author 's ideal of the sort of cooperative endeavor that he believes will prove the ultimate solution of the great social prob - lem .

		His socialistic community offers an enticing spectacle , and his belief in the perfectibility of hu - man nature is so whole-hearted that it proves con - tagious while we remain under the spell of his glowing pages .

		Afterwards , doubts creep into the mind , and we begin to realize the artificial charac - ter of the whole scheme .

		But the book is so fine in its conception , and so noble in its idealism , that it can hardly fail to quicken the most sluggish heart , and bring hope to the soul that is most despairing of social progress .

		That a smooth and well - trained voice has more elementary beauty and is capa - ble of more intense and varied expression than any instrument , we are all aware ; but few of us realize the natural attributes which proclaim the successful vocal - ist .

		The author names them totidem verbis : an attract - ive appearance , the gifts of the musician , quickness of conception , and the power of representation , together with requisites of relatively minor importance -- a good ear , a sound and rich voice of extended compass , added to an ardent desire to become an artist , -- such is the essential equipment of those that would travel the fair if thorny road that stretches out before them .

Manuel Garcia	PERSON	-LRB- who is living at nearly ninety years of age , in

Etelka Gerster	PERSON	,

Nellie Melba	PERSON	, all of whom owe so much to their teacher .

		As has been pointed out , she is something more than a great teacher of singing -- she is at once the great enthusiast and philosopher of her art .

		Her present volume embraces an elaborate analy - sis of the connection of music with the human voice , as well as critical comment on its position with reference to individual ability , in such a manner as to enable one to discriminate and determine a voice that has no po - tentialities of successful training .

		The volume contains intimate recollections of persons famous on the concert and lyric stage , and includes a brief review of the mu - sical conditions prevailing in

		The story of
Scott	PERSON	's life goes along with a swing that is not interrupted by too much discussion of his literary characteristics .

		The book is intended for the general reader rather than the specialist , and for that reason the details of such things as
Scott	PERSON	's en - tanglement in the failure of the
Ballantynes	LOCATION	are given only so far as they are necessary to our understanding of the story .

		The experiences out of which
Scott	PERSON	's writings were to grow are carefully traced from boy - hood , and in '' The Lady of the Lake '' and '' Guy Man - nering '' we find again the spirit of spectacular and picturesque romance that had kindled his early imag - ination .

		The pathos of

		In some quarters ,
Scott	PERSON	has been greatly over-rated ; but in the two concluding chapters of criticism in this book there is full recog - nition of the faulty construction of his novels , of the diiSuseness and slovenliness of his style , of the lac -RSB- ^ of verbal felicities , and the absence of any inspiration be - yond the commonplace in his poetry .

		It is a series of chapters no less inter - esting than its predecessor ''

		No fact or situation is too familiar or too commonplace to be untranslatable by him into terms both of poetry and of religion .

		For example , take this passage a propos of standing by the bank of a city river : `` The river gathers up the filth and garbage of the city until it becomes fetid and loathsome , but a dozen miles be - yond it is again clear and pure .

		Filth is always foreign substance , and

		She filters it through gravel beds , strains it through cloud sieves , plants her rivers with water - cresses and lilies , and peoples her deeps with a thousand forms of animal life , revelling in a beauty of their own , and all for the purpose of purifying her waters ... Life , like water , may hold in solution a thousand sub - stances ; but through all its restless motion , it is per - manent and changeless .

		Rocks crumble into sand , mountains are carried into the valleys , but the sea re - mains .

		So forms , dogmas , and institutions may change , but the sea of life ever rolls in great tides toward the heavenly attractions . ''

		In discussing `` Art Music , '' he denies that this is essentially , although sometimes it may be , an outg ^ wth of the folk-song , the folk-song having as little to do with the noble melody of Mozart or Beethoven as the pretty prattle of an intelligent child with the weighty sayings of the same child when grown into a world-wise poet .

		The great German composers having shown how themes must be treated to produce great works of art , all great works must conform to these conditions until some better form is discovered .

		A folk-song can do no more than give a sort of quasi - local color to a composition ; consequently it is vain to look for an American school of music to grow out of '' plantation melodies . ''

		Dvorak 's '' American Sym - phony '' is in no sense a development from indigenous American music .

		It is a symphony constructed in ac - cord with the well-known plan that owes its existence to the Teutonic element in music .

		The only result at - tained by the choice he has made of its themes is that it sounds like the apotheosis of the '' minstrel show . ''

		In discussing `` Modern Tendencies in Music '' Dr.
Clarke	PERSON	finds a trend toward harmonic freedom and toward formlessness , and away from melody and '' tune . ''

		To give up melody for recitative , and form for vagueness , seems akin to atavism rather than prog ^ ssive evolu - tion ; but Dr.
Clarke	PERSON	finds gains to offset the losses .

		Despite the extravagences into which some composers have fallen , the emancipation of harmony is a great step forward , and it is quite possible that from the pres - ent formlessness some new and more beautiful forms may be evolved .

		Also , there is hope in the cultivation of the best class of music in which there is now a wide - spread and ever-growing interest .

		Whereas , in our country , music formerly was a luxury within the reach of the wealthy and cultivated classes exclusively , its most interested patrons at the present time are found among the people at large .

		By the formation of choral and other musical organizations , and in very great de - gree by the generous liberality of men of means and public spirit , it is now possible for everyone to hear the greatest of instrumental compositions -- performed by orchestras of unsurpassable excellence .

		Only a master - mind can treat large subjects in the brief yet scholarly fashion of this little book , in which both the amateur and the professional will find matter well worth his while .

		AteanshMtke `` Th ® Philosophy of History , '' by Mr. law ^ kuwttm
S. S. Hebberd	PERSON	, is a carefully-wrought developmenL essay , in which the attempt is made to establish a single law of thought which will successfully explain the course of human development .

		The author finds this fundamental law in the statement that '' causes can be known only through their effects ; and , con - versely , effects can be known only through their causes . ''

		Taking this fundamental law as a key , the author ap - plies it in turn to the doors of human history , and makes it open them all in succession , from the contem - plative systems of Indian thought to the industrial con - flicts of the nineteenth century .

		The book can not be even summarized here ; but it may be said that its treatment of old problems is fresh , logical , and in many respects convincing .

		Especially is this true of the chap - ters on classical and mediaeval art , in which the law of '' unity in dependence '' is admirably illustrated .

		How the book will be received by the followers of the great school of philosophy which it antagonizes , is not certain ; but it is likely to command their interest .

		Mr.
Heb	PERSON	- berd 's close adherence to his thesis occasionally betrays him into some extravagances , as when -LRB- p. 305 -RRB- he makes the newspapers and churches , and in large degree the colleges and universities , subservient to the conjoint rule of the bosses and the monopolists .

		But in general his thought is temperately and lucidly expressed , and appeals both to reason and right feeling .

		Mr.
Hebbard	PERSON	is his own publisher , at
La Crosse	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		A preciau * bock 1 ° Bishop Spalding 's '' Aphorisms and o/Aphoritmt Reflections '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- we have one and BejUetUnu .

		of the best books we know of the class indicated by its title .

		At whatever page the volume be opened , the reader will find a thought worthy of consideration or a principle worth putting into practice .

		Undoubtedly , as the author says in his Introduction , '' The thoughts that keep us company , like persons with whom we live , influence us in secret and unnoticed ways ; like spirits , they flit about us , and create au 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	,
Sanborn	PERSON	's life of
Emerson	LOCATION	, atmosphere in which the soul prospers or droops or faints . ''

		Hence the value of having at hand a book like this , vital with so much fine wisdom of experience , in - spiring through its faith in the worth and sacredness of human life , in the joy of living , in civilization and pro- gress , in God and the soul .

		The lovers -- and they are many -- of Bishop Spalding 's earlier books will rejoice in this precious addition to the series .

		With the greatest admiration and even enthusiasm for his subject , Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	's volume on
Emerson	LOCATION	, in the series of '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not what we should expect from one who knew
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	so well .

		There is a lack of color and definite - ness in the picture which is hard to explain , but which all Emerson lovers will feel .

		Perhaps Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has been oppressed by the weight of hifi material , for he knew
Emerson	PERSON	long and intimately , and , moreover , he feels that previous biographers have failed to grasp the principal
spring	DATE	of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		This trait he conceives to be versatility , and the presence of his subtle and sincere thought in every pathway of the hu - man intellect .

		But that Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has been success - .

		ful in presenting this aspect of his subject will not be granted .

		The principal value of the book to many readers will be its chronology of
Emerson	LOCATION	's life .

		Even the bibliography of a dozen volumes fails to mention some of the best sources for
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	research .

		`` ' Empresses of
France	LOCATION	'' is the suggest - F ^ ehEm * ^ lsL ^ ^ ® * ' ^ ^ ® ° ^ * handsome volume issued by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and written by Miss
Harriet A. Guerber	PERSON	, who has made her name known as the author of several '' popularizing '' books , intended to make easy the paths of classic myth - ology , mediaeval folk-lore , and modern history .

		The three women to whom their evil destiny brought the name of '' Empress of the French '' presented an invit - ing theme to such a pen ; and the result is this series of three narratives in which the life-stories of
Josephine	LOCATION	,
Marie Louise	PERSON	, and
Eugenie	PERSON	are told with a fluency and gossipy detail which make entertaining reading enough , but are better suited to the limp labyrinth of a
Sunday	DATE	newspaper than to the permanent elegance of form be - stowed upon them by the publishers .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		For the many who are unable to view the annual exhibitions of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	a large measure of consolation is offered in the volumes of '' Royal Acad - emy Pictures , '' issued for several years past by
Messrs. Cassell & Co. , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In comprehensiveness and author - ity , as well as in the artistic quality of its reproductions , this work holds a foremost place among publications of its kind .

		The issue for
1901	DATE	, just published , is made doubly attractive by the inclusion of five full-page photogravures , instead of but one as heretofore .

		With Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	's Preface , and the numerous notes , this latest volume of `` Royal Academy Pictures '' forms as satisfactory a black-and-white reproduction of the late exhibition at
Burlington House	ORGANIZATION	as could be desired .

		When people began to take sides for and against the
King and Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in the rising tide of the American Revolution , much alarm was felt by the patriots because the Loyalists , as the pro-British were called , were so strong and influential in the city and colony of
New York	LOCATION	.

		This was due largely to the predominance then of mercantile interests , which were unwilling to see trade interfered with for the sake of political principles .

		At the close of the war the feeling against these Loyal - ists found vent in the treatment which is usually ac - corded the vanquished by the victors in warfare .

		A thorough study of this phase of the Revolution has been made by Mr.
A. C. Flick	PERSON	in his '' Loyalism in
New York	LOCATION	during the American Revolution '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has wisely compiled a systematic presentation of the facts concerning the origin of the Loyalists , their activity against the patriots , and their subsequent hardships , rather than a justifica - tion or condemnation of their attitude toward their country .

		Mr.
Charles Alfred Downer	PERSON	's ''
Frdd	ORGANIZATION	^ ric
Mistral	PERSON	, Poet and Leader in
Provence	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a careful critical study of `` Mirfeio '' and its fellow-poems , and an account of the author 's life based upon careful research as well as personal acquaintance .

		Furthermore , it is a history of the Felibrige movement and a treatise upon the Provencal language .

		The work belongs to the series of literary studies that have been prepared by recent candidates for the doctorate of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , and illustrates a sort of original work far better worth doing than the counting and cataloguing that too frequently do duty for a doctor 's thesis .

		In a bulky monograph entitled '' Political Nativism in
New York State	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Louis Dow Scisco	PERSON	traces the history of the anti- foreigner movement from the first riot against the Catholics in
New York City	LOCATION	in
1806	DATE	.

		He finds the feeling against aliens especially strong in that city and state , both because this region was the first destination of immigrants , and also because it had been peopled previously by Englishmen -- the hereditary foe of the Irish , who predominated among the new comers .

		The effect of this social question on national politics between
1835	DATE	and
1860	DATE	occupies the largest part of the author 's attention .

		The movement is summed up by him as peculiarly un-American and narrowing in its aim , al - though a prominent factor in rounding out the ideal of the nation .

		The latter paradox is satisfactorily ex - plained by showing that it led to more homogeneity in religion and in social life , and thus became ultimately a benefit , although outwardly a failure .

		For all to whom the humor of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's '' Tribune Primer '' makes its appeal no better edition could be found than that lately issued by the
Mutual Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The broad caricature of Mr.
F. Opper	PERSON	's seventy-five drawings is well adapted to the work in hand , and the volume has the further advant - age of including , in addition to the '' Primer , '' a number of Field 's earlier miscellaneous writings , such as the '' Auto - Analysis '' and `` The Two Friars . ''


Maryland	LOCATION	, a
Border State	ORGANIZATION	, which did not secede from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in
1861	DATE	, was exempt from the
Emanci	PERSON	- pation Proclamation of President Lincoln , which pri - marily destroyed slavery in so many of the States .

		How the anti-slavery element in that state succeeded in freeing her from the system is told by Mr.
William Starr Myers	PERSON	in a monograph on '' The
Maryland	LOCATION	Con - stitution of 1864 '' -LRB-
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author thinks that the Civil War simply hastened an action bound to come eventually from economic and senti - mental causes .

		The sixth annual report of the
John Crerar Library	PERSON	, covering the year
1900	DATE	, has just been issued .

		Its most noteworthy feature is the portrait and memorial sketch of the late
Huntington W. Jackson	PERSON	, who was one of the original trustees named in the will of the founder .

		What is probably the first English translation of Bal - zac 's dramatic works will be published this month by
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	.

		These plays , five in number , were written during the best period of the author 's lit - erary career , and have all beeu produced upon promi - nent Parisian stages .

		The translator 's name is not g ^ ven .

		The
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	has completed the first volume of the new -LRB- third -RRB- series of its publi - cations .

		The volume for
1900	DATE	, now at hand , inclndes four numbers , the last of which is a monograph on '' Cur - rency and Banking in the Province of the
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts Bay , '' by Mr.
Andrew McFarland Davis	PERSON	.

		Although this work comprises nearly five hundred pages , it covers only the '' currency '' half of its subject , and the sec-ond , or '' banking '' half , will receive treatment in a later publication , to be included in the
1901	DATE	volume of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of these books .

		Mr.
Frank M. Morris	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	annonnces a limited reprint of the ''

		Mr.

Wallace Rice	PERSON	.

		A second impression of Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	's Poems , published a few weeks since , is announced by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lovers of genuine poetry will be glad to learn that there is such a demand for Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's book , for by general consent of the critics no volume of American verse has appeared for many a day so strong in the higher qualities of poetry .

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	's life-work , the prepara - tion of the

		The combination of all forms of insurance in one group is advocated by Mr.
Allan H. Willett	PERSON	in '' The Economic Theory of Risk and Insurance '' -LRB-

		When
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	celebrated his sixtieth birthday in
1888	DATE	, his friend ,
Henrik Jaeger	PERSON	, wrote the critical biography which , in Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	's English translation , was published eleven years ago .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	was probably the first American reader , not Scandinavian by descent , to become acquainted with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's work , and he has borne in this country the same pioneer relation to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	criticism that Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has borne in
England	LOCATION	, and is unquestionably the most competent
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	critic in
America	LOCATION	.

		The work has for some time been out of print , owing to the destruction of the remaining copies in the fire of
February , 1899	DATE	.

		Since it is the standard English work upon its subject , a new edition has been greatly needed , and this the publishers are now about to supply .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has written for the new edition a supplementary chapter which gives an analy - sis of the six plays that
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has produced since
Jaeger	PERSON	's book was written .

		This makes the book a complete account -- the only one existing in English -- of the life and writings of the great Norwegian whose career is now unhappily drawing to a close .

EDWIN ARNOLD	PERSON	Its subject is the circumnavigation of
Africa	LOCATION	by the Phoenicians six hundred years before
Christ	LOCATION	.

		Ithobal is a sea-captain of Tyre , who takes service with
Neku	ORGANIZATION	,

		After picturesque scenes at
Tyre	ORGANIZATION	, where he buys in the slave market , with a priceless pearl , an African princess , made captive in the

Suez	ORGANIZATION	and sets forth .

		All this is minutely described , together with full details of the voyage of fifteen thousand miles round
Africa	LOCATION	.

		SIR
HENRY M. STANLEY	PERSON	, in a leUer to the author , says of it : '' You have added greatly to the happiness of many of your race , in every continent , by the production of so unique a poem , so rich in tJie beauties of the sweet English langvuge . ''

		NOTES 190 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS ... 191 -LRB- A classified list of 1,800 titles announced for pabli - eation during the coming season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF T HE C OMING YEAR .

		The task of indicating , among the contents of a list of books that numbers not far from two thousand titles , the really important and significant announcements , is one that can not be performed with any degree of thoroughness .

		We have taken a cursory and impressionistic survey of this vast field of prospective publica - tion , and noted a few things that seem par - ticularly deserving of prominent mention , but we have doubtless passed over two or three times as many more that will prove equally valuable additions to our libraries .

		The inad - equacy of this brief summary grows more ap - parent with every year , as the activities of anthors and publishers become multiplied , and as our classified catalogue of Fall announce - ments fills with every year an increasing num - ber of our pages .

		For American readers at least , we should say that the long-awaited biography of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	is likely to prove ** the book of the year . ''

		Intrusted to the competent hands of his intimate associate and friend , Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	, this biography has been prepared with leisurely industry , and the author has had access to practically all of the available bio - graphical material .

		We have no doubt that Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	has risen to the occasion , and produced at the same time the most important of his own works and one of the most important works of biography in American literature .

		Our English friends , perhaps , will take a less exalted view of
Lowell	PERSON	and his books than our own ; to them the leading biography of the year is likely to be found in Mr.
Graham	PERSON	Bal - four 's life of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, or , if not in that , in Mr. Le & lie
Stephen	PERSON	's ** Life and Letters of
John Richard Green	PERSON	. ''

		The three books together will certainly make this season memorable for biographical writing , even if we take no account of such other works as '' The Making of an American , '' by Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	, the '' Reminiscences '' of Mr.
George S. Boutwell	PERSON	,
Bishop Creigh	PERSON	ton 's life of
Lord Grey	PERSON	, the two - volume life of Pasteur by
R. Vallery-Radot	PERSON	, Mr.
David Masson	PERSON	's biography of
Chatterton	LOCATION	,
Miss H. Augusta Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Gail	PERSON	174 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	,
Hamilton	PERSON	's Life in Letters , '' Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	's life of
George Washington	LOCATION	, Miss
Mary S. Austin	PERSON	's ``
Philip Freneau	PERSON	, the Poet of the Revolution , '' and others too numerous to mention .

		In the department of historical writing , we find no books of such striking prominence as the three biographies above mentioned , but we find many attractive titles , such , for example , as the Right Hon.
James Bryce	PERSON	's '' Studies in History and Jurisprudence '' ; Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's `` The Mystery of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	'' ; a three-volume history of `` The American Fur Trade of the Far West , '' by Capt.
Hiram M. Chittenden	PERSON	; '' The Civil War , '' by Professor
John W. Burgess	PERSON	; ''
George Washington	PERSON	, and Other American Addresses , '' by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	; the concluding volume of '' A His - tory of
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; '' Historic Towns of the Western States , '' edited by Mr.
Lyman P. Powell	PERSON	; and many new volumes in the standard series .

		One of the most noticeable features of this year 's list is found in the extraordinary num - ber and variety of reprints of the best literature of the past .

		In spite of the seeming craze for new books , and the unprecedented sales of the popular fiction of the day , the evidence grows stronger every year that bookbuyers are turn - ing more and more in the direction of good standard literature , and are creating a demand for reprints that makes this field of bookmaking one of the safest as well as one of the most profitable in which the publisher of taste and discernment can work .

		Here are a few titles that fill us with pleasurable anticipations : '' Colonial Prose and Poetry , '' in three volumes , edited by Messrs.
W. P. Trent	PERSON	and
B. W. Wells	PERSON	; a '' Temple '' Balzac , in forty volumes ; a `` Temple ''
Bronte	PERSON	, in twelve volumes ; Lane 's '' Arabian Nights , '' in six volumes ; an edition of
Samuel Richardson	PERSON	, in twenty volumes ; a '' Temple ''
Bible	LOCATION	, in twenty-four volumes ; a new edition of Mr.
Forman	PERSON	's
Keats	PERSON	, in five volumes ; a new
Dickens	PERSON	, in twenty-nine vol - umes ; a new
Carlyle	LOCATION	, in twenty-six volumes ; and several new editions each of
Scott	LOCATION	, Shake - speare , and
Dumas	PERSON	.

		After all , these are the books that one places upon the shelves of his library with the greatest satisfaction .

		A few miscellaneous announcements , which we can not refrain from mentioning , may be brought together in a paragraph . ''

		More Let - ters of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	'' will delight thou - sands of refined readers .

		Mr.
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	will have a volume of essays on '' Victorian Prose Masters . ''

		Professor

		Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells will be sure to discourse charmingly of the '' Heroines of Fiction . ''

		Lovers of
T. E. Brown	PERSON	's poems and letters will be glad to add his '' Essays '' to their collection . ''

		Societol - ogy , '' by Professor
W. G. Sumner	PERSON	, will deal soberly with themes that occasion much irre - sponsible vaporing .

		The first volume of Pro- fessor
J. M. Baldwin	PERSON	's great '' Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology '' will take its place among the standard works of reference .

		The `` Modern Scandinavian Literature '' of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	will for the first time in the English language deal readably and author - itatively with its deeply interesting subject .

		Finally , we can name the titles only of such books as Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's '' Hypolymia , or The Gods in the
Island	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	's '' Essays of an Ex-Librarian , '' a new volume of essays by Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, Professor

Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' Captain Sir
Richard F. Burton	PERSON	's '' Wanderings in Three Continents , '' and the late
Benjamin Harrison	PERSON	's `` Views of an Ex - President . ''

		Coming last of all to poetry and fiction , we note under the former category only one book that can be safely taken beforehand as a con - tribution to the permanent treasures of the language .

		That book is Mr ,
W. E. Henley	PERSON	's '' Hawthorn and Lavender , '' a volume of lyrics that will be sure to have the true singing qual - ity .

		On the other hand , the promised output of novels seems to include more interesting titles than we remember to have seen brought together at one time .

		Here , indeed , the hope - less nature of our task becomes most evident , for who shall say in advance what successes are to be soored by the fiction of the year ?

		Confining ourselves to well-known writers , we will at least mention a few books that can be bought on faith and on the reputation of their predecessors .

		Here is the random list : '' The Right of Way , '' by Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; '' Some Women I Have Known , '' by ``

		THE DIAL 176 THREE LYRI CAL A NTHOLOGIES .

		Shortly before his death
Francis Turner Palgrave	PERSON	pat forth the fifth book of '' The
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, '' thus completing , as far as he could do , a work which has had more influence on recent English literature than almost any other book .

		The determination of poetry to the lyric form was probably decided before .

		Burns ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	, the great influences , were lyric ; democ - racy , with its dispersion , its lack of criticism , was lyric ; even science , with its denial of design , its reference of the frame of things to spontaneous genesis , was lyric .

		Everything thus held together , and
Falgrave	ORGANIZATION	's book came at the right moment to fix the tendency to regard the Song as the highest , almost the only , form of poetry .

		It was perhaps a necessary phase of human thought , though it will be a pity if it becomes permanent .

		With the Greek anthology , Greek literature practically came to an end .

		But the poets of
Alexandria	LOCATION	did not claim equality with the great Athenians .

		They were fall of admiration for them .

		Even the immodest Mar - tial , in late Roman literature , only put forth a modest claim for the short poem .

		But many mod - ern lyric poets , and the critics who aid and abet them , are of a different mind .

		They claim for their song a unity , an intensity , and a perfection denied to other kinds of literature .

		Certainly they are wrong .

		No lyric in existence has the unity , the totality of impression , of the great dramas and poems .

		As for intensity , there are single moments in
Dante	LOCATION	or Shakespeare which outblaze all the lyric poetry of the world .

		Among mountains the greatest masses push up the highest peaks .

		In execution alone , in splendor of music and phrase , can lyric poetry vie with the blank verse of our best poets .

		Aristotle demanded `` a certain magni - tude '' for literary greatness , and he ignored lyric verse : `` nor am I confident he erred . ''

		But the deed is done ; modern poetry is overwhelmingly lyrical , and it is worth while to try to assess some of the results .

		We open the lately-added fifth book of Falgrave 's ''
Grolden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	'' expecting to find
Tennyson	PERSON	enthroned supreme ; and the surprise is great when we discover Arnold usurping the seat of rule .

		The number of lines quoted from each is about the same , but it is impossible not to feel that the weight and power is with
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Tennyson 's shorter bursts of keen and piercing song are fairly quoted , but not his rich earlier music ; and it would seem that
Palgrave	PERSON	had deliberately set aside his most massy and profound pieces . ''

		The Palace of Art , '' '' In Memoriam , '' `` Maud , '' the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	ode , have no place .

		Instead of these ,
Palgrave	PERSON	gives the later ballads , dramatic realizations of eccentric character or embodiments of pathetic themes .

		With the exception of '' Rizpah , '' these hardly seem to me of sufficient importance to shoulder aside the more exclusively lyrical work of a great lyrical poet .

		Browning is abundantly represented , but again dramatic narrative takes the place of those pieces where with intensity of pathos
Browning	PERSON	atones , if at all , for a lack of simplicity and sensuousness .

		`` Evelyn Hope , '' I should say , is worth half the things quoted .

		Specifically ,
Browning	PERSON	is hardly a poet at all , though a subtle and stimulating intel - lect .

		Had he gone in for law , he would have been the g ^ eat `` st special pleader in
England	LOCATION	; had he entered the Church , he might have become the Head Master of the Jesuits .

		There is a good deal of
Barnes	PERSON	and
Clare	PERSON	, who were especial pets of Pal - grave 's .

		Their poems hardly seem to me more than pretty .


David Gray	PERSON	, who is not admitted , had probably a more intense gift than either .

		One of the surprises of the book is the prominence given to
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	.

		By one of
Palgrave	PERSON	's most felicitous touches of arrangement , his best poem opens the section , and gives a promise hardly ful - filled by the rest of his work , which has a delicate etheriality suggestive of both
Shelley and Poe	PERSON	, but far inferior to either .

		All in all , the `` Golden Treasury '' is a wonder - ful book .

		Using the poems of others ,
Palgrave	PERSON	has made a mosaic of his own -- a work of design and creative art .

		Many other collections exist which contain the same poems and masses of equal work .

		But in all these the pieces are ill-arranged ; they are chaotically heaped ; they swear at each other ; they have no general effect But in Pal - grave 's work , so true is the tone from beginning to end , so absolute the harmony , that the poems help each other with reflected lustre ; they deepen each other 's notes with choral echo .

		This effect has been produced by ruthless suppression of much of the mightiest lyric poetry of the language .

		Palgrave knew what he was about , and sacrificed without pity , especially in the earlier editions of his book , many a piece whose brilliancy or whose glare woald have thrown his general sober coloring out , as he did many a one whose elemental power would have been dissonance in his cultured orchestra .

		The fierce expressions of love , of revolt , of despair , -- ecstatic visions or opium dreams , -- nothing of these is here .

		And what is the result ?

		The book brings up before us a perfect image of that
England	LOCATION	which we all keep in our thoughts -- the image of a land of rich woods and long-tamed fields , of flowery hedges and rose-fronted cottages , of war-cradled castles and pensive homes of fame .

		No stain is on the picture , which is one of ordered splendor and secluded peace .

		Turn now to the '' Treasury of Irish Poetry , '' edited by Mr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	and Mr.
T. W. Bolliston	PERSON	.

		Everything that is wanting in
Palgrave	LOCATION	's volume is here .

		The Celtic madness and the Celtic inspiration -- the glamor of a ghostly past , the bloodthirsty cry of exultation , the wail of defeat , the farewell of exile -- revolt and fury and fun -- all these are here .

		Comparing the two books , one might almost say that
Ireland	LOCATION	has been in a spirit - 176 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ual as well as a physical sense the breakwater of
England	LOCATION	; that the force of the ocean of passion and the fury of the stomas of thought had been expended upon it , leaving the English spirit to ride at anchor in the calm beyond .

		Palgrave could not have admitted `` The Jolly Beggars , '' but `` The Night Before
Larry	PERSON	was Stretched '' is a matter of course in the Irish Anthology .

		Yet , the purity of the Celtic poetry is notable .

		Archness and gal - lantry there is in plenty , but no taint of sensuality .

		The Irish Celt is an idealist , while his Scottish brother and his
Saxon	PERSON	foe are both liable to lapses of the flesh which often make their song defiant of decency .

		We have heard a good deal of the Celtic Revi - val recently , and have had perhaps a dim suspicion that the young leaders of this movement belonged to the amiable body of Log-Rollers .

		It was Mat - thew Arnold who , more than anyone else , revealed to them the genius of their race ; and they have been making some rather unfounded claims based upon his criticism .

		Take , for example , the matter of style -- of natural magic in expression .

		Judg - ing from Messrs.
Brooke	PERSON	and
Rolliston	ORGANIZATION	's selections , I should say that with a single astounding excep - tion the modern Irish poets fail in the very quality which Arnold indicated by that term , and which he thought entered into English poetry from Celtic sources .

		English poetry tends to the pictorial , Irish to the musical .

		Now style is really a two-fold thing of form and phrase .

		Form is that gift which looks before and after -- which regards the unity , the flow , the total effect of a whole piece ; phrase is the concentrated flash , the ruddy flush in the words .

		The Irish poets are preeminent in the first quality .

		Beside their art , so profound as to seem unpremed - itated , of easy lilt and interwoven rhyme and echoing refrain ,
Shelley	PERSON	himself is cramped and
Swinburne	PERSON	monotonous .

		They have doubtless in - herited this art from the Celtic bards of old , who made a business of poetry , and went about with a train of apprentices , and kept school for the mys - teries of rhythm and rhyme .

		But for the appoint - ment of words to body forth a visual image , the modern men at least have no particular genius .

		If Irish verse were challenged to tell down its coins of speech line by line with contemporary English or American poetry , it would be bankrupted before the others had begun to draw upon their treasuries .

		There is , however , as I have said , one remarkable exception ,
George Darley	PERSON	, and the five or six pieces in the collection quoted from him burn and blaze like a handful of opals amid a mass of colorless crystals .

		Palgrave slipped one of his poems -- '' True Loveliness '' -- into the Seventeenth Century section of the '' Golden Treasury '' as originally pub - lished , and it has passed muster ever since as an exceptionally beautiful poem of that age .

		An even greater piece is quoted from the '' Fight of the For - lorn . ''

		There is nothing like this in English litera - ture save Gray 's few translations from the Norse , and they are pale in comparison .

		Even
James Clarence Mangan	PERSON	, the greatest name in modern Irish poetry , is not a stylist in the sense of mastery of vivid words , but he is second only to
Poe	PERSON	in richness of rhythm , haunting melo - dy , and the power of total effect . ''

		My Dark Ros - aleen , '' ''
Karaman	PERSON	, '' '' A Vision of Connaught , '' `` Gone in the Wind , '' -- these and many others are potent and overwhelming poems .

		They demand to be read aloud , to be chanted , and , like certain strains of music , they almost compel the listener to rise to his feet -- to dance , to express in motion the feelings they convey .

		Emotion , then , rather than intellect , is the mark of Irish verse .

		From the Street Ballads , through
Tom Moore	PERSON	, Lover ,
Callanan	PERSON	,
Gerald Griffin	PERSON	, Sir
Samuel Ferguson	PERSON	,
Aubrey de Vere	PERSON	, and Graves , down to the younger men and women of to-day , Irish poetry cries , laughs , threatens , despairs , in verse which is the very echo of the meaning .

		A sense of the contrast between
Ireland	LOCATION	's romantic past and its deplorable present is always in the poet 's mind , whoever he may be .

		No literature is so affectionately national .

		And no literature , it is to be feared , ever effected so little practically .

		Ossian 's Celt , '' who always went out to fight , but who always fell , '' seems the permanent type .

		It is refreshing to have left in the world a race which knows nothing about common sense , but which , at least , has never mistaken the glint of the guinea for the rising of the sun , and which has always been as easily intoxicated by wit and poetry as by potheen .

		The literature of this race is gifted and attractive , but it would be uncritical to praise it as a revelation or place it among the great liter - atures of the world .

		It is doubtful whether it can show any work of the first importance , and it has a narrow range .

		Irish poetry is local .

		English poetry is cosmopolitan .

		English wits have never been home-keeping youth .

		Before
England	LOCATION	sent her fleets to the four quarters of the earth to gather old empires and new discovered continents into its ring-fence of rule , the English poets swept over all times and climes and made booty of the best themes and figures of the distant and the past .

		They seized upon the heroes of other races to be the Janissaries of their poetic array ; they made a Circassia of every country to stock their seraglios of song .

		En - gland 's greatest epic is Hebrew ; its mightiest dramas , Roman , Italian , and Danish ; its greatest history is European .

		Splendid piracy !

		-- but the result is that English poetry is the most imperial poetry of the world .

		Palgrave 's Anthology covers a period of three hundred years of poetic bloom ; the
Irish Treasury	ORGANIZATION	extends over thrice that time , for a great part of the poems are translations or imitations of the ancient Gaelic .

		The recently published book of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	includes only one hundred years of American song .

		How do we stand the comparison ?

		Miraculously well , considering the enormous diffi - culties our poets have had to contend with .

		They have been under a tacit convention to deal only
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 with home themes .

		Yet American life has been new , it has been prosperous , and it has been domes - tic , -- thiee disenchanting conditions for poetry to deal with .

		Generation after generation of the leaves of song have not fallen to enrich the soil for fairer growths .

		The spirit of oar nation has not been unified by foreign conquest on any large scale , or deepened by disaster at home .

		Our national ideal has been to get rich .

		We have believed that we could be saved by commerce and made glorious by manufactures .

		Yet the American public is some - what inconsistent .

		It thanks
Grod	PERSON	, like
Audrey	PERSON	, that it is not poetical , -- yet it bridles up with anger when a candid friend ventures the same opinion .

		`` What ! ''

		it says , `` have we not all the heredita - ments and appurtenances of human beings ?

		Are not our men brave ?

		Are not our women beautiful , and therefore , ex officio , poetical ?

		Have we not had sieges , battles , backwoods life , and piratical adventures ?

		What more do you want ?

		One can only say that these things are facts , and that facts have to suffer a sea-change before they can become poetical .

		Out of the millions of great hap -LRB- -RCB- ening8 of the world , out of the myriads of millions of heroic or beautiful human beings , how many have become permanently interesting and poetical ?

		En - gland has had a hundred wars , but only two of these , perhaps , -- the War of the Roses and the Scotch Invasion of the Young Pretender , -- were of much use for poetry or romance .

		Why do poets cling to the Tale of Troy and
Pelop	ORGANIZATION	's line ?

		Why have they hailed with delight the revival of the cycle of Norse myths and the Irish legends ?

		For one reason , a subject does not become poetical all at once .

		The fact must be half forgotten and a slow accretion of fancy grow around it .

		History is not poetical , and legend is .

		What specially qualifies a subject for poetry it is impossible to say .

		It is enough that a poet can seldom make a theme poetical out of his own head .

		All the greater American writers have instinct - ively known these truths , they have felt the bare - ness of American life , and , each in his own way , have fought against it .


Hawthorne	PERSON	did a great trade in importing to our shores the abstractions and allegories and ipantastic imaginations of the Old World .

		Longfellow and
Cooper	PERSON	idealized the In - dian and the Backwoodsman , and the dark and bloody borderland which they discovered is one of the few things of American experience which has impressed itself on foreign literature .

		Poe turned his back on realities , and colonized a region of inter - stellar space with wraiths of human fate and phantoms of his own imagination .

		Everybody experimented .

		It is not my desire to claim for the body of im - aginative work so produced equality with the con - temporary literatures of other countries .

		It is certainly inferior to that of
France	LOCATION	, and probably to that of
England	LOCATION	.

		But lyric poetry does not depend so much on subject .

		In it the poet 's soul and art are the prime factors .

		And here it seems to me we have no need to take off our hats to any literature in the world .

		Take the three Anthologies I have been comparing : Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's volume enormously outweighs Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's in intellectual force and splendor of language .

		And
Poe	PERSON	alone sums up and surpasses the special Celtic gifts of unity , impression , and music .

		The issue between Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and
Palgrave	PERSON	is more doubtful .

		Let us run over the muster-roll of the chiefs on either side , -- name the warriors who must meet in single combat in the middle field .

		Against Tennyson we must send forth
Poe	PERSON	.

		Tennyson is immensely the most varied , but he is in great part derivative , a good deal of his work is trivial , and he has no new secrets of art to communicate .

		Poe is sole , original , self-born .

		His every stroke tells , and as a teacher of technique he is only beginning his career .

		I believe the judgment of posterity will follow that of foreign nations , and count him the victor .

		Ar - nold is a harder man to dispose of .

		Emerson is more than his match in high thought , and deep , divine , pellucid phrase ; but , unfortunately , he sel - dom moulded thought and vivid words into good poetic wholes .

		To oppose him to
Arnold	LOCATION	is like sending out a boy with a handful of golden pebbles to fight a knight incased in glittering armor .

		As a lyric poet , Whitman would overwhelm and oblit - erate
Browning	PERSON	.

		I neither object to nor admire Whitman 's metre .

		It gives up most of the ad - vantages of verse , yet it is a sufficiently sounding instrument ; and when
Whitman	PERSON	gets rid of his price-current lists of poetic materials , and gives as a poem with a theme , a poem with a beginning , a middle , and an end , he is very great .

		His two best pieces are large and glowing odes , and are stamped with immortality .

		Longfellow 's poetry has lost a good deal of its original brightness , but still we may leave him to take care of the English ladies , Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Lowell , with his Barns-like ardor and his Drydenic energy of line , is surely equal to
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Both are stylists , and
Lowell	PERSON	has the better themes .

		No English inheritor of the lyre of
Wordsworth	PERSON	has drawn such austere and majestic strains from that instrument as
Bryant	PERSON	.

		As for the ranked followers of these leaders , they are at least most numerous on the American side .

		There are in particular a great number of writers of single poems which are or will become classics .


Edward Coates Pinckney	PERSON	's '' A Health '' -LRB- our best love-song -RRB- ,
Ticknor	PERSON	's `` The Virginians of the Val - ley , ''
Cooke	PERSON	's `` Florence Vane , ''
O'Hara	PERSON	's `` Bivouac of the Dead '' -LRB- a poem which if its verbiage were cut out would outrival the masterpieces of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Parson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Lines on a Bust of Dante , '' and Ly tie 's '' Antony to Cleopatra , '' -- these are a few of the superb estrays of our literature .

		On the whole , I do not hesitate to claim for American lyrical verse an equal place with
England	LOCATION	's con - temporary work .

		A nation 's crown is won at last by the song of the poet .

		THE SONNETS OF DE HEREDIA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The appreciative notice , in your issue of
July 16	DATE	, of Mr.
Frank Sewall	PERSON	's excellent translation of '' The Trophies '' of Jos ^
Maria de Heredia	ORGANIZATION	leads me to sup - pose versions of two of the sonnets , lying by me , may be of interest to your readers .

		They were made seven or eight years ago , on the appearance of M. de Here - dia 's book .


M. de Heredia	ORGANIZATION	has a way of fitting the movement of his verse exquisitely to the thought , which of course , like the other subtle beauties of his work - manship , is quite inimitable .

		In order faintly to hint it , I have allowed myself an anapaestic movement in the sonnet called The Conquistadores , Mr.
Sewall	PERSON	's version of which you have quoted .

		This will at least institute a contrast between its tone and the dreamy air of the
Cartagena	LOCATION	, however illegitimate such a move - ment may be thought to be in a sonnet .

		THE CONQUISTADORES .

		Like a flii ^ ht of gerfalcons out of their nest , Tired of the pomp that exalts but enslaves , From Palos or Moguer , the captains and braves Sailed forth , by a vision heroic possessed .

		Of the fabulous wealth they were going in quest That Cipango had ripened in far-away caves .

		And the trade-winds were driving them over the waves To the mysterious shores of a world in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Each evening , in hopes of an epical morrow , A golden mirage for their dreams they would borrow From the phosphorent blue of the tropical sea ; Or over the prow they would gaze wistfully .

		And watch from the depths of the ocean arise Strange stars climbing slowly the unknown skies .

		TO A DKAD TOWN .

Cartagena	LOCATION	of the Indies , 1532-158S-1697 . -RSB-

		Ah , mournful town !

		once ocean 's queen wert thou , And to thy harbor giant galleons drew , Where unscared birds in peace their prey pursue And errant clouds alone cast shadow now .

		Black heaps , thy crumbling walls lie low enow , -- Such work did
Drake	PERSON	and
England	LOCATION	's miscreant crew , -- While
Pointis	PERSON	' bullets , pearls of ebon hue , With coronet of glory ring thy brow .

		Between the burning sky and murmuring sea , When noontide casts the spell of sleep on thee , These old conquistadors come back in dreams ; And , in the stillness of the hot night-calms , Thou nursest thy old glory , and it seems Returned to thee a-slumbering ` neath thy palms .

		liEAVBS FROM A BUST IjIFE .

		* '' Is it possible that by any even chance pos - terity can get hold of these egotistic letters and hold me up to the howls of hoi polloi ? ''

		inquires ''
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	'' in one of them .

		And hoi polloi , who were her eager supporters through a life of varied usefulness -- and mis - chief , will be glad to know that their knowledge of that bright and indefatigable personality is not to end with her published writings , innu - merable as these were , but is to go on to the greater intimacy which her sister has now made possible . ''


Gail Hamilton	PERSON	, '' as most of at least the older readers know , is the pen-name of
Mary Abigail Dodge	PERSON	, the ''
Gail	PERSON	'' from the final syllable of her middle name and the ''
Hamil	PERSON	- ton '' from the little town in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	where she was born , as had been her ancestors for some hundreds of years .

		Her life extended from
March , 1833	DATE	-LRB- the day of birth is not given -RRB- , to
August 17 , 1896	DATE	.

		Into these sixty - three years she crowded the work of many personalities , busying herself about scores of projects , writing not less than twenty-six vol - umes of prose , verse , juvenilia , essays , history , biography , politics , sermons , editorials , biblical exegesis , and what not .

		Some of these topics , but not all , can be found discussed in the two duodecimo volumes containing
1090	DATE	pages which have been massed together by an elder sister .

		Miss
Hannah Augusta Dodge	PERSON	, to whom many of the letters were addressed .

		Through her whole life ,
Miss M. A. Dodge	PERSON	insisted upon the separation of her private per - sonality from that involved in her authorship and public writings .

		Letters sent to '' Miss
Abigail Dodge	PERSON	'' she refused to answer .

		She always felt it a burden upon her to have the two sides of her life brought together , and believed that her power would have been magnified greatly if her pen-name had remained a secret .

		Yet she took the frankest pleasure in the measure of fame her published work brought her , and these letters reveal a desire for praise and appreciation which is almost childlike .

		In the face of this fact , the good taste of such an exposure as is here made of her inmost heart is questionable ; nor has the editor showed the highest qualities of her office in making *
Qail Hamilton	PERSON	's Life in Letters .

		Edited by H ,
Augusta Dodge	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		Boston :
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 her selections .

		Small matters which shed no light upon the character of
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	, little personalities which must work harm to the living , crude ideas which were carefully worked over for public print , and a thousand minor matters which should have had minute censorship , are among the sins of commission ; while great gaps in the author 's life , failure to mention some of the most important things in her career , or to glean from her letters expres - sions of opinion on historical facts where her opinion would have been valuable , are as evi - dently sins of omission .

		Such is the absence of any reference to Miss
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's connection with the family of
James G. Blaine	PERSON	, a connec - tion first one of blood alone , but soon deepening into one of warm and almost bitter partisanship in the objects of
Blaine	ORGANIZATION	's ambition .

		More ex - asperating still is the editor 's fancy that her function does not extend to the correction of obvious errors , even of spelling , though she must have known that these are literally the first of her sister 's writings to be given the public without such consideration .

		One reads of ``
Raphael Meng	PERSON	, '' ``
Hamilton Aidee	PERSON	, '' '' Gen.
Berdau	PERSON	, '' '' Mrs.
McVeigh	PERSON	, '' and many more .

		The use of initials for persons who do not wish to be better known is also annoying , and the occasional use of an illuminating foot - note takes away all excuse for there not being hundreds more to cast light upon dark places and give these letters their full value .

		Xor is it possible , except in the minority of instances , to learn to whom the letters are addressed at any given time .

		More specific defects may be noted on page 695 , where a word dropped from one line into another makes the latter read '' fault it was the fault of society '' ; on page 998 , where '' a pair of O 's '' should evi - dently read '' a pair of naughts '' ; while the use of the expression '' contrabander '' in a letter given date as of
September 25 , 1859	DATE	, must surely have been written after General
Butler	PERSON	's decision in
1861	DATE	had made that term applicable to the negro slaves of the South -LRB- p. 245 -RRB- .

		These faults , and many more easily perceptible , should find correction in the second edition , to which we hope the book will come .

		For , in spite of everything , there was little that
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	did during her public life which was not interesting , and her writings , whether in public prints or to private persons , have the charm of a fascinating and always intelligent personality .

		She had a clever knack of hitting ojff the characteristics of those with whom she was brought into contact , of which the following account of an experience in Con - cord ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in
June , 1855	DATE	, is a good example : ''
Rose Hawthorne	PERSON	met me at the statioD , and I was cordially welcomed ...

		Emerson has the sweetest smile possible , is very courteous , speaks slowly but distinctly ... After they were gone , Mr.

Saturday	DATE	, Mr.

		The philosopher took us out into the bam , and climbed over old sleighs and wagons , dug down under old boards , brought up one rusty thole-pin , one short oar and one long one , and transmitted us through the back bars to
Walden	LOCATION	.

		His sister-in-law told me afterwards that she asked him when he came in if he had been shutting

		We lamented the inhospitality of the owner , and Haw - thorne said , < Miss Dodge , get in the boat and sit down on this seat .

		Perhaps he wonldn ' t like it . ' ''

		In this same paragraph Mr.
Frank Sanborn	PERSON	is mentioned , the recently published volume on
Emerson	PERSON	from his hand bringing a vastly re - moved past and the immediate present into almost perplexing contact .

		Here is a portrait of her host ,
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	, taken some time later : '' He is a glorious man , a very ideal man in his per - sonal appearance , with an infinite forehead , his gray , dry , long hair thrown back from it in all directions , deep lamps of eyes glowing out from under their heavy arches , black eyebrows and moustache , a florid , healthy face -- a pure , sensitive , reticent , individual man whom it is enough to have seen , to have looked at , to have been in the same house with .

		He talks little , but he talks extremely well . '' ''


Mary Abby Dodge	PERSON	, '' as she called herself , was at the first inaugural ball given President Lincoln , and leaves this sketch of it : << It was so late before Mr.

		When he came , the band struck up ' Hail to the Chief Who in Triumph Advances . '

		Everybody formed on each side of the room , leaving a passage between , Mr.

		Before this was half through we went out to supper , and when they came back , my attendant ... took me up .

		I said , ' Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, I am very sorry for you , but indeed I must shake hands . '

		He then gave me another shake , and with a very pater - nal and benevolent and gentle squeeze , said , < Ah !

		your hand does n't hurt me , ' and then the crowd came np and I passed on . ''

		This is capital , but lacks just the touch of per - sonal portraiture that she gave

William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	, as he appeared iu his native town of
Newburyport	LOCATION	in

That evening I was invited to supper with him , and the next morning drove over with him to

		He reproduces , recreates almost -LRB- , -RRB- the characters with whom his pen has made you familiar .

		I like him better than any public reader I have ever beard .

		He has less mouthing and unnaturalness . '' ''


Gail Hamilton	PERSON	, '' it will be remembered , had a certain reputation as a public scold , which these letters of hers do little to diminish .

		Here is a really choice bit of sarcasm : '' Quite an event happened in church yesterday .

		A minister got hold of an idea , -- not our own , but a neighboring clergyman , -- a man of rut aud routine , -- got a real , living truth on his lips , and announced it as the theme of his discourse , and I sat wondering where - unto this thing would grow , and mentally warning him , a la

		You ca n't have chawed it , Pip ! '

		However , he did no more harm with it than a child with a silver dollar .

		It was too big for him to swallow , so he did not strangle , and he was not strong enough to hurl it away , so he neither lost it uor broke the windows with it , but quietly put it in his pocket , and walked home under his umbrella , complacently unconscious of the jewel he had been sporting with . ''

		The more spiritual side of the letters is by no means the least interesting part of them .

		The steady growth of liberal ideas , from the beginnings in old-fashioned
New England	LOCATION	'' Orthodoxy '' to an acceptance of '' St. Her - bert Spencer '' beside St.
James	PERSON	and St.
Paul	PERSON	, is set forth with force and candor .

		So , too , are her views on the duties and privileges of authorship , and her sense of woman 's place in the world .

		To some correspondent , prob - ably a kinswoman , she has something to say about the papers which are prepared and read in women 's clubs , none the less pertinent be - cause it was written in
1885	DATE	: `` ' It requires a great deal more and a great deal higher skill to write a paper on Mrs.

		It may be said , in conclusion , that the index is deplorably meagre , and requires expansion to double the present size , to be adequate to the book .

		There is a failure to refer some of the most interesting letters to the persons ad - dressed , -- the one beginning on page 819 -LRB- possibly to

Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		A New History of the americax PEon.E .

		* A suggestion made by
George Washington	PERSON	regarding the importance of educating public opinion furnishes the keynote of Professor
Thorpe	PERSON	's latest publication , '' A History of the American People . ''

		This is apparently de - signed to meet the long-felt want of a one-vol - ume history of the
United States	LOCATION	for the use of the reader in the home rather than for a text-book in school or college .

		The six hun - dred pages of the volume are readily grouped into chapters relating to three themes : the consideration of legal and constitutional ques - tions , the discussion of changes and improve - ments in social conditions , and the account of the running history from
Columbus	LOCATION	to the present day , -- this last apparently being the least important in the general scheme .

		The style is that of the college lecture , with topical rather than chronological treatment , and with frequent pauses for recapitulation and retrospect .

		This method encourages repetition , and unless carefully watched plays havoc with chronology , especially when several somewhat distinct lectures are bound together into a book for connected reading .

		Class-room lectures must often be technical , with many a reference and illustration ; and not every successful lec - turer in the class-room can use his material satisfactorily for the larger audience of the reading public .

		drag their weary length along through involved clauses into obscure paragraphs , and it is not uncommon to find ideas and suggestions in the book suffering from a lack of clearness in the language used to describe them .

		A typical illustration is the sentence , '' One of the Sen - ators from
Florida	LOCATION	and
Nebraska	LOCATION	was of En - glish birth . ''

		In the method employed , in the character of the literary style , and in the ne - cessity of condensation in order to cover four centuries in a single volume , Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	has found three serious obstacles in the way of his laudable endeavor to make an easy-to-read , in - teresting story of American progress .

		The development of American constitutional law , especially as illustrated by a study of
State	ORGANIZATION	constitutions , forms the backbone of the his - tory , as it has done for three or four other publications by this author .

		There is no more interesting field for investigation than this , and Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	has profited from frequent excur - sions into it .

		In the present instance several of the faults of former histories have disap - peared , the condensation of the subject-matter being noticeable in comparison .

		Even yet , however , the difficulties of long and involved sentences present themselves , and useless rep - etitions mar otherwise interesting paragraphs .

		There may well be question , too , whether the average reader cares so much for detail regard - ing constitutional changes in various decades , and whether many other topics might not sat - isfactorily have been disposed of by the com - mon footnote reference to the author 's '' Con - stitutional History . ''

		The chapters of the second group , which are devoted to a study of social life , are interesting and suggestive .

		They contain a vast amount of matter , so much , indeed , that the proper distribution of it into readable sentences must have been a difficult undertaking .

		Changes in manners , customs , habits of life , material com - forts , and the modes of thought of the people , make good subjects for description , and the only danger , perhaps , comes from a tendency to generalize .

		The third group of chapters includes those that tell the general history of the country .

		The pages devoted to colonial life are very readable , and in the main are carefully worked out .

		Those concerned with the history from the time of
Washington	LOCATION	's administration to the present are marred by many inaccurate state - ments , half-truths , anachronisms , and com - parisons with conditions of '' to-day , '' a sort of essay feature not valuable in a finished history .

Thorpe	PERSON	's book .

		The importance of the treaty with
Spain	LOCATION	in
1795	DATE	is set forth , and then the southern boundary of the
United States	LOCATION	, the most important feature of the treaty , is wrong - ly described .

		In the account of the election of
1796	DATE	occurs an example of a very common fault -- carelessness as regards chronology .

		The candidates are mentioned , the results of the vote are stated , the method of voting in the various States is described , and then the decli - nation of
Washington	LOCATION	is discussed in such words as to suggest that it followed the election instead of preceding it .

		In like manner there is a description of
Perry	PERSON	's victory at
Put-in-Bay	LOCATION	, where reference is made to
Lawrence	PERSON	's famous utterance , although the account of
Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	's battle is given in a succeeding paragraph .

		In the account of the Civil War , one paragraph ends with the words , ''
Vicksburg	LOCATION	remained the only obstruction to the free navigation of the river , '' and the next one is given up entirely to an account of the taking of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		On '' the 23d of

		On page 446 Ten - nessee joined the Confederacy ; on page 447

		The Holy Alliance appears from the text to be planning in
1818	DATE	to help
Spain	LOCATION	'' beat down those new American Republics and to regain her colon - ies , '' although on a previous page the year
1820	DATE	is mentioned as the date of beginning of the Spanish - American revolutions .

		These are typ - ical examples , in every one of which the reader , unless otherwise fortified , will be misled as to the true sequence of events .

		The chapter on Reconstruction is a disap - pointment in the light of present history , and more recent developments in our national life find faulty treatment .

		It is hard to account for the author 's version of the incidents just prior to the beginning of the Spanish - American war , which might easily have been described correctly if there had been an examination of the published diplomatic correspondence of that period .

		Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	records : '' President Mc -
Kinley	PERSON	appointed General
Stewart L. Wood	PERSON	- ford minister to
Spain	LOCATION	.

		He neglected no op - portunity to conciliate the Spanish government and secure a peaceful solution of the Cuban question .

		He discovered that no such solution was possible . ''

		These are astonishing statements , in view of the fact that Minister
Woodford	PERSON	's diplomatic correspondence gives no evidence of any such '' discovery , '' but shows , on the contrary , that two of the three demands made by the
United States	LOCATION	government were imme - diately complied with and that steps were taken to secure the third .

		In fact , Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- ford discovered such evidence of willingness on the part of the Spanish government to find a peaceful solution , that he himself felt it near , and urged the President to support his efforts to secure it .

		Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	is a manifest hero-worshipper , the eulogy of Lincoln and Grant being espe - cially marked .

		To show
Jackson	PERSON	's popularity , the half-truth is stated that ''
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	was a typical American of his day .

		He had received more votes than were ever before cast for anybody in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The account would have been more complete had he added that
Jackson	PERSON	's opponent ,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, was another typical American of his day , and that he also received in this same election more votes than were ever before cast for anybody in
America	LOCATION	.

		The same spirit of hero-worship leads to the surprising statement , following the account of the Second War , '' The war produced two popular heroes , the ` Hero of the Tippecanoe ' and the ' Hero of New Or - leans . '

		Ovations befell them thick and fast .

		Everybody said that each would be Presi - dent some day . ''

		Reading such nonsense , one wonders what disposition Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	would make of the attitude of the
New York	LOCATION	Democracy some years later , when
Tennessee	LOCATION	suggested
Jackson	PERSON	for the presidency , and what method he would take to obscure the attitude of the Democrats toward the '' imitation old hero '' when
Harrison	PERSON	was '' mentioned '' some twenty odd years after the battle of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		A few typographical errors occur , such as ``
George B. Meade	PERSON	, '' on p. 458 ; `` Phohibi - tion , '' on p. 477 ; and the division of '' Semmes '' in two syllables , on p. 458 .

		But the volume is in the main a good specimen of bookmaking and reflects credit upon the publishers .

		It is to be hoped , however , that they will take measures to put forth an edition of the work better fitted , by a full and searching revision , to fill their de - scription of it as a '' comprehensive , scholarly , readable , and exact '' history of our country .

		188 Some Present-Day Methods in Ethics .

		* In the moral experience , as in the
Bible	LOCATION	, every man may find his favorite dogmas .

		The field is so broad and the phenomena are so complex that it is easy for a group of facts to seize and hold the attention when they agree with either preconceived theories or personal tastes .

		Thereupon these facts , in their sepa - ration from their context , will give just the results that the student desires to reach .

		This principle is illustrated in certain recent works on ethics .

		It is an indubitable truth , for instance , that there are persons who can answer the most complicated questions of con - duct with the readiness and the assurance of a '' lightning calculator . ''

		Again , there are those for whom creature comforts and '' outward suc - cess '' are comparatively insignificant matters .

		What they desire most is nobility of character ; and this , not for what it brings but for what it is .

		Finally , to some members of this latter class the obligation to develope and strengthen character , as distinguished from the aspiration to that end , seems to have its source in a de - mand made upon them by God .

		Given a mind in which these phases of experience and this cast of temperament are predominant , and the outcome at one time usually was , and even to-day occasionally is , the theory called Intuitionism .

		Professor
Davis	PERSON	's treatise on the '' Elements of Ethics '' is an excellent representative of this type of thought .

		The fundamental datum of ethics , he holds , is the recognition of a law which we are under obligation to obey .

		Its requirements we know by intuition .

		Its source is God .

		Our own response to the law , the consciousness of obligation , is an elementary and unique phenomenon , miraculously im - planted in us , it would seem , by our Creator .

		Such are a few of the leading doctrines of this little book , one of the most satisfactory com - pendia of orthodox Intuitionalism that has yet been written .

		But plausible as these views may appear to some persons , the demonstration that they overlook important phenomena is unwittingly supplied by the author when he * Element8 0f Ethics .

		attempts to answer the question .

		What actions are commanded ?

		The basis of ethics , he writes , is the intuition . ''

		A man has a right to a free use of his native powers in the grati - fication of his normal desires . ''

		All trespass upon such rights is immoral .

		What desires , then , are normal ?

		The only reply that can be obtained from pages of exposition is the barren tautology -- those desires which it is right for us to indulge .

		The traditional Intuitionistic theories never escape this rock .

		Thus severe is the penalty for neglecting facts .

		In Mr.
Kedney	PERSON	's brief treatise on `` Prob - lems in Ethics '' we find again a mutilation of the moral experience in the interest of what appeals to the idiosyncracies of the writer ; but the mutilation proceeds , on the whole , upon other than conventional lines .

		His deepest longings go out to a social state in which every man can reckon upon the good-will , and , if necessity arises , the hearty , joyous cooperation or assistance of his fellow-men .

		That and that only is right which hastens the advent of this commonwealth .

		The supreme obligation is the development , in ourselves and others , of a character that will fit us for membership in such a society .

		In its failure to see anything in the moral experience except what appeals to a narrow , even if inspiring , ideal , Mr.
Kedney	PERSON	's work does not even supply a genuine representation of the facts it succeeds in appre - hending .

		On the other hand , as the revelation of an exceptionally attractive personality it is interesting and stimulating throughout .

		The school that made morality nothing more than a divine fiat , apprehended by a faculty working as independently of the emotional life and of experience as the so-called mathematical faculty appears to work , has long been con - fronted by a rival sect that looks upon the moral code as a system of rules for the attain - ment of the best collective and individual life .

		Its psychology has often been crude and frag - mentary .

		Even as late as the middle of the nineteenth century , therefore , the most it had accomplished was to show the intimacy of the relation between human happiness and right conduct .

		The conflict dragged on , like many of its kind , because each party was able to explain about half the observable facts , when the second or naturalistic theory received a great impetus from the promulgation and rapid acceptance of the theory of Evolution .

		It is probable , however , that supernaturalistic ethics would have been more successful in maintain - ing its position had it not been for the appear - 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ance of a new class of moralists .

		These were men whose devotion to their subject was based not merely upon its usefulness for practice , or its availability as a quarry for metaphysics , but also upon their interest in it for its own sake .

		Pledged in advance to no particular conclusions , approaching the subject with no particular bias except that which is the life of every science , the expectation that all phenom - ena will turn out to have a natural -- i. e. , a non-miraculous -- explanation , they have been largely successful in getting the points of view of both parties to the old controversies and in building up a theory true to all the experience from which the contending factions drew their life .

		Of this movement the recent text-books of Professor Thilly and Professor Mezes are rep - resentative examples .

		Within a comparatively narrow compass .

		Professor Thilly has given a very readable , and in the main clear and accu - rate , picture of present-day ethical investiga - tion , its tendencies and conclusions .

		There are chapters on conscience -- i.e. , the nature of the emotions of approbation and obligation , their source and history ; on the criterion by which conscience distinguishes between right and wrong ; on the nature of welfare , or the honum ; and on the kind of freedom involved in moral responsibility .

		Each of these subjects is discussed first with reference to the history of doctrine , then systematically .

		In the former division .

		Professor Thilly unfortunately prefers to supply a large number of very short sketches , instead of using his space for a more detailed presentation of a few typical theories .

		But this defect could easily be remedied by a good teacher .

		Professor Mezes 's '' Ethics , Descriptive and Explanatory '' is hardly a text-book of the con - ventional type .

		It passes over in haste or omits entirely many topics in which the under - graduate is much interested , and confines itself in the main to the detailed discussion of such subjects as the nature of the moral judgment , what can be said of its origin and growth and its relation to the other mental processes ?

		what kinds of action arouse the moral judg - ment ?

		and finally , what actions are judged right and what wrong ?

		In working out the solution of these problems , a wide range of literature has been utilized , the influence of Professor
Clifford	PERSON	and Professor Sidgwick being most pervasive .

		But the author has done something more than make a copy out of the authorities ; at almost every turn he has added material of his own , so that the book stands as an original contribution to ethics , on the whole the best and most noteworthy that has come from this generation of American moralists .

		Professor Mezes indicates with clearness the points in which modern naturalism meets the older metaphysical theories of ethics .

		He shows why we are able , under ordinary cir - cumstances , to decide off-hand what is right in a given case .

		He explains in part how char - acter can have both an intrinsic and extrinsic value .

		Finally , he points out the actual place of the will of God in ethical theory .

		If it be true that morality is a system of rules for the attainment of human welfare , if it be admitted , furthermore , that the fundamental reality of the universe is a personal being possessed of holiness and love , it will follow that He will care supremely for perfection of character in His children ; and that to believe in His exist - ence is to believe that He demands such per - fection of us .

		It is just this sense of a demand from above that is the essential feature in the supernaturalistic theories of obligation .

		The relation of metaphysics to ethics on such a view as the above is admirably stated by the author .

		Morality certainly has a significance for this world of ours ; it may also have a cosmic sig - nificance .

		But in order to discover anything about the latter , we must understand the moral life that is being lived here and now before our eyes .

		Therefore a metaphysics of ethics can build only on a foundation of data supplied by those whose immediate aim is merely to give a description and a '' natural '' explana - tion of the facts of the moral consciousness .

		made the way easy to a complete knowledge of onr native species .

		Mr.
Almond Dexter	PERSON	built him a
summer	DATE	home on an island in
Insley	LOCATION	lake , which , in a mountainous region of
Maine	LOCATION	, is famous for the sport it yields in trout-fishing .

		How he accomplished the enterprise of turning into a civilized estate a tract of wild and dense forest-land , two miles from the main shore and twenty miles from a railroad , is related in his book entitled '' And the `` Wilderness Blossomed . ''

		He would surround himself with all the comforts and luxuries of refined life ; he would have a spa - cious and picturesque dwelling , ample pleasure grounds , and kitchen and flower gardens , -- though to carry out his purpose he must rely upon the services of unskilled men , backwoodsmen in fact , whose main business was to act as guides and pack - ers for the strangers who people the country in the leisure season .

		Mr.
Dexter	PERSON	found these rude '' men of
Maine	LOCATION	'' equal to every requirement , and no plans depending upon them failed of fulfilment .

		He de - votes one chapter of his book to their peculiar traits and capacities .

		Another is filled with discourse pertaining to his library and the books that prop - erly furnish a country house .

		A third deals with the birds in the vicinity , and the remainder is occupied with his experiences in the culture of flowers and vegetables .

		The writer adheres closely to the ex - ternal aspects of his topics , offering no reflections savoring of sentiment or of a philosophical disposi - tion .

		He is everywhere the man of affairs , ener - getic and effective with the business in hand .

		His book is handsome in every detail and furnished with appropriate illustrations .

		The sketches which have been brought together in a volume entitled ' • Nature Biographies , '' by Mr.
Clarence Moores	PERSON	Weed , have the charm with which such work can be invested by the sympathetic ob - server and skilful writer .

		Each of the fourteen separate articles treats of a special member of the insect tribe .

		In one we have a story of '' The Making of a Butterfly , '' of its passage through the several stages from the egg to the imago .

		In others there are histories of tent-caterpillars , walking-sticks , locust mummies , potter-wasps , grasshoppers , para - sitic insects , and some of the commoner moths and butterflies .

		The chance reader , knowing and car - ing nothing for the creeping and flying things pic - tured with pen and burin in these pages , will soon find himself interested in the descriptions of Mr. `` Weed , who quickly proves that no living creatures have more curious and interesting habits and fac - ulties than those of which he writes .

		The copious illustrations are photographed from life by the author .

		An edition in colors of the excellent treatise on '' Insect Life , '' by Mr.
John Henry Comstock	PERSON	, com - mends this work anew to the consideration of the public .

		It is prepared for the needs of teachers and students who would pursue a thorough course in the science of entomology .

		The writer has had large experience as an instructor in his specialty in 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	and
Stanford Universities	ORGANIZATION	, and understands the necessity of presenting his subject in an at - tractive as well as systematic manner .

		The volume opens vt ^ ith lessons in the structure , metamorphoses , and classification of insects and their near relatives , and in the varied forms that abound in still and running water , in the orchard , the forest , and by the roadside .

		Part second is taken up with direc - tions for the collection and preservation of speci - mens .

		Eighteen colored plates , with a multitude of wood engravings , give completeness to the de - scriptive letter-press .

		`` The First Book of Birds , '' by Mrs.
Olive Thome Miller	PERSON	, which has enjoyed a deserved pop - ularity , is now followed by '' The Second Book of Birds , '' of merit similar to that of its predecessor .

		The supplementary volume leads the reader a step onward in the study of the feathered races , by showing how they are divided into families , and what are the prominent characteristics which unite them in these distinctive groups .

		One or more of the species common in the
United States	LOCATION	are selected as representatives of each family , and described in language suited to young persons .

		For many years Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	has spent her summers in the field watching the birds with an intelligent and patient eye .

		The mass of facts thus obtained has been augmented by diligent gleanings from the books , until she now maintains an estimable place among American ornithologists .

		She is as honest in her statements as in her investigations , and both carry the weight of authority .

		This latest of her publications will be found useful , not only to the beginner , but to the advanced student in ornithology , because of the interesting incidents regarding bird - life which have rewarded her personal notice or have been witnessed by trustworthy observers .

		The book is enriched by a profusion of full-i -RRB- age plates from designs by
Louis Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	, eight of them being colored .

		A favor to bird students is offered in the re - production of Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	's ' < Bird - Life '' with illustrations in colors , at a greatly re - duced price .

		Without pictures , the book is richly worth its cost ; and with them it is a treasure in - deed .

		The portraits are after drawings by Mr.
Ernest Seton-Thompson	PERSON	, whom everybody knows as a remarkably spirited delineator of the form and attitude of '' our little brothers of the air . ''

		In this edition they are clothed with colors and so are true to the very life .

		Seventy-five full-page plates are interspersed through the text , giving it the value of veritable object-lessons .

		Of the text it is su - perfluous now to speak .

		It is crammed with in - formation of a valuable sort not easily obtained elsewhere , and here presented in compact and per - spicuous order .

		What is there of promise in a boy who idles away all the time he can steal from home and books and healthful play , to sit like a stock or a stone for hours together watching the strange ways of the frogs and the ducks , the otter and the muskquash , that haunt the brook or the lake and hide their life from all but the most patient of prying eyes ; or who wanders through the woods and remote by-places to come silently upon the wild folk dwelling there and win them to friendly confidence or startle them into a betrayal of their best-kept secrets ?

		What profit is there in a man who spends weeks of
winter	DATE	and
summer	DATE	in the heart of the wilderness , alone with his rod and gun , an Indian guide at hand for camp - service and timely help at need , but living under a separate roof , while the hunter paddles his bark canoe on solitary waters or travels on snow-shoes weary miles in the track of the moose , the deer , and the caribou ?

		Open one of the little books that have been recently produced by Mr.
William J. Long	PERSON	, and you will find a gracious answer to these questions .

		There are three of these books , cheap in price and unpretentious , yet neat and attractive in every detail .

		First comes '' Ways of Wood Folk , '' then '' Wilderness Ways , '' and lastly '' Se - crets of the Woods . ''

		More charming entertain - ment for readers of varied tastes has seldom been provided within book covers .

		The author has made wonderful use of his op - portunities for nature study .

		One would suppose from his intimate knowledge of birds and beasts that his whole time must have been given to a study of them .

		But he is college-bred ; this we learn from indirect statements .

		That he is a man of fine cul - ture , his style attests .

		It is flowing , graceful , and well suited to convey the stores of curious informa - tion with which his books abound .

		The following , from the story of `` Chigwooltz the Frog , '' whom by quiet coaxing Mr.
Long	PERSON	had won to a genuine at - tachment , is a good example : '' One day , to try the effects of nicotine on a new subject , I took a bit of
Simmo	ORGANIZATION	's black tobacco and gave it to Chigwooltz .

		He ate it thankfully , as he did everything else I gave him .

		In a little while he grew uneasy , sitting up and rubbing his belly with his fore paws .

		Presently he brought his stomach up into his mouth , turned it inside out to get rid of the tobacco , washed it thoroughly iu the lake , swallowed it down again , and was ready for his bread and beef ... ''
Chigwooltz	PERSON	, unlike many of my pets , was not in the least dependent on my bounty .

		Indeed , he was a re - markable hunter on his own account , and what he took from me he took as hospitality , not charity .

		One morn - ing he came to me with the tail of a small trout sticking out of his mouth .

		The rest of the fish was below , be - ing digested .

		Another day , towards twilight , I saw him resting on the lily pads , looking very full , with a sus - picious looking object curling out over his under lip .

		I wiggled my finger in the water , and he came from pure sociability , for he was beyond eating any more .

		The suspicious-looking object proved to be a bird 's foot , and beside it was a pointed wing-tip .

		That was too much for my curiosity .

		I opened his mouth and pulled out the bird with some difficulty , for Chigwooltz bad been engaged some time in the act of swallowing and had it well down .

		It proved to be a full-grown male swallow , without a mark anywhere to show how he had come by his death .

		Chigwooltz looked at me reproachfully , but swallowed his game promptly the moment I had fin - ished examining it . ''

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 Mr.
Long	PERSON	surprised Chigwooltz one day in the very act of trapping a tree-sparrow .

		The bird was taking a morning bath , when Chigwooltz dis - covered him .

		He stole cautiously from the lily pads , '' Nearer and nearer , sinking himself till only his eyes showed above water .

		The ripple that flowed away on either side was gentle as that of a floating leaf .

		Then , just as the bird had sipped and lifted himself for a last swallow , Chigwooltz hurled himself out of water .

		One snap of his big mouth and the sparrow was done for .

		An hour later , when I came down to my canoe , he was sitting low on the lily pads , winking sleepily now and then , with eight little sparrow 's toes curling over the rim of his under lip , like a hornpont 's whiskers . ''

		The books are filled with similar histories of Mr.
Long	PERSON	's friendship with the timid and wary beings in fur and feathers , and smooth and shelly integu - ments , of which the world of men knows all too little .

		Much has been made of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's intimacy with wild animals , but his experience pales in com - parison with that related by Mr.
Long	PERSON	.

		`` With as keen a fondness for nature as Thoreau possessed , this later investigator has a tenderer feeling for his own and for inferior races , which gains our regard as it does that of the secluded , suspicious tenants of the wilderness .

		He stops and studies until he understands them , and they respond trustfully to his tactful sympathy .

		He has pathetic interviews with a veteran deer whom he rescued from a cruel death from a pack of blood-thirsty hounds ; he strokes the neck of a fierce bald eagle , and sits calmly by his nest on a cli # f to which he had climbed three hundred feet above the spruce tops of the level wilderness , while the male and female take their bold stand within ten feet and look him in the eye with mingled courage and anxiety ; he made friends with Killoleet -- `` Little Sweet Voice '' -- as the Indians call the white-throated sparrow , one of the most enticing and unapproachable of our wild birds .

		Killoleet slept on the ridge-pole of the tent , and was ever there to welcome his benefactor when he returned from his tramps , and to eat the crumbs that were bountifully scattered for him .

		Killoleet had a nest in the dark underbrush bard by , and we are glad , as Mr.
Long	PERSON	was afterwards , that he `` Never saw that nest , though it was scarcely ten yards from my tent , until after the young had flown , and
Killoleet	PERSON	cared no more about it .

		I knew the bush in which it was , close by the deer path ; could pick oat from my fireplace the thick branch that sheltered it ; for I often watched the birds coming and going .

		I have no doubt that
Killoleet	PERSON	would have welcomed me there without fear ; but his mate never laid aside her shyness about it , never went to it directly when I was looking , and I knew he would like me better if I re - spected her little secret . ''

		It was his delicate consideration for their sacred rights which put the author on easy footing with his comrades in the vast solitude .

		He fed and pro- tected them , and they were free in his presence almost as when alone .

		It was human-like , it was bird - like , for Killoleet to greet him with a song when he pitched his tent in the same spot a second
summer	DATE	, and to come down and eat erambs from his plate as he had done before .

		It is a service to the public to present books of such high quality in such inexpensive form as these .

		They are educational in a high sense ; and it is a pleasure to know that more of them may be looked for from the same genial hand .

		Sixteen years ago the American and sLiZ ` mL ?

		`` t ' ``'' ^ ^ ^ J `` ° ^ Companies joinUy issued the Revised Version of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		They did not agree on all the changes that should be made in the
King James Version	LOCATION	of
1611	DATE	; consequently the
British Committee	ORGANIZATION	inserted in ap - pendices such preferences of the American Com - mittee as they deemed wise .

		At the same time they required this
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	to enter into an agreement not to issue or sanction an issue of the Revised Version within fourteen years .

		The Amer - ican
Committee	ORGANIZATION	kept its promise , and perpetuated its organization .

		During these past sixteen years , the able-bodied members have steadily labored to perfect their work .

		Unhampered by any
British Committee	ORGANIZATION	, they have not only incorporated their preferences into the text , but have in many other ways improved the Revised Version of 1881-1885 , 80 as the better to adapt it to the needs of the American reading public .

		The result of their stu - pendous labor is now published under the title , '' The Revised Version ; the
American Standard Edition	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Messrs.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	& Sons of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The form of the book is a good inno - vation in Bible-making .

		It is 8 ^ inches by 6 | ^ inches , printed in long-primer type , double-column page , with scriptural references in single column between the reading columns , and variant readings on the two margins .

		At the top of each page , in black - faced type , is a summary of the contents on that page .

		A closer examination shows that the matter has been re-paragraphed and re-punctuated -- most acceptable improvements .

		The substitution of `` Jehovah '' for `` the Lord '' and `` God '' ; of '' who '' and '' that '' for `` which , '' when referring to persons ; of '' are '' for `` be '' ih indicative clauses ; the omission of '' for '' before infinitives , and the change of '' an '' to `` a '' before '' h '' aspirated , are changes which every reader of the Bible will in - stantly approve of .

		Archaic words -- altogether too numerous in the Revised Version -- are dis - placed by their modern equivalents , as , '' chapiter '' by `` capital , '' `` astonied '' by `` astonished , '' '' heath - en '' by `` nations , '' `` minish '' by `` diminish , '' '' reins '' by '' heart , '' '' hardly bestead '' by '' sore distressed , '' and scores of others .

		There is also a vast improvement in the proper use of `` shall '' and `` will . ''

		Another feature of this
Bible	LOCATION	which greatly enhances its value is the new set of Script - 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, A new life of Father Becker .

		ural and marginal references , which really refer to passages of value in understanding the text in ques - tion .

		All these and other improvenaents easily give this version the first place among the English trans - lations of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		In mechanical make-up , in literary form , and in faithfulness to every interest involved , this
American Standard Revised Bible	ORGANIZATION	is facile princeps .

		More than ordinary interest attaches to the life of the Rev.
Isaac Thomas Hecker	PERSON	, as told by Mr.
Henry D. Sedgwick , Jr.	PERSON	, for the '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Father
Hecker	PERSON	was one of the few men who went from practical Amer - ican life and Protestant rearing to the mystic side of Roman Catholicism , just as he is one of the few Americans who have given the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	another instrument for the promulgation of her doctrines through his establishment of the mission - ary order of
Paulist Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Born in
New York City	LOCATION	on
December 18 , 1819	DATE	, a member of the com - munity at
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	from
January	DATE	to
June , 1843	DATE	,
Hecker	PERSON	was baptized a Roman Catholic on
August 1 , 1844	DATE	.

		Two years later he sailed from his native land to make his novitiate with the Redemptorists , to which order he was duly admitted in
1846	DATE	, being priested by
Cardinal Wiseman	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION
three years later	DATE	.

		After a life of great usefulness in the
United States	LOCATION	, he was expelled from the
Congrega	PERSON	- tion of the Most Holy Redeemer in
1857	DATE	, by a decree the effect of which was virtually abrogated by the papal permission to establish the order of the
Missionary Priests of St. Paul the Apostle	ORGANIZATION	.

		An earlier experience had taught Father
Hecker	PERSON	the value of journalism in the spreading of opinion , religious or secular , and he founded the `` Catholic World '' in
1865	DATE	and the `` Young Catholic '' in
1870	DATE	, in pursuance of his ideas .

		He died on De - cember 22 ,
1888	DATE	, in
New York City	LOCATION	, deeply regretted by many thousands of his countrymen who had learned to know and love him through his preach - ings and writings .

		Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	tells the story of this saintly life with simplicity and candor , and makes it a worthy addition to the admirable series of biographies of American leaders in thought and action .

		In the delightful series of hand - books bearing the Dent-Macmillan imprint , and devoted to mediaeval towns , the latest and certainly one of the most charming is that which tells the story of
Bruges	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
E. Gilliat-Smith	PERSON	, the author , is in every true sense at home in his subject .

		He has lived many years in the quaint old Flemish city , '' the fairest of the North , '' and is fairly saturated with the lore of her thousand years of civic life .

		Back to the days of
Baldwin	PERSON	of the Iron Hand , the first Count of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Gilliat-Smith	PERSON	takes his readers ; and then , with swift , unwavering fingers , he turns for them the blood-stained pages where tyranny and treachery , freedom and loyalty ,
Fleming	PERSON	and
The Story of Bruges	ORGANIZATION	told again .

		Frenchman , have left their red record .


Belgium	LOCATION	's claim to be the '' battle-ground of
Europe	LOCATION	'' receives fresh and full vindication in this stirring recital , which occupies twenty-two of the twenty-five chap - ters .

		Then follows an appreciative survey of the architecture of Bruges in its '' bloom-time , '' the fifteenth century , when so many picturesque struc - tures were either begun or received their final glories .

		The great Belfry , the
H6tel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	and a score of other churches , the guilds ' halls and chapels , were the salient landmarks ; but ' * even working men , humble members of the great guilds of smiths , or masons , or carpenters , were making their homes beautiful with the fruit of their handicraft ; constructing canopied niches at street corners , or over the doorways of the hovels in which they lived , and placing in them graven images of Our Lady or of some favorite saint ; hammering out exquisite lanterns , which it was their delight to hang before them , from brackets of no less dainty fashion ; fabricating , of wrought iron , those quaintly beautiful trade signs by which it was their wont to call attention to their avocations ; making door , and lintel , and chimney , and rafter comely with fruit and foliage , fascinating with heraldic devices , and grotesque and leering heads , and the images of devils and saints . ''

		The painters too , who are no small part of the glory of
Bruges	LOCATION	, are given a chap - ter : the van Eycks ,
Gerard David	PERSON	,
Roger van der Weyden	PERSON	, and
Hans Memling	PERSON	are appreciatively described and some of their most famous pictures reproduced .

		Of all these things Mr.
Gilliat-Smith	PERSON	writes alertly and enthusiastically , though not with - out some looseness and repetition .

		The book 's at - tractiveness and usefulness are at least doubled by the felicitous illustrations , some sixty in number , contributed by Miss
Edith Calvert	PERSON	and Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	.

		Quite in the
Pennell	PERSON	style , and varying in size from thumb-nail to full-page , they have left no monument unrepresented , and complete the value of a handbook which must share or dispute the place of
Baedeker	PERSON	in the side-pocket of the tourist 's jacket .

		In `` Pleasures of the Telescope '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- Mr.
Garrett P. Serviss	PERSON	has written a book that is not des - tined to a popularity so immediate as that which followed his earlier '' Astronomy Through an Opera-Glass , '' the value of its contents depending on the possession of an optical instrument of con - siderable value , and one not to be found in the ordinary household .

		After learning all that can be learned with the customary opera-glass , the telescope follows as a matter of course , if the interest in as - tronomy is to extend beyond that accorded a mere pastime .

		Here it is that Mr.
Serviss	PERSON	's really nota - ble abilities as a popular writer come into play .

		THE DIAL 189 at the end of his reading , it will have been acquired with an ease that entitles the work to praise as affording almost a royal road to learning .

		The illustrations and diagrams are numerous and valu - able , the text easily grasped and suflBciently exten - sive , and the whole admirably designed for both recreation and instruction .

		-- Of quite another sort is Professor
A. W. Bickerton	PERSON	's '' Romance of the Heavens '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The entire book is devoted to a demonstration , in language as little technical as possible , of the truth of the writer 's theory that variable stars , spiral nebulae , and a number of similar celestial phenomena , are due to a grazing contact in mid-space of roaming suns or other bodies of similar nature .

		The text is closely reasoned ; all the latest discoveries of physics and chemistry are drawn upon , and the whole culminates in the postulation of renovation and immortality in the material universe .

		■ > n - • mi - ri Towns and Cities ; or .

		The
Practi	PERSON	- cal Basis of Civic ^ Esthetics '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is offered as an aid to the development of civic consciousness .

		It takes up the general question of beautifying American cities by whatever means , and deals with the broad field of effort manifested in
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Teutonic Europe	LOCATION	, drawing conclusions from the older civilizations which are likely to benefit our own .

		Within comparatively small compass the work now in progress in American cities , for the most part by bodies outside of the municipal gov - ernments , is detailed ; while the economic advan - tages to flow from an increase in the beauty of every citizen 's surroundings are also set forth with con - vincing particularity .

		Beginning with city sites and street plans , the author passes through such topics as '' Beauty in the Street '' and '' The Adver - tisement Problem '' to considerations of the aesthetic phases of social , philanthropic , and educational effort , and concludes with two chapters of practical advice concerning the beautification of our cities , whether by individuals and voluntary associations or by the oflBcials .

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	has not familiarized himself with the work to this end already accomplished in the States of
South America	LOCATION	, where a round score of cities far surpassing anything north of
Mexico	LOCATION	are flourishing amain .

		BealUiet of modem Ruuxan life .

		The fact that the subjects of the Tsar have a duty toward their ex - panding frontier not dissimilar to that of Americans toward their vanishing boundary on the western plains , and the growing realization of the fact in this country , may justify the reader in seeking Mr.
Francis H. E. Palmer	PERSON	's '' Russian Life in Town and Country '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- for infor - mation not to be found in any similar work .

		How - ever remote the Russian noble may seem to be during his winter life in one or another of the great cities of the empire , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	shows us how inti - mately blended with the soil he is during the
summer	DATE	time .

		All Russian estates are based upon tillage during the short , fierce season when the sun coaxes into being the uncertain crops .

		Whether the season is good or bad determines the amount and charac - ter of the winter 's pleasure , and the margin of profit is too small to permit the delegation of supervision to another .

		The pictures drawn by the author of the homely patriarchial life which is the lot of every Russian of old descent and fortune for a part of his year is not an alluring one , though enlivened with glimpses of the frailties and humors of a simple folk only recently out of slavery and not yet famil - iar with their changed economic status .

		In addi - tion , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	discusses the more important questions arising out of the social conditions of Russian life , the Church and the dissenters , the Jews and the commercial and mechanical monop - olies they secure , '' Education and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, '' and many more .

		No more informing book , nor one admitting its readers to more intimate acquaintance with the realities of Russian life , has been pub - lished of late years .

		A book of mingled essays and bits of hpv ^ ipt ^ '' fiction has been written by `` Violet Fane '' -LRB- Lady
Currie	PERSON	-RRB- , with the title of '' Two Moods of a Man , with Other Papers and Short Stories '' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		Three or four of the sections of the book are fiction of the slightest sort , several are of inter - est to lovers of books , and one deals with the same `` Jem , '' the Turkish `` young pretender , '' whose life was told so much better by the late
Eugene Schuyler	PERSON	; yet all have a certain literary value and grace of style .

		The most ambitious of the stories is called '' A Romance of Kensington Gardens , '' in which the heroine is a noblewoman whose years have outstripped but not extinguished her love for adventure , leading her to pose in the most amusing manner before a distinguished-looking stranger , whom later she is chagrined to learn is totally blind , and nothing more than a `` Klondike million - aire '' at that .

		The concluding paper , on '' The
Ideal Country House	ORGANIZATION	, '' is one of the most interest - ing in the book , being written with full knowledge and lively understanding .

John Marshall	PERSON	's selection to be Chief Justice of the

Sept. 16	DATE	, ruary , for his material .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	is entirely sympathetic with
Marshall	PERSON	's methods and char - acter , according to him with enthusiastic apprecia - tion the distinction of having set the judiciary above both the legislative and executive branches of the government , and of having left the American people content with this interpretation of their Constitu - tion .

		In a work so limited in size it was hardly to be expected that the pleas of
Marshall	PERSON	's adversaries , few as they are at this day , should be considered , and Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has probably done better by con - tenting himself with showing why the American people permitted the establishment of a practice at variance with that of all other civilized nations of the globe , his argument from our colonial history being cogent and succinct .

		Recent decisions , like that in the income-tax case and the cases growing out of the Porto E.ican annexation , have not added to the complacency with which many Americans regard the powers conferred by
Marshall	PERSON	's genius on the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, for all that .

		It is signifi - cant that the manner of
Marshall	PERSON	's appointment is not even hinted at in this book .

		Pioneer towns 0 /
America	LOCATION	.

		In addition to literary duties which would break down a less industrious man , Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	has undertaken the preparation of a number of small volumes for a series to be called '' The Pioneer Towns of Amer - ica , '' those of the State of
Maine	LOCATION	falling .

		to his share .

		The first of these , '' The Story of Old Falmouth '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , has just been issued , and is a pleasantly discursive history of an interesting spot .

		If the series is made sufficiently inclusive , -- and the amount of available material is immense , -- taking in all parts of the country , there should be no doubt of its success .

		Few American towns worthy the name , east or west , north or south , are without pioneer traditions .

		Notes .

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	's '' Golden Treasury of American Lyrics '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is reissued in a neat '' pop - ular edition , '' in a mechanical form similar to that of its English namesake .

		We learn that the whole edition of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	collotype facsimile of the
First Folio Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, referred to in our last issue , was sub - scribed for within six weeks of the issue of the pre - liminary prospectus .

		A contemporary account of the battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	, by the Rev.
Jonas Clarke	PERSON	, being an appendix to a ser - mon delivered on the very day of the conflict , provides the contents of a very interesting pamphlet just issued by the
Lexington Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of '' A
Brief Topical Survey of United States History	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Messrs.
Oliver P. Cornman	PERSON	and
Oscar Gerson	PERSON	, This is a text-book intended for use , not as a substitute for the standard works , but rather as a supplementary aid to the teacher in the work of review .

		It is distinctly a book for study and not for reading , and is admirably fitted for its purpose .

		Among the topics summarized are '' Discoveries and Explorations , '' '' Troubles with Foreign Countries , '' '' Financial History , '' '' History of Political Parties , '' and the '' Growth of American Lit - erature . ''


Lorimer Stoddard	PERSON	, the only son of Mr.
Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	, died at
Sag Harbor	LOCATION	,

		Messrs.

London	LOCATION	booksellers , have lately removed their business from
No. 159 Church St.	ORGANIZATION	, where they have been for upwards of thirty years , to more central premises at 109 Strand , W. C .

		This firm has recently issued a catalogue which American collectors will do well to have .

		The '' Edinburgh Folio '' edition , as it is called , will be pub - lished in forty parts , all so paged as to be bound in ten volumes .

America	LOCATION	. ''

		A Composition and Rhetoric for Higher Schools , '' the work of Misses
Sara E. H. Lockwood	PERSON	and
Mary Alice Emerson	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its chief features are a cumulative method of treatment and the placing of a constant emphasis upon the pupil 's own thinking and writing .

		It is a book of generous dimensions and tasteful typography .

		We have just received Volumes VII .

		and
VIII	PERSON	.

		con - taining '' Middlemarch , '' in '' The Personal Edition of
George Eliot	PERSON	, '' published by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This edition is specialized from its many com - petitors by the introductions that Mrs. Wood has writ - ten for each of the novels , and by the many pictures of places made familiar by the novelist 's pen .

		Two French texts are among the recent publications of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' L'Enfant Espion , '' edited by Mr.
Reginald R. Goodell	PERSON	, is a volume of eight short stories by Daudet ,
Coppde , Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, and M ^ rim ^ e -- two from each author .

		• ' La Neuvaine de Colette , '' by Mile .

1901	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 191 Announcements of Fal-l .

		Books .

		Again The Dial 's list of books announced for Fall publication sbows an advance over auv season in the history of the American book trade , -- the number of titles this year being nearly 1800 ; as against
1700	DATE	, the highest number of any previous year .

		With the increase in population there is an increase in the number of book - readers ; and the demand for books grows , besides , with the growth of the reading habit as the country advances in intelligence and prosperity .

		The list here given is prepared entirely from advance information secured especially for this purpose , and represents the output of about 75 publishing firms .

		All the books entered are presumably new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and , with a few necessary exceptions , the list does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		Juvenile books are , from their great number , deferred to another issue , -- although reckoned with in the above eoum - eratiou .

		The more important literary features of the list are commented upon in the leadiug editorial in the present issue .

		Upon a background of contemporary Southern life Mr.
Chesnutt	PERSON	has written a strong , virile , and exciting novel .

		The story involves the fate of a child for whom its parents forsee a bright future , but for whom a superstitious old black nurse sees grave misfortunes ahead -- a fancy which seems curiously borne out by an adverse fate .

		There are an interesting love story , an injury avenged with Old Testament rigor , and a greater wrong nobly forgiven .

		Among the characters are an editor who heads a reactionary political move - ment in a Southern state , set off against whom is an educated colored man seeking by wise methods to ele - vate his people .

		Dr.
Paine	PERSON	here extends to the whole field of re - ligious thought concerning God and His relations to mankind , the historical survey which in his previous book was restricted to Christianity .

ELLEN Or	PERSON	, The Whisperings of an Old Pine .

		A Philosophical Novel By
JOSEPH BATTELL	PERSON	.

		This book demonstrates through the great principle of the universality of natural laws , the principle upon which all science rests , that the Darwinian theory of evolution and all undulatory theories are alike absurd and impossible .

		It follows that the same is true of all materialistic conceptions of existence , i. e. , of any con - ceptions of existance which do not give to mind , and mind only , the creative power .

		A man , through the operations of his mind , can make a spade , but the spade can not make a man .

		Although antagonizing some of the theories of science , the book is thoroughly and entirely scientific , placing science upon a permanently firmer , truer , and sounder basis .

		In the same direction all of the most ad - vanced scientific thinkers are tending , as was shown at the recent meeting of the
French Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, ^ at
Paris	LOCATION	, when it was demonstrated that X-ray light is composed of material particles .

		This , of course , does : away with all Undulatory theories , for it would be as -LCB- -RRB- robable or possible for nature to have two or more • methods for the production of rain , or any or all phe - nomena , as for the production of light ; besides , as the ibook shows , the law of creation itself must be univer - .

		- sal , and this means that every material thing is made by the combination of matter in its different elements ^ nd proportions .

		There is no possible question in re - : ^ gard to this , nor do we consider it possible that any • man of intelligence , when the matter is brought to his ■ attention , will seriously undertake to question it , any • more than he would that the sun shines .

		For the uni - versality of natural law is not an hypothesis or opinion `` Twhich , as
Socrates	PERSON	said , '' are bad all , '' but a great truth , supported by every fact which comes within our knowledge .

		`` A book with much ingenious construction of the most vital truths . ''

		-- SIbnby Wattsbson , in
Louisville	LOCATION	Journal .

		`` A very interesting book . ''

		--
W. J. Bbtan	PERSON	, in The Commwier .

		`` The work is not a criticism of science , but of certain theories of - scientists , and enlarges the sphere of human knowledge by demonstrat - ing the homogeneousness of physical phenomena that hitherto have been considered the independent results of remote and distinct causes .

		` This feature of the work marks a material advance in physical science hat is very auspicious for the beginning of the new century . ''

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 252 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 255 A WORD OF W ARNING .

		The system of publishing books at net prices , with a uniform discount of twenty-five per cent to the trade , as agreed upon last Spring by the
American Publishers	ORGANIZATION	'
Associa	PERSON	- tion , is now supposed to be in full operation , and many people who are neither publishers nor booksellers will be interested in learning how it works .

		It will be remembered that we gave our hearty approval to the plan because it promised to rehabilitate the old-time book - store , and because we believed the book-store , which seemed to be fast passing out of exist - ence except in a few of the largest cities , to be a civilizing agency that no community of any size could afford to dispense with , to be an institution worthy of making some sacrifice to preserve .

		Under the ruinous system of com - petitive prices as fixed by retailers , and of discriminations in favor of large purchasers as allowed by publishers , the bookseller , in the good old sense of that term , was going the way of the dodo and the megatherium .

		In comparing the old system with the new , let us take the '' dollar book '' as a convenient basis for our discussion .

		That book , as we all know , although listed at one dollar , and thus advertised , found few purchasers at so high a price .

		The only people who paid a dollar for it were those who ordered it by post from the publisher -LRB- in which case the latter paid the charges -RRB- , those who lived in out-of-the-way places or in places where a single bookseller took an unwise advantage of his monopoly , and those who were imposed upon by unscru - pulous dealers in cities where the usual dis - count was to be had by all who asked for it .

		The true retail price of this book was
eighty cents	MONEY	, thus allowing the dealer , who paid
sixty cents	MONEY	or less for it , a profit of at least one-third of the wholesale price .

		Now under the net system , as explained with great care by the publishing interests that have been influential in securing its adoption , this dollar book -- that is , any new book , not a novel , that would have been listed at one dollar under the old system -- must be listed at
eighty cents	MONEY	, and sold by the publisher to the bookseller for
sixty cents	MONEY	, thus allowing the 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, latter exactly the same profit as before .

		The object of the new system , as has been repeat - edly declared , is to eliminate the artificial price altogether , and make the published price of a book correspond to the price at which the book-buyer obtains it .

		While the system , in this aspect , has for its purpose to keep the retail price down , in its other aspect its pur - pose is to keep the price up to the net figure by refusing to supply dealers who make a practice of underselling .

		As far as the public has given its approval to the new system , it has been with the distinct understanding that both of these purposes should be maintained by pub - lishers in good faith .

		The refusal to supply dealers who are not willing to adhere to the list prices of books is possible only through the concerted action of the publishers , and such a combination in restraint of trade would rightly be viewed with suspicion were it not for the compensating features whereby the purchaser is protected from the imposition of the old artificial list price , and whereby the true inter - ests of the retail dealers are conserved .

		The word of warning which we have to address to publishers is this .

		If it should ap - pear that they are taking advantage of the new system in their own interests alone , and ignor - ing the interests of book-buyers , they would clearly be acting in bad faith toward the pub - lic .

		In other words , if their new net prices should turn out to be substantially the same as their old retail prices , thus increasing by twenty - five per cent the amount paid by purchasers for their books , the trick would soon be dis - covered .

		They are bound by every considera - tion of fairness not to do this , and not to appear to be doing it ; should they fail to recognize this obligation , their sympathy for the declining trade of the bookseller will quickly be recognized as so much hypocrisy , and as quickly resented by the public .

		To come back to our illustration of the dollar book , they are bound to make the published price of this book
eighty cents	MONEY	; the best way to con - vince the public that they are thus acting in good faith is to base all retail prices upon mul - tiples of twenty , instead of basing them upon multiples of twenty-five , as in the past .

		In trying to gain popular acceptance for the new system , the publishers have given us every reason to believe that they were not actuated by a desire for gain so much as by a desire to simplify the whole question of prices and dis - counts , and to restore the retail book trade to something like its earlier flourishing condition .

		It is legitimate for them to expect an indirect benefit from the improved conditions of book - selling ; it is not legitimate for them to expect higher prices for their books than heretofore .

		We have been examining with much inter - est the prices set upon publications announced for the present season , in order to gain some idea of the extent to which publishers are recognizing their obligations under the new system .

		The evidence that they are so recog - nizing these obligations is not as convincing as we could wish .

		In some cases , we find that practically all prices are , as heretofore , multi - ples of
twenty-five cents	MONEY	; in other cases , we find that some prices give evidence of the new system , while others do not ; in still other cases , we find a close approach , at least , to a systematic attempt at readjustment .

		One page of advertisements , for example , covering six announcements of a certain firm , gives us the following net prices : 11.80 ,
$ 0.84	MONEY	,
$ 1.20	MONEY	,
$ 0.90	MONEY	,
$ 1.35	MONEY	, and
$ 1.10	MONEY	.

		These figures are a little puzzling , but they certainly indicate an attempt to deal fairly with the public .

		Another page yields these net prices ;
$ 1.15	MONEY	,
$ 3.75	MONEY	,
$ 2.50	MONEY	,
$ 3.00	MONEY	,
$ 2.00	MONEY	,
$ 1.75	MONEY	, and
$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		If these are books that would have been priced , under the old system , respectively at
$ 1.50	MONEY	,
$ 5.00	MONEY	,
$ 3.25	MONEY	,
$ 4.00	MONEY	,
$ 2.50	MONEY	,
$ 2.25	MONEY	, and
$ 1.25	MONEY	, we get approximate reductions of twenty or twenty-five per cent , but we need to see the books themselves to feel sure about it .

		Still another specimen page gives us the following net prices :
$ 1.50	MONEY	,
$ 1.25	MONEY	,
$ 2.00	MONEY	,
$ l.OO	MONEY	,
$ 7.50	MONEY	, and
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Here there is no indication that the prices are lower than they would have been under the old system , although it is , of course , quite possible that in every case the price might have been twenty or twenty-five per cent higher .

		But we think the publishers are acting unwisely , if that be true , in failing to make the fact more apparent to the casual reader .

		In a word , the ultimate success of the new system will depend , not upon pub - lishers ' agreements and disciplinary measures , but upon the approval of the public ; and the public , which is naturally suspicious in all mat - ters that directly concern the pocket , should be made to understand in the clearest possible terms that it will not be asked to pay more for its new books than it has paid in the past .

		We believe that the simplest and best way of convincing the public that their purveyors of books are acting in good faith would be , as we have already suggested , to make the list prices of all new books multiples of
twenty cents	MONEY	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 Another aspect of this general question is in urgent need of consideration .

		We have seen what are the duties of publishers toward the purchasers of books under the new system ; something must now be said concerning their duties toward the authors of books .

		In this country , the prevailing royalty , as we all know , is ten per cent of the retail price of the book .

		As compared with the royalties paid in other countries , it is a low rate , and certainly should not be made any lower .

		Again taking our dollar book as a convenient example , we see that under the old system an author received
ten cents	MONEY	for every copy of the book sold .

		Since the publisher got about
sixty cents	MONEY	for the book , it amounted to paying the author one-sixth of the publisher 's receipts .

		Also , since the book sold at retail for
eighty cents	MONEY	, the author got one-eighth of the price paid by the individual purchaser .

		Now let us see how this arrangement is affected by the system of net prices .

		Assuming that the publisher acts fairly toward the public , and lists this book at
eighty cents	MONEY	, the author , on a ten per cent royalty , would receive only
eight cents	MONEY	a copy .

		In other words his earnings would be reduced one-fifth to the gain of the publisher .

		This is clearly wrong , and should be remedied by increasing the customary royalty to twelve and one-half per cent .

		In other words , an author , to be as well off as he was before , must still receive his
ten cents	MONEY	a copy on the dollar book , which means one-eighth of the net retail price .

		Authors are proverbially careless of their own financial interests , but this question is one that affects them so seriously that they will have to take it into account , and insist upon the new basis of agreement with their publishers , should the latter fail to take the initiative in thus doing simple justice to the men whose books they publish .

		If publishers should show a disposition to cling to this special margin of profit accruing to them under the new system of prices , an American
Walter Besant	PERSON	will need to arise to convince them of the error of their ways , and to champion the rights of American authors .

		An elaborate subscription edition of the works of
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, in thirty-two yolnmes , is an - nounced by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	will contribute a life of
Cooper	PERSON	and a general introduction to the edition , and special intro - ductions will be supplied to the '' Leather-Stocking Tales '' by Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	and to the '' Sea Tales '' by Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	.

		A noteworthy feature will be the inclusion of the famous series of steel en - gravings by

		AN INTERESTING MEMORIAL OF TWO GREAT AUTHORS .

		-LRB-
London Correspondence of Thb Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		The finding of any unpublished writing from the pens of two each illastrioas aathors as
John Stoart	PERSON	Mill and
Robert Browning	PERSON	would seem to be an ex - tremely unlikely event at this late date .

		However , this interesting experience has lately been mine in
London	LOCATION	.

		The literary world has long been familiar with the fact that the first poem written by
Robert Browning	PERSON	-- ''
Pauline	PERSON	'' -- was published anony - mously ; that it was either completely ignored , or for the most part reviewed unfavorably ,
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	being one of the few who cared to enter some - what closely into the study of the poem .

		Bat when he offered a notice of it to ``
Tait	PERSON	's Magazine , '' his contribution was rejected by the editor on the ground that the book had already been noticed in a previous number , -- said notice consisting merely of one line : ''
Pauline	PERSON	, a piece of pure bewilder - ment . ''

		Mill being young and obscure -- for this occurred when
Browning	PERSON	was but twenty-two and Mill but twenty - eight years old , -- and having ac - cess to the pages of no other magazine , his com - ment was unpublished at the time , and has re - mained so , I believe until now .

		Copies of the first edition of '' Pauline '' are now extremely rare ; but within the past year the par - ticular copy owned first by Mill , afterward by
Browning	PERSON	himself , and later presented by him to
John Forster	PERSON	, has become the property of the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		For some reason it was withheld from the • ' Forster Collection '' be - queathed to the Museum at
Forster	ORGANIZATION	's death ; and the librarian looked not a little amazed when I asked for it , answering , '' How do you know we have it ?

		It is not on our catalogue . ''

		However , no other formality than my register of name and address was necessary to bring the book out of its locked cupboard and into my hands , with the privileges of such memoranda as I should care to make .

		It proved to be even richer in interest than I had anticipated , containing not only Mill 's marginal an - notations in pencil and
Browning	PERSON	's rejoinders with the pen , -- sometimes accepting , sometimes reject - ing Mill 's strictures , -- but also on the blank pages at the end Mill 's entire article , still legible though written with the pencil , and probably in the exact words as rejected by ''
Tait	PERSON	's Magazine '' sixty-eight years ago , before either poet or critic suspected his own future fame .

		This belated book-review , now receiving its first publication , can hardly fail to have a keen interest for lovers of litera ture ; nor can they fail to speculate on the prob - able loss to
Browning	PERSON	by its suppression , in those early days when he waited so long for any kind of recognition from the public .

		To be sure , Mill 's comments are far from being altogether fiattering , but to a young writer any serious treatment is bet - ter than absolute indifference .

		Here is the review : 230 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' With considerable poetic powers , this writer seems to me possessed with a more intense and morbid self-consciousness than I ever knew in any sane human being .

		I should think it a sincere confession , though of a most unloveable state , if the '
Pauline	PERSON	' were not evidently a mere phantom .

		All about her is a halo of inconsistency , -- he neither loves her nor fancies he loves her , yet insists upon talking love to her .

		If she existed and loved him , he treats her most ungraciously and unfeelingly .

		For all his aspirings and yearnings and re - grets point to other things , never to her ; then he pays her o # P toward the end by a piece of flummery amounting to a modest request that she will love him and live with him and give herself up to him without his loving ker , -- moyennant quoi he will think her , and call her everything that is hand - some , and he promises her that she shall find it mighty pleas - ant .

		Then he leaves off by saying he knows he shall have changed his mind by tomorrow , and begins ` those intents which seem so fair , ' but that having been thus visited once no doubt he will be again , -- and is therefore ' in perfect joy , ' and luck to him 1 as the Irish say .

		`` A cento of most beautiful passages might be made from this poem , and the psychological history of himself is power - ful and truthful -- truth-like certainly , all but the last stage .

		That , he evidently has not yet got into .

		The self-seeking and self-worshipping state he well described , -- beyond that , I should think the writer had made , as yet , only the next step ,
viz.	LOCATION	, into disguising his own state .

		I even question whether a part of that self-disdain is not assumed .

		He is evidently dissatisfied , and feels part of the badness of his state ; he does not write as if it were purged out of him .

		If he could once muster a hearty hatred of his selfishness , it would go ; as it is , he feels only the lack of good , not the posi - tive evil .

		He feels not remorse , but only disappointment ; a mind in that state can only be regenerated by some new pas - sion , and I know not what to wish for him but that he may meet with a real
Pauline	PERSON	. ''

		Meanwhile he should not attempt to show how a person may be recovered from this morbid state , -- for he is hardly convalescent , and ' what should we speak of but that which we know ? ' ''

		`` Pauline '' was published in
1833	DATE	, and that Mill 's annotations were seen by
Browning	PERSON	soon af - ter they were written is probable from the fact that on the fly-leaf is written in his own hand ``
R. Browning	PERSON	,
October 30th , 1833	DATE	. ''

		The inscription on the next page , '' To my true friend ,
John For	PERSON	- flter , '' is probably of much later date .


Browning	PERSON	's answers to Mill 's marginal notes are highly interesting .

		Apropos of the lines , -- `` I rather sought To rival what I wondered at , than form Creations of my own ; so , much was light Lent back by others , yet much was my own , '' -- Mill wrote : '' This writer seems to use ` so ' according to the colloquial vulgarism in the sense of ' therefore ' or ' accordingly , ' from which occasionally comes great obscurity and ambiguity , as here . ''

		To which
Browning	PERSON	responds : '' The recurrence of ' so ' thus employed is as vulgar as you please ; but the usage itself of ' so ' in the sense of ' ac - cordingly ' is perfectly authorized .

		Take an instance or two from
Milton	LOCATION	: ` So farewell Hope , and with Hope , farewell Pear . '

		-- ' So on he fares and to the border comes of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	. '

		-- ` So down they sat , and to their viands fell , ' -- ` So both ascend in the visions of God . '

		-- ' So death becomes his final remedy . '

		-- ' So in his seed all nations shall be blest .

		-- ' So law appears imperfect . '

		-- ` So all shall turn degenerate . '

		-- ` So violence proceeded , and oppression . ' ''


Browning	PERSON	's well-known later disapproval of his own early work is here definitely stated , these words being written opposite the title-page : '' The following poem was written in pursuance of a fool - ish plan which occupied me mightily for a time and which had for its object the enabling me to assume and realize I know not how many different characters ; -- meanwhile the world was never to guess that '
Brown	PERSON	,
Jones	PERSON	,
Smith	PERSON	, and
Robinson	PERSON	' -LRB- as the spelling-books have it -RRB- , the respective au - thors of this poem , the other novel , such an opera , such a speech , were no other than one and the same individual .

		The present abortion was the first work of the Poet of the batch , who would have been more legitimately myself than most of the others ; but I surrounded him with all manner -LRB- to my then notion -RRB- , poetical accessories , and had planned quite a delightful life for him .

		Only this - crab remains of the shapely Tree of Life in this Fool 's paradise of mine .

		R. B. '' But to students of
Browning	PERSON	's inner life , perhaps the most interesting page of all is the last one of the volume .

		Perhaps others have wondered , as I have , why this poem is always printed with the date , ''
Richmond	LOCATION	,
October 22nd , 1832	DATE	, '' since
Browning	PERSON	never lived at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		In this volume
Browning	PERSON	has underlined
Richmond	LOCATION	, and added : ''
Kean	PERSON	was acting there ; I saw him in
Richard III	PERSON	.

		that night , and conceived the childish scheme already mentioned ; there is an allusion to
Kean	PERSON	, page 47 .

		I do n't know whether I had not made up my mind to act , as well as to make verses , music , and God knows what , -- que de chateaux en Espagnt ! ''

		The lines on page 47 , referred to , are these : '' I will be gifted with a wondrous soul .

		Yet sunk by error to men 's sympathy .

		And in the wane of life ; yet only so As to call up their fears ; and then shall come A time requiring youth 's best energies ; -- And straight I fling age , sorrow , sickness off , And I rise triumphing over my decay . ''

		It must have been one of the last , if not the very last , of
Kean	PERSON	's performances when
Browning	PERSON	saw him , for
Kean	PERSON	was then acting but seldom , and he died in the following
May	DATE	.

		The critics have been in the habit of attributing '' Pauline '' mainly to
Shelley	PERSON	's influence over
Browning	PERSON	, but no one seems to have interpreted this passage with any reference to
Kean	PERSON	, or to be aware that he had any part in in - spiring this '' first heir of the invention '' of
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		This will be < ' new matter '' for the
Browning	PERSON	societies , direct from headquarters .

		A coincidence occurred to me just here , perhaps sufficiently striking to be worthy of mention .

		As I raised my eyes from this ''
Kean	PERSON	'' note , I saw hanging exactly opposite a life-size painting of Ed - mund
Kean	PERSON	as
Richard III.	PERSON	, painted by
John James Hall	PERSON	.

		It was the merest accident , of course , that I had chosen the one seat in the room where this could have happened .

		Yet for the moment it gave me a distinct thrill , almost a shock , as if some magic had called up the actor 's presence as
Brown	PERSON	- ing saw it ; and for that moment
Kean	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing and Mill seemed more real presences than the actual persons in the room , -- an impression scarcely dimmed as I write now to describe a book so long inaccessible , but vital with the touch of two of the greatest minds of our century .

		* Only too few public careers in
America	LOCATION	have attested the single-minded devotion to principle which marks the life of the lawyer , legislator , soldier , governor , senator , and presidential can - didate whose story is told by himself in the large octavo volume styled '' Personal Recollec - tions of
John M. Palmer	PERSON	. ''

		Though presented in a manner far too artless to claim attention as literature , the book is so successful in inter - preting the man to his innumerable friends and acquaintance that it is deserving of every attention from students of history and public polity .


John McAuley Palmer	PERSON	was born in
Scott	LOCATION	county ,
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
September 13 , 1817	DATE	, the son of a cabinet-maker who served his country in the war of
1812	DATE	, and grandson of a revolu - tionary pensioner .

		The lad was reared by a God-fearing father who placed his earthly trust in the doctrines of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	and , hated slavery with a hatred so thorough that it led to his removal from
Kentucky	LOCATION	to
Madison County	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, in
1831	DATE	.

		It is to be observed , also , that the elder
Palmer	PERSON	was one of the first advocates of total abstinence in a place and time when persecution followed rebuke of an almost universal custom of liquor - drinking .

		The boy attended
Shurtleff College	ORGANIZATION	at
Upper Alton	ORGANIZATION	, an institution which claims the distinc - tion of being the '' oldest college in the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, '' supporting himself by manual labor during his schooling and entering upon the study of law before obtaining his degree .

		He was admitted to the
Illinois	LOCATION	bar in
December of 1839	DATE	,
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	being his sponsor to the court , his political shallop having then been launched through his acceptance of the nomination for county clerk a few months before .

		In
1842	DATE	, young
Palmer	PERSON	married Miss
Malinda Ann Neely	PERSON	, such success as a young practitioner could boast having already fallen to his portion .

		In
1843	DATE	he was elected probate justice of the peace by a large majority , retaining his office until it was abol - ished by the constitution of
1848	DATE	, an instru - ment in the making of which he had a full share , being a delegate to the convention which formulated it .

		In

		In

John M. Palmer	PERSON	, always a hater of slavery though never an abolitionist , over to the new-born Bepublican party .

		He assisted at the organization of the party in

Bloom	ORGANIZATION	- ington Convention in
1856	DATE	, and went as a delegate from that to the
National Republican Convention	ORGANIZATION	which convened at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
July	DATE	of the same year .

		In
September , 1859	DATE	, he was unanimously nominated for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but was beaten by four thousand vot `` s ,
John Brown	PERSON	's attack upon
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry strength - ening the opposition .


Palmer	PERSON	was a delegate to the
Republican State Convention	ORGANIZATION	at
Decatur	LOCATION	in
May , 1860	DATE	, and to the
National Convention	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	a few weeks later .

		He served as one of the five Illinoisans in the Peace Con - vention on
February 4 , 1861	DATE	, and while there was reconciled to
Douglas	PERSON	, with whom he had quarrelled on leaving the Democratic party .

		Upon the outbreak of the Civil War
Palmer	PERSON	was sent to
Cairo	LOCATION	by Governor
Yates	PERSON	, and upon his return was chosen Colonel of the
Sixth Congressional District Regiment	ORGANIZATION	, the Four - teenth
Illinois Infantry	ORGANIZATION	.

		The modesty of the man leaves much of his military service unre - corded , but he was with the reinforcements after the battle of
Wilson Creek	ORGANIZATION	and through the
Springfield	LOCATION	campaign , and was made brig - adier-general on
December 20 , 1861	DATE	, taking command of a division of
Indiana	LOCATION	volunteers in the operations of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	against Island No. 10 .

		He was at the battle of
Stone River	LOCATION	, and was made major-general soon after - wards .

		Efficient services were rendered by him at the battle of
Chickamauga	LOCATION	, but he re - garded the breaking - up of the
Twenty-first Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	as a reflection upon the entire command and resigned his office .

		Lincoln refused to accept the resignation , and put him in command of the
Fourteenth Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	soon after .

		At the beginning of
Sherman	ORGANIZATION	's invasion he was embroiled in a controversy over seniority of office with General
Schofield	PERSON	, who had received his commission a full year later , and again resigned .

		Again the resignation was disregarded , and General
Palmer	PERSON	was giv - en command of the
Department of Kentucky	ORGANIZATION	.

		The manner of his appointment is worth re - peating in detail , beginning with his conversa - tion in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	: '' I said to him , ' Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, I wrote you a letter last
September	DATE	, saying that I did not wish to be one of 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, your unemployed generals , and you answered me on a card , saying '' When I want your resignation , I will tell you . '' '

		He said , `` I have a job for you now , the com - mand of the
Department of Kentucky	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I replied , ' I have commanded troops in the field during my military service , but I do n't want to go to
Kentucky	LOCATION	and spend my time quarrelling with politicians . '

		He said , • Go to
Stanton	PERSON	and get your orders , and come back here at nine o'clock to-morrow , and I '11 tell you who are our friends and what makes a change in that command necessary . '

		When I returned in the
morning	TIME	, I saw several persons going in and out of his room , and be - came slightly impatient , but when the colored door - keeper came and inquired for me , I entered the room and found him -LSB- Lincoln -RSB- seated in an office chair en - gaged in being shaved .

		He said , ` You are home folks , and I must shave .

		I can not do go before senators and representatives who call upon me ; but I thought I could do so before you . '

		We then commenced to talk of the affairs of
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		I repeated what I had said the
evening	TIME	before about my reluctance to go to
Ken	PERSON	- tucky and quarrel with the politicians , and he said , ' Go to
Kentucky	LOCATION	, keep your temper , do as you please , and I will sustain you . '

		Then occured an incident which affords a key to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's policy and accounts for his successful conduct of the civil war .

		I was silent while the barber was shaving him about the neck , but after he was through with that particular part of his duties , I said , ' Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, if I had known at
Chicago	LOCATION	that this great rebellion was to occur , I would not have consented to go to a one-horse town like
Springfield	LOCATION	, and take a one-horse lawyer , and make him president . '

		He pushed the barber from him , turned the chair , and said in an excited manner , ' Neither would I ,
Palmer	PERSON	.

		If we had had a great man for the presidency , one who had an inflexible policy and stuck to it , this rebellion would have succeeded , and the
Southern Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	would have been established .

		All that I have done is , that I have striven to do my duty to-day , with the hope that when to-morrow comes , I will be ready for it ! ' ''

		General
Palmer	PERSON	left the army in
September , 1866	DATE	; though
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	offered him a brigadier-generalcy in the regulars , to which he replied , '' I would rather be the police magistrate in the town where I live than a brigadier-general in time of peace . ''

		He prac - ticed law until

		Useful as we find rugs and carpets to be in our households , their rela - tive value is beyond all comparison greater in the domestic economy of the nomad , or the man whose dwelling is arranged upon the simple model of the tent , as is the case through - out a large part of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		For him they are the chief furnishings of his habitation , and are a recognized form of property , scarcely less important than his weapons , his flocks , and his herds .

		It is no wonder then that he should strive to make them as perfect as possible for the purposes they have to serve , and as beau - tiful as his fancy can compass .

		In this way , what was doubtless in the beginning a mere industry , developed into an art which has been handed down from generation to generation , and kept alive until the present day by the conservatism of the hitherto immutable East , where manners , customs , and habits of life have persisted for centuries upon centuries substantially unchanged .

		THE DIAL .

		233 of foreign dyes .

		This transformation has been in progress for some twenty-five years or more , and latterly western merchants have invaded the rug-weaving countries , where they seek to control and direct the business of manufac - turing .

		Although it would seem obvious that it is for the interest of the western merchant to pre - serve the old methods intact , there is grave reason to fear that the Oriental craftsman 's inherited skill in design , and more especially in dyeing , will in the not distant future be utterly lost .

		Commercialism has many sins to answer for , not least among which is the de - struction of the arts of primitive peoples .

		Among such peoples production is never upon what we would consider a commercial basis .

		For example , neither time nor labor enter into the calculation of the nomad weavers as an element of cost which they need consider when selling .

		The members of a family work to - gether , and having made such rugs as they require for their own use , they sell their sur - plus product for what they can get , be it much or little .

		The change comes when the opulent foreign buyers appear and compete against each other .

		Then it invariably happens that the stimulus of unusual demand causes haste in production and deterioration in the product ; while the habit of suiting the wares to the for - eigner 's taste as certainly results in loss of fine perception on the part of the makers , and we wonder to what extent skill in design and in harmonious blending of color are attributable to traditional rules rather than to innate feeling .

		Happily , although every kind of error con - ceivable in connection with rug manufacture has been persistently introduced by European and American merchants , the art still lives , albeit in a crippled condition .

		If anything can save it from further decay it will be the educa - tion of the people who make the foreign mar - ket .

		While it is too much to expect that this can proceed upon such a scale as to materially affect trade conditions , yet the publication within a year of two important and sumptu - ously-illustrated books about rugs and rug - weaving , and their cordial reception by the public , may be taken as a favorable symptom .

		Miss
Holt	PERSON	's book , as indicated by its sub - title , is designed as a '' Handbook for Ready Reference , '' and as such it should serve a use - ful purpose .

		It is not intended to challenge comparison with Mr.
Mumford	PERSON	's elaborate and epoch-making work , but '' to present in concise form certain facts that may enable a novice to appreciate the beauty and interest attaching to rugs , and assist a prospective purchaser in judging of the merits of any particular rug he may desire to buy . ''

		To the general reader who does not care to delve deeply into the de - tails of the subject this treatment has its advan - tages .

		That there should be a good many points about which more ample information would seem desirable is inevitable under the circumstances .

		On the whole the leading facts are presented quite lucidly and accurately , and in very compact and readable form .

		As this review is written from advance sheets it does not seem worth while to com - ment on minor errors which may be corrected before the book is printed .

		It may however be noted that while most of the proper names are correctly rendered , the spelling of Sinna for Sehna , and of Derbent for Derbend are open to objection from the point of view of scientific transliteration .

		There is hardly suf - ficient warrant for the statement that '' in de - sign and color the rugs woven to-day in the Orient are similar to the Assyrian and Baby - lonian textile fabrics of B. C. 1000-607 -LRB- Fall of
Nineveh	LOCATION	-RRB- and 538 -LRB- Fall of Babylon -RRB- . ''

		And it is obviously a blunder to say that there is now in the possession of Mr.
Hay	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	'' a small rug discovered in that city -LSB-
Thebes	LOCATION	-RSB- some time between the years 666 and 358 B. C. '' A book upon such a subject as that under consideration would be comparatively useless without the aid of illustrations .

		The twenty - four full-page reproductions of rugs with which the volume is adorned add much to its value .

		Twelve of these are in color , and present with wonderful truthfulness the effects of the beau - tifully harmonious and soft coloration of the fabrics reproduced .

		The other twelve , which are in monochrome , show the patterns as clearly and satisfactorily as could be expected from black and white .

		There are also six half-tone plates showing the conditions under which Oriental rugs are produced .

		The great cost of illustration in color forbids the introduction into a single volume of reproductions of all the typical weavings .

		The lack of such adequate illustration was a shortcoming in Mr.
Mum	PERSON	- ford 's book , and the plates in both books taken together suplement each other admirably and furnish material assistance to the student .

		Miss
Holt	PERSON	's book is supplied with an ex - cellent index and some serviceable geographical tables .

		The list of symbols contains much irrelevant matter ; and the so-called Bibliog - 284 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Two
Views of Southern Recon	ORGANIZATION	- struction .

		* The attractiveness of the Reconstruction period of American history for doctorate dis - sertations is attested afresh by the appearance of '' Reconstruction in
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
James Wilford Garner	PERSON	, and '' The Reconstruc - tion of
Georgia	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
Edwin C. Woolley	PERSON	.

		The task of getting the seceded States back into their '' proper practical relations , '' as Lin - coln expressed it , has been made the subject of a monograph for almost every State that revolted in
1860	DATE	and
1861	DATE	.

		In nearly every instance these writings have been the fruits of class-room instruction and library investiga - tion , and as such they form a strong contrast to books written by those who participated in the work they describe , being the product of a younger generation than that which engaged in the practical work of Reconstruction .

		The partisan spirit characterizing such books as
Logan	LOCATION	's '' Great Conspiracy '' on the one side , and
Herbert	PERSON	's '' Why the Solid South ? ''

		on the other , is replaced in these dissertations by a calm presentation of the testimony on both sides and conclusions reached from its study .

		Although one of these volumes was written by a native of
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and the other by a native of
Illinois	LOCATION	, the reader searches their pages in vain for evidences of sectional ani - mosity or even prejudice .

		It is true that the darker aspect of the '' carpet bag '' rule appears in the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	author , while the Northern man finds evidences of nothing much worse than extravagance in that unsavory regime .

		But that the Southern people should have been willing to return , repentantly or unrepentantly , to the bonds they had been trying to break , both authors agree in thinking would have been '' unnatural '' and '' extraordinary . ''

Mississippi	LOCATION	is the more am - bitious of the two , being really a political his - * Reconstruction in

1860	DATE	to
1875	DATE	.

		The author describes the devastated condition of the
State	ORGANIZATION	at the close of the war , and the eagerness with which many of the citizens un - dertook to accept the mild terms of President
Johnson	PERSON	in the
summer of 1865	DATE	.

		But the situation was greatly aggravated by the pres - ence of troops , and especially black troops , most obnoxious to the South .

		To the lax and partisan white commanders of these troops , the records point much of the friction that oc - curred .

		Mr.
Garner	PERSON	deplores the '' black laws '' passed by these
Johnson	PERSON	governments for regu - lating the freedman , although his abundant quotations from newspapers show a state almost reaching terrorism from the license of the blacks .

		Yet he sees that these laws gave to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, flushed with triumph and regarding President
Johnson	PERSON	as a Southern man and sympathizer , an opportunity to gain an ascend - ancy , which culminated in the harsh acts of

		An account of the '' revolution of
1875	DATE	, '' which overthrew the Congressional governments in the reconstructed States and brought the Democratic party again into con - trol of
Mississippi	LOCATION	, concludes an interesting and scholarly volume .

		In three rather distinct chapters , side phases of Reconstruction -- the
Freedman 's Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, the
Ku Klux	PERSON	, and Educa - tion -- are thoroughly treated .

		Mr.
Woolley	PERSON	, in his study of '' The Recon - struction of
Georgia	LOCATION	, '' has confined himself to the political question involved , arguing from a political-science standpoint .

		He weighs care - fully the constitutionality of the many questions that arose in the rapidly succeeding govern - ments in
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		So far as the Southern view of Congressional government is concerned , he thinks the people hated this government '' partly for what it did , but more for what it was . ''

		He regards the enfranchisement of the negro as a grievous mistake , since it checked the friendly spirit of the white man toward him , a check from which it has not yet recov - ered .

		From a political viewpoint also he thinks it was a mistake .

		The Republicans lost the support of the Southern whites who had been opposed to secession , and these formed a large party in
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		For a time this loss was made good by the negro vote , but not long .

		Epochs and
Epoch-Makbrs	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Modern educational reading has come to be pretty highly organized ; and among its effect - ive agencies a definite place and function have been found for the various '' series '' which present in compact form -LRB- usually one moderate volume -RRB- the results of scholars ' studies in the world 's history and biography .

		Standing mid - way between the scattered original sources and the constraint of an Encyclopjedia article , these '' stories '' of the nations and of the nations ' heroes seem to divine and to meet the temper of our time .

		As most of the writers of these monographs are university professors , it would seem , too , that we are learning to utilize our scholars for a direct popular advantage in a way unimagined by a former generation .

		One of these series , under the suggestive -- if somewhat Teutonic -- title of '' The World 's Epoch-Makers , '' is that edited by Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	, and intended to present , when the issue is complete , a conspectus of the most prominent movements that have taken place in theology , philosophy , and the history of intel - lectual development , from
Buddha	LOCATION	to the present day , -- the last name being
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	.

		Of the twenty-eight volumes announced , seven have thus far appeared , the subjects naturally not being chosen in chronological order ; and the three latest of these form the occasion of this notice .

		In ''
Francis	PERSON	and
Dominic	PERSON	, and the

University of St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	, we have an account of the lives of these mediaeval saints which lifts their personality into sharp relief against the confused background of their time .

		Though Dr.
Herkless	PERSON	is calm , he is not cold ; and his portrayal of the lovely character of

		of St.
Francis	PERSON	that finds its quickest response in
North British	LOCATION	thought and feeling ; and we recognize without surprise that the writer has the right key to at least one door when he says : `` His -LSB-
Francis	PERSON	's -RSB- education in the school of the Troa - badoors , more than the education of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's school , prepared him for the wandering life of poverty in which his love to Christ had a lyric sweetness and his actions for men bad often the character of romance . ''

		It is made the glory of
Francis	PERSON	, with his car - dinal virtues of poverty , humility and love , that '' He spread religion beyond the cloister and carried it into family life ... Poverty was for
Francis	PERSON	, as for
Dominic	PERSON	, not simply a question of property or money ; it meant for them the sum of the vir - tues or graces in the character of Jesus Christ ... Poverty was the watchword of
Francis	PERSON	.

		Before his day religion was little more than attention to the observances of the church .

		He , on the other hand , was the preacher of personal piety .

		His love flowed to
Christ	LOCATION	, and conduct was an imitation of His sacred life .

		Dominic in the same manner sought to invite men to religion , preaching the gospel and teaching the truths of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's dognta .

		Francis chose to preach , but also to show forth the beauty of holiness by imitation of Christ .

		The end sought by the two saints alike was to stimulate piety , not by drawing men to the cloister for contemplation , but by keeping them in the world for the practice of righteousness . ''

		The fact that the mendicant orders so often and so far fell away from the noble standard set by their founders only serves to identify them , mournfully enough , with Christianity in general ; but in spite of defects in morality and excesses in superstition their services to religion and civilization were real and impor - tant .

		Professor
Herkless	PERSON	does not hesitate to say : '' The mendicants , while acting as the servants of the church , unintentionally fostered the tendency to criti - cize ecclesiastical pretensions and priestly professions , and to examine the validity of the dogma .

		Stimulated to piety , the soul found freedom and rejoiced , and in its freedom took up the task of testing authority , and the Reformation was the far-off result .

		Taught by the mendicants that religion must govern conduct , men listened to their doctrine , and inquired and thought , and judged . ''

		The progress of the Franciscan and Domi - nican orders , and their prominence in ecclesi - astical and scholastic history , are discussed by the author in a couple of interesting chap - ters . ''

		In
1825	DATE	, at the close of six hundred years of history , the Dominicans counted among their numbers four popes , seventy cardinals , four hundred and sixty bishops , four presi - dents of General Councils , twenty-five legates a latere ^ eighty apostolic nuncios , and one prince - elector of the Holy Roman Empire . ''

		The Franciscan Minorites show a shorter roll 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, of five popes , fifty cardinals , and a host of minor prelates ; but in the realm of scholas - tic thought their list lengthens with such names as
Alexander Hales	PERSON	,
John Bonaven	PERSON	- tura , Duns Scotus -LRB- Doctors respectively Irre - fragable , Seraphic , and Subtle -RRB- ,
Raymond Lully	PERSON	,
William	PERSON	of
Occam	LOCATION	, and
Roger Bacon	PERSON	; as against only two great Dominican fathers , Albertus
Magnus	PERSON	and
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, `` Universal '' and `` Angelical '' though these were .

		On the whole .

		Dr.
Herkless	PERSON	has given us a book to be commended .

		He '' sees things steadily and sees them whole '' ; and reports what he sees without prejudice , and yet with appreciation and even sympathy .

		His wide range of reading is attested by a copious bib - liography , and his consideration for students by an unusually minute index .

		Another volume in the same series is a study of the life and work of
Savonarola	LOCATION	, by the Rev.
George M'Hardy	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	.

		It is not necessary to expect at this day any additions to our knowledge of what the great preacher of
San Marco	LOCATION	said and did in
Florence	LOCATION	in the
closing years of the fifteenth century	DATE	.

		We can only read the story again , and try to measure the potency of the motives which dis - tracted that heroic soul .

		Dr.
M'Hardy	PERSON	has made good use of his authorities , from
Villari	PERSON	down to
George Eliot	PERSON	and
Frederick Myers	PERSON	; and in simple straightforward language he tells the tale of
Savanarola	LOCATION	's troubled life , from his leap into fame by the apocalyptic sermon preached at
Brescia	LOCATION	in
1486	DATE	, to the final tragedy of the
Piazza della Signoria	LOCATION	in
1498	DATE	.

		The limitations of his character are not denied , but are explained by his temper - ament and the conditions of the age .

		In jus - tifying his resistance to the fulminations of the infamous Alexander VI. , Dr.
M'Hardy	PERSON	takes the only possible Protestant view of that world-old question .

		He deprecates
George Eliot	PERSON	's criticism of
Savonarola	LOCATION	's failure to interfere on behalf of the condemned Medi - cean conspirators ; claiming reasonably enough that the right of appeal to the Greater Coun - cil was one that he had never advocated , and further that , as an excommunicated priest , he was debarred from any suitable opportunity of moving the public mind .

		On the other hand , our author goes too far in becoming an apolo - gist for
Savonarola	ORGANIZATION	's iconoclastic zeal in con - signing works of art to the flames along with the wigs and masks which were proper fuel for the '' Pyramid of Vanities . ''

		The fatal embarrassments which obscured
Savonarola	PERSON	's real greatness are well summed up in the concluding chapter , and assigned to the following causes : First , his attempt to combine the role of political director with that of religious teacher and reformer .

		Second , as a reformer of morals , he imposed restraints which inevitably provoked revolt .

		Third , he assumed a hazardous prerogative by his per - sistent though sincere claim to direct divine illumination .

		In spite of these , however , the author fairly establishes his thesis , claiming for the eloquent Fra
Girolamo	PERSON	a place among the world 's epoch-makers by virtue of '' the moral passion he inspired -- the feeling he awakened in a sordid , pagan age of the great ends of life , of the needs and claims of man 's immortal nature , of the glory of truth and the noble endeavor for right . ''

		In all her age-long history , the Church never had a nobler son than
Ansel m of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		It fell to him to illustrate the passive virtues of Christianity in a degree which could only remind men of the Founder himself .

		Italian by birth , Norman by adoption , English by for - cible translation , this gentle soul yearned for cloistered peace , spiritual growth , and the win - ning of souls ; but after thirty-three years of monastic life , he was coerced into accepting -LRB- if that be possible -RRB- the primacy of all
England	LOCATION	.

		How he bore himself in that great office ; how , in the unending wrangle between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, he held out with infinite patience against the blasphemous and brutal
William Ruf	ORGANIZATION	us and the cautious and unscrupulous
Henry I.	PERSON	, and won for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the monarchy , and En - gland more than any of them dreamed of , -- all this , and more , is admirably set forth in the Rev.
A. C. Welch	PERSON	's volume .

		Aside from the clear and consistent narrative , this little book deserves a place in literature by the felicity of its style .

		Nearly every page con - tains some bit of pungent observation , some telling comparison , some convincing exposition of motive ; and all couched in chaste , spon - taneous English , which rarely falters .

		One fairly representative passage may be cited , from the description of the great council held at

		Probably the knight knew little about the immediate issue of the struggle , understood little about papal claims and royal rights .

		But the English sense of fair-play was appealed to , and that deeper sense of the right to appeal to law against power which has rarely deserted the race .

		It was a day to be marked with a white stone in the cause of English liberty and English law , the day when the lustful arrogant Norman kings learned that there was a limit set to their power , and that any man , monk , priest , or layman , dared resist their will . ''

		The Psychologt of Play .

		* The earlier work of
Karl Groos	PERSON	on '' The Play of Animals , '' already published in an English translation , made a profound sensa - tion ; and with the present volume on '' The Play of Man , '' it is probably the most compre - hensive and satisfactory study yet made of the psychology of play .

		The matter in the new book is divided into three parts -- Playful Experimentation , Playful Exercise of Impulses of the Second or Socionomic Order , and The Theory of Play .

		The child -- or the man -- in playful experimentation , exercises his sen - sory apparatus , his motor apparatus , and his higher mental powers .

		Groos exhaustively considers the matter of experimentation in each of these directions .

		From such experimenta - tion , a valuable training for the individual results .

		Not that the playful use of the various powers aims at discovery , improvement , and development ; intentionally directed to useful ends , the exercise ceases to be play .

		Passing from individual play experimentation to play - ful exercise of impulses of the second or socio - nomic order , the author considers this under the divisions of fighting play , imitative play , and social play .

		The review is remarkably complete .

		The method is inductive and com - parative .

		the savage , and of civilized man , are brought into relation and made to contribute mutually to conclusions .

		In the final very brief part of the book , the theory of play is discussed .

		The difficulty of adequately presenting
Groos	PERSON	's treatment in a brief notice is greatest at this point .

		The theory of play is considered from six standpoints -- the physiological , biological , psychological , aesthetic , sociological , and peda - gogical .

		We may briefly refer to some of these .

		In the explanation of play there are three views , '' none of which science should neglect '' : -LRB- a -RRB- Play serves as a discharge for superabundant vigor ; -LRB- b -RRB- Play is an oppor - tunity for relaxation and recreation of ex - hausted powers ; -LRB- c -RRB- Play has a teleological significance , it is a training , preparatory to the tasks of life .

		The author grounds the physiological theory of play upon the first and second of these , though the first is admitted to often act alone in youth .

		But the statement of a physiological theory , as such only , is un - satisfactory .

		It reduces itself largely to the propositions -- we play because we have an impulse to play ; we repeat the playful act until weary , because we have an impulse to repetition .

		To find the origin of these impulses and a basis for his teleological practice theory , the author turns to the biological standpoint .

		Here , in the advantage of experimental play and the action of natural selection , he finds that of which he is in search .

		When speaking of the theory of play from the pedagogical standpoint ,
Groos	PERSON	says : '' There are two ways of regarding the relation of play to education .

		Instruction may take the form of playful ac - tivity , or , on the other hand , play may be con - verted into systematic teaching . ''

		He warns against the extreme in either method .

		The book requires careful and thoughtful reading and re-reading .

		The matter is none of the simplest , and we may question whether it has been rendered easier by the translator .

		If she found the following passage as she gives it , she ought to have changed it : '' She adopted the rather forward manner of speaking , prac - tised by a boy of whom she was thrown with for a while '' -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- .

		The translator is un - fortunate in her rendering of geographical and ethnic terms .

		The
Marquise Islands	ORGANIZATION	^
Moluh	PERSON	- ken dwellers , and Botohu are neither English nor German .

		But we are too thankful for having this important work in English to find much fault with a translation the preparation of which presented unusual difficulties .

R. H. Russell	PERSON	.

		bly equal to that of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, but he has outdone even the poet of '' Sordello '' in the matter of reckless cacophany and darkly elliptical forms of expression .

		As we write these words we have in mind the last volume by Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	that occu - pied our attention , the volume of '' Odes '' upon the major happenings of a century of French history .

		We recall the strange verbal monsters that guarded the approach to the thought of those fearful and wonderful compositions -- '' The friable and the grumous , dizzards both '' -- and it is with no slight apprehension that we open the pages of '' A Reading of Life , '' the new volume that now calls for consideration .

		It is pleasant to be able to say that this volume , although still typically Meredithian , reverts in some measure to the poet 's earlier manner and exhib - its more of the poetical graces of harmony and lucidity than we had expected .

		The '' Reading of Life , '' with which the volume opens , is a set of four pieces which bid us choose between
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	and Aphrodite , setting forth the rapture of either worship -- the spiritual and the sensual -- and reconciling the conflicting claims , in one high syn - thesis . ''

		Not far those two great Powers of Nature speed Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead ; Not either points for us the way of flame .

		From him predestined mightier it came ; His task to hold them both in breast , and yield Their dues to each , and of their war be field . ''

		This is '' The Test of Manhood , '' to be -- * ' Obedient to Nature , not her slave : Her lord , if to her rigid laws he bows ; Her dust , if with his conscience he plays knave , And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse . ''

		This is the substance of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's deepest meditations upon the conduct of life .

		It is the ideal of upright , temperate , balanced manhood , recognizing the claims of both sense and spirit , alike avoiding the snare of the licentious and the ascetic .

		We find its deepest expression in these lines from the poem called '' Foresight and Patience . ''

		`` Ay , be we faithful to ourselves : despise Naught but the coward in us !

		That way lies The wisdom making passage through our slough .

		Am I not heard , my head to
Earth	LOCATION	shall bow ; Like her , shall wait to see , and seeing wait .

		Philosophy is Life 's one match for Fate .

		That photosphere of our high fountain One , Our spirit 's Lord and
Reason	ORGANIZATION	's fostering sun .

		Philosophy shall light us in the shade .

		Warm in the frost , make Good our aim and aid . ''

		Before taking leave of this volume , we must find room for one delicate lyric .

		`` They have no song , the sedges dry , And still they sing .

		It is within my breast they sing .

		As I pass by .

		Within my breast they touch a string , They wake a sigh .

		There is but sound of sedges dry ; In me they sing . ''

		The recent successful presentation , in a number of our largest cities , of '' The Land of Heart 's
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		239 Desire , '' has doubtless widened the circle of Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	's readers , and all those who felt the exquisite charm of that bit of dramatic poetry will be glad to make the acquaintance of '' The Shadowy `` Waters , '' the poet 's latest work .

		This , too , is dramatic in form , but woven of a dream-tissue so impalpable that ordinary words are well-nigh pow - erless to convey the impression that it leaves upon the mental vision of the reader .

		The poet says in a proem , '' My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires ; And the images I have woven in this story Of Forgael and
Dectora	PERSON	and the empty waters Moved roand me in the voices and the fires . ''

		The story is of a galley of adventurers who have sailed far northward , and whose `` Sail has passed Even the wandering : islands of the gods .

		And hears the roar of the streams where , dmids say ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	and the world and all things dwindle oat . ''

		The sailors seek to slay the leader who has thus taken them far from the haunts of men and the hope of booty , but are restrained by the music of his magic harp .

		Unexpectedly a strange ship is sighted , presently captured , and its crew put to the sword .

		A fair woman alone is spared , and she , at first defiant , succumbs to the spell of the harp , and gives herself heart and soul to the player .

		Their companions left upon the captured ship , these two , filled with a vision of the land of heart 's desire , where love shall be changed from '' brief longfing , and deceiving hope , and bodily tenderness '' to '' imperishable fire , '' speed still further northward '' to the streams where the world ends . ''

		As the poem closes ,
Dectora	ORGANIZATION	puts her arms about Forgael , and thus adjures him : -- '' Bend lower ,
O King	PERSON	, O flower of the branch , bird among the leaves , O silver fish that my two hands have taken Oat of a ninning stream , morning star Trembling in the bine heavens like a white fawn Up > on the misty border of the wood , -- Bend lower , that I may cover you with my hair .

		For we will gaze npon this world no longer . ''

		Even so summary an account as has here been attempted does wrong to the haunting beauty of this poem ; for its finer qualities elude both analysis and exhibition .

		One does not expect great poetry from Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	, and one must be prepared to find in his work whole tracts of bald platitude and incurable commonplace .

		Yet it is impossible to withhold a certain tribute of respect from a man who has through a long life so respected the art of song , and , to use his own words , '' has throughout endeav - oured to follow the honoured traditions of English poetry . ''

		In his new `` Harvest-Tide '' he has brought together his poems of recent years , and the collec - tion includes an ode for the Victorian jubilee of
1897	DATE	, a long narrative poem called '' A Georgian Romance , '' a philosophical disquisition on '' The
March of Man	DATE	, '' and a considerable variety of lesser pieces .

		Tennyson 's '' The Higher Pan - theism '' is followed -- at a marked distance -- in the couplets of '' A New Orphic Hymn , '' which opens in the following fashion : '' The stars , the skies , the peaks , the deeps of the fathom - less seas , Inmianent is He in all , yet higher and deeper than these . ''

		The Tennysonian influence is apparent in many of these productions , and notably in the writer 's in - sistence upon the spiritual struggle which man is ever called upon to wage with the brutal strain in his inheritance .

		One poem , '' The Union of Hearts , '' is a paean of praise for the defeat of
Spain	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The isles once more are free .

		No more the down-trod peoples cry in vain .

		In long-anheeded pain ; They are free , they are free once more , after rebellious years Of misery and tears . ''

		In view of subsequent happenings , these lines have an nnintended irony that even the writer can hardly fail to see .

		Mr.
Lawrence Binyon	PERSON	's '' Odes '' are eight in number , moderate in length , upon such themes as '' The Bacchanal of Alexander , '' '' The Death of Tristram , '' '' Orpheus in
Thrace	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Belfry of Bruges . ''

		We quote a fine passage from the ' * Orpheus '' poem , the singer 's apostrophe to his lyre . ''

		Ah , marvelloas once was thy power In the marvelloas days of old !

		I touched thee , and all hearts heard .

		And the snake had no thought to devoar .

		And the shy fawn stayed and was bold .

		And the panther crept near in desire ; And the toppling symplegades hong To hearken thy strings as I sung , And
Argo	PERSON	glanced through like a bird .

		Like a swallow , to hear thee , my lyre I '' These '' Odes '' are not deeply impressive , but they are serious and dignified poems , with striking dr ^ matic effects , and inspired by a noble idealism .

		Mr.
Sidney Boyse Lysaght	PERSON	, the author of '' Poems of the Unknown Way , '' is a new writer to us , and one whose first volume -LRB- if this be his first -RRB- strikes a note of austere idealism that is uncommon enough to arrest attention .

		It is the note of failure , in a sense , of disillusionment , and of brooding melan - choly , but it is also the note of determination to make the best of spiritual defeat , and to rise above the wreck of an old faith to the plane of a new and higher hope .

		There is nothing finer in the volume than its dedication '' To my Comrades , '' from which we quote . ''

		You , who once dreamed on earth to make yonr mark .

		And kindle beacons where its ways were dark ; To whom , for the world that had no need of you .

		It once had seemed a little thing to die ; Who gave the world your best , and in return No honors won , and no reward could earn !

		Sad Comrade , we were shipmates in one crew , -- Somewhere we sailed tc ^ ether , you and I. '' You against whom all fates have been arrayed ; Who heard the voice of Qod and disobeyed ; Who , reckless and with all your battles lost .

		Went forth again another chance to try ; 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Who , fighting desperate odds yet fought to win , And sinning bore the burden of your sin I We have been on the same rough ocean tossed , And served the same wild captain , you and I. '' Mr.
Lysaght	PERSON	's poems are grouped in two sections , -- '' The Undiscovered Shore , '' and '' A Ritual . ''

		From the former group we take '' The Penalty of Love , '' a sonnet quite beautiful enough to be its own excuse for being . ''

		If love should count you worthy , and should deign One day to seek your door and be your guest .

		Pause !

		ere you draw the bolt and bid him rest , If in your old content you would remain .

		For not alone he enters : in his train Are angels of the mists , the lonely quest , Dreams of the unfulfilled and unpossessed .

		And sorrow , and Life 's immemorial pain . ''

		He wakes desire you never may forget .

		He shows you stars you never saw before .

		He makes you share with him , for evermore , The burden of the world 's divine regret .

		How wise are you to open not I -- and yet .

		How poor if you should turn him from the door . ''

		More in keeping with the suggestion of the sub - title is such a poem as '' The Ends of the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' with its almost Swinburnian movement .

		The follow - ing stanza may be said to sound the keynote of the poet 's whole thought : '' When man wins truth from the years , the loss with his dreams he pays ; Bat in time the knowledge he won but leads again to a dream .

		And the wonder ever remains ; and a mystery more supreme Than the distant promised of old , is hidden in homely ways . ' '

		Mr.
Lysaght	PERSON	's '' Ritual '' expresses a faith that is well represented by the following lines : '' Be it our ritual to read In Life our Faith , in Truth our Creed .

		Let Fear its graven tables break .

		And Love our ten commandments make .

		Let us , when heaven no light imparts .

		Our gospel seek in human hearts ; Our hymns of praise on children 's lips ; In Beauty , our Apocalypse , And let the burdens all must bear In silence , be our common prayer ; Let every flower that cleaves the sod Become to us a word of God ; And , lifting heavenward Life 's intent .

		Love be , itself , our Sacrament 1 '' The religious feeling of these lovely verses may seem unsatisfactory to souls stiffened by formalism and wedded to outworn creeds , but it is nevertheless religious feeling of the most vital and inspiring sort , and its sanctions
spring	DATE	from the deepest founts of the spiritual life .

		`` The Queen 's Chronicler and Other Poems '' is a volume of verse by Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	.

		We say '' verse '' advisedly , for Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	, although an excellent craftsman in various forms of prose , has little of the poet 's inspiration , and plain sense rather than emotional quality is the salient characteristic of his measures .

		The title-poem is a versification of the
Mary Stuart	PERSON	story after
Brant	PERSON	6me .

		The follow - ing stanza is typical of the form , besides serving to in - dicate the author 's attitude toward the rival queens . ''

		Well , there they stand , pursuer and pursued .

		Famous alike now by the common voice .

		One is the bad , no doubt , and one the good : In one the gods , in one the devils , rejoice .

		One has been canonised by Mr.
Froude	PERSON	, The other by old Brantome ; take your choice .

		Say , for the name that each has after death .

		Would you be Mary or Elizabeth ? ''

		This is the longest poem in the volume .

		The others are of miscellaneous sort : descriptions , personal tributes , historical episodes , and philosophical mus - ings . ''

		A Death Mask '' is a pathetic piece , sugges - tive of
Browning	PERSON	, inspired by the sight of a woman 's body in the
Paris	LOCATION	Morgue .

		`` Those baffling eyes !

		-- Behind each lid .

		Each drawn-down lid , the soul shines through , And yon can tell that they were blue , -- And yet what message hold they hid ?

		Dumb eyes !

		But he that saw them turn .

		How deep !

		how soft I and melt and yearn In utter love upon him bent .

		Never saw them so eloquent .

		Who shall divine ?

		But if her leap To other lands than lands of sleep Launch her , and he may follow , where He can confess till his life lies .

		Pierced through and thrilling with her eyes .

		He yet may be forgiven there . ''

		Mr.
Arthur Legge	PERSON	's '' Town and Country Poems '' are fairly described by this title .

		Some of the pieces evoke images of natural beauty , and the thoughts that can not escape the reflective mind when in the presence of the woods and the fields ; others betray the shrewd observation of a dweller among men , inspired to a semi-satirical philosophy by the trivial preoccupations and the feverish unrest of modern life .

		In both classes of poems , the manner is pleas - ant enough , but the technique is mechanical , and there is little of the deeper sort of poetic emotion .

		The author is at his best in such a piece as ''
Gipsy Souls	ORGANIZATION	, '' from which we will quote .

		`` There is a secret brotherhood , whose rules Are never framed , whose watchword is unknown , Whose dogmas flourish not in learned schools .

		Whose creed is but a precept to disown The wisdom of a world that names them fools ; A band where brother scarce encounters brother .

		But treads the maze alone .

		Doubtful of life 's enrichment with another To share his thought , bruised in the human press .

		And as the roving wind companionless . '' ''

		They glide like shadows through the trailing years , Their voice a cry from an eternal Past .

		Their laughter floats across a wave of tears ; They play with all the passions , and are cast Into Love 's furnace of delights and fears ; But Hope 's brave banner , on the tide of Sorrow , Floats proudly from their mast .

		They lose not Yesterday , yet win To-morrow ; And , where the golden sunset flames afar .

		They seek their haven in an unborn star . ''

		These are the first and last stanzas of a poem that has given us unusual pleasure . ''

		Deirdre Wed '' is the title poem of Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	's volume , and is longer than all the '' other poems '' taken together .

		Since Mr.
Trench	PERSON	affects an almost Meredithian obscurity of diction , and since
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 241 Celtic legend at its best is misty in outline , the poem is a difficult one to follow , and we shall make no attempt to describe it , beyond saying that the story is told in sections by bards of several far - separated centuries .

		The pages that follow this poem prove more quotable .

		The following lyric is well deserving of reproduction : '' Come , let ns make love deathless , thoa and I , Seeing that our footing on the
Earth	LOCATION	is brief -- Seeing that her multitades sweep out to die Mocking at all that passes their belief .

		For standard of oar love not theirs we take : If we go hence to-day Fill the high cup that is so soon to break With richer wine than they !

		`` Ay , since beyond these walls no heavens there be Joy to revive or wasted youth repair , I 'll not bedim the lovely flame in thee Nor sally the sad splendor that we wear .

		Great be the love , if with the lover dies Our greatness past recall .

		And nobler for the fading of those eyes The world seen once for all , '' If this message fail to prove acceptable to the soul of broader faith , there can at least be no quarrel with such counsel as is given us in '' A Charge . '' ''

		Last , if upon the cold green-mantling sea , Thoa cling , alone with Troth to the last spar .

		Both castaway And one must perish -- let it not be he Whom thou art sworn to obey I '' '' An Iseult Idyl , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
G. Constant Lounsbery	PERSON	, is a volume of classical and romantic echoes , with a few graceful lyrics of no definite provenance .

		`` We like the following ''
Ron	PERSON	- del '' about as well as anything in the collection , although choice is difficult where all is exquisite : '' Sleep is a thornless rose upon Life 's breast .

		Whose opalescent petals breathe forth rest ; More mellow than the moon 's melodious light .

		Subtle of fragrance , fraught with strange delight Of fragile dreams and delicate repose .

		Sleep is a thornless rose ! ''

		Love is a blood-red rose of poignant thorn Whereby the flower-soft heart is bled and torn .

		While all the crimson leaves bum brighter , gain New lustre from the crimson drops of pain .

		How brief its beauty ; yet , while still it glows .

		Love is a blood-red rose ! ''

		Herodotus tells us how
Neco	ORGANIZATION	, King of
Egypt	LOCATION	, believing
Libya	LOCATION	-LRB-
Africa	LOCATION	-RRB- to be surrounded by water , '' sent certain Pbcsnicians in ships , with orders to sail back through the Pillars of Hercules , into the
Northern Sea	LOCATION	, and so return to
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		This passage is the text upon which Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	has written his long narrative poem , '' The Voyage of Ithobal . ''

		The story of the journey is told by Ithobal himself , at the court of
Pharaoh	LOCATION	, after the successful accomplishment of his task .

		The recital fills seven days , and thus occasions a division of the poem into as many cantos or sec - tions .

		The adventures of the mariners are many and various , and the author has given free scope to his picturesque invention .

		There are prophetic foreshadowings of
Vasco da Gama	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	, and the wild beasts of
Africa	LOCATION	are described in the light of modern knowledge .

		The story is stirring , and one can hardly escape a thrill when
Gibraltar	LOCATION	is reached on the homeward voyage . ''

		Here is the Ocean-Qate I Here is the Strait , Twice before seen , where goes the Middle Sea Unto the Setting Sun and the Unknown -- No more unknown .

		Ithobal 's ships have sailed Around all
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Our Task is done !

		These are the Pillars !

		this the
Midland Sea	LOCATION	I The road to Tyre is yonder . ''

		Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's blank verse is not distinguished , but it is fluent and vigorous .

		His poem is a creditable addition to the long list of his writings in verse .

		In the sequence of sonnets which he calls '' The Oxford Year , '' Mr.
James Williams	PERSON	sings the vari - ous charms which the changing seasons bring to the beautiful city where Thames and Cherwell meet in gentle confluence .

		The tribute is heartfelt , as almost any page will attest . ''

		In thee I learned to love the toil that brings Forth from the treasured wisdom of the wise The truth that must be truth forevermore .

		In thee my soul first dared on golden wings Afar in empyrean realms to soar .

		And from the child first felt the man arise . ''

		In many other forms besides that of the sonnet are the praises of Oxford set forth by this graceful writer , its legendary past renewed , and its modern humors exploited .

		In his lighter vein Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is not a little suggestive of
Calverley	PERSON	, although his fun is not quite so riotous .

		These verses on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	may serve to illustrate the author 's grave fooling .

		It seems that Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, in one of his books , says that < ' in one sense
Chaucer	PERSON	is the poet of the schools . ''

		Whereby the author is thus inspired : '' Fet `` h me forth a cnp and saucer .

		Pour the coffee ere it cools .

		Let me drink the health of Chaucer , Poet of the Oxford schools . ''

		Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	with his far sight Revolutionizes ns .

		Hand upon an English tiller All the stormy seas are past .

		Now the sumpnour and the miller Steer one safe to port at last , '' This is excellent satire , and a deep meaning lies beneath its surface .

		More reckless in its fun is such a piece as '' How I Was Ploughed in
Smalls	LOCATION	, '' which thus begins : 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ** We were rang ^ ed in long rows in those horrible halls .

		And the funk it was great though the papers were
Smalls	PERSON	, And we wrote down a patois we called
Latin Prose	ORGANIZATION	, Such as ' solus jam rosa , ^ ' The sun now arose . ' ''

		Some of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's things are amazingly clever , his Dantesque description of a football match , for example , and his ''
Oxford Horace	PERSON	, '' of which this is a specimen : '' Fair child of mother scarce less fair , Go , cast these verses to the air , Or let the doggrel be The sport of flame or sea . ''

		Thine anger overwhelms thee sore , No irate God or priest of yore .

		Not even

		`` Twas anger dug Thyestes ' tomb And caused full many a city 's doom .

		And in the Schools ere now
Oft	ORGANIZATION	drave the hostile plough .

		`` To-day I 'll get me down and fill The weary hours with golf until Cool tea again I get At Lady
Margaret	PERSON	. ''

		The transition is a natural one from this Hora - tian imitation to '' The Book of the
Horace Club	PERSON	, '' which also comes to us from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iams is a member of this
Club	ORGANIZATION	, being reckoned among its '' past Arbiters , '' and his associates in - clude such well-known writers as the Hon.
A. M. Herbert	PERSON	, Professor
F. York Powell	PERSON	, Mr.
H. Belloc	PERSON	, Mr.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	, Mr.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	, Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	, the Rev.
H. C. Beeching	PERSON	, and Professor Courthope .

		Most of these writers , as well as others , are represented in the volume now published , the contents of which are written in English , French ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Greek .

		The poems are both grave and gay , Horatian by sug - gestion and finish rather than by imitation , and they include many charming pieces .

		Since we can not represent all the writers , we are forced to make an invidious selection , and these verses by Mr.
John Buchan	PERSON	must stand for the quality of the whole collection : '' O Thou to whom man 's heart is known .

		Grant me my morning orison .

		Grant me the rover 's path -- to see The dawn arise , the daylight flee , In the far wastes of sand and sun !

		Grant me with venturous heart to run On the old highway where in pain And ecstasy man strives amain , Conquers his fellows , or , too weak , Finds the great rest which wanderers seek .

		Grant me the joy of wind and brine .

		The zest of food , the taste of wine , The fighter 's strength , the echoing strife .

		The high tumultuous lists of life -- May I ne'er lag , nor hapless fall , Nor weary at the battle-call .

		But when the even brings surcease Grant me the happy moorland peace ; That in my heart 's depth ever lie That ancient land of heath and sky ; Where the old rhymes and stories fall In kindly , soothing pastoral .

		There in the hills grave silence lies , And Death himself wears friendly guise .

		There be my lot , my twilight stage .

		Dear city of my pilgrimage . ''

		Lady
Lindsay	PERSON	has published several volumes of pleasing verse , and the last of them , now before us , is called '' The Prayer of
St. Scholastica	LOCATION	, and Other Poems . ''

		Not only the title-poem , but a consider - able number of the others , are suggestions from the lives of the saints , as , for example , this sonnet upon '' The Portiuncula '' of St.
Francis	PERSON	: '' little house within a house of prayer -- Thyself a sanctuary !

		We softly tread Thy time-worn floor ; we stand with bended head Before thy walls where every stone 's more rare Than precious gems , for loving pilgrims there Have planed it smooth with kisses .

		Lies he dead .

		Or lives he yet ?

		Assisi 's saint , who led
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's barefoot band the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's toil to share . ''

		Here oft spake
Francis	PERSON	, and his voice yet rings That called the swallows : ' little sisters dear . '

		Hard by , his cell with memories teems , and near Is the grey cave which saw him weep and pray .

		Where his soul wrestled , to the rosebush clings A stain of blood , as though of yesterday . ''

		Lady
Lindsay	PERSON	writes lyrics and ballads , as well as religious verse ; it is all sincere in feeling , but rarely rises above the commonplace in expression .

		The '' cycle of song '' called '' Heartsease '' -LRB- anonymous , but clearly the work of a woman -RRB- , fills a dainty little volume of about sixty pages .

		There are nearly as many songs as there are pages , which gives us free range for our illustrative ex - ample . ''

		A Woman 's Hope '' seems to be one of the best of these graceful lyrics . ''

		The sands of human trust run low .

		And life is all unrest ; But the faith that fades in the doubting mind Lies deep in a woman 's breast . ''

		The after-glow dies out of the skies , And fate like the sun is set ; But the light that goes from the golden world In a woman 's soul lives yet . ''

		The night-storm gathers o'er sea and land And Nature 's heart beats high ; And the Storm-master is holding fast The love in a woman 's sigh . ''

		Others of the songs strike a note of more passion - ate utterance , but the one we have quoted must do duty for the rest .

		Our first acquaintance with '' The Lyric Library '' is made through a booklet called '' Song-Surf , '' by Mr.
Cale Young Rice	PERSON	.

		It contains such things as this description of fate : '' Nor fights she for the love of fight .

		Or vict ` ry 's valiant thrill ; But ghastly to God , and godless to man .

		Bemadded of haunting Chaos ' den .

		She bursts thro ' barriers good or ill With measureless maniac might . ''

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	can write , on occasion , more intelligi - bly and melodiously than this , but we are inclined , on the whole , to dismiss his poems with a refer - I ence to
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 24S '' The iiDiniti ^ ble dense yoid Of this abjsm , in which all things are cloyed And lost in nnremembered Nothingness '' -- A motto to which he can not object , since it is of his own devising .

		A second volume of this '' Library '' is by Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	, and is called '' One Day and Another . ''

		It turns out to be a re-publication , with considerable additions , of a volume called '' Days and Dreams , '' which appeared some ten years ago .

		The poems of which the volume consists are con - nected by descriptive headlines so as to form , not exactly a continuous story , but a continuous account of the thoughts and moods of two lovers through the seasons of the year .

		The writer styles it '' a lyrical eclogue . ''

		The maiden dies before the year is over , and the man is left to bear the winter with his g ^ ef .

		* ' So long it seems since last I saw her face .

		So long ago ic seems .

		Like some sad sool in nnconjectnred space Still seeking happiness throngh perished grace And unrealities .

		-- a little while Illosions lead me , ending in the smile Of Death triumphant in a thorny place Among Love 's ruined roses and dead dreams . ''

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	evidently writes too much to do him - self full justice .

		Rather richly endowed with the poetical temperament , and aiming at the sort of mastery attained by
Keats	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, he is yet willing to publish much work that is unpolished .

		Throughout his pages one may find , side by side with passages of true and delicate inspiration , other passages that reveal hasty composition , to say noth - ing of infelicitous words and jarring rhymes .

		This statement is as true of the volume just mentioned , which the author has had ten years to revise , as of the new volume also in our hands upon the present occasion .

		But we always examine Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's work with pleasure , for every volume affords a few lyrics , at least , that are real additions to the wealth of our national song .

		Such a poem as ''
Transub	PERSON	- stantiation , '' for example , may be criticized only upon the ground that there is little new in the imagery or the sentiment .

		It certainly is an ex - quisite poem . ''

		A sunbeam and a drop of dew Lay on a red rose in the South : Ood took the three and made her moutli .

		Her sweet , sweet month , So red of hue , -- The burning baptism of His kiss Still fills my heart with heavenly bliss . ''

		A dream of truth and love come true Slept on a star in daybreak skies : God mingled these and made her eyes , Her dear , dear eyes .

		So gray of hue , -- The high communion of His gaze Still fills my soul with deep amaze . ''

		Mr.
Walter Malone	PERSON	appears to be a poet of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and the dedication of his `` Songfs of North and South '' to Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	betokens not merely personal friendship , but also a kindred in - spiration and a similar choice of themes .

		It must be said that this incessant cataloguing of vegeta - tion , and these impassioned tributes to various young women are rather cloying in their effect , and that we are glad when Mr.
Malone	PERSON	gets away from his native South , as well as from his own sentimental experiences , and fi ^ nds other themes upon which to exercise his talents .

		These lines upon '' A Western Plain '' are fairly typical of his work , and as good as anything that we have been able to find in the volume . ''

		A lonely white-washed farmhouse where I wait , A sweep of swirling cornfields , far and nigh , A flight of crows across a dreamy sky .

		Fast-fading morning-glories at the gate , A lonesome field-lark seeking for his mate .

		No hazy purple mountains meet the eye .

		No giant white-capped ocean thunders by .

		The land is quiet as the face of Fate .

		A craving for the moimtains and the sea , A pining and a waiting evermore ; A longing for the crags and cascades free , A yearning for the seaweeds of the shore ; A hopeless hope , on cloud-swept cliffs to be .

		To hear the stormy ocean billows roar . ''

		Unlike the work of his friend , Mr.
Malone	PERSON	's pieces are frequently touched with social feeling , and have some outlook upon the larger world of men and events .

		The author of '' The Book of Jade '' is a modest person who does not reveal his name .

		From the gloom that hangs like a pall over his vaporings we judge that he is also a very young person .

		Bau - delaire is his model , and he sings of charnel-house subjects in measures that would have startled even the poet of the '' Fleurs du Mai . '' ''

		I love all sombre and autumnal things , '' he tells us , '' Regal and wonderful and funereal .

		Things strange and curious and majestical .

		Whereto a solemn savor of death clings ; Coemlian serpents , mark 'd with azure rings ; Awful cathedrals where rich shadows fall ; Hoarse symphonies sepulchral as a pall .

		Mad crimes adomM with bestial blazonings . ''

		We have sought to realize the image of that last line , but it is beyond our powers of imagination .

		Perhaps the writer is making fun of as after all .

		We get a horrid suspicion that this is the case when we read his sonnet entitled '' Ennui , '' and come to its petulant close . ''

		I sat in tall Gomorrah on a day .

		Boring myself with solitude and dreams .

		When , like strange priests , with sacerdotal tread .

		The seven mortal sins , in rich array , Came in and knelt : one old .

		and weak , and gray , One that was shrouded like a person dead .

		And one whose robes cast reddish-purple gleams Upon her scornful face at peace alway .

		They swung before me amischirs of strange gold .

		And one most beautiful began to pray .

		Dreamily garmented in pallid blue .

		But I said only , -- I have dream 'd of you .

		Naught really is ; all things are very old , And very foolish .

		Please to go away . ''

		244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, And when we come to the end of the volume , we even have doubts of the author 's modesty , for he describes his own work as '' These paltry rhymes which loftier shall pursue Than aught
America	LOCATION	of high or great Hath seen since first began her world-wide State . ''

		If American poetry is to have its school of deca - dents , this ingenious writer sets them a pace that they will find it diflficult to keep .

		In looking over '' The Dead Calypso , and Other Verses , '' Mr.
L. A. Robertson	PERSON	's volume of poems , one balks a little at such a title as '' When
Lulu Comes	PERSON	, '' and a little more at such futile artifice as is exhibited in the sonnet on '' Golgotha , '' which works a sacred phrase , letter by letter , into the fabric of the verse .

		But these suggestions do not afford an adequate measure of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's talent for serious composition , which is undeniable .

		And yet a sort of sturdy good sense , rather than poetic inspiration , seems to be the most befitting phrase with which to characterize his work .

		Take for example the double ballade , `` The Man Is Noth - ing , the Work Is All , '' of which this is a specimen stanza : '' To some misleading guides we owe Lights that have made us retrograde ; While others up
Time	ORGANIZATION	's ramparts throw For us a shining escalade , By which we shall at last invade , Truth 's glorious and eternal hall ; Or fair or foul , in Life 's crusade , The man is nothing , the work is all . ''

		The expression here is rather prosaic than poetic , and many others of the pieces would require the same comment .

		The sentiment of the following lines is excellent , but their manner is that of the journalist at work upon a leader . ''

		These mongrel miscreants from o'er the sea Would any country , any cause betray .

		As witness our own Civil War , when they In scores of thousands from the flag did flee .

		Let everlasting shame be ours if we Should in one balance their black perjuries weigh `
Gainst England	LOCATION	's friendship . ''

		We have read with much satisfaction the sonnet on that very unpoetical subject , '' Dialect Verse , '' which thus concludes : '' The poor provincial 's patois may be strong With the rude eloquence that stirs the soul ; But when in raucous rhyme , or senseless song .

		The uncouth verbs and nouns together roll In tangled tropes -- then must I turn away .

		And let the yokel 's sponsor have his say . ''

		But this excellent literary criticism seems to lose , rather than gain , by being couched in the forms of verse .

		The '' Poems '' of Mr.
James B. Kenyon	PERSON	are concerned mostly with religious sentiment and the domestic life .

		They are always tastefully com - posed , and sometimes have a touch of the exquisite .

		`` In the Market-Place '' is a fair example . ''

		Muse , we have piped , but none have danced , And now we sit in the market-place , -LRB- While the shadows of noon on the flags lie tranced -RRB- , With idle fingers and drooping face . ''

		Why should we vex our souls to send Our laboring breath through the hollow reed ?

		No ears are charmed , save those that bend To scrannel straws at the lips of greed . ''

		Come , let us rise from these sordid ways ; Let us flee to the conscious woods and streams , And though we have fallen on evil days .

		We will dwell apart and keep our dreams . ''

		One of Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	's pieces voices the desire for the appearance of '' The New Poet . '' ''

		He comes not , though we tarry long ; He comes not -- and the noon is near ; The anxious world awaits his song ; Men hush their very hearts to hear . ''

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	, in his volume called `` On Life 's Stairway , '' has in mind the same thought of the new poet who is one day to appear . ''

		When the tunesters of our time Learn to live before they rhyme , Burn their sonnets to a star .

		Love the brown earth where they are '' -- When these things , and several others , shall come to pass , then the new poet will find his opportunity . ''

		He shall stand -- with brow of flame .

		As the Hebrew prophets came , Shouting , as he smites the string , ' In Jehovah 's name I sing I ' '' Meanwhile , the case of our poets is parlous , and evokes the following adjuration : `` O juggler with the fire divine , O hoarder of God 's bread and wine , Your dark and doleful sprigs of verse Nod like the plumes above a hearse . ''

		This is a very fair description of more than one of the writers reviewed in the present article , but it does not apply to Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	, whose utterance is usually sane and robust .

		At his prettiest , he can write verse like this : '' O rose , climb up to her window And in through the casement reach .

		And say what I may not utter In your beautiful silent speech I '' She will shake the dew from your petals , She will press you close to her lips , She will hold you never so lightly In her warm white finger-tips . ''

		And then -- who can tell ?

		-- she may whisper -LRB- While the city sleeps below -RRB- , ' I was dreaming of him when you woke me .

		But , rose , he must never know . ' '' ''

		The Glass of Time '' is a very small volume of sonnets and songs by
Miss Charlotte Becker	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her careful workmanship may be illustrated by '' Lin - gua Toscana . '' ''

		With tender reverence the dying sun Haloes in golden peace the ancient ways Where treasured shrines bear witness to the days When art and beauty knew their laurels won By noble , fearless souls , whose race was run With dreams alone ; who trod life 's wondrous maze Through trails of glowing color -- but to gaze On other dreams more perfect , yet undone .

		Down dusky street and narrow winding lane , The music of dead greatness fills the air With happy melody , half kin to tears -- Even as Tuscan eyes are sad with pain .

		But Tuscan lips , through centuries of care .

		Laugh with the gayest laughter down the years ! ''

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		245
Miss Becker	PERSON	's themes are of old-world scenes , and classical motives intermingle with Alpine remi - niscences .

		The verse is almost uniformly pleasing , and frequently touches the deeper chords of feeling .

		Last upon our list comes '' A Rose of Dawn , '' by Miss
Helen Hay	PERSON	.

		This is a tragic idyl , in blank verse , of love and jealousy in the
South Sea	LOCATION	islands .

		It tells of `` The land Where history is but a charming tale Droned by old men at twilight , future days Pleasantly certain as the next repast , Where gods and goddesses appear as birds .

		Trees , plants , or moonlight , gently rising tide .

		And shining girdle of leaves , -- all homely things .

		Which hold the people 's hearts . ''

		The poem is a rather slight performance , and its sentiment seems a little sophisticated ; but the story is clearly told , and the metrical form is managed with much skill .

		> pigher
Unwin	PERSON	-RRB- , a work from various hands , which deals with the shortcomings of modern civilization as exhibited in the English cities ,
London	LOCATION	in particular .

		Wholly free from chau - vinism and national self-opinionation , the several authors have brought to their task unusually clear vision and calm minds .

		Failures to grapple with the crying questions of the day by legislatures and that better class which sets the fashion in legislation , are discussed and dissected by a critical method which is never timid and yet never merely destruc - tive .

		In the same breath with a merciless arraign - ment of methods may be found a putting forth of remedial agents , these in turn to meet with approval or condemnation in the light of fuller knowledge and comprehension .

		To do all this from a practical point of view , with a freedom from the methods of the doctrinaire as rare as it is delightful , is the final merit of a work which is the more certain to meet with condemnation , either loud or tacit , from the very conviction which must follow its unprejudiced pe - rusal .

		The Preface of this interesting and valuable production gives the note of the whole in announc - ing that the Victorian Era has passed , ♦ • that new problems -LSB- are -RSB- were arising with a new age , '' and that something more must be done than '' to con - front the evils of national life with the old remedies . ''

		In all the papers following , it is noteworthy that the essayists are men with university degrees , four of them being fellows of one or another college in
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, and five of them engaged in
University Settlement	ORGANIZATION	work or activities of similar nature .

		Within the limits of this criticism it must suffice to give the titles of the respective treatises and the names of their authors , with the statement that the work throughout , whether in manner or matter , is homogeneous and logically interrelated . ''

M.A.	LOCATION	, explain themselves .

		Then follows an important paper on `` Imperialism , '' by Mr.
G. P. Grooch	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, which contains not only the best summary of recent world movements and by far the most enlightening review of the South African war and its antecedent causes , but also a word or two to Americans which deserve to be learned by heart . ''

		The descendants of the men who fought and died for the right to live their own national life under their own flag , '' Mr.
Gooch	PERSON	observes , `` now explain that when the authors of the Declaration of Independence declared government to derive its authority from the consent of the gov - erned , they only meant ' the probable consent of the governed at some future time ' -LSB- quoting Professor Giddings on ' Democracy and Empire ' -RSB- , the gov - ernors themselves being judges of the probability .

		And the politics are worthy of the logic .

		The Philippine War goes far to cancel the debt of liberty that the world owes to the

		The volume closes with '' The Past and the Future , '' by Mr.
G. M. Trevelvan	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, a survey , acute and discriminating , of what
England	LOCATION	was , what she ex - pects to become , and what the hope is for her con - tinued existence as a moral force .

		It is significant in this last connection that the great English univer - sities should grapple with problems of the vital significance of these in such a book as this .

		Viewi of ^ ® * ^ ° ^ ° * suppose that even a dis - 18th century cussion , or rather a resumi of the family life .

		discussions , Concerning the `` Letters of Junius '' will make Sir
Philip Francis	PERSON	a person of literary note once more .

		Nor was
Francis	PERSON	him - self , in his private capacity , an especially agree - able letter-writer .

		But `` The
Francis Letters	PERSON	, by Sir
Philip Francis	PERSON	and other members of the Family '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a good book notwithstanding .

		It is edited by
Beata Francis	PERSON	and
Eliza Keary	PERSON	, and although it has a '' Note on the Junius Controversy by Dr.
C F. Keary	PERSON	, '' its real value consists in the great abundance of letters by the various ordinary members of the
Francis	PERSON	family , which give us many good side-lights on English life in
the second half of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		The most amusing letter - writer of all is Mr.
Alexander Mackrabie	PERSON	, the brother of Lady
Francis	PERSON	.

		It is true that this opinion comes in part from the fact that
Mackrabie	PERSON	spent a number of years in
America	LOCATION	just before the 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Revolutionary War .

		We are naturally interested in his remarks that `` the people have all too violent principles of independence , '' that
New York	LOCATION	was a better place than
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for company and amusements , though
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was more public - spirited ; that the climate was so variable that you could wear cloth clothes in the
morning	TIME	, at noon sit in your shirt with door or window open , and want a fur cloak at night ; that if the Americans were not so hospitable they would grow immensely rich `` too rich , mon ami , for your system of American politics '' ; and a hundred other matters .

		But it is not merely
Mackrabie	ORGANIZATION	's American letters that are amusing : when he went with
Sir Philip	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	he did not lose his gift of wit and ease .

		Francis himself is a bit commonplace by comparison ; ' still he appears in quite as excellent a light when we read that in
India	LOCATION	'' in an age and country of corrup - tion , with every opportunity of enriching himself at the expense of the Indian public , he preserved his hands and his conscience clean . ''

		There is much other good meat in the book :
Burke	PERSON	defends his `` Age of Chivalry is past and gone '' ;
Godishall Johnson	PERSON	affirms that in the war times at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	he saw a Doctor of Divinity knock down an under - graduate with his musket ;
Francis	PERSON	tells of his elec - tion to Parliament for the ancient borough of Ap - pleby Castle by the one elector , '' after which a great dinner at the castle . ''

		In fact , the book is on the whole very interesting to those who like to read memoirs and letters for the view they give of the conditions of life of our fathers .

		True and false ute in Englith In `` Word and Phrase '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , Mr.
Joseph Fitzgerald	PERSON	has made an interesting contribution to the sub - ject of true and false use in English .

		Like
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	,
William Dwight Whitney	PERSON	,
George P. Marsh	PERSON	, and other predecessors in the same field , Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	treats language as one of the natural sciences , and one by no means inferior in interest and importance to any other whatsoever .

		But both as to matter and manner , he strikes out in a path of his own and is in no sense a follower of these older writers .

		He takes a middle route be - tween the purists on the one hand who would have the language put under the absolute rule of Author - ity without appeal , as is done by the French Acad - emy ; and the philological anarchists on the other , who defy all law , and maintain that in language whatever is , is right .

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	believes that the voluntary acquiescence of the people , ruled by the classic writers of their language , is the saving element of correct speech .

		Moreover , he declines to accept the authority of
England	LOCATION	as superior to our own .

		In such cases as the effort of the English to restrict the meaning of the word '' sickness '' to nausea , he calls attention to the fact that it is an effort of finical connoisseurs , and entirely at vari - ance with their own best usage , adding : '' The Anglic people in their several divisions are really or virtu - ally autonomous as regards their use of the langu - age , and they are not subject to the language laws that may be enacted in the isle oversea . ''

		This is a Declaration of Independence that will be ac - ceptable to many like-minded Americans .

		Some of the most suggestive passages of the book are those in which the English is compared with other languages , though here one may not always agree .

		Especially , we must protest against such a sweep - ing conclusion as that the German language is easier to master than the English , because its vo - cabulary is more homogeneous .

		This is to take a most partial and puerile view of what is meant by `` knowing '' a language .

		Indeed , the author grants this himself on an earlier page by saying , '' He who learns no more of a language than the child learns will remain in mental stature a child . ''

		The section devoted to `` Some Faults and Excellencies of En - glish '' is one of great discrimination and even originality , the superiorities and the failings of our tongue being pointed out with equal candor .

		In a work devoted to corectness of diction it is a pity that the first page of the Preface should offer an example of such awkward and incorrect writing as this : `` No article , except two or three , was published in the Forum in its first four or five years that was not corrected or revised before it went to the compositor . ''

		But such slips as this are not frequent .

		There is so much animation of style , such fertility and aptness in illustration , that not a page in the whole four hundred that make up the volume is dull reading .

		The pages are now increased by about fifty per cent , and the names included are increased from 8,602 to 11,651 .

		Since over seven hundred of the old names have been dropped , for death or other reasons , there are nearly four thousand new biographies .

		As for the old biographies , nearly all have been revised and brought down to the present year .

		The special features of the new edition are the statement of parentage wherever possible , and the very complete lists of the publications of the many writers included .

		It seems from a comparison of the two editions that three per cent is the annual mortality among men and women of achieved repu - tation .

		Since there can be few people included who are under forty years of age , this mortality is not as alarming as it first appears .

		Amethier aecontmt the
Iron Matk	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another book on '' The Man in the Iron Mask '' is the patient work of Mr.
Tighe Hopkins	PERSON	, whose researches have been confined with some strictness to the ro - mantically historic .

		But though he comes to no new conclusion in the matter , which was long ago taken from the field of vexed questions , he marshals his facts in a manner that takes the romance out of this famous story and leaves it a commonplace instance of the old French commonplace despotism .

		After discussing all the various myths and fables that have grown up around the reality , the author proceeds to his demonstration of the identification of the Man in the Iron Mask with one
Ercole Antonio Matioli	PERSON	, born in
Bologna	LOCATION	on
December 1 , 1640	DATE	, of an old and distinguished family of lawyers .

		He grew to be a favorite of the young
Charles IV.	PERSON	, Duke of
Mantua	LOCATION	, and aided that princeling in negotiating the sale of the important fortress of Casale to
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
France	LOCATION	.

		But
Matioli	PERSON	played double , and betrayed the confidence and plans of le roi soleil in a manner that earned the enduring displeasure of that self-centred tyrant .

		Biding his time ,
Louis	PERSON	cajoled Matioli into custody , and in the strictest custody he remained , condemned without the un - needed formalities of a trial , until death put an end to his discomforts in the
Bastile	LOCATION	, to which he had finally been removed , on
November 19 , 1703	DATE	.

		The story of this unfortunate man is told interestingly and with much vivacity , though it must be confessed the truth is not so fascinating as the lies which have been told , though doubtless equally strange .

		Re - productions of many portraits embellish the book , which is handsomely printed and bound .

		Thediteate tf life in freat eitiei .

		Men of letters are not , or at least were not , commonly regarded as very practical people , at least by no means so practical as hard-headed lawyers or scien - tific doctors .

		Their opinions or exertions in law or medicine would rarely be matters of interest .

		But when a lawyer or a doctor turns to letters , the boot may be on the other leg .

		Thus a judge condescends to show by evidence that would convince a court of law that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets were not written by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the absolute lack of interest with which his decision is greeted shows the value of his labors .

		We have now in '' Newyorkitis '' -LRB-
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
John H. Girdner	PERSON	, a hand - ling of a social topic by a literary method , namely , satire .

		If a doctor who lived in
Chicago	LOCATION	observed that his townsmen , on nearing the age of fifty , were apt to be getting bald , and wrote a medical treatise called '' Chicagoitis '' tending to show that the living in
Chicago	LOCATION	caused people to lose their hair , he would in some respects resemble Dr.
Girdner	PERSON	.

		For with all the display of technical language and method , this treatment of Newyorkitis amounts to nothing more than a statement of some of the general characteristics of a plutocratic civilization .

		Some people in
New York	LOCATION	have these characteris - tics , just as some people in
Chicago	LOCATION	are bald .

		The disease is more common in
New York	LOCATION	than else - where , only because
New York	LOCATION	is the largest of our gre & t cities .

		So one need not expect in this book any particular cleverness in diagnosing the specific difficulties of
New York	LOCATION	.

		We find in this treatise little that has not been noted by the satirists of all times .

		And we may add that in offering a cure Dr.
Girdner	PERSON	does not get much farther than when he describes the disease .

		`` Culture , '' says he , `` in its widest signification . ''

		We do not believe that he is mistaken .

		But it is probable that if he would indulge more largely in his own specific , he would learn that something more than a word , even in a very broad sense , is needed for the serious conditions he has in mind .

		Thehumort ^ ° Concluding the introduction to oj EngixA '' A Student 's Pastime '' in
1896	DATE	, the etymotcgy .

		Reverend
Walter W. Skeat	PERSON	, LittD. , took occasion to say , '' If the reception of the pres - ent book is sufficiently encourag ^ ing , it will be easy to produce another volume , or even two more , of a like kind . ''

		The reception was sufficiently encour - aging , and now we have '' Notes on English Etymo - logy '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- , a volume of like kind , for the delectation of those who like to know about the bones of the language , whether living or dry .

		This latter volume is similiar in content to the former , but it is successful in omitting , partially at least , the didacticism of its predecessor , and being of more general interest .

		It is supplementary both to the
Etymological Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	from the same hand and to Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's New English Dictionary , and at the same time it contains the material gleaned in many fields of diverse application .

		No one unfamiliar with Professor Skeat at his best could prophesy the amount of humor which can be set in such discus - sions as arise here , -- this , for example : '' Wallop , to castigate .

		This is merely the causal use of the M. E. toalopen , to gallop .

		We speak of galloping a horse , t. e. , making him gallop ; and the way to en - 248 THE DIAL -LSB-

		sure his doing so is to use the whip freely .

		The verb to wallop is also used with reference to the boiling of a pot ; this likewise is only a particular use of the same M. E. walopen , to gallop .

		The rapid boiling of the pot is compared to the galloping of a horse .

		Hence also pot-walloper , one who boils a pot . ''

		And so on , for half a page more .

		In ad - dition to the '' Notes , '' the work contains chapters on the language of
Mexico	LOCATION	, on words from the lan - guages of
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	, and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, a rough list of English words taken over into
Norman French	PERSON	, and some observations on Anglo-French spelling .

		The book is bound uniformly with its predecessor .

		May the promised third volume not be long delayed !

		In the Introduction to his five hun - dred-page volume on '' The Founda - tions of Knowledge '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Prof.
A. T. Ormond	PERSON	states that '' some fundamental reconsideration of the whole problem of Philosophy will be one of the first duties of the century upon which the world is about to enter . ''

		After a brief survey and criticism , in the Introduction , of the intellectual movements of the past century , the author takes up the task of construction .

		The book is divided into three parts , `` Ground Concepts of Knowledge , '' `` Evolution of the Categories of Knowledge , '' and '' The Transcendent Factor in Knowledge . ''

		In the first part , the notion of ex - perience is subjected to a careful analysis , and is distinguished from consciousness , knowledge , and reality ; and the problem of epistemology is set forth .

		In the second part , the clear distinction drawn be - tween perceptual and conceptual space and time , and the discussion of the subject-consciousness , may be especially mentioned ; while the third part shows that the trancendent is necessarily present in ex - perience , and that , without concepts which involve the transcendent , science is unable to escape from the internal instability of the relative and achieve a stable basis of certitude .

		The functions of mysticism and symbolism in knowledge are also discussed in a masterly way , and the bearing of the general conclusion upon ethics and religion is traced out .

		The work is scholarly throughout , and while controversy is avoided , `` the whole effort , '' as the auther says , `` may be regarded as a plea for the rights of the spiritual and for the reality of spirit - ual knowledge . ''

		Everything that we recently had tf ` ZerTA ```` ``'' `` i `` ° t `` `` ay `` f Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's life of
Ulysses S. Grant	PERSON	in the '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- The Dial ,
February 16 , 1901	DATE	, page 112 -RRB- applies with equal force to Mr.
Walter Allen	PERSON	's compendious story of the life of the soldier-president in the '' Riverside Biographical Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		With entire sympathy for the great good in the man , yet with - out the slightest condolence for the evil his political career wrought to the nation , with a complete un - derstanding of the virtue which steadfastness toward friends implies , yet with no denial of the fact that
Grant	ORGANIZATION	made it a vice by carrying it beyond con - siderations of public duty , Mr.
Allen	PERSON	has given an unusually accurate and significant portrait of a national hero , who with feet of clay could still lay claim to something of the stature of a god .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's is a book to be read and pondered over ; seldom does any biography contain an equal share of plain unvarnished truth .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The popular series of reprints entitled the '' Handy Volume Classics , '' published by

		The American Jewish Year Book '' for

Cyrus Adler	PERSON	, is the third annual issue of that useful work of reference .

		It leaves out the directories of the previous issues , as well as the bibliography of Jewish periodicals , and new matter is provided for the vacated space .

Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	.

Cleveland	LOCATION	by the
Cumulative Index Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is a dictionary catalogue of the contents of twenty-seven volumes of `` St.
Nicholas	PERSON	, '' and the expert hands that have prepared it have done their work in accordance with the best modern practice in indexing .

		Something like twenty thousand articles are catalogued , and librarians , at least , will appreciate the magnitude of the undertaking and the usefulness of the work .

		Dr.
John Rae	PERSON	's work on '' Contemporary Socialism '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- was first published in
1884	DATE	.

		Ten years ago it reappeared in a secoud edition , considerably enlarged , and now a third edition , with important additions , is placed before the public .

		The new matter of the third edition takes the form of a chapter of about fifty pages upon the historical development during the past decade of the various movements that are roughly grouped under the general name of socialism .

		The German developments are particularly noteworthy , although they by no means occupy the entire field .

		The work is distinctly the most sober , scientific , and interesting treatment of its subject now accessible to the English - reading public .

Fleming H. Revell Company Announcement JAMES M. LUDLOW Deborah	ORGANIZATION	.

		a Tale of the
Times of Judas Maccabaeus	ORGANIZATION	.

		By the author of `` The Captain of the Janizaries . ''

		12n -RSB- o , cloth , illustrated ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		A thrilling romance of a thrilling time , inTolving the career of
Judas Maccabaeus	ORGANIZATION	, the chief hero of the Jewish nation , who is counted as one of the seven greatest uncrowned men of human history .

		The four battles in which this peasant chieftain rescued his land from the Syrian monarchy are regarded by military critics as masterpieces of strategy .

		They are vividly and picturesquely de - scribed with that brilliant oriental coloring which won for the author his reputation through his earlier works .

		The martyr patience of the Jewish patriots , the sweet home-life of the people , the intrigues of priests and diplomacy of princes , are inwoven with a story of love as delicate as it is strong .


Deborah	PERSON	, the heroine , is the creation of a character , strange yet true to its type , which fascinates the reader and enriches the imagination of those who love the truly beautiful and heroic .

		It is a book which provides rarest entertainment while moving among the highest ideals .

		The publishers submit this work to the public , confident that it will be a valued contribution to the richest lit - erature of the day .

		Of the author 's style we subjoin the opinion of a few eminent critics : '' Of that rich oriental character which fires the fancy . ''

		`` Straightforward , almost in the great style of Scott . ''

		`` Some of the finest pieces of historical fiction ever produced in
America	LOCATION	. ''


ARTHUR H. SMITH	PERSON	Author of << Chinese Characteristics , '' < * Village Life in
China	LOCATION	. ''


China	LOCATION	in Convulsion .

		The Origin , The Outbreak , The Climax , The Aftermath , A Survey of the Cause and Events of the
Recent Uprising	ORGANIZATION	.

		Very fully illustrated , with numerous maps and charts .

		Two volumes .

		8vo , cloth ,
$ 5.00	MONEY	net .

		Not only was Dr.
Smith	PERSON	in Peking during the siege , but he has resided in the district most affected for the past thirty years .

		He made a close study of the inception of the movement in the centre of '' Boxerdom , '' and after the siege was raised , in spite of tempting allurements to return home , he preferred to remain on the field of action so as to study the new conditions at close range and complete this record .

		``
China	LOCATION	in Convulsion , '' therefore , is written by a man unequaled in his qualification to convey to the West a conception of the tremendous upheaval in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The five or six hundred pages sum up in a graphic way all the essential events leading up to the catastrophe , as well as the better known occurences of last year ; salient incidents of the war not generally known , thrilling stories of massacre , and narrow escapes from death , and striking facts connected with the pacification .

		It will be elaborately illustrated from hitherto unpublished photographs , and will contain several very valuable maps .

		It is safe to predict that this book will be recognized at once as an authoritative record of the Chinese outrage , and as such will become the standard work on the subject .


W. A. P. MARTIN	PERSON	Author of `` The Cycle of Cathay . ''

Cathay	ORGANIZATION	, in five parts : Arts and Sciences , Literature , Philosophy and Religion , Education , History .

		By the President of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated ,
$ 2.50	MONEY	net .

		While '' Cycle of Cathay '' exhibits the people of
China	LOCATION	, this companion volume is a mirror of their intellectual life .

		In every branch of the subject the material is drawn exclusively from na - tive sources .

		Nothing has been included which is not worthy of preservation as a result of original researches .

		As the internat - ional law and diplomacy of the ancient Chinese were unearthed by Dr.
Martin	PERSON	, so he may fairly claim to have thrown fresh light on their literature , science , and philosophy . ''

		He is one of the scholarly Americans , who , whether as mis - sionaries , teachers , diplomatists , or educators , have shed lustre upon the name of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		If one were to erase from the record of American negotiations with
China	LOCATION	, or of American scholarship in things Chinese , the names of missionaries , then our country 's record in the
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	would be scarcely higher than that of a semi-barbarous nation ... Dr.
Martin	PERSON	, as the head of the college created by the
Chinese Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, learned at first hand what he describes , and his story is a modest narrative of things seen and known . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 285 NOTES 286 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 287 WORLD LITERATURE .

		In the happy mediaeval days it was easy to be a world-writer .

		When Latin was the lan - guage of scholarship everywhere , and when to be educated meant more than anything else the ability to read Latin , whatever writings were worth heeding promptly made their appeal to the whole educated public .

		It was not a very large public in point of numbers , but it was a widely-scattered one , and it had a thirst for ideas that puts us modems to shame .

		When j the confusion of tongues seized upon the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- I pean peoples , as a regrettable but inevitable incident in the development of their several nationalities , the world-writer in the old sense became extinct .

		Yet we can not altogether re - I gret that
Dante	PERSON	, for example , wrote his great - est work in the vulgar tongue , or that
Petrarch	PERSON	sought diversion from the serious business of the epic in writing certain Italian sonnets to a young woman named
Laura	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , '' The Divine Comedy '' and the '' Canzoniere '' could not hope to find readers outside of
Italy	LOCATION	, whereas the '' De Monarchia '' and the '' Af - rica '' could command the attention of all the world .

		We can easily understand why Petrarch looked slightingly upon his sonnets , and why
Dante	PERSON	hesitated a long while before turning from
Latin	LOCATION	to Italian .

		We can also picture to ourselves the astonishment of these men , could they have foreseen that posterity would hold of slight account all that thev wrote in the language of scholars , and would treasure among the most precious of its literary posses - sions their compositions couched in the despised language of the common people .

		When the languages of modem
Europe	LOCATION	came to be the recognized vehicles of literary expression , there could be no more world - writers in the mediaeval sense .

		The Latin classics , of course , retained their prestige , and the Greek classics , so eagerly studied by the men of the Renaissance , quickly took their place beside the Latin , or rather took the superior place to which their extraordinary spontaneity and perfection entitled them .

		Bat the new writers of the Renaissance centuries were nearly restricted to the public of their respective peoples .

		We have seen how
Dante	PERSON	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, standing as it were upon the 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, water-shed that divides ancient from modern culture , contributed with doubt and hesitation to the streams that were to flow down into modern life for its refreshment and quicken - ing .

		Boccaccio was in similar case , although perceiving rather more clearly that the vitality of Latin literature was well-nigh spent .

		When we come to
Ariosto	PERSON	and Tasso , to Rabelais and Montaigne , to
Cervantes	PERSON	and
Lope de Vega	PERSON	, to
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his starry train , we come to an age in which the most remarkable manifestations of literary activity are evidently indigenous to their own soil .

		There are no longer any world - writers , unless we apply the term to such belated classicists as Poliziano and
Erasmus	LOCATION	.

		If we contrast
Erasmus	PERSON	, par - ticularly , with any of the great writers just named ,
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the others not only write in the languages of their own people , but each of them embodies in his thought the dis - tinctive characteristics and ideals of his own race .

		Erasmus , on the other hand , is no more Dutch than Italian , no more Italian than Ger - man , and he is almost as much English as he is anything else .

		While it is true that the Elizabethan English displayed a remarkable zeal in the work of translation , their activities in this direction could not disguise the fact that the time for the development of European literature upon a common basis of interests and aspirations had forever gone by .

		If we take a broad view of the three cen - turies from the sixteenth to the eighteenth inclusive , we shall see that for the history of literature they were centuries of nearly inde - pendent development in the five countries that really count .

		National interactions there were , no doubt , such as the influence of Italian upon English literature , or of French upon German literature , but these were on the whole super - ficial , and did not in any case seriously modify the bent of the national genius .

		Even the unifying influence of the classical heritage could not avail to accomplish such a result .

		This statement needs no further proof than is offered by a comparison between the treatment of classical subjects by
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his fellows , on the one hand , and by the French dramatists , from
Corneille	LOCATION	to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, on the other .

		And when we remember that it is not much more than a hundred years since Shake - speare received adequate recognition in Ger - many , or any sort of recognition in
France	LOCATION	, that it is even less than a hundred years since
Dante	PERSON	came to his own in the hearts of En - glishmen and Frenchmen and Germans , we shall realize the full meaning of the decentral - izing process of modern literary evolution .

		We now speak familiarly of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Dante	PERSON	as belonging to the literature of the world , but for hundreds of years they belonged only to the literatures of their respective peoples .

		Although world literature as a fact has a history of many centuries -- a history which covers the whole classical and mediaeval period , down to the development of the modern tongues as suitable organs of expression -- world lit - erature as a name is of rather recent birth .

		In other words , the point of critical self - consciousness at which the idea assumed defin - ite shape was not reached until very modern times .

		Goethe was the first , we believe , to speak of the world literature which to the pro- phetic view was even then shaping itself anew , and rising upon a broader foundation than its classical prototype .

		Goethe also expressed the belief that
Germany	LOCATION	would contribute some share of this new literature to come , a belief to which he of all men was best justified in giving utterance , for his is the one name since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's that has by the common agree - ment of posterity been added to the list of the world 's literary immortals .

		Since Goethe 's time , the idea has taken shape in many minds , and every decade of the past century has seen the conditions grow more favorable under which a world literature in his sense is possible .

		Let us inquire a little into these conditions .

		Some of them have to us the familiarity of the commonplace , although they were startling novelties not so very long ago .

		The linking together of the continents by electric wires and steel rails , the new means of transportation which have made of travel at once a de - light and an easily - attainable method of self - cultivation , the multiplication and cheapening of printed matter whereby the news of the whole world is brought to us with little delay -- these are the conditions that obviously sug - gest themselves , and it is plain to see that they have accomplished great things for the soli - darity of mankind .

		But this solidarity of sympathetic interest has for its necessary con - comitant the solidarity of intellectual effort that is attested in so many ways , in cooperative movements and congresses , in broad educa - tional programmes , in the increase of friendly intercourse among the peoples , and in the gen - eral growth of the cosmopolitan spirit .

		Under these modern conditions , the sort of world lit - erature that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	had in mind has been shaping itself in spite of the barriers of Ian -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 guage that tend to restrict the free communi - cation of ideas .

		This difficulty is overcome partly by translations , and partly by a frank recognition of the fact that an educated man in our time must be able to read freely at least two modern languages besides his own .

		Neither of these agencies alone would suffice , but taken together they work wonders .

		Given a trained minority of students , all the time exploring and reporting upon contemporary foreign lit - erature , and given also a public of readers who have acquired the habit of looking abroad for ideas and inspirations , and no significant mes - sage uttered anywhere in
Christendom	LOCATION	can long escape the attention of cultivated mankind .

		In
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's own later years , his dictum was strik - ingly illustrated by the European vogue of
Byron	PERSON	, and all through the century , now by
Heine	ORGANIZATION	, now by
Hugo	ORGANIZATION	, now by many another writer , the free currency of thought that has made for a world literature in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's sense has appeared among the most insistent phe - nomena of the age .

		Finally , glancing at the intellectual life of the present time , we find corroborations of our thesis upon every hand .

		To say nothing of the work done in science and general scholar - ship , which becomes the common property of scholars everywhere almost from the moment of its first publication , we may find in the field of literature proper all the evidence we need .

		One has only to mention the names of
Bjorn	PERSON	- son ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and Zola , to make it clear that contemporary literature , in its higher ranges and when occupied with large ideas , knows no barriers of race or speech , and has the whole world for its readers .

		It is a particu - larly impressive fact that of the men just men - tioned , the two who would by almost unanimous consent be singled out as world-writers ` par excellence , write their books in lansruages that lie outside the province of the most liberal education , and are known only in translations to the world at large .

		There is no writer living to-day who is making world literature of the permanent sort for which the names of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Shakespeare stand , but there are numerous writers whose envisagement of the chief aspects of modern civilization is so sincere and profound that they can command almost equally the at - tention of readers in all countries , and fairly deserve to be called world-writers .

		That their number will increase rather than diminish during the present century is a prediction that it seems reasonably safe to make .

		ON THE SHORT STORY .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Academy '' has seen fit recently to scoff at the critics who have been exercising themselves over the so-called art of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Short Story , the '' Academy '' thinks , is a short novel , and its art is distinguished by just one thing , and that is inferiority .

		Perhaps there has seemed to be a greater oat - pouring of criticism and discussion than this literary fashion of the Short Story warrants , since in some respects it is a very old fashion indeed , and the story of
Rath	PERSON	, for instance , or the Paolo and Fran - cesca incident in the '' Inferno , '' differ from their modern prototypes only in certain characteristics of internal structure and external relation .

		Bat the new
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	has gained more individuality .

		It supports the magazines and has invaded the newspapers .

		It gets itself bound into books and has made many authors famous .

		Is it a separate genus of literary expression , belonging to the nar - rative family , but distinct from the novel , or is it merely a variety of that well-recognized form ?

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	holds to the former view , and bases his opinion largely upon a certain '' unity of impression , '' which be says is character - istic of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Wedmore	PERSON	, the English critic , strenuously affirms the distinction between the two ; and it may be assumed that
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	held some such belief , for he says that '' Terror , passion , horror , most fields but that of pare beauty , can be best treated in a tale . ''

		Considerable evidence will be necessary before the Short Story can be proved deserving of a sepa - rate classification , and '' unity of impression '' needs some defining before it is ranked under this evi - dence .

		Poe used the phrase in argument , and thought mainly of the time element .

		A tale could be read at a sitting ; a novel must be read in gulps , as it were , of a handful of chapters each , and the impression , which the unity of the tale should con - vey , naturally suffered .

		But Professor
Matthews	PERSON	, wielding the same phrase , seems to refer to the effect of the design of the narrative upon the reader , whether read at one sitting or a dozen .

		A single vivid impression is to be the result of the Short Story ; while many , diverse yet harmonious , impressions are to follow upon the reading of a novel .

		Yet surely many novels , such as
George Eliot	PERSON	's `` Romola '' or
Meredith	PERSON	's `` The Egoist , '' leave a unity of impression not essentially differing from that of which Professor
Matthews	PERSON	speaks .

		In the first , the degeneration of the beautiful Greek is not only the central thread , but the digest of the whole story ; as in the other book is the egoism of
Willoughby	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither this quality nor the unity gained by condensation is a completely sufficing reason for the separate classification of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is another way of getting at this matter .

		The great difference between a poem , an historical 272 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, essay , and a novel upon the same subject , lies in the point of view .

		The poem works through imagi - nation and suggestion .

		The history deals with the facts that the poem almost neglects , and has to do with selection among these facts .

		The novel , sup - posing it to be historical , uses first the methods of the history , leavens the result with fancy , sets it forth suggestively , and , keeping in view the end of art instead of the necessity for truth , produces still other results .

		Compare , for instance ,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's life of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	PERSON	's sonnet on
Cromwell	PERSON	, and
Scott	PERSON	's novel based upon the life of the same hero .

		It is such a distinction in the point of view which differentiates a novel from a Short Story .

		From the eighteenth century downward , novel - ists have tried from their little
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	to get the all-embracing view , to record the good and the bad , the thought and the action , the youthful deed and the aged penalty .

		Either by details , or , when that was not practicable , by suggestion , their transcrip - tion of life has been as full as they could make it .

		Their art is always to imitate the breadth and the fulness of living .

		At one extreme of this imitation is realism , and there the picture is somewhat photo - graphic ; at the other extreme is romance , where the reader 's imagination is tickled into supplying much not plainly told by the author .

		In either case the life depicted in the books , like the life in the world , has many facets ; though the multiplicity of actual experience may not be present , the sug - gestion of it will not be lacking , if the book is good .

		Thus the novel is natural , in so far as any artistic transfer of the real world into the world of imagi - nation can be natural .

		In the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	, as in the poem or the his - tory , there is a different point of view , and there - fore a different treatment .

		Just the reverse of this might be true if the story that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	writes is merely a variety of the longer form that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	uses .

		But the primal difference lies in the way the authors view their crude materials , which is to say the life about them .

		While the novel-writer aims at an eminently natural method of transcription , the author of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	adopts a very artificial one .

		His endeavor is to give a striking narrative picture of one phase of the situation or the character , as the case may be .

		His aim is toward a strip lengthwise , disregarding much that a cross-section might show .

		He deals with a series of incidents , closely related to one another but not at all related to the by-play of life which , in reality , must accompany them .

		He treats of a mood always existing , but in the story supremely indicated ; perhaps of an adventure or a catastrophe , which differs from the dSnouement of a novel in that the interest is concentrated , -- the cause in the hero 's character , ready-made for the occasion , the results in the circumstances of the tale .

		If all nar - ration amounts , as critics say , merely to a simpli - fication of experience , imaginative or real , then a Short Story is simplification to the highest degree .

		We are selecting , far more than in a novel , and this because we are looking only for the chain of related incidents that go to make up one event .

		We are picking out the steps that make the tragedy , as in
Maupassant	LOCATION	's famous tale `` La Parure , '' or in
Bret Harte	PERSON	's '' The Outcasts of Poker Flat '' ; we are looking only for what bears upon our narrow purpose , that the interest may be concentrated and the conception vivified beyond the power of a novel .

		The process is very artificial but very powerful : it is like turning a telescope upon one nebula in the heavens .

		Thus it is the standpoint of the author that makes the distinction between a short novel and a long Short Story .

		In the one the writer di - gests life histories , or portions of them ; in the other he looks only for the episode , which , like the bubble on the stream , is part of and yet distinguished from the main current .

		Recognizing the futility in cer - tain cases , and the needlessness in others , of ex - pressing the whole truth , he succeeds much better with the half .

		He foregoes completeness and gains in force , and this by a change in the standpoint from which he views his world of fact and fancy .

		There is a great deal of truth in the charge that this point of view means superficiality , provided the word be taken in its root sense .

		Of course the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	is superficial in this way ; it is that which chiefly distinguishes the form .

		It is intended for surface work ; it is meant to catch and record the striking things and make them more striking .

		It is a precipitate of the important things from the general solution , and these must be the most easily precipitated .

		There is no room for intricate sub - jectivity and plot in a dozen pages .

		The function of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	is to be interesting , to convey vivid impressions ; and therefore it must , to a de - gree , work with the evident and superficial things .

		Such an endeavor has produced its characteristic form , potential for the powerful expression of the daily facts about us .

		Thus , though the novel with a purpose is bad enough , the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	with a purpose beneath its expression of interesting fact or fancy , or which forsakes its natural field to delve deep into the mystery of things or the confusion of psychological character-subtleties , is usually a flat failure .

		Such are some of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's tales , -- good allegories but poor Short Stories .

		New developments in literature do not arise nor become popular without reason .

		There are causes , artistic and otherwise , for the present blossoming of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	, causes which in themselves differ from those which have made the novel flourish .

		In a time of much writing , tastes are quickly jaded , and the Short Story , because it is terse , striking , highly-colored , and somewhat new , meets with quick applause .

		Its length is of advantage , for many people can be made to swallow good literature in a pill who reject it in larger doses .

		But the class of readers thus gained accounts less for the literary development of the tale than for the vast number of poor Short Stories now breeding manifold .

		Such a clientele can increase the production , and will usually debase the quality , of any form of literary
1901	DATE	, -RSB- THE DIAL 273 production , as the attitude of the prurient-minded popalaee of the Restoration increased and debased the eatput of the contemporary dramatists .

		Unin - telligent appreciation is not likely to be responsible for a high development in art .

		That there has been an artistic advance , and a great one , in Short Story telling , needs for illustration only a compari - son of a
Blackwood	ORGANIZATION	's tale of the 30 's and a Kipling Indian story .

		The old desire for something new and more pungent would account for the encouragement which this new development has received .

		And there is an undoubted need , in a generation whose life is greatly varied by widely-diffused knowledge and extensive intercommunication , for the vivid ex - pression of little things .

		This would add another impulse .

		But a literary structure which displays the greatest nicety of form to be found outside the domain of poetry indicates some more aesthetic cause than those so far mentioned .

		In simple truth the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	has attained a wonderful perfection because wonderful men have worked with and through it It has just come into its own .

		In
England	LOCATION	of the SO 's , publishers would not look upon anything less than a volume in fiction as a serious literary effort , -- and they preferred three volumes .

		It was only in the 40 * s that
Poe	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	began the cult of the tale .

		Copp ^ e 's search for the inevitable word and
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's refinement of the conte came later still .

		The Short Story was adapted to the needs of the time and the tastes of the people .

		Men of genius found through it a new voice , and the attempt to perfect , to give laws and a form to the instrument , progressed be - cause of the men who tried .

		In pre-Hawthornian times these authors employed the tale for the by - products of their minds ; afterwards it has served to express some of the great conceptions of their genius .

		It is this which best accounts for the chastening of its form .

		Except in one instance , which is the vivid ex - pression of single incidents or detached movements in life , the Short Story is not to be chosen before the novel ; but in its capabilities for perfection of structure , for nice discrimination in means , and for a satisfying exposition of the full power of words , it is much superior to the novel , and can rank only below the poem .

		But the novel and the Short Story are distinct instruments , differently designed , for diverse needs .

		Perhaps if the '' Academy '' should itself take a different point of view , it might not be so unwilling to grant to the latter a separate use and classification .

		Our liAXD OF THE Midnight Sun .

		* A

		It is perhaps to be expected that we Americans should seek the picturesque fiords of

Alaska	LOCATION	, whose principal products - are pay dirt and salmon and whose leading ports are
Skagway	LOCATION	and

Alaska	LOCATION	we must see the rest of the world first or surfeited stay at home thereafter .

		For as Mr.

Alaska	LOCATION	for pleasure , for sigbb - seeing .

		If you are old , go by all means ; but if you are young , wait .

		The scenery of

		274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of the trip .

		This paucity of the spoils of the chase may perhaps be explained by this state - ment in the Preface : '' Although big game played an important part in the original plan , no extended or organized effort for hunting was made , the sportsmen unselfishly foregoing their own pleasure and allowing the scientific - workers to use their camp equipment . ''

		In this combination of big game hunting and scientific exploration the
Harriman Expedition	ORGANIZATION	has a parallel , on a much smaller scale , in the voyage to
Spitzbergen	LOCATION	in
1898	DATE	of the German steamer '' Helgoland , '' which in like manner carried a small party of scientists , the results of whose work are now appearing in '' Fauna Arctica . ''

		The two volumes in hand deal with the nar - rative of the expedition , and contain a number of additional papers , all of general interest , a combination presenting the various phases of the subject in topical rather than chronological sequence .

		The technical reports , principally in the fields of the natural sciences , will be gathered in subsequent volumes .

		Already twenty-two papers of this series have been issued through the liberality of Mr.
Harriman	PERSON	and with the cooperation of
the Washington Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over fifty specialists have been at work upon the collections , and our meagre knowledge of the natural history of the Alaskan region will ultimately be greatly extended as a result of the expedition .

		The party consisted of Mr.
E. H. Harriman	PERSON	and his family , twenty-five scientists , three artists , and two photographers , all his guests .

		The guests were invited from leading univer - sities in the East and on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, together with representatives from the scien - tific departments at
Washington	LOCATION	, comprising altogether , as Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	facetiously re - marks , `` zoologists , botanists , geologists , and other specialists , besides artists , photographers , two physicians , one trained nurse , one doctor of divinity , and at least one dreamer . ''

		The steamer '' Geo .

		W. Elder , '' specially chartered for the trip , carried the party from
Seattle	LOCATION	by way of the Inside Passage northward for a thousand miles through probably the finest scenery of the kind in the world which can be viewed from the deck of a ship .

		The glaciers of the Glacier Bay region , including the famous one named after Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	, were visited , and in Prince
William	PERSON	Sound a new fiord fifteen miles in length , abounding in glaciers , was discovered and mapped .

		Here the world-shaping forces are at work : '' We were really in one of the workshops and lab - oratories of the elder gods , but only in the glacier 's front was there present evidence that they were still at work .

		I wanted to see them opening crevasses in the ice , dropping the soil and rocks they had transported , polishing the mountains or blocking the streams , but I could not .

		They seemed to knock off work when we were watching them . ''

		Leaving the forests and glaciers of the main coast they turned along the treeless Alaskan peninsula to the peaceful isle of Kadiak , which won a place in the hearts of all the company . ''

		If we had other days that were epic , these days were lyric .

		I feel as if I wanted to go back to
Kadiak	LOCATION	, almost as if I could return there to live -- so secluded , so remote , so peaceful ; such a mingling of the domestic , the pastoral , the sylvan , with the wild and the rugged ; such emerald heights , such flowery vales , such blue arms and recesses of the sea , and such a vast green solitude stretching away to the west , to the north , and to the south -- bewitching Kadiak !

		the spell of thy
summer	DATE	freshness and placidity is still upon me . ''

		Past the green hills and meadows of the Shu - magin Islands , they steamed northward to the home of the fur seal , turning aside only to the new volcano
Bogoslof	LOCATION	, a smoldering witness of the recent Titanic struggle of fire , earth , and sea .

		Brief calls were made at the Eskimo settlements on the Siberian and American shores of
Bering Sea	LOCATION	, and the prow of the '' Elder '' was turned homeward , passing in re - view once more the majestic panorama of the
Pacific	LOCATION	's shores .

		A chapter upon the glaciers of

		Indeed , the contamination of the civilized is heavy upon them , and the outlook is gloomy .

		The half-hearted attempts made by some of the corporations to re-stock the salmon streams , and the more successful fox farms , make some reparation for the havoc wrought in nature ; while the peaceful , prim , but dependent colony of Metlakahtla -- thanks to the altruism of one generous soul -- has brought the blessings of civilization to one isle at least and barred out its curse .

		But even here the shadows are now looming .

		The history of the country is written by Dr.
William Healy Dall	PERSON	, an authority on all things Alaskan , and familiar with the country and its people through many years of exploration along its coast and iuland waters in connection with the coast survey .

		Though brief , this is one of the most illuminating chapters in the book , especially in its analysis of the forces operative in Alaskan history .

		Matters were in a bad way during the last years of Russian control , and the transfer to the Republic did not work an immediate cure . ''

		A history of conditions in
Alaska	LOCATION	from

		The cheery '' Song of the Innuit People , '' by Dr.

		The division of subjects among many writers in a work of this kind of necessity detracts somewhat from the unity of the whole , and eliminates largely any dominating personal element , -- both qualities of literary strength , as evidenced in the narrative of
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the other hand , as we see in this work , a com - bination in authorship can afford a scope and a variety both in matter and form which is rarely if ever secured from a single pen .

		The editing and the illustration of these volumes has been superintended by Dr.
C. Hart Merriam	PERSON	, and the result merits the highest praise .

		The illustrations are bountifully sup - plied and exquisitely executed .

		They include one hundred and twenty-five full-page plates , of which thirty-nine are in colors .

		The photo - gravure plates , made by various firms , are prin - cipally of Alaskan scenery , having been selected from the five thousand negatives , official and private , taken on the expedition .

		The colored plates of scenery are from paintings by Mr.
R. Swain Gifford	PERSON	and Mr.
Fred S. Dellenbaugh	PERSON	.

		About two hundred and fifty line drawings by Messrs.

Charles B. Hudson	PERSON	, and
Louise M. Keeler	PERSON	further illustrate the text , and five specially-prepared maps serve to mark the route and to set forth some of the geographical discoveries .

		In this wealth of illustration these volumes surpass all previously published works of American travel .

		The typography , binding , and paper exhibit excel - lent taste , and the volumes are fine examples of the book-maker 's art .

		The skill which the host of the
Harriman Expedition	ORGANIZATION	has manifested in the world of finance in marshalling and directing men and means for definite ends has been shown in his conduct of this Alaskan expedition , the out - come of which is given to the public in these two sumptuous volumes .

		Chaste and elegant in design and execution , artistic from 276 THE DIAL -LSB-

Charles Atwood Kofoid	PERSON	.

		A
Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Dictionaries are rarely inspiring subjects for review , any more than they are profitable material for continuous reading .

		Yet they possess an interest peculiarly their own , and their profitable use forms one of the important aids to scholarship .

		The bringing together in convenient form of the equipment -- the rolling stock as it were -- of a given trunk-line of in - tellectual commerce is naturally a task of con - siderable magnitude and difficulty , to be entered upon with deliberate appreciation of its inherent limitations , to be pursued with perseverance and tact , with fortitude and patience unassailable by trials of the spirit or drudgery of the flesh , to be completed with undisguised expressions of gratitude and appeals to charity .

		And surely must this be the case in a work dealing with the intricate and vast and imperfectly-coordi - nated discipline described as Philosophy and Psychology .

		In speaking of Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	's under - taking the reviewer 's first duty is to record his appreciation of the task thus accomplished ; and with it , in the present instance , may be coupled an equally appreciative word of con - gratulation to the editor and his able and rep - resentative staff of contributors and sub-editors .

		This dictionary is not only the first adequate work of its kind in English , but may be said to be the first adequate philosophic dictionary in any language .

		It is accordingly with much proper pride that attention is called to the very large proportion of contributions emanating from American scholars .

		The work is , however , international in character ; and the inclusion of foreign equivalents , and still better the inclus - ion of foreign sanction and revision by special - ists of all nationalities , is one of the important and commendable features of the undertaking .

		And yet in plan , and considerably in execution , it remains an American product .

		It is directed primarily toward meeting the needs of

		readers , though it prevents the English usage from assuming any undue importance by giving to philosophical terms their proper historical setting .

		It is the purpose of the Dictionary '' to understand the meanings which our terms have , and to render them by clear definitions ; and to interpret the movements of thought through which the meanings thus determined have arisen , with a view of discovering what is really vital in the development of thought and term in one . ''

		While terms that require only a definition to indicate their local habitat and their relations to larger conceptions are thus merely defined , the terms with larger intention or with eventful life-histories are sketched in outline yet with some suggestion of detail .

		For such a discipline as Philosophy and Psychology a mere skeletonizing of terms would be of but very limited and doubtful value .

		The vital qualities of flesh and blood must be indicated , even if only by a line or two ; it must be clear with regard to all but merely historical usages that not museum - specimens but natural life-forms with an actual environment are being described .

		This means that the work in regard to the more important and more modern terms must be encyclopaedic in character ; this it is , and is the more success - ful in those parts in which this policy has been carried through .

		The landof Philosophy and Psychology does not need mere indexing : it requires a descriptive guide-book that has a definite and consistent perspective , that ob - serves the '' stars '' and '' double stars '' of im - portance and handles the reader authoritatively yet intelligently .

		In these aspects the work is in the main successful , though by no means equally so in the several departments ; With regard to the fact-material of the work , the separate and coordinate specification of Psychology is the most significant point .

		This reflects the importance of the psychological factor in all modern treatment of philosophical problems , and it reflects the many and diverse enlargements of the psychological outlook which recent investigation has brought about .

		Psychology as a specialty is a far more com - prehensive and consistent discipline than it was a half-century ago ; and the psychological aspects of other sciences -- notably biology , sociology , medicine , ethics , anthropology -- have been more distinctively and appreciatively recognized .

		In the distribution of space ,

Philosophy of Religion	ORGANIZATION	and by Biology ; the fifth by Sociology together with
Political Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and by Economics together with Physiology ; the sixth by Philology and by Law ; the seventh by Education , and by Physics in - cluding Mathematics .

		This distribution is interesting in itself , and may serve to indicate the scope of the several departments of learn - ing for which the dictionary is to serve more or less fully as a guide .

		A mildly critical scrutiny is sufficient to dis - cover inequalities and deficiencies of execution ; this is the natural result of the many minds of many men , and editors , however encyclopaedic and diplomatic , can hardly equalize or adjudi - cate individual differences .

		The inclusion of disciplines -- such as law or biology -- that offer a direct contribution to the general con - tent and conceptions of philosophy , is eminently proper ; but the inclusion in a philosophical dictionary of terms under these heads without such philosophical bearing seems very ques - tionable .

		A work that passes from '' Admiralty Jurisdiction '' to '' Antenna '' seems almost too comprehensive : and surely neither psycholo - gist nor biologist nor student of law seems likely to look for such terms in a dictionary of philosophy .

		That there are occasional lapses from the spirit of the editor 's Introduction will not surprise the editor .

		The skeleton form of exposition is now and then to be met with , and sometimes in important articles .

		The article on '' Binocular Vision '' tells almost nothing , and may be contrasted with the article on the '' Blind-spot '' -- a far less extensive term but one occupying more space and satis - factorily outlined .

		Two other faults of defini - tion are also to be met with : the one the securing of a brief definition at the cost of extreme technicality ; the other the lack of brevity by reason of trying to describe too much in the definition .

		The first is unfair to the student who goes to the work for enlight - enment ; the other is unfair to the scholar who goes to the dictionary for a terse formulation of conceptions already familiar .

		Of the latter the only available definition given under '' An - alogy '' is an example : it is introduced by the word '' briefly , '' and then goes on to the extent of seventy-two words , arranged intelligently enough , but by no means cogently .

		But when all is said and done , these faults are distinctly of a minor order , and are not frequent enough to mar the general excellence of the whole .

		The plan and scope of the dictionary are conceived in an admirable spirit ; and the work will doubtless promptly find its way to the shelves of our libraries and studies as the standard work of its kind .

		It remains to add that the work will appear in three volumes , of which the first -- including from A to Law -- covers 644 pages ; that the third volume will supplement the introductory bibliographies given under the several terms by more com - prehensive and classified bibliographical lists ; and that in mechanism and convenience the volume leaves nothing to be desired .

		IfrSETEENTH CKXTURT lilTERATTJKE .

		* It is now just thirty years since Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	began , in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, to deliver a series of lectures upon European literature .

		These lectures were continued for about ten years , and constituted a survey of the whole modern intellectual movement , as it found ex - pression in the literature of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, from the time of the French Revolution down to about the middle of the century just ended .

		As one phase after another of this survey was completed by the lecturer , the results were published in a series of vol - umes bearing the general title of '' Main Cur - rents in Nineteenth Century Literature '' -LRB- Hovedstromninger i det Nittende Aarhund - redes Literatur -RRB- .

		Six volumes were produced altogether , the whole constituting a truly monu - mental work of combined literary history and criticism -- certainly one of the half-dozen most important critical works of the century .

		Few readers outside of the Scandinavian conn - tries could benefit by a work written in the Danish language , but German translations were promptly made , and in this form the vol - umes of '' Hauptstrbmungen '' have for the
past quarter	DATE	- century been an indispensable part of the apparatus of every worker in the field of modern European literature .

		For many years it has been to us a source of wonderment that so important a work should have remained untranslated into our own language ; now , a full score of years from the date of its com - pletion , the work is to appear in English , and the first volume has recently been issued .

		He goes on to say : '' The six different literary groups it is my intention to represent may be looked on as six acts of a great play .

		In the first group , the French Emigrant Liter - ature inspired by
Rousseau	PERSON	, the reaction begins , but here the reactionary are still everywhere mingled with the revolutionary currents .

		In the second group , the semi-Catholic Romantic school of
Germany	LOCATION	, the reaction is on the increase ; it is more vigorous and holds itself more aloof from the contemporary struggle for progress and liberty .

		The third group , consisting of such men as
Joseph de Maistre	PERSON	, Lamennais in his strictly ortho - dox period ,
Lamartine	PERSON	and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	when they -LRB- after the restoration of the monarchy -RRB- were still mainstays of the Legitimist and Clerical party , repre - sents the militant , triumphant reaction .

		Byron and his English contemporaries form the fourth group .

		It is this one man ,
Byron	PERSON	, who produces the revulsion in the great drama .

		The Greek war of liberation breaks out , a revivifying breeze blows over
Europe	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	falls like a hero in the cause of
Greece	LOCATION	, and his death makes a tremendous impression on all the productive minds of the Continent .

		Shortly before the Revolution of
July	DATE	a change of front occurs among the great authors of
France	LOCATION	; they form the French Romantic school , which is our fifth group , a new Liberal movement on the rolls of whose adherents we find such names as
Lamennais	LOCATION	, Hugo ,
Lamartine	LOCATION	, Musset ,
George Sand	PERSON	, etc. .

		The movement passes from
France	LOCATION	into
Germany	LOCATION	, and in that country also Liberal ideas are victorious .

		The writers forming the sixth and last group which I shall depict .

		Young
Germany	LOCATION	, are inspired by the ideas of the Greek war of liberation and the Revolution of
July	DATE	, and , like the French authors , see in
Byron	LOCATION	's great shade the leader of the Liberal movement .

		The authors of
Young Germany	LOCATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	, Borne ,
Gutzkow	LOCATION	,
Ruge	PERSON	,
Feuerbach	PERSON	, etc. , prepare , together with the contempor - ary French authors , the great upheaval of
1848	DATE	. ''

		Such was the ambitious programme of the young Danish doctor of philosophy when he began to lecture in his capital city
thirty years ago	DATE	.

		Here was a conception of literature cal - culated fairly to take the breath away from the mere aesthetician .

		Here was a critic who believed literature to be intimately and vitally connected with human life and with the his - torical development of the social organism .

		That there should be no mistake concerning the author 's enlarged conception of literary history , he more than once , in the course of his lectures , emphasized his purpose of bringing literature into its proper relations with life .

		A fine passage in the second series gives us a typical expression of the attitude which he throughout maintains . ''

		It follows from my conception of the relation of literature to life that the history of literature I teach is not a history of literature for the drawing-room .

		I seize hold of actual life with all the strength I may , and show how the feelings that find their expression in literature spring up in the human heart .

		Now the human heart is no stagnant pool or idyllic woodland lake .

		It is an ocean with submarine vegetation and frightful inhabitants .

		The literary history and the poetry of the drawing-room see in the life of man a salon , a decorated ball-room , the men and the furnish - ings polished alike , in which no dark corners escape illumination .

		Let him who will look at matters from this point of view , but it is no affair of mine . ''

		The preparation of a work undertaken in this spirit evidently called for an unusual equip - ment on the part of its author .

		He must have philosophical breadth of view , an unerring in - stinct for the typical as distinguished from the accidental , and a frank acceptance of the con - clusions of modern thought .

		It is not too much to say that the completed work justifies its ambitious programme , and that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has proved himself one of the soundest of criti - cal historians .

		The very matters which aroused violent controversies at the time when his lec - tures were delivered are those which to-day , after the lapse of a quarter-century , appear of the most vital importance .

		Most literary criti - cism is apt to seem a little old-fashioned a gen - eration after it is produced , and it is a striking tribute to the author 's large conception of lit - erature and life that , except for a few details , his work remains essentially true in perspective and convincing in exposition .

		In some respects it seems truer and more convincing than it could have seemed in the seventies , when critical tradition weighed heavily upon men 's judgments , and the author 's voice was as of one crying in the wilderness .

		Let us take one of his boldest pronouncements as an illustration .

		It took more courage than it would take to-day for a young man thirty years ago to write the following lines : * ' I believe that the time will come when
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Iphigenia will not be considered appreciably more Greek than
Racine	LOCATION	's , when it will be discovered that the German Iphigenia 's dignified morality is as German as the French Iphigenia 's graceful refinement is French .

		... The spirit of the French people resembles the Greek spirit in its absolute freedom from awkwardness , its love of lightness , elegance , form and colour , passion and dramatic life .

		No reasonable person would dream of ranking the French with the Greeks .

		The distance between them is so great as to be practically unmeasur - able .

		Still one must maintain their right to the place of honour against those who assert that the Germans stand nearer to the Greeks .

		... If
France	LOCATION	is far from being a
Greece	LOCATION	in art ,
Germany	LOCATION	is still farther .

		Of all the gods and goddesses of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, the Germans have only succeeded in acclimatising one --
Pallas Athene	PERSON	, and in
Germany	LOCATION	she wears spectacles .

		Mme. de Stael might have observed to
Schlegel	PERSON	that an Athene with spectacles is not much more beautiful than a
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	with a wig . ''

		The best criticism , we believe , has in our

		279 time come around to substantially this view , but how strangely the words must have sounded to their first Teutonic hearers .

		The volume now published , as has already been stated , deals with what Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	calls the '' emigrant literature . ''

		He means by this the literature of opposition to the Napoleonic order , whether legitimist or liberal , and he calls it '' emigrant literature '' because in those days '' it was only far from
Paris	LOCATION	, in lonely country places , where he lived a life of death - like stillness , or beyond the frontier , in
Swit	PERSON	- zerland ,
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, or
North America	LOCATION	, that the French man of letters pursued his calling . ''

		After noting the profound influence of '' La Nouvelle Heloise '' and '' Werther '' upon the literature of the period , the author takes up the special group of writers which includes Chateaubriand , Senancour , Nodier , Constant , and
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	.

		An account of
Barante	ORGANIZATION	's retrospective view of eighteenth cen - tury literature completes the survey .

		The group at first sight seems to have little unity , but Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	provides the philosophical nexus , and we close the volume with the feeling that he has justified his design .

		He shows also how these writers were the logical pre - cursors of those who came after them . ''

		Looked at from one point of view , this group pre - pares the way for the later religious and political reaction in French literature ; looked at from another , it prepares the way for the
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		It is the best of introductions to the study and under - standing of the
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	, it has even points of contact with such remote phenomena as
Byron	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		In a word , the Emigrant Literature constitutes the prologue to the great literary drama of the century . ''

		him at a moment of depressed fortune in the North , and he made up his mind forthwith to seek employment in this new field .

		Nothing but discouragement followed his efforts to ob - tain work from the
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	papers , so he set out for
Cape Town	LOCATION	with a little borrowed money , hoping to find some local journal which needed his services .

		After a series of experiences which would have discouraged an older man , or anyone less self-reliant , Mr. linger found himself at the front as the authorized correspondent of the
Grahamstown	LOCATION	'' Daily Mail , '' with a certain minor connection with the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' gained through the good offices of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	; but these commissions were not ob - tained until after desperation had forced him to offer his services to the British Crown as a member of a command which required the ability to ride well and shoot straight .

		Mr.
Unger	PERSON	could do neither , and is doubtless glad that he was so promptly found out and rejected .

		He was at the battle of
Paardeburg	LOCATION	, the occu - pation of
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	, attached himself to General French 's column in pursuit of General DeWet after witnessing the capture of
Cronje	PERSON	and the battle of
Poplar Grove	ORGANIZATION	; and , while taking part in the general advance upon Pre - toria , received a commission from the
London	LOCATION	'' Express '' and
New York	LOCATION	'' Journal '' to pro- ceed to the capital of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		By a bit of bravado Mr.
Unger	PERSON	succeeded in passing through the Portuguese territory , and was soon busily engaged in ingratiating himself with the Boer authorities , just as he had done a few months before with the British .

		He was for many days after the occupancy of
Pretoria	LOCATION	and the transfer of the seat of gov - ernment to Machadodorp the only source of news received in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	from the burgher government , and it was he who announced to the world President
Krueger	PERSON	's determination to go on fighting without refer - ence to the loss of
Pretoria	LOCATION	and
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	-- a determination which seems to have found some of its inspiration in our own War of In - dependence , so far does a good deed shine in a naughty world .

		Mr.
Unger	PERSON	relates a con - versation which he had with Secretary
Reitz	PERSON	, whom he found studying a child 's history of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		• I 've been reading here , ' went on Mr.
Reitz	PERSON	, be - tween successive puffs of smoke , ' all about your Revo - lutionary War , and I find it is extremely interesting ; and what 's more , so very encouraging to us at this time .

		Look here , ' and he began to turn the pages ; ' I read here that in the
winter of 1777	DATE	, when your General 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
Washington	LOCATION	was at
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	, near
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, his army was reduced to only fifteen hundred in num - ber , and he knew the name of every man under him , and that at the same time the English held your prin - cipal cities of
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The com - parison between that time and our present situation is so very striking and so much in our favor that I feel greatly encouraged .

		You see , this is our
winter	DATE	, and our burghers are suffering severely ; the British have possession of all our principal cities --
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	,
Johannesburg	LOCATION	, and
Pretoria	LOCATION	, -- yet we have a fairly com - fortable capital here at
Machadodorp	LOCATION	; our armies have plenty of supplies , and , though scattered , they number at least fifteen thousand men , and their hearts are full of hope and determination .

		Do n't you see how much better off , in comparison , than you were , we are in this our darkest hour .

		And yet you won your liberty and independence ; and I think we will also , for I know we are in the right , and I believe God will help us ! '

		And the old man looked intently at me , his eyes glistening , his entire being radiating belief and complete confidence in what he was saying . ''

		What an appeal to my school-boy enthusiasm and patriotism !

		I felt tears coming to my eyes ; I sought in vain for something to say to encourage and comfort the old statesman and patriot sitting beside me , his eyes sparkling with hope and enthusiasm as he talked and turned over the pages of that familiar school-book .

		Then , as I thought how my country , where almost every man and woman and school-child within its boundaries were watching this unequal struggle , half a world away , with sympathy for one contestant and anger for the other , our own hereditary enemy -- as I thought how my country had stood aloof , her administration crying Neutrality !

		neutrality !

		while with her left hand she allowed and encouraged the selling of millions worth of horses and forage to
England	LOCATION	to use in the war , and with her right hand refused to insist on the enforcement of neutrality on the part of
Portugal	LOCATION	where American supplies for the burghers were being wrongly detained in the customs-house , that the armies of the Republics might be starved into submission -- as these things passed through my mind I grew sad and sick at heart . ''

		Mr.
Reitz	PERSON	assured Mr.
Unger	PERSON	that the burghers could hold out six months longer , and the sequel proves that they have been able to ex - tend that time already more than eleven months , with prospects of an almost indefinite extension , completely justifying President
Krueger	PERSON	's statement to Mr.
Unger	PERSON	on
June 5 , 1900	DATE	, '' We will never surrender as long as five hundred armed men remain together . ''

		Nor will the difficulties be ended when the last of the burghers lay down their arms , if ever they do .

		One of the government officials told Mr.
Unger	PERSON	at
Machadodorp	ORGANIZATION	this story : '' The -LSB-
Transvaal	LOCATION	-RSB- government originally leased the mines -LSB- about
Johannesburg	LOCATION	-RSB- with the provision that if at any time they should remain unworked for a period of six months the leases would revert to the government .

		Of course , the beginning of the war put a stop to all mining operations , and when the war was six months old the government privately sold the reverted leases to French and German capitalists .

		Now when the war is officially declared over , these capitalists , through their governments , will insist on their claims , and all sorts of unpleasant complications for
England	ORGANIZATION	will be the result .

		Nothing will be done in this matter until the war is entirely at an end , for the Powers desire that
England	LOCATION	shall have expended as much of her re - sources as possible in her contest with the Republics .

		...
England	LOCATION	will certainly object to surrendering the mines , and then the trouble will begin , '' As Mr.
Unger	PERSON	adds , it will be interesting to remember this phase of the complication .

		The post at
Machadodorp	ORGANIZATION	was abandoned a short time before President
Krueger	PERSON	took ship for
Holland	LOCATION	, Mr.
Unger	PERSON	finding it a difficult one .

		His sympathies seem to have been divided between the two contestants in such a manner that he was able to avoid much of the prejudice in favor of either .

		This is not shown in his final chapter , however , where he gives credence to the British tale of a general conspiracy on the part of the Afrikander Bund to drive the English out of
South Africa	LOCATION	, in the face of the authorities to the contrary ; and his state - ment that the aims of the
United States	LOCATION	and

		Still , this attitude makes the book one from which both sides can obtain en - lightenment ; and his parting advice to the victors , to use their victory honestly and avoid pressing toward the total extinction of the Re - publics , is undeniably sound .

		In addition to its presentation of the serious side of the war and its diplomacy , there are scores of entertaining anecdotes in the book concerning the men with whom Mr.
Unger	PERSON	was brought in contact during his sojourn in
Africa	LOCATION	, including several of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, who seems to have been something more than a leader and benefactor to the British soldier .

		The Opinions of a Statesman .

		* When one considers the methods by which political parties choose the men who fill our offices and manage our public affairs , and the kind of men who pull the wires that bring about nominations , it is a cause of profound satisfaction as well as of wonder that our highest office has been filled by a succession of men of ability and honor , of whom we have good reason to be proud .

		It is really a most striking tribute to the insight and discrimination of the mass ♦ Views OF AN Ex-President , By
Benjamin Harrison	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL .

		281 of our voters , with perhaps a wholesome ad - mixture of fear of the independent minority whom the party managers can not count on to vote as they dictate , that the men nominated for the office of president are worthy in char - acter and ability to stand at the head of a great nation .

		And it is interesting to see how men who have been rated as second class by their opponents , if not by their friends , have risen to meet their responsibilities , and have given the nation no cause for shame ; and to see what unsuspected gifts lay concealed in some politicians who had been long in promi - nent positions before the people .

		While these remarks are not intended to apply especially to Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, they are illustrated in a way by the volume under con - sideration .

		It is made up of his papers and addresses on subjects of public interest written after the close of his administration in
1893	DATE	.

		The collection shows an earnest devotion to the public good , a sound wisdom on public ques - tions , and a felicity of presentation , that make the volume an admirable memorial of a distin - guished public servant .

		First in the book come six lectures on the origins of the Constitution , delivered at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	in
1894	DATE	.

		They go over ground that is familiar to every student of our history , but they have a distinct value in their clear statement of the principles of development of our institutions , a power which the distinguished author developed through a long course of speaking to popular audiences in political campaigns .

		His treatment of the well-worn subject is also enriched by his famil - iarity with the practical affairs of government gained through senatorial discussions and law - making , and through the intense labors of ad - ministration incident to his position at the head of the nation .

		The lectures bear on their face the evidence that they are not the work of a professional scholar , but rather of a prac - tical man of scholarly tastes ; the general reader will find no disadvantage in this .

		The first lecture discusses the vital principles of the Constitution , partly as inherited through ages of national growth in
England	LOCATION	, and partly as the result of a combination of these inherited principles with the religious , social , and physical conditions of the new world .

		The author rightly makes much of the influence of Puritanism in the development of our national character through
New England	LOCATION	; of the fidelity to con - viction that it bred ; of the ideas of freedom and equality as a result of the levelling doe - trine of the equality of man in the sight of God ; of the individual 's right to decide what things were
Caesar	PERSON	's and what things were God 's ; and of the doctrine that king and sub - ject were brothers equally insignificant in the sight of God .

		He shows also the influence of unstinted land upon the character of the people , of the nearness of hostile savages , and of the simplicity and absence of distinctions of the life of the colonists .

		The lecture closes with a discussion of local government both as a tra - ditional principle among Englishmen , and as a necessity under the conditions prevailing in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The nature of the other five lectures is in - dicated sufficiently by their titles : The Co - lonial Charters , Legal Aspects of the
Contro	PERSON	- versy between the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, Early Attempts at
Union	ORGANIZATION	and the
Union De Facto	ORGANIZATION	, The Confederation , and
The Institution of State Governments	ORGANIZATION	.

		Next follow three papers into which the vet - eran statesman evidently put his whole heart , which , though they have been violently criti - cized for their political bearings , yet show a statesman 's grasp of fundamental principles as applied to great political questions at home and abroad .

		These papers were published in the `` North American Review '' early in the present year , and are yet so fresh in the public mind that there is now no need of a synopsis of them .

		The author may have belonged to a generation that is too old to reverse its long - cherished ideas as to the nature of our govern - ment and its relation to the territory that lies beyond immediate reach , a generation that is beyond the point where it can change its con - ception of the Constitution even at the bidding of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, -- especially when the reasoning of that court does not command con - fidence .

		But we can not but honor him for his courage in opposing the policy of the party that had highly honored him , and in striking sturdy blows for those principles that he be - lieved vital to the welfare of the nation that he loved ; and we must recognize the strength of argument and ardent patriotism that we see in the
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	address on '' The Status of Annexed Territory '' and in the `` Musings on Current Topics . ''

		The second part of the book contains , besides a legal argument on '' The Inheritance Tax Cases '' and several brief occasional addresses , the strong address on '' Some Hindrances to Law Reforms '' given to the students of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, and the similar one 282 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, on `` The Obligations of Wealth '' spoken be - fore the
Union League Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	on
Washington	LOCATION	's Birthday .

		Both are striking appeals to the conscience of the people to ex - tirpate from the body politic an evil that threat - ens to corrupt our public life at its source , and one that offers most encouragement to pub - lic lawlessness .

		This evil is the corrupt use of wealth to prevent reforms aimed at the unright - eous advantages that such wealth holds and uses to take more than its share of the products of industry or the gifts of nature ; and the twin evil of robbing the people by avoiding just taxes , and thus compelling others to bear more than their share of public burdens for the ben - efit of those most able to pay .

		If the earnest and weighty words of this tried public servant could only reach and touch this class of public robbers , respectable men though many of them are , he would be a public benefactor indeed .

		The inspiring addresses delivered by Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	as president of the
Ecumenical Missionary Conference	ORGANIZATION	last year are worthy of special note .

		Nowhere has he shown greater felicity of expression or greater nobility of ideas and spirit than in these brief utterances .

		It is necessary to speak , unpleasant though it may be , of the great change of tone that becomes evident in turning from the sincere and earnest speeches that show a wise statesman and good man at his best , to the few partisan addresses and articles contained in the book .

		Instead of deep indignation at corruption and at what he deemed destructive public policy , we have the politician 's professional and perfunctory indig - nation at the policy and alleged corruption of the other party .

		Instead of the statesman 's and the lawyer 's sound reasoning , we have the poli - tician 's fallacies of half-truths and the poli - tician 's misrepresentation of the men and measures on the other side .

		As stump speeches these papers serve the purpose , but they make a sorry showing beside the dignified and sound contents of the volume .

Abelard	ORGANIZATION	, and the interest which we have in him is many-sided .

		As the lover of
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	his name is immortal in romance ; as the keenest dialectician of his age he is of import - ance in the history of philosophy ; and as an ad - vanced thinker on matters of religion he reached conclusions which , rejected by the church of his day , have become the fundamentals of modern theology .

		That up to the present time we have had , in English , no satisfactory life of so remark - able a man is more than strange , but now Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	's volume -LRB- Putnam -RRB- atones ex - ceptionally well for the deficiency .

		The story of the brilliant controversialist 's career is one of ab - sorbing interest , dramatic , full of striking incidents , glowing with the warmth of an ardent and high - hearted personality , and Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	has made the most of its possibilities .

		Thoroughly familiar with the philosophical and ecclesiastical discussions of the time , and with the characters of those who were shaping men 's lives then , as he shows himself to be , he makes the men and the movements , the passions and purposes that stirred them , clear and convincingly real at once .

		From the beginning the interest centres in the man rather than in his ideas ; and for this reason , perhaps , the reader not famil - iar with the wranglings of the schoolmen may sometimes , like little
Peterkin	PERSON	, wish to know what it was all about .

		This , however , will be true of details only ; the general course of
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	's rea - soning , the basic principles of his thought , are made sufficiently clear , and more than this might easily have interrupted the rapid movement of the story .

		As it is , the misfortunes of a life devoted to truth in an age of ecclesiastical tyranny are full of a pathos which is heightened by the strangely sweet and enduring love of
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	, whom Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	portrays with singularly clear and true penetration .

		So manifestly unjust and cruel were the persecu - tions that chastened
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	's eager spirit towards the last sad days among the monks at
St. Marcellus	LOCATION	that the indignant reader will be tempted to repeat his heart-wrung question , '' Good Jesus , where wert Thou ? ''

		For readers of all classes , the writer 's sympathy with his subject will be found infectious , and both for its scholarly and for its human inter - est the book should be widely read by those who care to trace the development of the human spirit .

		An authoritative The price placed upon the sumptuous exposition of first edition of Mr.
H. C. Marillier	PERSON	's RossettiU art .

		`` Illustrated Memorial of the Art and Life of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	'' was prohibitive to the impecunious , and Rossettians of slender purse could but await in patience the appearance of a cheaper edition , which usually follows in due course the first publication of such a book .

		After nearly two years the work is now issued -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in a form which , though by no means inexpensive , may be had for considerably less than half the price of the original edition .

		Of books dealing with
Ros	PERSON	- setti the man there are enough , -- more than enough , perhaps , -- and Mr.
Marillier	PERSON	has not sought to add another to the list .

		His volume is essentially an account of

		In critical soundness , thoroughness , and manner of presenta -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 tion , the work leaves little to be desired .

		It was readily accepted on its first appearance as the aa - thoritative account of
Rossetti	PERSON	's art , and we are not likely ever to have a better .

		In addition to the correction of some minor errors of statement , the present edition has been considerably abridged in both text and illustrations .

		The excisions are such , however , as only the closest student of
Rossetti	PERSON	's work need miss .

		They consist mainly , in the text , of some of the detailed descriptions of particular works ; and the chronological list of pictures , one of the most valuable features of the book , now appears without the historical notes .

		As regards the illus - trations , the absence of some important pictures , notably several from Mr.
Rae	PERSON	's fine collection , is explained by the fact that arrangements with the owners of originals made it impossible to include reproductions in any other than the first edition .

		But even with these omissions , the pictorial equip - ment is lavish indeed .

		There are twelve finely - executed photogravures , no less than eighty full - page plates in half-tone , and a number of line illustrations in the text .

		The frontispiece is a beautiful photogravure from
Rossetti	PERSON	's masterpiece , `` The Beloved , '' -- a painting which , to quote Mr.
F. G. Stephens	PERSON	, '' is in English art what Spenser 's gorgeous and passionate '
Epithalamium	PERSON	' is in English verse . ''

		A very full index makes Mr.
Marillier	PERSON	's splendid volume readily accessible for purposes of reference .

		Recognition of the rights of dumb animals is one of the gifts for which mankind may thank the vanishing nineteenth century , and one of the advances of civilization of which we have great cause to be proud .

		Not the least of the bequests of that time to this is to be found in the beautiful book by the late
Hermon Lee Ensign	ORGANIZATION	, just published under the title of ''
Lady Lee	PERSON	, and Other Animal Stories '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The author was born in
Carbondale	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
June 30 , 1849	DATE	.

		but his boyhood and early youth were passed in
Bureau	LOCATION	county ,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		At the age of twenty-one he removed to
Chicago	LOCATION	, in which city
several years later	DATE	he aided in the establishment of '' The Alliance , '' a weekly journal of great promise and short life .

		With the experi - ence gained here , the young man took up the busi - ness of advertising , and soon amassed a competency , a successful invention or two adding to his wealth .

		From infancy a lover of animals , he gave freely during his lifetime to the various societies for the prevention of cruelty to beasts and the humbler creatures , and
The National Humane Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, to which he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune , was of his own institution .

		Always a lover of his pen , he left behind a mass of literary material at his untimely death in
February , 1899	DATE	, from which has been selected the stories contained in this pleasant volume .

		As might be expected , the ten little tales which make up the book are informed with a genial and tender love for animated things , and bespeak Some notable ttorie * of animcU life .

		a consideration and forbearance which make them the best of reading .

		In almost every case the old , old lesson is repeated which proves that kindness is the best policy , and that all greed and selfishness works to its own undoing .

		All of the stories , in - terpreting the characters of the lower animals in terms of our own character as they do , have just claim to be considered literature in the fine sense of the word , the simplicity and sincerity of the author 's style leaving the matter beyond doubt .

		A word should be said for the excellent illustrations which have been provided for the book by Messrs.
Max F. Klepper	PERSON	,
J. Carter Beard	ORGANIZATION	,
Jay Hambidge	PERSON	, and
Will H. Drake	PERSON	, rounding it oat into a thor - oughly worthy whole .

		jg ^ straightforward account of the King who consecrated monarchy in
France	LOCATION	, making it in fact , as it was by tradition , the fountain of justice .

		To write a successful biography of one , the outlines of whose personality seem so familiar even if they are often actually vague , is not an easy task .

		The chief difficulty is one of proportion .

		During the minority of the
King	LOCATION	there were several feudal uprisings which at times seriously threatened the monarchy , and would have crippled it but for the energy and tact of his mother , Blanche of
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tile .

		If these are related with much detail , the reader is fatigued by the necessity of understanding the feudal geography of
France	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , he quite loses from sight the subject of the tale .

		At times it seems as if Mr.
Perry	PERSON	had committed this fault .

		At least a more general treatment of the incidents of the Regency would have brought his readers more quickly to the subject they expect to study , -- that is to say ,
Louis	LOCATION	IX .

		himself , and the meaning of his career in the history of
France	LOCATION	.

		A similar difficulty arises in the treatment of the Crusades in which the
King	PERSON	took part , although here it is not so great because these were manifes - tations of his own character .

		Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's account of them is clear and interesting .

		It would have been fortunate had he given a proportionately greater attention to the development of institutions during the King 's career , because this was even more characteristic of
St. Louis	LOCATION	as a monarch .

		The successes which he won against the barons were merely symptoms of the general change which in his day became evident and by which the monarchy began to dwarf even the greatest of the feudatories .

		Consequently the change itself , and not its symp - toms , should be the theme of such a work .

		The first four volumes of '' The Artists ' Library '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , pub - lished under the general editorship of Mr.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	, have been put forth , and may be said to supply a want which has long been felt by an art-loving public .

		Each of the volumes is the work of an accepted authority , and consists 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of a biographical and critical discussion upon some painter of repute , followed by numerous reproduc - tions in half-tone and photogravure , or half-tone and color , of typical works from the artist 's hand .

		The first volume of the series is by Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	, and deals with the great Japanese popularly known as
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	.

		A general consideration of the pictorial art of
Japan	LOCATION	precedes this account of one of its most influential practitioners .

		Hokusai was born at
Yedo	ORGANIZATION	in
1760	DATE	, and after a life of vicissi - tude , marked throughout by a noble devotion to the true spirit of art , he died in his ninetieth year with the prayer , '' If Heaven had only granted me five more years I could have become a real painter . ''

		The second volume , by Mr.
Roger E. Fry	PERSON	, deals with
Giovanni Bellini	PERSON	, and discusses the conditions existent in
Venice	LOCATION	previous to the artist 's birth in
1432	DATE	.

		Bellini lived until
1516	DATE	, dividing his years between the city of his birth and its appurtenant
Padua	LOCATION	.

T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	has prepared the volume on

1480	DATE	, like
Bellini	PERSON	the son of a painter of re - pute .

		He removed to
Ratisbon	LOCATION	, where he lived in ease and dignity until his death in
1538	DATE	.

		The last of the four volumes now published deals with Fran - cisco Jos ^ de
Goya	ORGANIZATION	, whose work is sympathetically treated by Mr.
W. Rothenstein	PERSON	.

		This distinguished painter was born in Fuendetodos , near
Saragossa	LOCATION	, in
1746	DATE	, of humble parentage .

		He was a born rebel , driven in early life from
Madrid	LOCATION	by his independ - ence of political and religious expression .

		He studied in
Rome	LOCATION	and returned to the Spanish capi - tal to be accepted as a leader by the younger men .

		Attaining all the honor possible in his native land , he went to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1822	DATE	, aided in the great romantic movement then on foot in
France	LOCATION	, and died in
Bordeaux	LOCATION	in
1828	DATE	.

		All the four painters treated of expressed themselves also as draughts - men or etchers , and examples of their work in all the media adopted add greatly to the value of the illustrations .

		These , it should be added , are numer - ous , not less than twenty in any instance .

		The great success which attended the ZlntJL i ```` `` e of `` The Butterfly Book '' pre - sages a warm welcome to another volume of the series , `` The Insect Book '' -LRB- Double - day ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr. L. 0 .

		Howard , Chief of
the Division of Entomology	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a popular yet authoritative and quite comprehensive account of the ants , bees , wasps , grasshoppers , bugs , flies , and many other North American insects .

		This volume is especially rich in the natural history of these animals , and offers a mine of information concern - ing the wonderful facts of the insect world not pre - viously accessible to the general reader .

		Life - histories , habits , and the relations which insects bear to agriculture and other forms of industry , are copiously treated ; while the large field still await - ing investigation and unknown as yet even to scientists is constantly brought to the reader 's notice .

		The book will thus bring a legitimate stimulus to the nature-study movement , and in its perspective of relative values and its maintenance of interest it may well serve as a model for writers who seek to popularize other fields of science .

		Simple directions for collecting and preserving in - sects , and keys for the determination of the larger groups , together with suggestive bibliographies and abundant illustrations , will assist those who wish to begin the study of insects with the aid of this book .

		The sixteen colored plates by the colorotype pro- cess , taken from the actual insects themselves , demonstrate the availability of this valuable pro- cess of illustration for other forms than butterflies .

		It is to be hoped that the Moth and the Beetle books will soon follow .

		It is a good biography of the Boswellian sort , and though the author leaves to others the more attractive field of generalization , and contents himself with the grouping of facts , we are given a comprehen - sive view of the life of the most popular composer
England	LOCATION	has ever known .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	was born of musical parents in
London	LOCATION	on
May 13 , 1842	DATE	, and first came into public notice when fourteen years of age as the successful candidate for the Men - delssohn Scholarship at the

W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	was that of many another strug - gling and ambitious composer .

		Then came the '' Pinafore , '' -- after which the career of Gilbert and
Sullivan	PERSON	is too well known to bear repetition j yet in writing of the collaborators it seems difficult to avoid the temptation to digress into the endles * successes with which they were associated .

		Not - withstanding the success of his vocal works , in - cluding his well-known hymns , it is as a composer of orchestral music that Sir
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	will be remembered longest .

		The last work he ever composed , and which he finished almost on hi '' death-bed , was a '' Te Deum , '' intended to be sung ^ at
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's on the termination of the war in

		The author enforces his straightforward argument by many apt illus - trations and some new points of view , seeking throughout to maintain the supremacy of natural selection as the dominant force in the diversification of life , and discrediting the Lamarckian factors of exercise , environment , and effort .

		THE DIAL 285 drama of development , a part limited the more narrowly by heredity as evolution advances .

		In his later chapters the application is made to the problems of human progress , the argument being carried to its logical conclusion as regards conscious - ness , the moral sense , and religion .

		The physical degeneration of man which has resulted from the suspension in civilized life of the rigorous weeding process of natural selection , is counterbalanced by the higher morality attained ; and the author sug - gests that this physical degeneration may find its ultimate correction in the moral and religious mo - tives which will make the propagation of misery and weakness a sin .

		The great unprogressive people -- the Chinese -- will eventually , according to our author , take their place among civilized nations in accordance with this inevitable law of evolution .

		The tenor of the work is thus optimistic and whole - some , though vigorously partisan for one of the con - tending schools of evolutionary thought .

		It deals with some of the most pressing problems of the hour in terms of the prevailing mode of thought , and is a work of unusual power and attractiveness for the thinking reader .

		If it is true , as another historian of American literature has lately said , that '' current criticism tends perceptibly to depreciate our native literature , '' Mr.

Maurus Jokai	PERSON	's novel , '' There Is a God , '' together with such comment on the religious and social aspects of the life treated as seems to be called for .

		The novel is a setting of Unitarian purity and idealism in
Transylvania	LOCATION	against the background of Catholic corruption , worldliness , and insincerity as found in
Rome	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	in the first half of the present century .

		Inevitably the story loses in vividness and dramatic power , and this study of a novel of purpose becomes valuable mainly for the light it throws on social and religious con - ditions in a part of the world with which we have been but little acquainted .

		A style with more of color would have helped in the telling ; but the mixture of politics , love , religion , and intrigue is interesting in spite of the baldness of the author 's literary art .

		Since that time many important

		In form , this set of books is a little like the '' Temple Classics . ''

Ralph Comior	PERSON	' a inimitable minert of '' Black Bock '' and eovboy * of '' The Sky Pilot '' will giTe * cordial welcome to his lumbermen in '' The Man from Olengarry . ''

		It is a wild scene in the
Oreat Northland	LOCATION	, its rough-hewn shanties and log-jams , but not so wild as the tumult in the hearts .

		The strong current of the river farther down was not more mighty in its peace than those same hearts under the influence of a woman , an angel of mercy to the hardy pioneers .

		Among them stands out in bold relief '' The Man from Glengarry . ''

		At first a turbulent boy , whose sturdy Scotch blood boQs as did that of his Covenanter ancestors .

		The boy becomes a man .

		The sledge-hammer blows remain .

		The action is not less rigorous .

		He fights the great fight that strong men must put up if they would retain their manhood .

		The control of self develops the boyhood charm into a maturity of character which once known can never be forgotten .

		It is full of local color , and the types of Scottish Highlander , French Canadian , and American character form a vivid picture drawn by a master hand .

		BRIEFER MENTION 327 NOTES 328 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 329 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 329 WOMAN A ND T HE ESSAY .

		At first thought , it might seem that if there is one field of literature more than another in which women are likely to excel , that field would be the light essay .

		But the facts show precisely the contrary .

		There is no lack of articles , profound , clever , and able , written by women on all manner of subjects .

		Miss Scud - der , Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	, are but a few out of the many American women whose names come readily to mind as writers of philosophical , historical , biographical , or practical papers .

		But for critical essays m light vein , such as those of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	, or for those on life and society cor - responding to the essays of
Stevenson	PERSON	, or to the short papers of
George William Curtis	PERSON	,
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, and Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	, we shall look in vain among women writers .

		We have , in truth , no women essayists .

		Miss Repplier might perhaps be cited as an exception ; but though undeniably clever , she is overweighted by her voluminous reading , and lacks both of the indispensable qualities of the essayist .

		For whether the essay be as keen in insight and as subtle in interpretation as
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's on Leonardo da
Vinci	LOCATION	, or as simple as
Warner	ORGANIZATION	's in the '' Editor 's Drawer , '' its essen - tial charms are to be looked for in the indi - viduality and style of the writer .

		In other forms of literature the author may project his work from himself , and literary finish is not so indispensable ; but the essay must have the flavor of personality and the distinction of style .

		In both of these requisites the work of women is lacking .

		There are no papers writ - ten by women in which we feel the attraction of individuality , and no woman has yet written in the English language who can be said to have literary style in the sense in which it can fairly be claimed for fifty or more men among living or recent writers .

		Do we find such slight indications of per - sonality in the writings of women because they have less individuality than men ?

		A writer in one of the leading periodicals a few years ago was at some pains to prove this to be the ease .

		But granting a measure of truth in the hypothesis , there are other possible explana - tions for the fact that women show little per - sonality in their writings .

		Women are at once more self-conscious and more conventional than men .

		They may be spontaneous and individual in an intimate cor - respondence , but in anything more public they rarely show their real selves freely and natur - ally .

		Probably the desire for self-revelation is stronger in women than in men , but there is always a pose in conscious efforts to communi - cate one 's self , whether the striver be a
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	or a
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		It is only when , in self-forgetfulness , one says straight out what he genuinely thinks and feels , that he becomes 310 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, personally interesting .

		This , women never do , and apparently can not do .

		They do not seem to know how to let go of themselves , and either practice severe self-repression , or else they at - titudinize , or become unduly confidential and familiar with their public .

		Probably another reason why the short , bright essay , dealing cleverly with men and things , is not written by women , lies in the incompatibility between the feminine tempera - ment and the tone of the essay .

		Women are by nature partisans .

		They take themselves and their views too seriously to handle a sub - ject with humor and impartiality .

		The attitude of the disinterested spectator is impossible to the sex .

		Rarely do we find a woman who is both a keen and a tolerant observer of life .

		In fact , the knowledge of life which constitutes the recognized background of the essayist is wanting in women .

		They may , through social settlements and charity organizations , come to know '' how the other half lives '' ; but that is quite a different thing from knowledge of life .

		The lack of literary style among women writers , which would hinder a compiler of a book of model prose extracts for analysis from making a selection from the work of any woman , is largely due to causes already men - tioned .

		If the style is the man , individuality in style can not be separated from individuality in thought .

		Women frequently are fluent , easy , and graceful in expression , but they sel - dom attain a distinguishing any more than a distinguished style .

		When they attempt to be serious or profound , they are usually labored ; when , on the other hand , they essay the light touch , they become flippant and diffuse .

		The easy conversational tone degenerates with them into triviality , through lack of being subjected to the rigid control of good taste .

		Undoubtedly a choice diction and fine liter - ary finish do not come to anyone by nature .

		They are achieved only with infinite pains .

		Women , as a rule , are not willing to exercise the tireless patience necessary to acquire the little touches that distinguish the artistic from the commonplace use of language .

		Conse - quently they are never artists in the use of words .

		These are at least among the reasons why women , though they may excel as writers of fiction , history , biography , travel , of prac - tical and theoretical articles of all sorts , and of clever sketches , are not as yet contributing anything worthy of mention to the most finished of all forms of prose literature .

		SOME EARLY ANTI-SLAVERY PUBL
ICAT	ORGANIZATION	IONS .

		A few months ago a writer in The Dial took Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	to task for omitting to mention in his '' Literary History of
America	LOCATION	'' Mrs.
Lydia Maria Child	PERSON	's book , issued in
1833	DATE	, entitled '' An Appeal for that Class of Americans called Africans , '' which he claimed was incontestably '' the first Anti-Slavery book published in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		* Knowing that there were a number of earlier anti- slavery books , I have made a point of picking them up as rapidly as I have run across their titles in the catalogues of second-hand booksellers .

		A rough list of '' Anti-Slavery Publications from
1750	DATE	to
1863	DATE	, '' compiled by the Rev.
Samuel May , Jr.	PERSON	, was added to the '' Report of the Third Decade Meet - ing of the American Anti-Slavery Society , '' and a list of publications before
1835	DATE	is given by General
William Birney	PERSON	as an appendix to his '' Life of
James G. Birney	PERSON	. ''

		Notices of the earlier anti- slavery publications may be found in the '' Life of Garrison '' by his sons , and in other similar works .

		The test of what constitutes a book is somewhat arbitrary ; but , in the popular sense , any publica - tion bound in board covers is a book .

		Passing over a number of sermons and tracts belonging to the Colonial period , the earliest original anti-slavery book published in the
United States	LOCATION	ap - pears to have been a little 16mo , issued in
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia in
1816	DATE	, entitled '' The Book and Slavery Irre - concilable , '' by the Rev.
George Bourne	PERSON	.

		It might be questioned whether this may properly be called an American book , as the author was born in
England	LOCATION	; but it was certainly '' an anti-slavery book published in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		This book was the source of many of the most telling phrases afterward used by
Garrison	PERSON	.

		Little biographical information respecting
Bourne	ORGANIZATION	is now accessible .

		There is a short notice of him in Appletons ' '' Cyclopaedia of American Biography , '' but most of the statements contained in it appear to be erroneous .

		He came to
America	LOCATION	early in the century , and encountered the institution of Slavery during a residence in
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Per - secution finally drove him to
Canada	LOCATION	, whence he returned and in
1832	DATE	settled in
New York	LOCATION	, where he engaged in editorial work until his death in
1845	DATE	.

		He continued writing against slavery to the end of his life .

		A book by him entitled '' Pictures of Slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' published in
1834	DATE	, was illustrated by curious wood-cuts of '' Selling Females by the Pound , '' '' Ladies Whipping Girls , '' and the like .

		In
1817	DATE	, two more anti-slavery publications were issued .

		The first was not a book but a little tract of 59 pages , issued in blue paper wrappers at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		It was entitled '' Horrors of Slavery : In Two Parts , '' by
John Kenrick	PERSON	of
Newton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		It contained no original matter .

		Part I. consisted of extracts from parliamentary * The Dial ,

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 speeches taken from
Clarkson	PERSON	's '' History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade , '' and Part II .

		was made up of opinions of various American and foreign writers respecting slavery .

		Among the extracts is one from a pamphlet to which I find no other reference .

		It was written by
Jarvis	PERSON	Brew - ster , entitled '' An Exposition of the
Treatment of Slaves	ORGANIZATION	in the
Southern States	LOCATION	, '' and printed at
New Brunswick	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	ORGANIZATION	, in
1815	DATE	.


Kenrick	PERSON	caused a copy of his tract to be laid upon the desk of every
U. S.	PERSON	Senator and Member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second anti-slavery publication of this year was entitled '' Portraiture of Domestic Slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by
Jesse Torrey , Jr.	PERSON	, an octavo of 94 pages , bound in boards and issued in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		The book describes a trip from
Pittsburg	LOCATION	to
Washington	LOCATION	, and the abuse of slaves that was witnessed en route .

		The author was a physician , who wrote a number of books upon other subjects , the titles of which are given by AUibone .


Kenrick	PERSON	's tract and
Torrey	ORGANIZATION	's book were both denounced in a speech delivered in the Senate
March 6 , 1818	DATE	, by
Wm. Smith of South Carolina	ORGANIZATION	.

		The next anti-slavery book was entitled '' A Treatise on Slavery , '' by the Rev.
James Duncan	PERSON	, printed at
Vevay	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, in
1824	DATE	.

		I have not seen a copy of the original edition , but a reprint issued in
1840	DATE	, by the
American Anti-Slavery Society	ORGANIZATION	, makes a closely-printed little book of 136 pages .

		It is written in the dry and formal style of the old-time sermon .

		Very little can be learned of the author .

		The editor of the reprint says that he had intended to give a biographical sketch of him , but had mislaid the notes for it .

		In
1826	DATE	a little book entitled '' Letters on Ameri - can Slavery '' was published by the Rev.
John Rankin	PERSON	at
Ripley	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The letters were very vio - lent in tone , and became extremely popular with the radical abolitionists .

		Garrison reprinted them in the second volume of '' The Liberator , '' and they afterwards ran through half a dozen editions .

		Its author continued a vigorous war against slavery until the victory was achieved .

		One other book that should be mentioned here is a '' Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery in the Several States of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
George M. Stroud	PERSON	, the first edition of which , pub - lished in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1827	DATE	, made an octavo of 180 pages .

		This book is still extremely interesting and instructive reading .

		Though not professedly an anti-slavery book , it is strongly imbued with anti-slavery principles , and in its plain statement of leg ^ conditions constitutes to the mind of the present-day reader a much stronger indictment of slavery than the more direct attacks upon the in - stitution .

		The author was Judge of
the Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
City	LOCATION	and County of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The next anti-slavery book issued in the
United States	LOCATION	was Mrs. Child 's work , an able book and longer than its predecessors , but certainly not '' the first anti-slavery book published in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The main point is that the rise of anti-slavery sentiment in the
United States	LOCATION	was due not to any one person or coterie of persons , but to a very large number of people working independently in different parts of the country , most of them not writing for publication but using their influence in public and private station in furtherance of the cause .

		Inci - dentally it may be remarked that a great deal of work still remains to be done upon the history of the beginnings of the anti-slavery movement in ^ ° * ^ '' '' * -

		MR.
FREDERIC HARRISON	PERSON	AS A CRITIC OF
TENNYSON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, in bis essay on
Tennyson	PERSON	in his recent volume of '' Literary Estimates , '' says of '' Itt Memoriam '' : `` Indeed , with all its art , melody , and charm , we see from time to time in < In Memoriam ' a little too visibly the ' sad mechanic exercise ' which is the Lnevitabie result of too rigid and prolonged devotion to the uses of ' measured language . ' ''

		That would do very well , alone ; but a little farther on in the same essay Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	seems so to alter his - opinion as to speak of ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's religions and philo - sophical pieces -LRB- especially < In Memoriam , ' the most perfect of his poems -RRB- , because his claim to rank as the supreme poet of the nineteenth century must rest on this if on anything . ''

		And a little farther on still , he says : '' It is a far happier task to turn to the more distinctly lyrical work of
Tennyson	LOCATION	-- that whereon his permanent fame must abide . ''

		The italics , in both cases , are mine .

		Now , it seems to me that most admirers of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	will agree with Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	in his latter statement ; but it is hard for them to understand his singular dis - agreement with himself .

		In two different books , or even in two different essays in the same book , such con - tradictions of view might be excused on the ground of changed views -LRB- '' I do not let what I think to-day keep me from thinking what I ought to-morrow '' -RRB- .

		Bat in the same essay they can not be allowed to pass unchal - lenged , -- especially as Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's Tennyson '' esti - mate '' is full of '' this sort of thing . ''

		Another example may perhaps suffice .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, having spoken of Tennyson as '' the supreme poet of the nineteenth century , '' surprises ns by remarking , a little later on : '' It may be doubted if his ultimate place in our literature will at all overtop that of
Burns	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, or Shelley . ''

		In the name of '' serious , patient , and absolutely impartial criticism , '' ^ it may be asked what Bams is doing in such high com - pany .

		Barns is a minor poet of very genuine if very limited merit , but he has no claim to a place among the '' far-darters '' of '' the peaks of song . ''

		Concerning the ratings of the other three , competent critics would have us believe that it will be '' merely a matter of opinion '' ■ for a score of years at least .

		If the fame of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's lyrics is '' that whereon his permanent fame must abide , '' it may be well to dis - cover which of those lyrics are of greatest worth .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	says : `` Above all others are the songs in ` The Brook , ' ' The Princess , ' and in • Maud . ' ''

		I can not think that '' the concensus of critical opinion '' agrees 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	'' with these dicta of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	.

		He speaks of '' the songs in < The Brook , ' '' but after an exhaustive search through the ten volumes of the definitive edition of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, I can find but one song in '' The Brook . ''

		This , it is true , is broken into several parts .

		Mr.
Har	PERSON	- rison , as a critic , should be more careful in his state - ments .

		The song in `` The Brook '' is charming ; but is it very much more ?

		Or rather , is it as much more than charming as are many others of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's lyrics ?

		In fact , I think it the very slightest in merit of
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's twenty or twenty-five best lyrics .

		The songs in `` The Princess , '' -- `` The Splendor Falls on Castle Walls , '' `` Tears , Idle Tears , '' `` O Swallow , Swallow , '' '' Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal , '' and '' Come Down , O Maid , '' -- are of course delightful lyrics ; that almost goes without saying , since they are
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's lyrics .

		But , even admitting that they are in the first rank of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's lyrics , are they , in the language of the Oxford schools , such '' good firsts '' as the lyrics '' A Farewell , '' `` Choric Song , '' `` Far -- Far Away , '' `` In the Valley of Cauteretz , '' '' Requiescat , '' '' Sir
Galahad	PERSON	, '' '' Crossing the Bar , '' '' The Deserted House , '' and '' The Silent Voices '' ?

		The songs in `` The Princess , '' Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	says , '' are most bewitching . ''

		That is true , -- but
Tennyson	PERSON	at his lyric best is more than that .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	speaks of '' Ulysses '' as one of the '' Idylls . ''

		It , and '' Vastness , '' are the two poems of Tennyson which most evade classification .

		It is of course easy to classify and measure after this fashion .

		It is more difficult to classify and measure correctly .

		If Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	gave more attention to helping '' the reader who wants criticism , '' both writer and reader would be better off .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	quotes the first line of '' Despair '' -- * ' la it you that preach 'd in the chapel there looking over the sand ? ''

		And says : '' This is not poetry , with 16 syllables and 52 letters in the line . ''

		It is true that this line is not utter poetry , but not especially because it contains 16 syllables and 52 letters .

		It would probably be neither better nor worse poetry if it contained 49 letters , or 63 letters .

		Perhaps , if the line were printed , '' la it you that preach 'd in the chapel , There , looking over the sand ? ''

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	would have less trouble in deciphering what poetic quality it possesses .

		Yet where is the essen - tial difference ?

		I think the difficulty Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	says one ought to find in reading this line of '' 16 syl - lables '' is chiefly non-existent .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	also finds fault because
Tennyson	PERSON	has so many monosyllables in his poetry , and so few polysyllables .

		But so long as the result is poetry , one doesn ' t care whether the words are long-syllabled or short-syllabled .

		If the result is not poetry , one ought not to care much about it , either .

		With such futilities as these does Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	regale us in his essay on
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Such captious dissections , and philological peckings , are but the tin - soldiery of literary criticism .

		Some there are who give us `` this sort of thing '' because they can not give us real literary criticism .

		Less often we are confronted by cases in which a critic persists in this minute method because he is of the opinion that it is '' scientific . ''

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	can write good criticism , and he does write it elsewhere in this volume ; but the essay on
Tennyson	PERSON	is '' of little worth . ''

James Russell	PERSON	.

		Lowell , .

		* '' I am richer than he thinks for , ''
Lowell	PERSON	once wrote to his friend
Briggs	PERSON	, apropos of a recent notice which had intimated that the young poet was in easy circumstances . ''

		I am the first poet who has endeavored to express the American Idea , and I shall be popular by and by .

		Only I suppose I must be dead first .

		But I do not want anything more than I have . ''

		These words were written in the annus mira - bilis of
Lowell	LOCATION	's youth , the year which pro- duced '' The Fable for Critics , '' '' The
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' and '' The Vision of Sir Launfal . ''

		It is as the poet of the American Idea , so nobly expressed in these early writings , and even more nobly in some of the later ones , that we cherish the memory of
Lowell	LOCATION	, and turn to him , rather than to any other , for cheer and conso - lation in such a time as our own , when the Idea upon which he had fixed his faith seems to have become submerged beneath a flood of corruption , self-seeking ambition , and the cyn - ical disregard of our national obligations .

		It may be urged that the American Idea , as
Lowell	PERSON	voiced it , was nothing more than the
New England Idea	LOCATION	, or the Puritan Idea , but we are of those who believe that the best expression thus far given to Americanism in its finer sense is the expression given it by the group of
New England	LOCATION	writers who for many years held the national conscience so largely in their keeping , and of whom
Lowell	PERSON	was at once the raciest and the most deeply imbued with those moral principles which are the only real basis of our national greatness .

		And it is because in these dark recent days those principles seem to have lost their old-time hold upon our na - tional life that we listen more yearningly than ever for some echo of the voice that thrilled with indignation in '' The
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' and with the pride of American manhood in the great ode consecrated to the sacred memory of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		It is now ten years since the death of
Lowell	LOCATION	bereft us , not merely of our foremost man of letters , but of our foremost man .

		A Biography .

		By
Horace Elisha Scudder	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Boaton :
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 large accessions .

		First in importance among these accessions stands , of course , the collection of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's letters , as edited by Professor Nor - ton .

		These volumes gave us so intimate a view of the man himself , as apart from his books , that they in a measure made a formal biog - raphy seem unnecessary .

		At least , they en - abled us to wait patiently the appearance of such a biography , knowing that when it did appear it could hardly alter the main outlines of the portrait that had already been drawn for us .

		Nevertheless , the biography , as we now have it , is a welcome contribution to the his - tory of American literature and of American manhood , and the discreet sympathy which Mr.
Seudder	PERSON	has brought to its preparation deserves our warmest gratitude .

		The previous publica - tion of the '' Letters '' has mainly determined the lines of the present biography .

		Concern - ing this matter , Mr.
Seudder	PERSON	says : '' If they had not been published , I might have made a ' Life and Letters ' which would have been in the main
Lowell	PERSON	's own account of himself , in his voluminons correspondence , annotated only by such further aecouat of him as his letters failed to supply .

		As it is , though I have had access to a great many letters not contained in Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's work , I have thought it desirable not so much to supplement the < Letters ' with other letters , as to complement those volumes with a more formal biography , using such letters or portions of letters as I print for illustration of my subject , rather than as the basis of the narrative . ''

		Having thus introduced what is probably the most important publication of the present year , it remains for us to illustrate its quality by a few extracts , and to call attention to a few of its more noticeable features .

		When
Lowell	PERSON	had got through with college , and , among other experimental ventures , started ♦ ' The Pioneer , '' he wrote a prospectus which shows how serious were his aims thus early in his career .

		The object of the new periodical , we read , was to furnish the public '' With a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash , in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches , which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular magazines , -- and to offer instead thereof , a healthy and manly Periodical Litera - ture , whose perusal will not necessarily involve a loss of time and a deterioration of every moral and intel - lectual faculty . ''

		If such things might fairly be said
sixty years ago	DATE	, what language would be adequate to de - scribe the state of things existing to-day , both in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, as respects the peri - odical literature which really enjoys a popular vogue I As we all know , political passion became at an early age as important an element in Low - ell 's being as literary passion , and his inde - pendent attitude toward political questions receives constant expression in his writing when still a young man .

		Given the approval of his own conscience , and he cared not how many were leagued against him , or how for - midable were the forces which he had to com - bat .

		How characteristic of the whole man is this satirical comment upon the time-serving politicians of the forties : '' The word xo , '' he wrote , '' is the shibboleth of poli - ticians .

		There is some malformation or deficiency in their vocal organs which either prevents their uttering it at all , or gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be unintelligible .

		A month filled with the national pud - ding , or watering in the expectation of it , is wholly in - competent to this perplexing monosyllable .

		One might imagine that
America	LOCATION	had been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript African animals , the Aye Ayes .

		As
Pius Ninth	PERSON	has not yet lost his popularity in this coun - try by issuing a bull against slavery , our youth , who are always ready to hurrah for anything , might be practised in the formation of the refractory negative by being encouraged to shout
Viva Pio Nono	PERSON	. ''

		The culmination of
Lowell	LOCATION	's application of lit - erature to politics was reached , of course , with the publication of that memorable masterpiece of satirical hamor , the first series of `` The Biglow Papers . ''

		What Mr.
Seudder	PERSON	says of the work is so just and discriminating that it deserves quotation . ''

		The force which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	displayed in this satire made his book at once a powerful ally of a sentiment which heretofore had been crassly ridiculed ; it turned the tables and put Anti-slavery , which had been fight - ing sturdily on foot with pikes , into the saddle , and gave it a flashing sabre .

		For
Lowell	PERSON	himself it won an accolade from
King Demos	LOCATION	.

		He rose up a knight , and thenceforth possessed a freedom which was a freedom of nature , not a simple badge of service in a single cause .

		The book in its fullest meaning is an expression of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's personality , and has in it the essence of
New England	LOCATION	.

		The character of the race from which its author sprang is preserved in its vernacular and in the characters of the dramatis personal .

		Not unwit - tingly , but in the full consciousness of his own inherit - ance ,
Lowell	PERSON	became the spokesman of a racy people , whose moral force bad a certain acrid quality , and , when thrown to the winds , as in the person of
Birdofredom Sawin	PERSON	, was replaced by an insolent shrewdness .

		Nor is the exemplification of
New England	LOCATION	less complete for that infusion of homely sentiment and genuine poetic sensibility which underlie and penetrate the sturdy moral force . ''

		Lowell 's course of lectures given at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	during the winter of 1854-55 marked a sort of turning-point in his career .

		They not only led to more lectures elsewhere , but they also led to the recognition of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's peculiar fitness to succeed
Longfellow	LOCATION	at Har - vard .

		College lecturing , as he shaped it , was much to his taste , which can not be said of the 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, public and itinerant lecturing of his apprentice - ship to the art . ''

		I hate this business of lec - turing , '' he wrote from
Wisconsin	LOCATION	. ''

		To be received at a bad inn by a solemn commit - tee , in a room with a stove that smokes but not exhil - arates , to have three cold fish-tails laid in your hand to shake , to be carried to a cold lecture-room , to read a cold lecture to a cold audience , to be carried back to your smoke-side , paid , and the three fish-tails again -- well , it is not delightful exactly . ''

		But lecturing at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, in his own way and on a subject that he liked , was a different matter , and he can not have failed to receive some reflex influence from the inspiration that he gave year after year , to his classes of eager students .

		Here is a description of his way of dealing with
Dante	PERSON	, upon whom he lectured for many years : `` The classes were not large , and the relation of the teacher to his students was that of an older friend who knew in a large way the author they were studying , and drew upon his own knowledge and familiarity with the text for comment and suggestion , rather than troubled himself much to find out how much his pupils knew .

		A student would trudge blunderingly along some passage , and
Lowell	PERSON	would break in , taking up the translation himself very likely , and quickly find some suggestion for criticism , for elaboration , or inci - dental and remote comment .

		Toward the close of the hour , question and answer , or free discussion yielded to the stream of personal reminiscence or abundant reflection upon which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	would by this time be launched .

		Especially would he recall scenes in Flor - ence , sketch in words the effects of the Arno ,
Giotto 's Tower	ORGANIZATION	, the church in which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	was baptized , where he himself had seen children held at the same font ; and so
Lowell	PERSON	gave out of his treasures , using that form of literature which was perhaps the most perfectly fitted to his mind , free , unconstrained talk . ''

		For the formalities of academic work , however , he had little concern .

		Mr.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	tells the following anecdote of an academic exercise : '' Weeks passed , and no news came of our marks .

		At last one of the class , who was not quite at ease con - cerning his academic standing , ventured at the close of a recitation to ask if Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	had assigned him a mark .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	looked at the youth very gravely , and inquired what he really thought his work deserved .

		The student rather diffidently said that he hoped it was worth sixty per cent .

		• You may take it , ' said Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, ' I do n't want the bother of reading your book . ' ''

		This reminds us of a story of
Walter Pater	PERSON	in his character as a college teacher .

		He also , when questioned concerning his neglected marking of a set of themes , found a sufficient answer in the observation , '' They did not greatly impress me . ''

		It is from
Lowell	PERSON	's ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' period that the following example of his humor is taken : '' Just as
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's fun could find its way even into an index , so in his sober criticisms he would sometimes hide a jest for the delectation of especially discerning readers , as when in his article on White 's Shakespeare , he remarks incidentally : * To every commentator who has wantonly tampered with the text , or obscured it with his inky cloud of paraphrase , we feel inclined to apply the quadrisyllable name of the brother of
Agis	ORGANIZATION	, king of
Sparta	LOCATION	. '

		Felton ,
Longfellow	ORGANIZATION	tells us in a letter to
Sumner	PERSON	, was the first to unearth the joke and to remember or discover that this name was Eudamidas . '

		* '
Lowell	PERSON	was in charge of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' for about four years .

		The most distinguished of a distinguished line of editors , he was by tem - perament far from fitted for the work , and he chafed under its routine , its practical details , and its petty exactions .

		The constant flood of manuscripts appalled him ; on one occasion he wrote jubilantly that he had cleared them all away , but the respite could not in the nature of things be lasting , and it was with a distinct sense of relief that he resigned the editorial desk to Mr. Fields .

		Under great difficulties he had accomplished much for the magazine , ^ and given it that foremost place among our monthlies that it has ever since retained .

		The chapter which deals with ''
Lowell	PERSON	and the War for the Union '' is one of the strongest and most interesting in the biography , but it covers familiar ground , being mainly concerned with
Lowell	PERSON	's political essays , and the second series of '' The
Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		During this period , the '' North American Review , '' of which he had assumed the editorship , became the medium through which he chiefly addressed the public .

		It is interesting to note the develop - ment of his appreciation of the great President who bore the burden of the Civil War .

		Lowell had favored the nomination of
Seward	LOCATION	, and was much disappointed when Lincoln proved to be the successful candidate in the
Conven	LOCATION	- tion .

		He did not know the man , and hfr doubted .

		As the war went on , he expressed his impatience more than once at what seemed the temporizing policy and excess of caution displayed by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		But as the drama drew near its close , and the President was seen to be so magnificently justified by the event ,
Lowell	PERSON	's admiration for the man grew deeper and deeper , the heroic figure was at last seen in its true proportions , and
Lowell	PERSON	more than made up for his early questionings in the apotheosis of his '' Commemoration Ode . ''

		But it is curious to note that the sixth stanza , in which the won - derful characterization of Lincoln appears , was not recited at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and not even written at the time of the delivery of the '' Ode , '' ^ although added almost immediately afterwards .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 < ' It is so completely imbedded in the structure of the ode that it is difficult to think of it as an after - thought .

		It is easy to perceive that while the glow of • composition and of recitation was still upon him
Lowell	PERSON	suddenly conceived this splendid illustration and indeed climax of the utterance of the Ideal which is so im - pressive in the fifth stanza .

		So free , so spontaneous is this characterization of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and so concrete in thought , that it has been most frequently read , we sus - pect , of any single portion of the ode , and it is so elo - < juent that one likes to fancy the whole force of the ode behind it , as if
Lowell	LOCATION	needed the fire he had fanned to white heat , for the very purpose of forging this last , firm , tempered bit of steel .

		Into these threescore lines
Lowell	PERSON	has poured a conception of Lincoln which may justly be said to be to-day the accepted idea which Americans hold of their great President .

		It was the final expression of the judgment which had slowly been forming in
Lowell	LOCATION	's own mind , and when he summed him up in his last line , -- ` New birth of our new soil , the first American , ' He was honestly throwing away all the doubts which bad from time to time beset him , and letting his ardent pursuit of the ideal , his profound faith in democracy as incarnate in his country , centre in this one man . ''

		We must pass over the period of combined literary and educational activity that followed upon the close of the war , and turn at once to JLowell 's career in the diplomatic service of his country .

		He was offered the Austrian mission soon after
Hayes	PERSON	took the presidential chair .

		He told Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who approached him on behalf of the President , that he must decline the offer , but remarked , at the close of the con - versation , '' I should like to see a play of Calderon . ''

		The hint was sufficient , and soon thereafter he was officially invited to represent his country at
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		The social and diplo - matic success of his Spanish Mission were so marked that the appointment to the
Court of St. James	ORGANIZATION	followed some
three years later	DATE	as a logical consequence .

		Lowell 's life in
England	LOCATION	as American min - ister was useful to both his country and himself .

		The country benefitted by a strengthening of the bonds of friendship between the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	; the man benefitted by a broadening of his outlook and a refinement of his ideals .

		As early as
1848	DATE	, he had written that '' nationality is only a less narrow form of provincialism , a sublimer sort of clownishness and ill manners . ''

		But it is difficult to deny that
Lowell	PERSON	, when he went to
England	LOCATION	, took with him something of that provincialism of which he himself , in his dispassionate moments , recognized the narrowness .

		An English critic who became one of his warmest admirers , and of whose sympathy there can be no doubt , wrote of his appearance in
England	LOCATION	as follows : * ' He came over here full of anti-English preju - dices .

		When he said , ' We are worth nothing except so far as we have disinfected ourselves of Anglicism , ' he fully meant what he said .

		Englishmen who met him then were apt to find this disinfecting process rather a nuisance , but with the American new-comer , if he is of the right strain , you have only to grin and bear .

		In the atmosphere of his fathers he will soon begin to grow ... The truth is that
Lowell	PERSON	, having been thrown into the best circles -- best , I mean , as regards their wide knowledge of man and of men -- discovered -LRB- as
Emerson	LOCATION	had done before him -RRB- that the voice of the mob of
New York	LOCATION	is , in its Anglophobic tem - per at least , as far off from being the voice of God as that of any people under the sun .

		He found that between an American of the true strain and an Englishman of the true strain there is a stronger attraction than exists be - tween men of any other strain , however good .

		He found that
John Bull	PERSON	is not quite so offen - sively taurine as the American pressmen paint him -- that he is not in the habit of greeting
Jonathan	PERSON	with ' a certain condescension , ' but on the contrary is in the habit of treating him as an absolute equal in most things , and as a superior in some . ''

		These remarks were made by Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	in a reminiscent article published in '' The Athenaeum '' just after
Lowell	PERSON	's death .

		The simple truth is that
Lowell	PERSON	had misunderstood English life and thought before he came to live among Englishmen , and when he did come to understand them , he was honest enough to say what he thought .

		Yet , as his biographer says , '' Throughout his stay in
England	LOCATION	he showed a certain vigilance as the champion of American institutions , speech , and manners which gave him the air of combat - iveness .

		An Englishman who was often his host said : ' I like Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	.

		I like to have him here .

		I keep him as long as I can , and I am always in terror lest somebody shall say something about
America	LOCATION	that would provoke an explosion . ' ''

		One incident connected with
Lowell	PERSON	's En - glish experiences may be mentioned .

		His popularity was so great that it brought him , in
1883	DATE	, the election as Lord Rector of the Uni - versity of
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some indiscreet per - son having objected to the nomination because
Lowell	PERSON	was an alien , the matter came up for lively discussion both in and out of print . ''

		Punch , '' as usual , said the final word upon the subject of controversy , when it published the following verses : `` An alien ?

		Goto !

		If fresh , genial wit In sound Saxon speech be not genuine grit , If the wisdom and mirth he has put into verse for os 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, Do n't make him a ' native , ' why so much the worse for us .

		Whig , Tory , and Rad should club votes , did he need 'em , To honor the writer who gave Bird o ' Freedom To all English readers .

		A few miles of sea Make Lowell an alien ?

		Fiddle-de-dee ! '

		T is crass party spirit ,
Boeotian	LOCATION	, dense , That is alien indeed -- to good taste and good sense . ''

		It turned out , however , that
Lowell	PERSON	was ineli - gible for the appointment , not because he was an alien , but by reason of his '' extra-territori - ality '' as the American minister .

		We will close this review of a deeply-inter - esting work with some extracts which illustrate
Lowell	PERSON	's attitude towards the larger questions of politics .

		In the strict sense , his political activity was confined to his services as a mem - ber of the Republican Convention of
1876	DATE	, and as a Presidential Elector the following year .

		He went to the Convention as an adherent of
Bristow	PERSON	and an opponent of Blaine .

		Writing of his participation in the gathering , he said : '' I believed that a
Kentucky	LOCATION	candidate might at least give the starting-point for a party at the South whose line of division should be other than sectional , and by which the natural sympathy between reasonable and honest men at the North and the South should have a fair chance to reassert itself .

		We failed , but at least succeeded in preventing the nomination of a man whose success in the Convention -LRB- he would have been beaten disastrously at the polls -RRB- would have been a lesson to American youth that selfish partisanship is a set-off for vulgarity of character and obtnseness of moral sense .

		I am proud to say that it was
New England	LOCATION	that de - feated the
New England	LOCATION	candidate . ''

		Eleven years later , he visited
Chicago	LOCATION	, for the purpose of addressing the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	on
Washington	LOCATION	's birthday , and intending to speak upon '' American Politics . ''

		The result - ing episode is thus described by Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	: '' The house was completely filled and
Lowell	PERSON	was given a hearty welcome .

		The audience , however , was greatly taken aback at the first words of the speaker , for he said when he came forward that he had changed bis subject and would speak , not on < American Politics , ' but upon the principles of literary critism as illustrated by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '
Richard III	PERSON	. '

		... He went on to say that in announcing politics as the subject of his address he had not fully realized the conditions under which it was to be delivered ; that he was accustomed to speak frankly , but that he found himself the guest and , in a manner , the representative of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		What he had to say would plainly give offence to his hosts , and he was thus compelled on the score of courtesy to change his subject .

		The situation was one which might have led those present to detect some irony in
Lowell	LOCATION	's po - liteness .

		The
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	was a Republican organization under the control of the
Blaine	PERSON	wing of the party .

		It had succeeded in getting rid of those Repub - licans who had been hostile to
Blaine	LOCATION	, amongst whom was the gentleman who was
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's host .

		But
Lowell	PERSON	had made no concealment of the position he occupied .

		He made it clear enough at this time , a couple of days later when he was a guest of the
Harvard Club of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago . '

		I stood outside of party , ' he then said , * for nearly twenty-five years , and I was perfectly happy , I assure you ... Party organization , no doubt , is a very convenient thing , but a great many people , and I feel very strongly with them , feel that when loyalty to party means worse disloyalty to conscience , it is then asking ^ more than any good man or any good citizen ought ti > concede . ' ''

		The treatment accorded to
Lowell	LOCATION	upon this occasion by the press and a large section of the public was of such a nature that most
Chicago	LOCATION	- ans of intelligence and refinement blush for their city whenever they recall the * thing to mind .

		Both in public print and private conver - sation
Lowell	PERSON	was roundly abused by those who should have been warmest in his defense .

		For an act prompted only by a fine sense of honor and exceptional delicacy of feeling he was dealt with as if he had been guilty of an insult to the public and a gross betrayal of faith .

		The whole affair was extremely discreditable to the city whose guest was thus treated , aud we are glad that Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	has at least outlined the situ - ation with exact truthfulness .

		He might pro- perly have gone still further , and made some caustic allusion to the public exhibition of bad manners which this episode occasioned , for in this , as in all other matters , it may safely be said of
Lowell	LOCATION	, as
Tennyson	PERSON	said of
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' Whatever record leaps to light He never shall be shamed . ''

China	LOCATION	's Intellectual , IiIfe .

		* After the doleful pages of Dr.
W. A. P. Martin	PERSON	's '' The Siege in Peking , '' in which the author appeared as a member of the church militant , it is a pleasure to turn to the scholarly and dignified volume on '' The Lore of Cathay . ''

		^ No one has more qualifications than the Presi - dent of the
Chinese Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	for the writing of a book which shall , within rea - sonable compass , give the western world a sym - pathetic account of '' The Intellect of
China	LOCATION	, '' ^ as the sub-title of the book runs ; and no one could make better use of the knowledge labori - ously acquired of Chinese classics and customs than is here disclosed .

		The book summarizes the scholarship , philosophy , and religious thought of an Empire which has shown itself more capable of perpetuation than any institu - tion ever contrived by man ; and it finds here * The Lore of Cathay ; or , The Intellect of
China	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 317 a student who has so far divested himself of western prejudices as to see beneath the sur - face to the very heart of a majestic and endur - ing civilization .

		The sequel and complement of a former book from the same hand , '' A Cycle of Cathay , '' it differentiates itself from that standard work , which was concerned with the active life of the Chinese , by dealing almost exclusively with their intellectual life .

		It is divided into five parts , dealing respectively with the various intellectual departments of the Empire , its lit - erature , its religion and philosophy , its educa - tional methods , and a few studies in Chinese history , -- the latter including a consideration of '' sources , '' of the Tartars in ancient
China	LOCATION	, of international law as the Chinese know it , and of their diplomacy , past and present .

		Dr.
Martin	PERSON	has no doubt that the invention of gunpowder and the discovery of the magnet as a guide to orientation rest with the ancient Chinese , and cites certain classical works in proof of the antiquity of the knowledge .

		He believes , too , that the European invention of movable types for printing may be traced , in modified form , to this ancient race .

		The manu - facture of porcelain and silk is undoubtedly Chinese , and they not only invented paper about the beginning of the Christian era , bat made wood pulp into paper centuries ago .

		On the side of science , it is to be said that alchemy , the parent of modern chemistry , is certainly Chinese in its origin ; while astronomy has a history going back forty-one centuries in the
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		Decimal arithmetic is also theirs , with a possible beginning as early as 2600 B. C , and a text-book setting forth its principles which is authentically dated
1125	DATE	B. C. Dr.
Martin	PERSON	shows , moreover , that the modern concept of ether was already a sub - ject of Chinese speculation in the eleventh century before
Christ	LOCATION	, just as suggestions of both the Baconian and Cartesian philosophy may be found in age-old discourses accepted among Chinese scholars .

		With interesting details of this sort the book abounds .

		Passing over the suggestions of the influence of the Christian religion upon the Chinese mind , in which the author holds a brief for Protestant orthodoxy , the fascinating chapter on Chinese education will be found worthy of careful study . ''

		In no country , '' we are told , '' is the office of teacher more revered .

		Not only is the living instructor saluted with forms of profoundest respect , but the name of teacher , taken in the abstract , is an object of almost idolatrous homage . ''

		Yet it becomes readily apparent that there are grave defects in the existing system , in which the teacher holds his pupil 's esteem by the exercise of what Dr.
Martin	PERSON	calls '' the argument a jposteriori ^ ^ and keeps his little students at work for five full years memorizing the Chinese classics , which are to-day couched in a language the meaning of which is `` absolutely unknown to them .

		At the end of that time the period of exegesis sets in , and the minds so carefully exercised by long and meaningless learning by heart are slowly brought to fructification by the transla - tion into the vernacular of all the innumerable syllables with which they are stored .

		That the Chinese generally are not as well educated as Europeans suppose , is one of many astonishing statements in the book which are made to bear their own conviction with them .

		If the ability to read and write means what it does with us ^ hardly one Chinaman in a thousand , and not one Chinawoman in ten thousand , possesses these accomplishments .

		All can read the syl - lables as they find them in a book , but few have any knowledge of what they mean ; all can write with the copy before them , but very few can indite an original composition ; all can cipher sufficiently for their business needs , but there their mathematical knowledge stops abruptly .

		Yet
China	LOCATION	is , emphatically , the land of the scholar .

		The civil service is in the possession of members of the
Republic of Letters	ORGANIZATION	to an extent unknown elsewhere , and for that system Dr.
Martin	PERSON	professes the utmost respect .

		In - deed , he would have
Christendom	LOCATION	take it over in all its essentials .

		`` The bare suggestion may p '' erhap3 provoke a smile ; but are not the long duration of the Chinese govem - ment , and the vast population to which it has served to secure a fair measure of prosperity , phenomena that challenge admiration ?

		Why should it be considered derogatory to our civilization to copy an institution which is confessedly the masterpiece in that skillful mechanism -- the balance-wheel that regulates the working of that wonderful machinery ?

		... More con - genial to the spirit of our free government , it might be expected to yield better fruits in this country than in
China	LOCATION	.

		In British
India	LOCATION	it works admirably -LSB- and in
Egypt	LOCATION	and the
Malayan States	LOCATION	even more admirably -RSB- .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	, too , the diplomatic and consular ser - vices have been placed on a competitive basis ; and something of the same kind must be done for our for - eign service if we wish our influence abroad to be at all commensurate with our greatness and prosperity at home .

		When will our government learn that a good consul is worth more than a man-of-war , and that an able minister is of more value than a whole fleet of iron-clads ? ''

		Dr.
Martin	PERSON	commends the Chinese for many 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, things , but always with discrimination and intelligence .

		Their ideals of patriotism seem admirable , as they are disclosed to us , and an ode of the late Emperor contains these lines : `` To maintain prosperity , we must cherish fear , and rejoice with trembling .

		In your new poems , therefore , be slow to extol the vastness of the Empire ; Rather by faithful advice uphold the throne . ''

		The volume abounds with photographs of the scenes mentioned , and the publishers have given it a most attractive outward setting .

		McCl.el , l , an as a Great Commander .

		* The difficulties under which a democracy conducts war was epitomized in the career of General
George B. McClellan	PERSON	, whose Life by General
Peter S. Michie	PERSON	, the latest addition to Appletons ' '' Great Commanders '' series , at - tains its greatest value , perhaps , not from what soldiers may learn from its pages as to the proper conduct of campaigns and battles , but from the warnings which
McClellan	PERSON	's career gives to presidents , cabinets , bureau officers , and congresses , concerning what civilians in positions of authority and influence should not do .

		From the settlement of the colonies to the present time , we have never been long without war ; and we have so persistently repeated , throughout our colonial and national existence -- in the war of the Revolution , in the war of
1812	DATE	, in the Civil War , and in the recent war with
Spain	LOCATION	-- the error of civilian interference in the conduct of military affairs , that the rec - ord as it stands must be attributed less to igno - rance of our own history , faulty logic , and hasty mistakes of judgment , than to the impatience of our people , our national traits of character , and our political and social institutions , which are little adapted to the making of war .

		McClellan 's career is enshrouded in such historical confusion that the sincere biographer , who seeks to account for it by a scientific con - sideration of all the elements of the case , attempts a most formidable undertaking ; and perhaps no man who lived during the Civil War period , who has associated with the par - ticipants in the struggle , whose judgment has been influenced by the writings of the survivors of the conflict and disturbed by the conflicting reputations of the '' great captains with their guns , '' can be expected to grapple with the *

		task in a way thoroughly to satisfy logical readers of the correctness of the explanatory theory at which he may arrive .

		From the very number of the contentions in regard to
McClellan	PERSON	's plans and achievements , it is necessary that his case should be considered freshly , with all the industry required to weigh the evidence , and by a mind gifted and trained in the analytical power of determining which is the vital piece of evidence in the mass of testimony , and what is the weight of the evi - dence .

		Much of the confusion and many of the conflicting claims in connection with the mili - tary careers of the Civil War are to be directly traced to a want of the analytical power often combined with that defective reasoning which Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	has said has lost more vessels than have been sunk by faulty seamanship .

		To the doubts and contentions hovering over all
McClellan	PERSON	's career , the late General
Michie	PERSON	endeavored to apply a simple and readily understood theory .

		To
McClellan	PERSON	, this biog - raphy attributes every personal virtue , -- high - mindedness , a noble and generous character , lofty patriotism , industry , mastery over details , great capacity for organization , fondness for the study of strategy .

		The book is also fair to
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	in its enumeration of the personal and political difficulties with which the army commander had to contend .

		.

		But it also taxes him with persistent exaggeration of the enemy 's strength , with lack of aggressiveness , with timidity , and tactical incapacity .

		Let us con - sider some of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's difficulties .

		Called to the command of
McDowell	ORGANIZATION	's de - feated army and the troops at
Washington	LOCATION	immediately after the battle of Bull Run , and assigned to the task of making an army out of a mob ,
McClellan	PERSON	on the one hand was hindered by the presence of General
Scott	PERSON	, who was still at the head of the regular army , and on the other hand by the ignorance of his staff and line officers .

		The amount of personal work thrown upon him in the organization of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, because of the absence of competent subordinate officers , was so pro- digious that , strong as he was , he broke down physically under the burden .


November 1 , 1861	DATE	,
Scott	PERSON	was retired ; and
McClellan	PERSON	, be - coming General-in-Chief , had to consider larger plans than those which related merely to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		The whole theatre of the war was under his direction .

		Very notable at this time was his desire to have General
Buell	PERSON	march to the relief of the loyal people of
Eastern Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 Early in the
winter	DATE	,
McClellan	PERSON	was stricken with typhoid fever .

		Stanton succeeded Cam - eron as Secretary of War , and the attitude of the department changed from one of cordial support to one of hostility to the army com - mander .

		The
Congressional Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Conduct of the War , of which Wade and
Chandler	PERSON	were the leading spirits , -- a com - mittee of whose star-chamber proceedings , of whose indictments , one-sided trials and convic - tions of prominent officers , it is difficult to condemn in terms of moderation , -- was ag - gressively hostile to
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pressure of the politicians was for an immediate advance of the army , fit or unfit ; and during the period of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's illness in the
early winter	DATE	, the President , by consulting with several of Mc -
Clellan	PERSON	's subordinates in the presence of Cab - inet officers , tried to formulate by committee a plan of campaign at a season of the year which would have doomed any overland campaign to failure .

		On
January 27 , 1862	DATE	, Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	ordered that a general movement of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	forces be made on
February 22	DATE	; and for the same day the President ordered a movement of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac upon the Orange and
Alexandria	LOCATION	railroad .

		Finally , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was persuaded to abandon his plan of campaign for
McClellan 's Peninsula	ORGANIZATION	plan .

		It may be said at this time that , coming to
Washington	LOCATION	in midsummer ,
McClellan	PERSON	had done everything that could be reasonably expected of him in the few months before the season of bad roads set in , and that thereafter nothing could be undertaken with any chance of success until the roads had again become passable .

		Had
McClellan	PERSON	marched out to the
Occoquan	LOCATION	, in the
fall of 1861	DATE	, we may safely infer from the career of the Confederate General
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	-- which , from the beginning of his service along the Potomac in
Virginia	LOCATION	, on the
Peninsula	LOCATION	, in the
Vicksburg	LOCATION	campaign , and before
Sherman	PERSON	, was uniformly and throughout one of retrogression -- that the Confederates would simply have fallen back , and little would have been gained except the marching experi - ence .

		It is General
Michie	PERSON	's view , however , that
McClellan	PERSON	should have made the movement .

		By the
spring of 1862	DATE	, -- that is , before there could be any reasonable hope of a suc - cessful general movement of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's army , -- the army commander 's standing with the President had been so undermined that it was deemed necessary by
McClellan	PERSON	, in order to win the President 's consent to a movement by way of the
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	to
Urbana	LOCATION	on the
Rappahannock River	LOCATION	, that the plan should be submitted to the approval of his subordinate generals .

		The nature of the proposition suffi - ciently indicates the conditions which made it necessary , conditions under which no general could hope to conduct campaigns to a successful issue .

		On
March 8	DATE	, the President selected for him four corps commanders , --
McDowell	PERSON	, Sum - ner ,
Heintzelman	PERSON	, and Keyes .

		Of the degree of capacity indicated and reputation made by these officers , it is sufficient to say that theirs are not among the great names of the war .

		Sumner and
Heintzelman	PERSON	were already well advanced in years ; Keyes was soon retired : and
McDowell	PERSON	, like
McClellan	PERSON	, had already suffered from being expected to do with raw volunteers that which only an organized and disciplined army could accomplish .

		The Presi - dent also ordered that
McClellan	PERSON	's movement should not be made without leaving in front of
Washington	LOCATION	a sufficient force for its protection , and that , this being done and the
Potomac	LOCATION	cleared of the foe , the movement should begin on
March 18	DATE	; and on
March 11	DATE	, the President relieved
McClellan	PERSON	of all military departments outside of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac , an act not calculated to increase the degree of confidence still felt in the
General	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems now unfortunate that
McClellan	PERSON	abandoned his
Urbana	LOCATION	plan for the movement up the
Peninsula	LOCATION	between the
York	LOCATION	and
James Rivers	PERSON	, from
Fort Monroe	LOCATION	as a base .

		The movement from
Urbana	LOCATION	would certainly have resulted in the capture or quick retirement of
Magruder	PERSON	's forces on the
Peninsula	LOCATION	below , and would probably have compelled the retirement of
Johnston	PERSON	from the immediate vicinity of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		But as
Johnston	PERSON	retired at this time , of his own volition , to the line of the
Rappahannock	LOCATION	, we have to consider chiefly the superiority of a movement threatening Ma - gruder 's rear , in contrast with the one actually made upon his front .

		What
McClellan	PERSON	's mo - tives were for the change , are not clear .

		He himself said that the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	forced the change upon him .

		The present biographer does not accept this view , but he does not clear up the matter altogether .

		The confusion con - tinued , not through
McClellan	PERSON	's fault , when the
General	ORGANIZATION	desired to make a flank movement up the
York River	LOCATION	for the purpose of turning the Confederate position at
Yorktown	LOCATION	and ar - riving quickly at West Point on the
Richmond	LOCATION	and York River Railroad , within thirty miles of
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		No adequate cooperation of the navy was arranged for or apparently contem - 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, plated by the authorities ; and
McClellan	PERSON	was left to make the best of the direct movement upon
Magruder	PERSON	's front .

		Once under way ,
McClellan	PERSON	was furnished with a map prepared by
General Wool	ORGANIZATION	's topo - graphical engineer , which failed entirely to show that the
Warwick River	LOCATION	ran across the
Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		Behind this stream
McClellan	PERSON	found the Confederates entrenched .

		His own generals and his staff proved unequal to their positions .

		General
Michie	PERSON	says that at York - town
McClellan	PERSON	encountered the most critical moment in his career , -- implying that he should have attacked promptly , instead of set - tling down to a siege .

		Undoubtedly he should have attacked .


McClellan	PERSON	had much to learn about the practical handling of an army in front of a foe .

		He had had so far little op - portunity to learn .

		But there is little more reason for considering Yorktown a critical moment inMcClellan 's career than for thinking Shiloh a critical moment in the careers of
Grant	LOCATION	and
Sherman	PERSON	.

		In spite of
Yorktown	LOCATION	,
McClellan	PERSON	, with ex - perience , with better corps commanders such as
Meade	PERSON	picked out later for the same army , and with a staff such as
Meade	PERSON	was enabled later to develope , might have run the glorious career of a successful general .

		That he could have rushed into
Richmond	LOCATION	with the army as it was in the
spring of 1862	DATE	, is not by any means made clear , even if we ignore the op - position of hurrying Confederate reinforce - ments .

		That
McClellan	PERSON	was steadily improv - ing as a commanding general is shown by his subsequent Antietam campaign , which , in spite of the serious blunder of a weak corps com - mander of whom
McClellan	PERSON	said truly that he was only fitted to command a regiment , was highly successful .

		The important question of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's posi - tion astride the
Chickahominy	LOCATION	, and the other question whether the retirement to the
James River	LOCATION	was voluntary , or was forced upon him by Lee in part and in part was the result of his own timidity , are discussed with every dis - position on the part of the biographer to be fair to the army commander ; but it is difficult to avoid the impression that
General Michie	ORGANIZATION	's appreciation of the tactical blunders of Mc -
Clellan	ORGANIZATION	's army -- blunders due largely to the lack of practical experience on the part of
McClellan	PERSON	and his corps commanders , -- and a certain impatience with the resulting faulty manoeuvring in the face of the foe , prevented the biographer from giving due value to the soundness of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's strategical plans .

		At the same period , and in the same campaign , tactical mistakes were made abundantly in Lee 's army by
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	and other Confederate generals .

		In the Antietam cam - paign ,
Lee	PERSON	's strategical movements were of the most dangerous character .

		In the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	campaign , his tactics were faulty in the ex - treme ; and , indeed , it was not until the
last year	DATE	of the war that Lee 's tactics developed to the point where they would bear the severest scrutiny .

		McClellan had no such opportunity to learn the art of war .

		With every disposition to be just toward the subject of his biography .

		General
Michie	PERSON	early in his book , in his account of the Rich Moun - tain affair in
West Virginia	LOCATION	, indicates the attitude of disapproval which he steadily main - tains toward all
McClellan	PERSON	's movements in the field .

		Now
McClellan	PERSON	's movement upon Rich Mountain was as well planned as
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's flank march upon Hooker at Chan - cellorsville ; although , of course , the battle at Rich Mountain was on much the smaller scale .

		But General
Michie	PERSON	would take away much credit from
McClellan	PERSON	, because it was Rose - crans who , by
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's orders , making the flanking movement on the right , discovered the theretofore unknown woods-road which led him to the Confederate flank unobserved .

		Inas - much as in the older parts of our country , wherever extensive woods exist , woods-roads are also to be found ,
McClellan	PERSON	in strict equity can not be deprived of the credit of his victory because his subordinate , acting under McClel - lan 's orders and moving in the way that
McClellan	PERSON	had directed him to go , was so con - spicuous an element in the affair .

		The presumption in favor of the idea that
McClellan	PERSON	's right was extended on the north bank of the Chickahominy for the purpose of connecting with
McDowell	PERSON	's force when the latter should move down from the
Rappahan	PERSON	- nock , is so strong that , even if we did not have the emphatic statements of
McClellan	PERSON	himself and his confidants in support of it , the minor evidence to the opposite effect does not appear sufficient to overthrow it .

		The unfortunate position of the army was due to two counter - acting influences at work , -- one being
McClel	PERSON	- lan 's desire to move to the
James	PERSON	, and the other the desire of the civil authorities for a more or less direct covering of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Lee 's attack on
McClellan	PERSON	's right set the
Union	LOCATION	commander free to go where he wanted to go .

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Reserves at

		THE DIAL 321
Mechanicsville	LOCATION	was made on
Jane 26	PERSON	.

		But on the
18th McClellan	ORGANIZATION	had ordered supplies sent up the
James	LOCATION	.

		The movement to the
James	PERSON	was already under way when
Lee	PERSON	attacked at
Mechanicsville	LOCATION	, a
Union	ORGANIZATION	victory which certainly gave
McClellan	PERSON	no cause to hurry .

		Nor does
General Michie	ORGANIZATION	appear to give full value to the strategical importance of the battle of
South Mountain	LOCATION	, the turning-point in the
Antietam	LOCATION	campaign .

		The forcing of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's Pass was most skilfully and successfully done , and caused Lee to prepare for and consider an immediate retirement to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Consider - ing the circumstances , the forcing of the mountain pass was promptly done .

		Lee 's `` lost orders , '' which came into
McClellan	PERSON	's possession , placed at the pass a Confederate force sufficient to hold it against a host .

		As a matter of fact , a large part of this force had gone on toward
Hagerstown	LOCATION	; but of this ,
McClellan	PERSON	could have no knowledge .

		Even as it was , the Confederate force left at the pass was sufficient to prevent Cox from gaining the crest to the south of the pass , and
Gibbon	PERSON	from making any headway in front of the pass .

		Meade 's successful gaining of the crest by assault on the right compelled Lee to abandon the position .

		At
Fairfield Pass	ORGANIZATION	, in
July , 1863	DATE	, a small Confederate rear-guard was sufficient to make so capable a corps commander as Sedg - wick , with so large a force as the
Sixth Corps	ORGANIZATION	, think that the pass could only be forced after long delay ; and
Sedgwick	PERSON	's decision has never been questioned .

		In the ensuing battle of Antietam -- a wasteful engagement on Lee 's part , and one fought after he had seen that his campaign of invasion had come to grief --
McClellan	PERSON	only failed of a decisive tactical success because of the well-meaning
Burnside	PERSON	's shortcomings as a corps commander .

		But even then , all the substantial results were with
McClellan	PERSON	.

		Lee 's scheme of invading
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania had been abandoned before .

		From being the aggressor , he had from
South Mountain	LOCATION	on - ward been upon the defensive ; and he now aban - doned the battle-field and returned to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The obvious tactical errors in
McClellan	PERSON	's battles -- some of these errors due to untrained subordinates and inexperience in actual war - fare -- should not prevent a due appreciation of his comprehension of larger strategical prob - lems .

		It looks now as if the greatest error in all his campaigns was committed by the civil authorities in bringing his army away from the
James	LOCATION	.

		General Lee never forgot what Mc -
Clellan	PERSON	's threat pointed out to him , and before
Grant	PERSON	's
1864	DATE	campaign was under way wrote to President
Davis	PERSON	of the possibility that the
Union	LOCATION	forces might cut the
Weldon Railroad	ORGANIZATION	and compel the evacuation of
Petersburg	PERSON	and the downfall of
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		General
Michie	PERSON	suggests that longer experi - ence might have eliminated
McClellan	PERSON	's faults as a tactician , -- a suggestion which will also be found in my earlier '' Life of General Meade '' in the same series .

		McClellan 's claim to be remembered , according to his present biographer , will rest upon his organization of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, -- a stupendous work , performed under many difficulties .

		Im - portant as
McClellan	PERSON	's work was , the organi - zation of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac did not reach a state approaching perfection until the
spring of 1864	DATE	, by which time the inadequate staff and corps commanders had been gotten rid of , and
Meade	PERSON	's orders were elaborated by so able a chief of staff as
Humphreys	PERSON	, and executed by such competent corps commanders as
Hancock	PERSON	,
Sedgwick	PERSON	, and
Warren	ORGANIZATION	.

		But to the foundation of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's claim to the grati - tude of his country should be added his suc - cessful Antietam campaign , -- the five most vital battles of the war -LRB- apart from sieges like the Siege of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	-RRB- , being
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
South Mountain	LOCATION	and Antietam -LRB- considered together -RRB- ,
Nashville	LOCATION	, Champion Hill -LRB- which decided that
Pemberton	PERSON	should be shut up in
Vicksburg	LOCATION	-RRB- , and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		This list throws the names of
Meade	LOCATION	,
McClellan	PERSON	,
Thomas	PERSON	, and
Grant	PERSON	, among Civil War generals , into promi - nence for having rendered the most conspicuous service to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in the hour of most vital need .

		Overshadowed by
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, -- as it always will be , and justly , -- still , the import - ance of the Antietam campaign will some day be better appreciated than it is now .

The Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ating it has been such as to give these four volumes a secure place among the books of permanent value to all who are interested in American history .

		The objects sought by the editor were two : `` First , to put within convenient reach of schools , libraries , and scholars authoritatiye texts of rare or quaint writings in American history contemporary with the events which they describe , and in the second place , to give , in a succession of scenes , a notion of the move - ment and connection of the history of
America	LOCATION	, so that from this work by itself may be had an impression of the forces which have shaped our history and the prob - lems upon which they have worked . ''

		The success of such an undertaking de - manded that the reader should feel absolutely sure of the genuineness of the extracts given , and , furthermore , that he should have the utmost confidence in the discriminating judg - ment of the editor .

		As to the latter point there is probably little doubt , considering Pro- fessor
Hart	PERSON	's place among students of American history ; and for the former strict rules were followed : '' First of all , pains have been taken to use the first authoritative edition of each work in English ; and a faithful translation of pieces in foreign languages .

		Next , the copy is meant to be exact ... Words not easily recognized are , however , repeated in modern dress in brackets .

		Next , the quotations are meant to be exact , all omissions being indicated , and the place where the extract was found being noted at the end . ''

		The result of the study is found in the twenty-five hundred pages of gathered glean - ings from diaries , letters , reports , discussions , reminiscences , addresses , newspapers , maga - zines , and other sources of materials , some manuscripts being available for the more recent period .

		Ofiicial documents find no place , these having been collated by
Preston	LOCATION	,
Macdonald	PERSON	, and others , but the expression of opinion throughout the years is clearly shown by the wide range of selection , the philosophy of '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' and the words of popular songs being presented along with the sounding sen - tences of some great oration or the studied argument upon some great theme of present moment .

		And so the volumes may be consid - ered not alone a compendium of history , but also a study in American literature , showing in a wonderfully interesting way the changes and improvement in American writing , spell - ing , and thinking during nearly three hundred years .

		The latest volume , finishing the series , was no doubt the most difficult in preparation , being nearest to the life activity of many yet living , and the selection of materials to illustrate the history of the last twenty years must have been a peculiarly trying task .

		Upon some questions public opinion is not yet settled , and twenty years hence a selection made in
1901	DATE	may be rejected as entirely unrepresentative , whereas the judgment of history probably has been finally passed upon the great topics of the periods illustrated by the first , second , and third volumes .

		An idea of the skill and resources of the editor may be gained by a study of Part IX. , which is devoted to recent American problems .

		The five chapters discuss the Spanish War ,
Questions of Colonization	ORGANIZATION	, Foreign Problems ,
Problems of Government	ORGANIZATION	, and Social Problems ; and the names of writers include Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, Ex-Secretary Day , Governor
Leonard Wood	PERSON	, President
McKinley	PERSON	, Ex-Secretary
Richard Olney	PERSON	, President
Roose	PERSON	- velt , Ex-Secretary
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, Mr.
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry W. Grady	PERSON	, President
Eliot	PERSON	, and Mr.
Booker	PERSON	T.
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Not every - one may agree with Professor
Hart	PERSON	regarding the final value of the selections printed , but the names just specified will convince any critic that an honest effort has been made to choose representative literature of the present day .

		The obligation due the editor for the series is great , and as the volumes become more and more familiar in private study and public library , the feeling of appreciation will steadily increase .

		* A theatrical memoir of more than ordinary interest , owing to the eventful and highly in - teresting career of its author , is '' Life on the Stage , '' which sets forth the personal experi - ences and recollections of

		Her career was most eventful , in the ordinary acceptation of the term ; it was full of many and diverse interests , and the real measure of her ultimate success can only be estimated when all these interests are taken into account .

		Miss Morris was born at
Toronto	LOCATION	on a cer - tain 17th of

		THE DIAL 32a the sad neglect of a faithless father and the untiring toil of a loving mother .

		When thirteen years of age she went on the stage as a ballet - girl , taking part in the marches and dances of a play called `` The Seven Sisters , '' for which service she received the munificent sum of
three dollars	MONEY	a week .

		Step by step she ad - vanced in her profession , and as the years crept by she became possessed of a broader and more comprehensive view of the drama ; standing humbly at the knee of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, she began to learn something of another world -- fairy-like in fascination , marvellous in re - ality .

		It is to be remembered that at about this time Forrest , crowned and wrapped in royal robes , was yet tottering on his throne ;
Charlotte Cushman	LOCATION	was the Tragic Queen of the stage ;
James Murdoch	PERSON	, highly esteemed , was still acting ;
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	,
E. L. Daven	PERSON	- port ,
Charles Culdock	PERSON	,
J. K. Hackett	PERSON	,
Maggie Mitchell	PERSON	, and
Matilda Heron	ORGANIZATION	were numbered among the popular favorites ; and
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, the greatest light of all , was rising in golden glory in the
East	LOCATION	.

		In comparing the actor of forty years ago with the actor of to-day ,
Miss Morris	ORGANIZATION	makes a statement which will elicit protest from many quarters .

		`` Looking back to the actors of
' 65	DATE	, I ca n't help noticing the difference between their attitude of mind toward their profession and that of the actor of to-daj .

		Salaries were much smaller then , work was harder , but life was simpler .

		The actor had no social standing ; he was no longer looked down upon , but he was an un - known quantity ; he was , in short , an actor pure and simple .

		He had enthusiasm for his profession -- he lived to act , not merely living by acting .

		He had more superstition than religion and no politics at all ; but he was patriotic and shouldered his gun and marched away in the ranks as cheerfully as any other citizen soldier .

		But above all and beyond all else , the men and women respected their chosen profession .

		Their constant as - sociation of mind with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	seemed to have given them a certain dignity of bearing as well as of speech .

		To-day our actors have in many cases won some social recognition , and they must therefore give a portion of their time to social duties .

		They are club - men , and another portion of their time goes in club lounging .

		They draw large salaries and too frequently they have to act in long running plays , that are made up of smartish wit and cheapest cynicism -- mere froth and frivolity , -- while the effective smashing of the
Seventh Commandment	ORGANIZATION	has been for so long a time the principal motif of both drama and farce that one can not wonder much at the general tone of flippancy prevail - ing among theatrical people of to-day ... They are sober , they are honest , they are generous , but they seem to have grown utterly flippant , and I ca n't help wondering if this alteration can have come about through the change in their mental pabulum .

		At all events , as I watched and listened in the old days , it seemed to me that they were never weary of discussing readings , expressions , emphasis , and action .

		One would remark , say at a rehearsal of `` Hamlet , ' that
Macready	PERSON	gave a certain line in this manner , and another would in - stantly express a preference for a Forrest -- or a
Davenport	LOCATION	-- reading , and then the argument would be oo , and only a call to the stage would end the weighing of words , the placing of commas , etc. '' It was in her third season that
Miss Morris	ORGANIZATION	's position became an anomalous one ; it showed that in the girl there dwelt a latent spark of genius waiting to be fanned into a flame .

		She studied in one afternoon , letter perfect , the part of JS ^ ing Charles in '' Faint Heart Never Won Fair Lady , '' and played it , in borrowed clothes , without any rehearsal whatever .

		This was followed by a greater success when she ap - peared in an adaptation of '' La Maison Rouge '' in support of that sterling actress .

		Miss
Sallie St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	-- wife of
Charles Barras	PERSON	, the wealthy and eccentric author of the '' Black Crook . '' ''

		Some girls change theirs often .

		My gods were few .

		Sometimes I cast one down , but I never changed them ; and on the highest , whitest pedestal of all , grave and gentle , stood the god of my professional idolatry --
Edwin Booth	PERSON	. ''

		And when the great actor played Hamlet in Mr.
John A. Ellsler	PERSON	's company , the author of these interesting memoirs received the greatest surprise of her girlhood days , when , in looking over the proposed cast , she saw the entry : '' Queen
Gertrude	PERSON	-- Miss Morris . ''

		But , notwithstanding that he looked more like her father than she like Hamlet 's mother , she added another successful role to her fast-increasing repertory .

		<< It would seem like a presumption for me to try to add one little leaf to the tight-woven laurel crown he wore .

		Everyone knows the agony of his * Fool 's Re - venge , ' the damnable malice of his lago , the beauty and fire of
Antonio	LOCATION	, and the pure perfection of his Hamlet , -- but how many knew the slow , cruel martyr - dom of his private life !

		which he bore with such mute patience that in my heart there is an altar raised to the memory of that Saint
Edwin	PERSON	of many sorrows , who was known and envied by the world at large , as the great actor ,
Edwin Booth	PERSON	. ''

		After a short engagement in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	as leading lady .

		Miss
Morris	ORGANIZATION	signed a contract with
Augustin Daly	PERSON	, and gained the proud dis - tinction of being the first Western actress accepted by a
New York	LOCATION	audience .

		She was likewise the first actress who attempted with any degree of success the modern French emotional drama : her success in the role of
Alixe	PERSON	is one of the memorable incidents of
New York	LOCATION	theatrical history .

		She was , how - ever , to our mind , much better fitted for parts 324 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, requiring stormy and passionate acting than for pathetic scenes .

		It is impossible to trace minutely Miss Mor - ris 's career under the managerial guidance of
Daly	PERSON	and
Palmer	PERSON	.

		Needless to add , her wide acquaintance with theatrical celebrities , her ability to depict their habits , talk , manners , disposition , and appearance , with the exactness of reality , combine to render her book fasci - nating and instructive .

		Her style is graphic , fluent , and luminous ; she has an exquisite appreciation of wit and wisdom ; and her ven - eration for contemporary actors and actresses , combined as it is with the most uncommon perspicacity , is an additional qualification .

		Her volume does not belong to that class of theatrical memoirs which know no distinction -- her life was not devoid of striking events and her career was one of triumph ; thus there was full scope for narrative , criticism , and personal reminiscence , which forms a book of human , tender , and personal interest .

		What We Are Getting '' will perhaps better serve as a designation for Mr.
W. Bleloch	PERSON	's '' The
New South Africa	LOCATION	: Its Value and Development '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		It is a general survey of the natural wealth of the
Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	, as seen by a man of wide acquaintance with those two countries , coupled with an inquiry into the social conditions of the Burghers , the
Uitland	LOCATION	- ers , and the Kaffirs , as they are likely to exist at the anticipated conclusion of hostilities .

		Mr.
Bleloch	PERSON	, it is not necessary to insist , is an enthusi - astic British partisan , and a believer in the leader - ship of Messrs.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	and
Joseph Chamber	PERSON	- lain .

		He finds it necessary , therefore , to omit all reference to the liberal movement among the Burghers of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	which came within a few hundred votes of electing the late General
Joubert	PERSON	over President
Krueger	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	, and was increasing in strength daily until the
Jameson	PERSON	outrage put an absolute end to internal reforms and left Mr.
Krueger	PERSON	the practically unanimous choice of the Republic in
1898	DATE	.

		Mr.
Bleloch	PERSON	is also a voluntary witness to the conspiracy against the British in general , which is so positively denied by Messrs.
Brice	PERSON	,
Gooch	PERSON	, and others .

		It may be added that he is an optimist of no mean order , as may be seen from such statements as '' The successful result of the War ... has fully justified the cost , '' which he estimates at less than
# 150,000,000	MONEY	; ''
England	LOCATION	has entrenched her position among the nations by the War '' ; and '' If the whole cost of the War had to be borne by the British people , they would have gained by having kept intact that force in the world which is theirs , and which it ought to be their steadfast and proudest aim to maintain . ''

		It is perhaps idle to censure historical faults in a book which is avowedly '' an unofficial prospectus of the work which lies before the British administration in the new Colonies , '' for there can be no doubt of the value which its contents afford to those who are seeking wealth in
South Africa	LOCATION	, assuming that
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	finally developes a policy which will make such a quest possible .

		The gold deposits occupy six chapters ; the coal fields another ; dia - monds and other minerals , dynamite and land , each one more ; immigration , the Uitlanders , the
Boers	PERSON	, and the black natives , each one ; while separate sections of the narrative are given up to `` Industry and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Railways , '' `` Summary of Resources and Crown Assets , '' '' The Present and Future Administration , '' `` The Fiscal Policy -- Capacity to Pay Part of the War Debt , '' and a separate consideration of the
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	under its new title of the ''
Orange River Colony	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work concludes with an extended series of ap - pendices , made up for the most part of the statistics necessary to support the contentions of the several chapters ; and there is an index .

		In an illustrated volume of five hun - dred pages , Dr.
Bernard Hollander	PERSON	expounds `` The Mental Functions of the Brain '' -LRB- Putnams -RRB- , with the purpose of showing that the results of modern research all tend to reinstate the conclusions of the early phre - nologists .

		This '' first work of the subject since the dawn of modern scientific research '' is indeed a curious conglomerate of latter-day knowledge , of distorted interpretations of clinical evidence , of far - fetched and one-sided presentations of questionable observations , and of a profound lack of appreciation of modern logic as a scientific implement .

		It is true enough , and is well pointed out by the author , that the merits of Gall as an anatomist and physi - ologist of his day are considerable , that many of the extreme forms of quackery practised under the name of phrenology are not traceable to him or to the doctrines to which his teachings properly led , that some of the results of the phrenologists find analogies in the results of the modern '' locali - zationists , '' -- and yet it is still truer that the spirit and results of phrenology at its best are totally out of relation with the spirit and the results of that form of intellectual endeavor from which the ripe and nutritious fruits of science have sprung .

		It is 80 easy to produce a travesty of the facts and argu - ments of science , -- of which , indeed , this able and painstaking work is a remarkable example ; the line that divides truth from error , the sublime from the ridiculous , is often so tortuous and indistinct An attempted revival of phrenology .

Duke	ORGANIZATION	's exile ; and in the main he tells it as Jacques should .

		One wishes , to be sure , that he had once again '' met a fool i ' the forest , '' and been made to unburden himself to Touchstone in riddles as of old .

		It is hard to fancy
Jacques	PERSON	, the poseur , the lover of two-edged words , suddenly grown quite so frank and simple or so tolerant of
Amiens	LOCATION	's humble understanding .

		But out of this too-mellowed urbanity the old Jacques breaks every now and then with a gibe or an epi - gram polished to his own delightful shine .

		And the little idyl is touched throughout with the spirit of
Arden Forest	ORGANIZATION	.

		One wishes there were more of this sort of Shakespearean comment .

		The book is made to fit its contents , with antique board covers , hand-illuminated initials , and some dainty pen drawings , which add much to its quaint charm .

		periodleal mfaetimile .

		It has been known for several years that Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	publisher , was at work upon a reprint in facsimile of '' The Germ , '' that most interesting and most inaccessible of all fugitive periodicals .

		Indeed the project was formed nearly twenty years ago ; but it was found that certain of the magazine 's contributors were averse to having their youthful writings resurrected in this way , and it became necessary to postpone publication until expirations of copyright should make such minor objections unavailing .

		The original editor of '' The Germ , '' Mr.
William M. Rossetti	PERSON	, was one of the first who consented to the enterprise -LRB- representing also his more famous brother and sister in the matter -RRB- , and was engaged to contribute an Introduction to the edition .

		In the form in which it is finally issued , Mr.
Stock	PERSON	's reprint bears evidence that the years of delay have been utilized to perfect the work in every detail , and it would be difficult to say wherein it could now be improved .

		The frontispiece etch - ings and outside wrappers are reproduced by photo - graphic process ; the text is reprinted from type , following the original line for line and letter for letter , typographical errors included .

		The four nambers of the magazine are loosely enclosed in a handsome case of paper-covered boards , bearing the title in gilt on back and side .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	's Introduction , filling some twenty-five closely-printed pages , is contained in a separate pamphlet of ani - form size .

		Coming from the pen of one more intimately acquainted with the history of '' The Germ '' than any other man now living , it must be at once accepted as the most authoritative , as it certainly is the fullest , account of this ' < amazing publication '' that has yet appeared .

		It is needless to say that through this successful undertaking , Mr.
Stock	PERSON	has placed every student of Victorian litera - ture in his debt .

		In the matter of price , there is a difference of some
hundreds of dollars	MONEY	between this reprint and a set of the original magazine ; as re - gards actual desirability there is no other than a purely sentimental difference .

		The 250 copies imported for sale in
America	LOCATION	bear the imprint of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	6 .

		In Messrs.
Greenough	PERSON	and
Kitt	PERSON	- i , ' ^ V ^ ^ redge 's `` Words and their Ways in English Speech '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we have a history of the development of the English language in which the authors strike out boldly into new and hitherto little-trodden paths .

		A large part of the histories of
Lounsbury	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, for example , is given np to the matter of inflections .

		In the work before us , however , inflections are dis - posed of in a dozen pages ; while the book includes discussions of such topics as '' Language as Poetry , '' '' Fossils , '' '' Generalization and Specialization of Meaning , '' '' Transference of Meaning , '' ''
Degen	PERSON	- eration of Meaning , '' `` Euphemism , '' words from animal , place , and personal names , and the like .

		Such chapters , filled with such a wealth of illustra - tion , could not have been written a few years ago , and show what a debt we owe the workers on the great Historical English Dictionary and other phil - ologists whom that book has stimulated to under - take special investigations of our speech .

		The authors have not been slow to incorporate the re - sults of the most recent studies , especially those of the science of meanings .

		And they have not merely copied etymologies ; we find here several independ - ent studies of the changes words have undergone .

		Throughout the book one sees traces of the profes - sor of Latin , and one can not help feeling that the book is decidedly the better from the fact that its subject-matter has been scrutinized from two points of view , that of the English and that of the Latin specialist .

		In expounding the principles which 326 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, have governed the development of our complex language , and in revealing the wealth of its vocabu - lary and explaining the sources of that wealth , the writers have been eminently successful .

		Whether the book will prove a satisfactory college text-book can be better told a year hence ; but as a popular though accurate exposition of a subject which has always been of the utmost importance , and which no one can now pronounce uninteresting , we do not hesitate to call it the ablest work which has yet appeared in its field .

		`` Great Religions of the World '' Religion , progres '' ^
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of xnthelatt century , v ' . ''

		a collection of essays by eleven dif - ferent writers .

		Some of the most prominent of the papers are '' Confucianism '' by Dr.

Rhys Davids	PERSON	of Lon - don , '' Brahminism '' by Sir
A. C. Lyall	PERSON	, ''

Sikhism	LOCATION	'' by Sir
Lepel GriflBn	PERSON	, `` Jews and Judaism '' by Dr.
M. Gaster	PERSON	, '' The Outlook of Christianity '' by Wash - ington
Gladden	PERSON	, and '' Catholic Christianity '' by
Cardinal Gibbons	PERSON	.

		The treatment of the themes is very uneven and of unequal value .

		Some are dis - cussed historically , such as
Sikhism	LOCATION	and Babism , while others are a recital of the doctrines and power of the faith under survey .

		Of the eleven papers embodied in the volume , six -- possibly seven -- only can be counted as dealing with '' great religions of the world . ''

		These are Confucianism , Buddhism ,
Mohammedanism	LOCATION	,
Brahminism	LOCATION	,
Zoro	PERSON	- astrianism , Christianity , and Judaism .

		Of these seven , the essay on Confucianism is a fair presen - tation of the growth of that faith in the last century .

		Dr.
Davids	PERSON	pictures the recent spread and power of Buddhism in the
East	LOCATION	.

		Mohammedanism is set before us in all its glory as seen in its conquests during the last few decades .

		The essay on Zoro - astrianism is both historical and doctrinal in treat - ment .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's '' Outlook of Christianity '' is a presentation of figures , numerical and geo - graphical , of
Christendom	LOCATION	, and the modifications of doctrines and beliefs brought about by the investi - gations of recent years .

		Dr.
Gaster	PERSON	's essay pictures in vivid terms the struggles for liberty through which the Jews have passed , especially on the con - tinent of
Europe	LOCATION	within the last century .

		Such a collection of essays has its value , but the disparity in methods and purpose of presentation is too great to give it first place among books on the great re - ligions of the world .

		The life and `` Brother Musicians , '' a brief biog - letterto/ttoo raphy of Edward and
Walter Bache	PERSON	# ngii '' hmuHciani .

		^ ^ tten by their sister , is an unpre - tentious record of the lives of two gifted English - men .

		It is somewhat belated in appearance , as the elder brother died in
1858	DATE	, and the younger in
1888	DATE	, but it has the interest which always belongs to the story of genius triumphing over difficulties .

		The brothers ' letters to their family from
Leipzig	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and other musical centres , make up a con - siderable part of the volume .

		These letters give entertaining and often intimate glimpses of
Wagner	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and many lesser musicians , as well as a quite unconscious revelation of the refined , enthusiastic natures of the brothers themselves , and the unsel - fishness of their devotion to the cause of music
Edward Bache	ORGANIZATION	's letters on the advantages to a city of placing the best orchestral music within the reach of the poor deserve a place in the literature of philanthropy as well as of music .

		His compari - son of the Wagnerian and Italian schools is also valuable for its clearness , though perhaps too pre - mature to be sound in theory .

		A peculiar interest is given to the book by the fact that , in spite of similarity of character and early training , the Bache brothers took wholly different paths in music .

		Ed - ward was a composer and followed the old school , believing that after
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's death music in
Germany	LOCATION	'' had taken a false direction . ''

		His own early death at twenty-five rendered futile his ambi - tion to create an English opera founded on the Italian .

		Walter was a pianist and teacher , and an ardent follower of the newer school .

		He is remem - bered as the champion and interpreter of
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	's music in
England	LOCATION	.

		The volume is published by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Welsh history Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	's recent work on and a great '' Highways and Byways in

		Wales '' showed that author 's apti - tude and enthusiasm in the treatment of Welsh history .

		The latest effort of his facile pen in the same direction is a volume on
Owen Glyndwr	PERSON	, in Putnams ' '' Heroes of the Nations '' series .

		The first eighty pages are a condensed history of
Wales	LOCATION	from its first historic records down to 1400 , or from 400-1400 .

		The brevity of the treatment makes this section quite unsatisfactory to the reader .

		Such condensation is always a hazardous undertaking .

		But the body of the book , on the other hand , treat - ing of the last struggle for Welsh independence as led by
Owen Glyndwr	PERSON	, is rather diluted .

		On the whole , however , the author has written an interest - ing narrative , has deftly woven in the facts of his - tory and many of the popular traditions of the hero , so as to bring out with great prominence some of the best elements of Welsh valor , persistency , and endurance .

		One can not read this volume without gaining a new conception of the character of the Welsh people , particularly in their valiant and vain struggle against the aggressions of the kings of
England	LOCATION	.

		The book is well-illustrated by half-tone cuts of some of the most famous castles of

		He has written within the last decade , besides '' The Story of Our English Towns , '' several books upon rural life in
England	LOCATION	and upon old En - glish sports and custooas .

		The avowed purpose of the present volume is to call attention to the rich - ness of the English villages , not only in mediaeval relics , but , in many cases , in Roman remains and in prehistoric monuments ; to exhibit the process by which the part of the '' scientiBc detective '' may be undertaken by the ordinary student , and what facts concerning primitive man in
England	LOCATION	may be developed from an investigation of the turmdi , barrows , pit and pile dwellings , cromlechs , camps , and earthworks , to be found scattered throughout the island .

		Nor does he slight the historic periods and the features of village life in '' Merrie En - gland '' which are of never-failing interest .

George Dorys	PERSON	, '' as is explained in the translator 's preface , is the assumed name of the son of the late Prince of Samos , one of Abdul - Hamid 's ministers and sometime governor of
Crete	LOCATION	.

		The author thus had abundant opportunity to gain inside information , and he appears to write from personal knowledge .

		Terrible is the picture he draws of the man whom
Gladstone	PERSON	called < ' the great assassin . ''

		The charitable reader will hope that this despot is really not quite so fiendishly cruel and cunning as he is represented .

		Other and less forbidding portraits of him incline one to sus - pect that Mr.
Dorys	PERSON	may have written in a mood not wholly free from prejudice .

		But the truth would seem to be almost as hard to get at as is the Sultan himself in his double and triple walled seclu - sion .

		His elaborate precautions against assassina - tion , his childish fear of the dark , and his abject dread of death , certainly bespeak something other than '' a still and quiet conscience . ''

		This volume maintains the high standard of interest and excel - lence of workmanship of the '' Lives of Royalties '' series in which it appears .

Daniel Webster	PERSON	,
Caleb Cushing	PERSON	, and others , largely
New Englanders	LOCATION	, whose lives have been of moment in American history .

		The material here gathered together has been in con - siderable degree a part of the personal experience of the writer , and so , while gaining in authenticity and personal nearness , they are but incomplete portraits that he presents .

		Although as a whole the book is inorganic , there is in it a great deal of valuable matter , which it needed only a more pleas - ing literary style to make extremely interesting .

		An account of `` A Summer in
Norway	LOCATION	, '' and the chapter entitled ' • Some Persons I Have Seen , '' have rather less of the stilted literary quality of a bygone day ; but here as elsewhere the author 's sense of values does not seem to be very sure .

		Such information as the volume contains is of a sort not easily accessible ; much , perhaps , is not to be found elsewhere ; and it is to be regretted that there is no index to make its real wealth of anecdote and story more available .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It would be unreasonable to ask for a handsomer school edition of the `` iEaeid '' than is provided by Dr.
Charles Knapp	PERSON	in his recently published volume .

		The first six books are given complete , and are followed by extracts from the six remaining ones .

		There is an intro - duction , historical , biographical , critical , and syntactical , of one hundred pages .

		There are copious notes -LRB- with the text -RRB- and a vocabulary .

		Interspersed among the books of the epic are full-page plates of famous works of ancient sculpture .

		The whole is bound in half-leather of restful dark green .

		Our only quarrel with the book is that it sanctions the wanton pedantry of the spelling ''

Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Agnes Giberne	PERSON	, a fair con - ception of the new science of oceanography and its aims and achievements may be had , set in language suffi - ciently popular to appeal to those wholly ignorant of its existence .

		With the discussions of the tides and their causes , the salt in the ocean and its sources , gla - ciers , the great ocean currents and several similar phenomea , the physical geographies have made us famil - iar .

		But in the descriptiuns of the curious animals dredged from vast depths , the varied proofs of the ex - istence of active life in even the profoundest valleys covered by the sea , and the habits of sea monsters of every size and most extraordinary shape , Miss Giberne finds an almost undiscovered country for the informa - tion of her readers .

		Xumerons illustrations , of rather unequal value , add to the interest of the volume .

		There is a great deal of pathos in a life that is in some way devoted to the interest of culture while never attaining culture for itself .

		Some such sense of the irony of fate must come to one who reads Mr.
E. Mars	PERSON	- ton 's '' Sketches of Booksellers of Other Days '' -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- , so pitifully outside the currents of thought and feeling fed by the books they sold do many of them seem .

		The sketches cover a period from the middle of the seventeenth century to the year of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and contain a great many things to interest the curious .

		The miseries of apprenticeship are more than hinted at and the stern economy of one who would rise from proverty to a competance are told again and again .

		Though the sketches are in the main but per - sonal histories touching little upon the larger concerns of men , they have a very real interest for those who care to know so much of the setting of authors ' lives two centuries ago .

		BRIEFER MENTION 377 NOTES 378 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 378 SCHOLARSHI P AN D CULTURE .

		The higher education of to-day , with all its endowments and auxiliaries , with all the re - sources of wealth and men at its command , is still open to one of the gravest of charges .

		Its fundamental aim seems to be the production of scholarly acquirement rather than of cultivated intelligence .

		Because scholarship is pedestrian in its methods , and requires only industrious application for its achievement , and because culture is to be attained only in more difficult ways , and under more genial guidance , our universities manifest a strong tendency to seek the path of least resistance in their educational effort , and to direct their activities toward securing results that make an imposing quan - titative showing , but that leave much to be de - sired in the quality of the product .

		The old antithesis between scholarship and culture has never been more strongly marked than in the educational programmes of the present day , and the need has never been more urgent of making a plea for the neglected interests of the latter .

		More and more do our universities tend to send out into the fields of thought young men who are narrow specialists ; less and less do they tend to encourage the broad - minded development of the intellect that cul - ture demands .

		In the complexity and variety of modern education , there are whole tracts of thought that may be frankly abandoned to the claims of pure scholarship .

		The entire region of science , mathematical , physical , biological , and social , may be yielded without demur to the work of minute investigation , orderly clas - sification , and logical construction .

		Culture is to be had from these subjects , but knowledge , and the applications of knowledge , constitute the immediate , and , to a considerable extent , the sole aim with which they are pursued .

		But humanity is a finer thing than knowledge , and the subjects whose consideration makes for humanity must suffer degradation if we permit ourselves to lose sight of their essential excel - lence .

		These subjects are those of the literary and artistic groups , and , largely also , those of the historical group , although in this latter domain mere scholarship has some claims that are legitimate .

		What the advocates of culture 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, and of humane education are bound to resist most strenuously , and if need be to the death , is the intrusion of scientific methods in the narrow sense , and the futile industry of the philological or historical specialist , into the pursuit of literary studies .

		This subject is not a new one .

		It has for many years engaged the pens and the persuasive powers of able men having the interests of the humanities at heart .

		But the tendency against which our protest is declared remains persist - ent , and as long as it controls the teaching of the literary classics , whether ancient or modern , in any large number of our universities , it must be combated without ceasing , even with much repetition and the laboring of the simplest points .

		Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	has said many a strong and vital word upon this theme in con - nection with the study of modern literature , and we do not hesitate to reproduce some of his observations , even at the risk of presenting ideas that will seem hackneyed to those who of late years have been following this conflict of educational ideals . ''

		To say that the anarchy which has resulted from confusing the distinction between the study and inter - pretation of Literature as the expression of art and genius , and its study and interpretation as a mere mon - ument of language , has had a more disastrous effect on education generally , would be to state very imperfectly the truth of the case .

		It has led to inadequate and even false conceptions of what constitutes Literature .

		It has led to all that is of essential importance in literary study being ignored , and all that is of secondary or accidental interest being preposterously magnified ; to the substitution of grammatical and verbal commentary for the relation of a literary masterpiece to history , to philosophy , to aesthetics , to the mechanical inculcation of all that can be imparted , as it has been acquired , by cramming , for the intelligent application of principles to expression .

		It has led to the severance of our Lit - erature from all that constitutes its vitality and virtue as an active power , and from all that renders its de - velopment and peculiarities intelligible as a subject of historical study .

		In a word , it has led to a total mis - conception of the ends at which literary instruction should aim , as well as of its most appropriate instru - ments and methods . ''

		This indictment , severe as it is , does not exag - gerate the alarming conditions of literary study in the majority of our universities , and indicates clearly the need of a far-reaching reform .

		In the study of the ancient classics , even more than in the study of modern literature , the same unfortunate conditions obtain , and the young student 's passport to success and professional advancement is too often found , not in his power to interpret the ideas upon which literature is based , and which make it significant , but rather upon the ingenuity with which its mechanical aspects are paraded , or the meticulous work of linguistic and syntac - tical analysis .

		This , too , is an old story , but the importance of classical studies in the de - velopment of culture is so great that their friends can not remain silent while their very existence is jeopardized .

		Classical studies are already too much discredited by the men of their own household , and the most dangerous foe of these studies is the man who , while posing as their champion , does his best to de - stroy their vitality by ignoring their lasting ^ claims to our consideration .

		The immediate suggestion for the above observations was provided us by a paper on '' Classical Teaching in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' written for '' La Kassegna Internazionale '' by
Signor Enrico Corradini	PERSON	.

		Of all countries in the world ,
Italy	LOCATION	should be bound to preserve the methods of the humanities in its teaching of the classics --
Italy	LOCATION	, the birthplace of Latin literature , and one of the ancient seats of Greek civilization .

		But even
Italy	LOCATION	has failed in its obligations , and allowed its classical teaching to degenerate into textual and philological investigations , inta minute studies of historical and archasological questions .


Signor Corradini	PERSON	's personal recol - lections are so much to the point that we have thought it best to translate his own words inta English . ''

		To begin with a recollection of my own , when at the age of eighteen I entered the university for my first course in letters , my first compliment from one of the professors was this : Do n't you know German , yoa must learn German if you wish to profit by your studies .

		I was a youth of moderate intelligence , mod - erately desirous of learning ; I wished to become a fairly good teacher or a fairly good writer ; I had en - tered the university knowing Italian and Latin pretty well , and Greek after a fashion ; but I could have ex - pected anything rather than that an Italian youth , de - sirous of perfecting himself in the literature of his country and in the ancient literatures of which it is the outgrowth , should be advised to begin by learning German .

		I suddenly perceived that I and the worthy professor who gave me that advice must be two persons by nature irreconcilable , and this irreconcilability was soon manifested between me and the other professors , between the little Greek and Latin and Italian taught me in the good old fashion in the college of priests and the much Greek and Latin and Italian which they wished to teach me , scientifically and by modern meth - ods , in the university .

		Thus my four or five years of the university were for me , and , God helping me , will remain , the most Beotian of my whole life .

		What had happened ?

		I had found the historical method , natu - rally the German , in full flower at the university ; that is to say , a manner of teaching on the part of the pro- fessors and a manner of learning on the part of my fellow-students in no wise corresponding to my intel - lectual and moral inclinations , whether I wished to be -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 come a fair teacher or a fair man of letters , not corre - sponding to the nature of those same classical studies , or their genial tradition among us since the days of the Renaissance , not corresponding to the purpose of pre - paring youths for teaching , to the vital character of our people , to the ambition of any intellect or any talent , however modest .

		I found , in short , in place of geni - ality and moral consciousness patient , frivolous , and f ntile research ; in place of any attempt of the spirit of man , brought into contact with the most beautiful lit - erature in the world , to impart its fire and force to hundreds of youths , I found certain cold and dull ultra - montane senilities forcing youths to Benedictine tasks of minute philology and minute history , that they might acquire a perfectly useless education de luxe , whatever serious work they might otherwise have wished to do .

		In place of what we are accustomed to call belles-lettres , I found a scientific criticism , so-called by the ridiculous vanity of those who practice it .

		Homer and Demos - thenes ,
Virgil	PERSON	and Csesar ,
Dante	PERSON	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, as if not sufficiently outraged by the fate that for centuries turned them over to priests and monks , had suffered final disaster by falling into the hands of the new Byzantines from
Austria	LOCATION	and Prtissia . ''

		The language is strong , but who shall say that the strictures are unjust ?

		Those who make themselves the partisans of this sort of classical teaching are apt to say that they are opposing positive knowledge to the nebulous theories of the rhetoricians and aestheticians .

		But these may also claim a positive character for their teachings , and they may add , further - more , in the words of our present advocate , that when classical instruction in
Italy	LOCATION	was in the hands of the rhetorical # estheticians , ' * the classical authors were read because they are great poets , because they are great artists , be - cause they are great philosophers , because they tell us great things , because they are the mir - ror of noble life and the witness of fair humanity . ''

		And again , '' if Greek and Latin are studied throughout the world , it is because the people who spoke those languages were in large measure the fathers of our modern civili - zation , and civilization is humanity , not
Byzan	PERSON	- tine erudition ; if Greek and Latin are studied throughout the world , it is because in them is expressed the maximum potency of life , fair and strong , speculative and active , with which men and races have ever been animated , and this too is humanity , not erudition . ''

		We should like to reproduce this vigorous and elo - quent argument at greater length , did space per - mit ; as it is , we are glad to have had the oppor - tunity of calling thus much of attention to it , and of affirming our belief that it represents an ideal of teaching that now more than ever is needed in the work of higher education , both in
Europe	LOCATION	and in our own country .

		SOME RECENT PHASES OF ENGLISH TE ACHI NG .

		It seems to be generally admitted that no other subject which has a place in the present carricola of secondary schools is so unorganized pedagogic - ally as the study of English .

		The last decade has seen the almost universal adoption in high Echools and academies of a distinct method of science in - straction -- the laboratory method .

		History , too , has developed a pedagogy of its own , in the library method which the college is handing down to pre - paratory schools having the necessary equipment .

		In the teaching of foreigjn languages , especially of Latin and Greek , many of oar difficulties have been met by the first-year books in those languages .

		But the comparatively recent introduction into both schools and colleges of the formal stndy of English has brought into pedagogy a new and perplexing problem which has not as yet been solved .

		We are still in search of a scheme of English instruction on which all are broadly agreed , one which will do for this branch of study what the laboratory method has done for science instruction .

		One of the most obvious reasons for this slow development of a rational plan for the teaching of English is the miscellaneous character of the subject - matter itself .

		Etymology , grammar , formal rhet - oric , oral reading , spelling , composition , literary history and biography , literary criticism , sometimes a coarse in mythology , and the accumulation of a vast amount of general information necessary in the elucidation of the texts of the authors read , are all included under the general term '' English . ''

		In handling this heterogeneous mass of material , it is difficult to maintain a point of view which will give unity and perspective ° to our teaching and make possible a definite and orderly progression from year to year .

		We shall speak first of recent phases of English teaching on its analytical side , -- that is , of methods for the critical examination and study of master - pieces ; and secondly , of the constructive side of the subject , or theme-writing .

		In the study of pieces of literature , the writer has been unable to discover any new tendencies at all large in their scope or general in their accept - ance .

		The discussion of certain topics connected with the particular masterpieces read , the answer - ing of questions on the thought or form , and the learning of sundry footnotes , make up the body of this side of the work .

		In general it may be said that English teaching in its analytical aspect is still in bondage to the word-by-word and line-by-line method of foreign languages , especially of the classics .

		While one should not undervalue the habits of accuracy and precision in thought and expression which result from the practice of looking intently at words , it must be confessed that it is narrow and inadequate as a general plan , for the 854 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, telescopic view of a piece of literature is often as important as the microscopic .

		To study a poem word by word , without realizing its plan or appre - ciating the broad sweep of the author 's thought , is like studying a building brick by brick , without a conception of the whole .

		Many teachers precede this intensive study with a rapid reading of the whole selection , to give the student an idea of the piece as a unit .

		These two methods are as old as literature itself , one of them superficial and the other minute to tediousness .

		We need some new thought in this direction ; but the recent text-books on English , suggestive as many of them are , do not help us .

		They follow traditional lines in the analy - sis and study of literature .

		It is to the constructive side of the subject that we must look for a distinct advance .

		The student 's own composition is being emphasized at present more than any other phase of English study .

		Even the colleges are requiring regular courses in daily themes .

		The student is spending less time upon the passive contemplation of the finished masterpiece of literature , and is trying his hand more often at some construction of his own , however crude .

		He is being taken , as it were , from the picture-gallery of literature into the studio or the workshop ; and his own work , as in other arts and crafts , is being made the basis of the instruction he receives .

		This bringing of constructive work to the front is one of the most promising phases of recent thought on English teaching .

		Another of the hopeful signs of the time is the extension of the sources from which material for composition is drawn .

		The student is no longer confined to abstract ideas and the encyclop '' diafor his thought , but is sent to literature , art , and com - mon life for his theme-material .

		In many schools , home reading-books on which the class is required to report furnish the subject-matter for composition .

		The college entrance requirements set apart a cer - tain number of books to be used in this way .

		An - other means by which material for themes has been extended is by the use of pictures .

		This is a feature of some of the newer books on the subject , and is derived from the practice of the elementary schools which have long made use of both art and literature in language work .

		The third and most important source from which students are now encouraged to draw their material is common life .

		We find many of the colleges to-day beginning their instruction in English with a theme-course that allows the student to derive his thought from ordinary experience .

		This is the social side of the study of composition , and deserves more emphasis than the aesthetic side developed by the study of literature and pictures .

		The result of this enlargement of theme-material is to show the young writer that he may find his subject-matter in the objective world and is not obliged to spin it painfully from the dark recesses of his own brain .

		Along with this widening of the thought side of composition has gone a narrowing of the scope of the formal rhetoric required in any one year , and a distribution of the departments of rhetoric , so that in many schools narration and description con - stitute the first year 's work , exposition that of the second , argumentation and persuasion that of the third , with a review of these five divisions in
the fourth year	DATE	.

		Another recent tendency to be noted is the in - creasing importance attached to the construction of wholes .

		The complete theme is being made the basis of instruction , and is taking the place in some measure of miscellaneous exercises on the smaller elements of discourse -- the word , the sentence , and the paragraph .

		The older rhetorics made exercises on these minor elements their chief concern , and aimed mainly at mere accuracy in mechanical , grammatical , and rhetorical detail .

		They began with the word and ended with the theme .

		The present tendency is to reverse this order , putting the theme first .

		As a mason learns to handle and fit his bricks by laying them in an actual wall , so the young writer should be taught to handle the word , the sentence , and the paragraph , as parts of a concrete whole which he is creating .

		It is clear to any one who has been thinking on this very perplexing question that this emphasis upon the construction of wholes , the extension of the thought-side or subject-matter , and the narrow - ing of the scope of formal rhetoric to one depart - ment at a time , are all tendencies in the right direction .

		And yet we are far from regarding the problem as solved .

		Our recent writers on this sub - ject leave the student in the position of an untrained workman who is shown the quarry where his stones lie , and is told that he is not to spend his time chiselling and polishing separate stones , but that his work is to build a church in accordance with certain general principles of architecture , namely , proportion , symmetry , etc. , of which laws he has as vague a notion as the young student has of the laws of literary unity , coherence , and emphasis .

		What the workman needs is a design which he can follow until he has learned the use and proper relation to each other of the necessary members or features of all architecture , the arch , pier , roof , wall , buttress , and apertures .

		Only after he has seen these ele - ments in carefully organized structures is he capable of making intelligent designs of his own .

		The in - experienced writer , too , needs more help than the text-books give him in the organization of his ma - terial according to long-accepted general designs which we can find by the analysis of pieces of litera - ture .

		We feel that the next step in the development of a distinct pedagogy for English teaching must be an attempt to solve this problem of organization .

		We have new material , but no new method for either literary analysis or synthesis .

		MR. JE5SSUP AS A CRITIC OF MR.
FREDERIC HARRISON	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		That a first-hand critic may occasionally '' change his pace '' in the logical sequence of an argument is not at all times greatly to be marvelled at .

		But when a second-hand critic , endeavoring to expose in the un - broken tracks of his forerunner the existence of such change of pace , stumbles and falls headlong , obliter - ating both his own prints and those of the innocent first - hand critic , and scattering dust into the eyes of his knowledge-seeking audience , in what degree shall we marvel ?

		In the last issue of The Dial , Mr.
Alexander Jessup	PERSON	criticises Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's masterly estimate of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		And why ?

		Because Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	in his criticism of '' In Memoriam '' advances among the cons that : '' With all its art , melody , and charm , we see from time to time in • In Memoriam ' a little too visibly the `` sad mechanic exercise ' which is the inevitable re - sult of too rigid and prolonged devotion to the uses of * measured language . ' ''

		And , a little farther on in the same essay , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	speaks of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's ' `` relig - ious and philosophical pieces -LRB- especially ' In Memoriam , ' the most perfect of his poems -RRB- , because his claim to rank as the supreme poet of the nineteenth century must rest on this if on anything '' ; while a little farther on still Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	continues : `` * It is a far happier task to turn to the more distinctly lyrical work of
Tennyson	LOCATION	-- that whereon his permanent fame must abide . ''

		The italics in both cases are Mr.
Jessup	PERSON	's ; and he italicizes because it seems to him that though `` most admirers of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	will agree with Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	in his latter statement , ... it is hard for them to under - stand his -LRB- Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's -RRB- singular disagreement with himself '' ; and -LRB- to draw towards a close with Mr.
Jes	PERSON	- sup 's ```` pique '' -RRB- though '' In two different books , or even in two different essays in the same book , such contra - dictions of view might be excused on the ground of changed views , ... in the same essay they can not be allowed to pass unchallenged , -- especially as Mr.
Har	PERSON	- rison 's Tennyson • estimate ' is full of ' this sort of thing . ' ''

		Is further exposition necessary to reveal the hoUow - ness of such arguments against Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's excel - lent criticism -- a criticism which only misses the quali - fication `` unequalled '' because its entire dimensions -- depth , breadth , height , -- and its learned soundness , are almost consistently the characteristic of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's critical work ?

		However , if only for the benefit of Mr.
Jessup	PERSON	himself , let me put the '' vexed '' question in its plainest form : 1 . ''

		lu Memoriam '' is the most perfect of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's poems , though it has its weaknesses ; as a philosophical poem it strikes the key-note of nineteenth century thought , and in so doing it places itself in the balance against every circa-eonteraporary work sharing that characteristic ; if , ipso facto , '' In Memoriam '' turns the scales ,
Tennyson	PERSON	is the poet who , as the prophet of his `` day , '' may `` claim to rank as the supreme poet of the nineteenth century . ''

		2 .

		And there is also to be weighed , quite independ - ently , the lyrical works of the poet -- work whose tune is in harmony with the song of all time -- not merely with the current fugue of an epoch , -- of a day .

		Herein is the immortality of the poet
Tennyson	PERSON	proven ; for it is to these pieces that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	declares '' it is a far happier task to turn '' -- the work '' whereon his permanent fame must abide . ''

		In short , not only is Tennyson possibly the first poet of his century , but he is a poet of all time .

		Mr.
Jessup	PERSON	concludes : '' With such futilities as these does Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	regale us in his essay on
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Such captious dissections and philological peckings are but the tin-soldiery of literary criticism ... Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	can write good criticism and he does write it elsewhere in this volume ; but the essay on
Tennyson	PERSON	is * of little worth . ' ''

		The fact is at all events patent to any logical reader that if such bottomless cavillings are the gist of Mr.
Jessup	PERSON	's objections to the '' Criticism on
Tennyson	PERSON	, '' they , indeed , are objections '' of little worth '' -- are the very tin hobby-horses of second-hand criticism .

		The number of Japanese honored with the degree of LL.D .

		from
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	universities is increasing .

		A year ago
Baron Kaneko	PERSON	, who had received LL.B .

		from
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	in the 80 's , was honored with LL.D .

		by his alma mater .

		Recently Glasgow Uni - versity conferred the same degree on Prof.
J. Sakurni	PERSON	, of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, -- the first instance in the case of a British institution .


Yale University	ORGANIZATION	is to confer the same degree on Hon.
K. Hatoyama	PERSON	, one of her own sons ; and is reported to have offered the degree also to Hon. Mr.
Kiknchi	PERSON	, Minister of
Ekiuca	LOCATION	- tion , and to
Marquis Ito	PERSON	.

		These honors are worthily bestowed on able and scholarly men .

		The scholars of
Japan	LOCATION	are naturally proud of the fact , that , by the generosity of
Baron Iwosaki	PERSON	, the
Max Miiller Library	ORGANIZATION	has been purchased for the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	in `` rokyo , in accordance with the wishes of the late owner , and is expected to arrive soon .

		The
Foreign Language School	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, continues to grow in favor and influence .

		At its recent graduation ceremony , ninety-two students were gfiven certificates , of which the largest number were for courses in Chi - nese , English , German , French , and Russian .

		A history of English literature , written in a most entertaining way by Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	, is meeting with great favor .

		One paper says : `` Next to Chinese lit - erature in the influence it has had on our national life stands English literature . ''

		A recent issue of the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' has the follow - ing item : ''
Baron Takasaki	PERSON	, Chief of the Poets ' Bureau in the Palace , says that the Emperor 's love of poetry increases with years .

		Scarcely an evening passes that His Majesty does not compose from 27 to 30 of the thirty-one-syllabled couplets called Wa-ka .

		These are handed to
Baron Takasaki	PERSON	for examination .


Baron Takasaki	PERSON	has held his present position since
1892	DATE	, and he declares that the number of couplets composed by His Majesty from that time up to the end of
last March	DATE	was thirty-seven thousand .

		The
Empress	ORGANIZATION	also is very fond of writing verses , but Her Majesty 's pen is not so prolific as that of the Emperor .

		She com - poses about two couplets twice a week -- quite enough for any ordinary mortal , we venture to think . ''

		* The task of preparing and presenting to an eager world an adequate life of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	may well have seemed a formidable one , especially after the two volumes of '' Let - ters '' 80 admirably edited by Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	; and the public regret at Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's inability to write the promised biography has naturally been accompanied by some uncertainty as to the qualifications of Mr.
Graham Balfour	PERSON	, who was requested to undertake the work .

		Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	was for many years
Stevenson	PERSON	's most intimate literary friend ; Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	was heard of chiefly as one of
Stevenson	PERSON	's fifty-odd first cousins .

		But Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	saw his friend for the last time in
1887	DATE	, when he bade him good - bye at the ship 's side in
London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	resided as a member of the family at
Vailima	LOCATION	during the
last two and a half years	DATE	of his cousin 's life , and was admitted to an intimacy shared only by the immediate members of the household .

		His acquaintance with every de - tail of the family history , remote or recent , seems both extensive and exact .

		His oppor - tunities , therefore , were unique ; and it may be said at once that he has not been unequal to them .

		To complain that the `` Life '' is less inspiring than the '' Letters '' -- in other words , that Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	is not
Stevenson	PERSON	-- is a criti - cism which should quickly be disarmed by the author 's modest and candid words in the preface . ''

		In
Stevenson	PERSON	's case , if anywhere , the rule holds , that all biography should be autobiography if it could ; and I have availed myself as far as possible of the writings in which he has referred to himself and his past experience .

		To bring together the passing allusions to himself scattered widely throughout his works , was an obvious duty ; at the same time my longer quotations , except in two or three manifest and necessary instances , have been taken almost entirely from the material which was hitherto either unpublished or issued only in the limited
Edinburgh	LOCATION	edition . ''

		On this plan Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has written a nar - rative not unlike
Hallam Tennyson	PERSON	's Life of his father ; and these two volumes may with propriety take their place on the shelf next to the '' Letters '' and the best editions of the '' Collected Works . ''

Robert Stevenson	PERSON	, in
1807	DATE	`` began his great work at the
Bell Rock	ORGANIZATION	, the first lighthouse ever erected far from land upon a reef deeply submerged at every tide . '' ''

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	accompanied the Commissioners and their officer on one of the annual voyages of the Pharos -LRB- the board 's official steamer -RRB- ; his Journal , pub - lished by
Lockbart	LOCATION	, shows that he found
Robert Steven	PERSON	- son an appreciative and intelligent companion .

		The Pirate and The Lord of the Isles were the direct result of this cruise . ''

		A great engineer and man of action ,
Robert Stevenson	PERSON	also essayed writing , and his '' Ac - count of the Bell Rock Lighthouse '' has been happily described as the '' romance of stone and lime , '' and the ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	of en - gineering . ''

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	adds : `` Traits are obliterated , and the characteristics of a family may change , but the old man 's detestation of everything slovenly or dishonest , ' his interest in the whole page of Experience , and his perpetual quest and fine scent for all that seems romantic to a boy , ' were handed dowu , if ever taste was transmitted , to his grandson .

		Of the one as of the other it will have been said that ' Perfection was his design . ' ''

		The other grandfather was the Rev.
Lewis Balfour	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, minister of
Colinton	LOCATION	, a parish about five miles from
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		In '' Mem - ories and Portraits '' he is described as follows : '' A man of singular simplicity of nature ; unemotional , and hating the display of what he felt ; standing con - tented on the old ways ... When not abroad , he sat much alone , writing sermons or letters to his scattered family in a dark and cold room with a library of bloodless books -- and these lonely hours wrapped him in the greater gloom for our imaginations . ''

		But his heart warmed to the sprightly delicate little `` Smoutie , '' his grandson , when the boy came in to recite a psalm . ''

		He took me in his arms , with most unwonted tenderness , and kissed me , and gave me a little kindly sermon for my psalm : so that for that day , we were clerk and parson . '' ''

		Try as I will , ''
Stevenson	PERSON	later wrote , `` I can not join myself on with the reverend doctor ; and all the while , no doubt , and even as I write the phrase , he moves in my blood and whispers words to me , and sits efficient in the very knot and centre of my being . ''

		Such , and much besides , were his grand - fathers .

		Of his father ,
Thomas Stevenson	PERSON	, his inspired pen has left us many a vivid portraiture ; none , possibly , of bolder outline than this , from '' Memories and Portraits '' : '' He was a man of a somewhat antique strain ; with a blended sternness and softness that was wholly Scottish , and at first somewhat bewildering ; with a profound essential melancholy of disposition and -LRB- what often accompanies it -RRB- the most humorous geniality in com - ^ < -LRB- - ``''
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 357 pany ; shrewd and childish ; passionately attached and passionately prejudiced ; a man of many extremes , many faults of temper , and no very stable foothold for himself among life 's troubles ... His talk , compounded of so much sterling sense and so much freakish humor , and clothed in language so apt , droll , and emphatic , was a perpetual delight to all who knew him . ''

		We are not surprised when Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	says that '' the characteristics of the father in his boyhood might be ascribed with little alteration to the son .

		The circumstances differed , but the spirits , the freaks , and the idleness were the same . ''

		Of their relations to each other he adds : ''
Thomas Stevenson	PERSON	's entire life was devoted to the unremitting pursuit of a scientific profession in which it was his dearest wish to see his son following in his footsteps .

		Yet it was from him that
Louis	PERSON	derived all the romantic and artistic elements that drew him away from engineering , and were the chief means by which he became an acknowledged master of his art . ''

		The differences between the pair were slight , the points of resemblance many .

		The younger man devoted his life to art , and not to science , and the bold of dogma upon him was early relaxed .

		But the humor and the melancholy , the sternness and the softness , the attach - ments and the prejudices , the chivalry , the generosity , the Celtic temperament , and the sensitive conscience passed direct from father to son in proportions but slightly varied , and to some who knew them both well , the father was the more remarkable of the two .

		One period of misunderstanding they had , but it was brief , and might have been avoided had either of the pair been less sincere or less in earnest .

		Afterward , and perhaps as a consequence , their comprehension and appreciation of each other grew complete , and their attachment was even deeper than that usually subsisting between father and only son . ''


Stevenson	PERSON	left no sketch of his mother , a fact easily understood when it is remembered that she outlived him .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	supplies this deficiency with a description from which we can make only the briefest extract .

		`` In person she was tall , slender , and graceful ; and her face and complexion retained their beauty , as her figure and walk preserved their elasticity , to the last .

		Her vivacity and brightness were most attractive ... Her undaunted spirit led her when nearly sixty to ac - company her son first to
America	LOCATION	, and then , in a racing schooner , through the remotest groups of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, finally to settle with him in the undisturbed spot where he had chosen his home . ''

		And what a stimulus to his spiritual qualities must have been afforded by the society and conversation of his best-loved cousin ,
Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson	PERSON	, -- the '' Bob '' so affectionately commemorated in '' Memories and Portraits . '' ''

		He was the most valuable man to talk to , above all , in his younger days ; for he twisted like a serpent , changed like the patterns in a kaleidoscope , transmi - grated -LRB- it is the only word -RRB- from one point of view to another with a swiftness and completeness that left a stupid and merely logical mind panting in the rear ; and so , in an incredibly brief space of time helped you to view a question upon every side .

		In sheer trenchancy of mind I have ever been his humble and distant follower . ''

		These are but glances at a few of the people who surrounded and , so far as in them lay , affected the childhood of
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son .

		He was always '' being a boy '' : in a special sense he may be called the sacer votes of childhood .

		Few writers have retained such continuous impressions of childhood 's dreams and realizations ; none , surely , has voiced them more truthfully .

		The delights of boyish '' make - believe '' received their crown for young
Louis	PERSON	and his associates in the '' lantern-bearers , '' a sport whose description it were almost profane to abridge . ''

		Toward the end of
September	DATE	, when school-time was drawing near and the nights were already black , we would begin to sally from our respective villas , each equipped with a tin bull 's - eye lantern .

		The thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce of
Great Britain	LOCATION	; and the grocers , about the due time , began to garnish their windows with our particular brand of luminary .

		We wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt , and over them , such was the rigour of the game , a buttoned top-coat .

		They smelled noisomely of blistered tin ; they never burned aright , though they were always burning our fingers ; their use was naught ; the pleasure of them merely fanciful ; and yet a boy with a bull 's - eye under his coat asked for nothing more ... When two of these asses met , there would be an anxious < Have you got your lantern ? '

		and a gratified • Yes . '

		That was the shibboleth , and very needful , too ; for as it was the rule to keep our glory contained , none could recognize a lantern-bearer , unless -LRB- like a polecat -RRB- by the smell .

		Four or five would some - times climb into the beUy of a ten-man lugger , with nothing but the thwarts above them -- for the cabin was usually locked -- or choose out some hollow of the links where the wind might whistle overhead .

		There the coats would be unbuttoned and the bull 's - eyes discov - ered ; and in the chequering glimmer , under the huge windy hall of the
night	TIME	, and cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware , these fortunate young gentlemen would crouch together in the cold sand of the links or on the scaly bilges of the fishing-boat , and delight themselves with inappropriate talk . ''

		Woe is me that I may not give some specimens -- some of their foresights of life , or deep inquiries into the rudiments of man and nature -- these were so fiery and so innocent , they were so richly silly , so romantic - ally young .

		But the talk , at any rate , was but a condi - ment ; and these gatherings themselves only accidents in the career of the lantern-bearer .

		The essence of this bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night ; the slide shut , the top-coat buttoned ; not a ray escaping , whether to conduct your footsteps , or to make your glory public : a mere pillar of darkness in the dark ; and all the while , deep down in the privacy of your fool 's heart , to know you had a bull 's - eye at your belt , and to exult and sing over the knowledge . ''


Stevenson	PERSON	had but scattered schooling , and his college life at the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	358 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, -LRB- 1867-70 -RRB- was fruitful chiefly in giving to him an intimate knowledge of the highways and byways of
Auld Reekie	PERSON	, and in demon - strating conclusively that he would never make an engineer , the profession for which he was ■ of course intended .

		As far as the
University	ORGANIZATION	was concerned , he '' acted upon an extensive and highly rational system of truantry , which cost him a great deal of trouble to put in exercise . ''

		His studies were thus mainly in the book of life : not unfruitful , as his readers well know .

		Perhaps the two most notable things of those academic days were his mem - bership in the Speculative Society of the Uni - versity -- '' that ' Spec ' of which the fame has gone abroad in the world largely by means of his writings , '' -- and his coming under the whole - some influence of Professor
Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	and his charming wife ; together with other such friendships , as those with
Charles Baxter	PERSON	,
James Walter Ferrier	PERSON	, and Sir
Walter Simpson	PERSON	.

		Somewhat later , in an English visit , he met
Sid	PERSON	- ney
Colvin	PERSON	and Mrs.
Sitwell	PERSON	, whose correspond - ence with
Stevenson	PERSON	is so richly informing .

		In one of his morbid moods , now growing happily rarer , he had written down the chief desires of his heart . ''

		First , good health ; secondly , a small competence ; and thirdly , O du lieber GottI friends . ''

		The second and third of these petitions were surely answered : but the first -- I Was ever man of genius so ruthlessly handicapped ?

		Almost from the cradle the pitiful record of the struggle begins ; every ugly form of pulmonary disease wreaked itself in experiment upon his corpus vile : pleu - risy , congestion , pneumonia , hemorrhages , -- these were their household words where the rest of the world speaks of malaria , indigestion , or headache .

		In
1893	DATE	he wrote to Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	: `` For fourteen years I have not had a day 's real health : I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary ; and I have done my work unflinchingly .

		I have writ - ten in bed , and written out of it , written in hemorrhages , written in sickness , written torn by coughing , written when my head swam for weakness .

		And the battle goes on -- ill or well , is a trifle ; so as it goes .

		I was made for a contest , and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield should be this dingy , inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle . ''

		Of the magnificent heroism and sunny sweet - ness with which he endured all this , we must learn from these volumes of Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- four ; for the '' Letters '' and other writings allow us only to guess at them .

		The pathetic record is full of reproach to common comfort - able existences , but has its inspiration for all who have ears to hear .

		We need feel no shame for the tears which start as we read such an instance as this , taken from the account of their sojourn on the
Riviera	LOCATION	in 1883-1884 , when
Stevenson	PERSON	was attacked with the most violent and dangerous hemorrhage of his life : '' The dust of street refuse gave him Egyptian ophthalmia , and sciatica descending upon him caused him the more pain , as he was suffering already from restlessness .

		The hemorrhage was not yet healed , and we now hear for the first time of the injunctions to ab - solute silence , orders patiently obeyed , distasteful as they were .

		In silence and the dark , and in acute suf - fering , he was still cheery and undaunted .

		When the ophthalmia began and the doctor first announced his diagnosis , Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	felt that it was more than any one could be expected to bear , and went into another room , and there , in her own phrase , ' sat and gloomed . '

		Louis rang his bell , and she went to him , saying , in the bitterness of her spirit , as she entered the room , ' Well , I suppose that this is the very best thing that could have happened ! '

		` Why , how odd ! '

		wrote
Louis	LOCATION	on a piece of paper , ' I was just going to say those very words . ' ''

		It was on his visit to
London	LOCATION	in
1873	DATE	that
Stevenson	PERSON	was `` ordered South '' by Sir An - drew
Clark	PERSON	, and went for the winter to Men - tone .

		This was the first of those extended quests which were to make him an exile from
England	LOCATION	for practically the rest of his life , though he often came back and attempted to stay at home . ''

		I do not ask for health , '' he once said , '' but I will go anywhere and live in any place where I can enjoy the ordinary ex - istence of a human being . ''

		One after another they were all tried :
Mentone	LOCATION	,
Davos	LOCATION	, H ^ eres ,
Bournemouth	LOCATION	; then , with lengthening range , the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, and finally those '' Ultimate Islands '' where he found alleviation , delights , a quiet home , and a mountain grave .

		His life was undoubtedly blessed and prob - ably lengthened by the companionship and devoted care of the interesting woman whom he met and loved in
France	LOCATION	, followed to
America	LOCATION	, and there married in
1880	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Osbourne	PERSON	's first marriage had been unhappy ; but her union with
Stevenson	PERSON	was a source of happiness to both , and her two clever and affectionate chil - dren found in their stepfather a delightful friend and guide .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's second volume describes the three years of life at
Bournemouth	LOCATION	, 1884-1887 ; then the winter spent at
Saranac Lake	ORGANIZATION	in the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	, with the details of which
Ameri	PERSON	- can readers of the '' Letters '' are familiar ; and then come the chapters devoted to those pro- longed and romantic cruises in the
Pacific	LOCATION	which meant so much to
Stevenson	PERSON	's body and soul .

		The '' Casco , '' a topsail schooner , ninety -

		THE DIAL 359 five feet in length , of seventy tons burden , was chartered at
San Francisco	LOCATION	; the captain , the cook , and a crew of four deck-hands , formed her complement ; and the passenger-list included
Stevenson	PERSON	, his wife , his mother , and his step-son .

		`` At last , on
June 26th , 1888	DATE	, the party took up their quarters on the ' Casco , ' and at the dawn of the 28th she was towed outside the Golden Gate , and beaded for the south across the long swell of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		So with his household he sailed away beyond the sunset , and
America	LOCATION	, like
Europe	LOCATION	, was to see him no more . ''

		From the published chapters '' In the South Seas '' Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	makes but sparing excerpts , relying rather on
Stevenson	PERSON	's original rough journal at the time , as striking a more personal note and dealing to a greater extent with his individual experience .

		The first voyage carried them to the
Marquesas Islands	LOCATION	after a run of twenty-two days .

		His reception there was cordial , and his vivid impressions of this French possession so recently redeemed from cannibal - ism are for the most part recorded in his published works .

		But we have from his note - book a charming picture of the good French missionary Pere Simeon . ''

		The small frail figure in the black robe , drawing near under the palms ; the girlish , kind and somewhat pretty face under the straw hat ; the strong
Gascon	PERSON	accent ; the sudden lively doCBog of the hat , at once so French and so ecclesiastical ; he was a man you could not look upon without visions of his peasant ancestors , worthy folk , sitting at home today in
France	LOCATION	, and re - joiced -LRB- I hope often -RRB- with letters from their boy . ''

		Pfere Simeon admired these natives as I do myself , admired them with spiritual envy ; the superior of his congregation had said to him on his departure ' Yon are going among a people more civilized than we -- peut-etre plus civilises que nous-memes . '

		What then was P ^ re Simeon doing here ?

		The question rose in my mind , and I could see that he read the thought .

		Truly they were a people , on the whole , of a mind far liker Christ than any of the races of
Europe	LOCATION	: no spiritual life , almost no family life , but a kindness , a generosity , a readiness to give and to forgive , without parallel ; to some extent that was the bishop 's doing ; some of it had been since undone ; death runs so busy in their midst , total extinction so instantly impended , that it seemed a hopeless task to combat their vices ; as they were , they would go down in the abyss of things past ; the watchers were already looking at the clock ;
Pfere Simeon	PERSON	's business was the visitation of the sick , to smooth the pillows of this dying family of man . ''

		We can not follow the detailed itinerary of these floatings through the ''
summer	DATE	isles of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, lying in dark purple spheres of sea . ''

		Seen by such eyes and reported by such a pen , they have yielded to us all no small part of their magical charm .

		From one group to an - other the little party wove their way until the last thread was drawn ashore at
Apia	LOCATION	, there to await the shears of Atropos .

		Of the last years at Yaillma Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	writes with considerable fulness , having been a resident of the place along with the family , though not there when the end came so suddenly on the 3d of
December , 1894	DATE	.

		The touching and romantic circumstances of the burial of
Tusitala	LOCATION	are known to all the world ; and Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	simply repeats Mr.
Osboume	PERSON	's admirable account from the '' Letters . ''

		He allows himself , however , a chapter -LRB- headed with the simple initials ''
R. L. S.	PERSON	'' -RRB- of appre - ciation of the genius and character of
Steven	PERSON	- son , which is so admirably conceived and so temperately and tenderly expressed , that few readers will fail to return to it a second and a third time .

		Quotation in this case is almost mutilation , but here are one or two of the closing paragraphs : '' There was this about him , that he was the only man I have ever known who possessed charm in a high de - gree whose character did not suffer from the possession .

		The gift comes naturally to women , and they are at their best in its exercise .

		But a man requires to be of a very sound fibre before he can be entirely himself and keep his heart single , if he carries about with him a talisman to obtain from all men and all women the ob - ject of his heart 's desire .

		Both g ^ fts
Stevenson	PERSON	pos - sessed , not only the magic but also the strength of char - acter to which it was safely entrusted . ''

		There linger on the lips of men a few names that bring to us , as it were , a breeze blowing off the shores of youth .

		Most of those who have borne them were taken from the world before early promise could be fulfilled , and so they rank in our regard by virtue of their possibilities alone .


Stevenson	PERSON	is among the fewer men who bear the award both of promise and of achieve - ment , and is happier yet in this : besides admiration and hope he has raised within the hearts of his readers a personal feeling towards himself which is nothing less deep than love . ''

		The publishers have given Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's volumes a handsome setting .

		There is a good index ; and seven appendices , containing ad - dresses of
Stevenson	PERSON	on education and missions , a list of the beautiful
Vailima Prayers	LOCATION	, four drafts of the opening chapter of ''
Weir	PERSON	of Her - miston '' to illustrate the author 's patient pains in composition , a complete chronological bibli - ography of his works , and a curious dozen of samples , nine from
Stevenson	PERSON	and three from his `` originals , '' showing his power of using other men 's style at will while forming his own .

		Students can exercise their ingenuity in '' plac - ing '' these specimens , some of which are , in - deed , unmistakable .

		Besides the portraits of
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	, there is an interesting chart of the
Pacific	LOCATION	voyages , oddly added to the first vol - ume , while describing events of the second .

		860 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, The Origin or European Peoples .

		* The author of '' The Mediterranean Race '' is Professor of Anthropology in the
University of Rome	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is one of the foremost workers in Anthropology and is notably bold and in - dependent in thought .

		He fearlessly criticizes those anthropological methods which he believes to be imperfect , and insists upon new ones , which he believes to be better .

		Anthropolog - ists in general give much weight to the Cephalic index -- or the proportion between the length and breadth of the skull .

		Sergi insists that it has but little value , that the same cephalic index may be given by skulls which differ pro- foundly in character .

		He himself says : '' According to my method of cranial forms , it is the forms alone that we have to take into consideration , and I have shown that the same cranial form may vary in measurements and in index without losing its char - acters ; this is a natural method , such as is employed in zoology .

		How many species of lark we should have if we calculated hy measurement their indices of length and breadth ! ''

		We shall gain the clearest idea of the author 's treatment by stating nine propositions , which he formulates : '' 1 .

		The primitive populations of
Europe	LOCATION	, after
Homo Neanderthalensis	PERSON	, originated in
Africa	LOCATION	; these constituted the entire population of neolithic times .

		`` 2 .

		The basin of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	was the chief centre of movement whence the African migrations reached the centre and the north of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		3 From the great African stock were formed three varieties ... ; one peculiarly African ... ; another , the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	... ; and a third the Nordic ... These three varieties are the three great branches of one species , which I call Eurafrican , because it occupied , and still occupies , a large portion of the two continents of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		`` 4 .

		These three human varieties have nothing in cemmon with the so-called Aryan races ; ... the Ger - mans and Scandinavians are Eurafricans of the Nordic variety . ''

		5 .

		The Aryans are of Asiatic origin , and constitute a variety of the Eurasiatic speciesj the physical characters of their skeletons are different from those of the Eur - africans .

		`` 6 .

		The primitive civilization of the Eurafricans is Afro -
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, becoming eventually Afro - European . ''

		7 .

		The Mycenaean civilization had its origin in
Asia	LOCATION	, and was transformed by diffusion in the Medi - terranean .

		`` 8 .

		The two classic civilizations , Greek and Latin , were not Aryan , but
Mediterranean	LOCATION	... `` 9 .

		In the course of the Aryan invasion the lan - guages of the Eurafrican species in
Europe	LOCATION	were trans - formed in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and elsewhere ,
Celtic	ORGANIZATION	, German ,
Slavonic	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , being genuine branches of the Aryan tongue ; iu other cases the Aryan languages underwent ♦ The Meditbbbanban Race .

		a transformation , preserving some elements of the conquered tongues , as in the Neo-Celtic of
Wales	LOCATION	. ''

		To the reader who has not followed the re - cent periodical literature of anthropology , these propositions may come as a distinct shock .

		They upset some of the cherished dogmas of linguistic and anthropological science .

		Sergi proceeds to develope and sustain them in a brilliant way .

		He first presents an historical sketch of the phases of Indo-Germanism .

		Next , he presents a detailed study of the Mediter - ranean Race .

		The Hamitic peoples of North - ern
Africa	LOCATION	-- the Libyans , Egyptians , Western Libyans , and the population of the
Canary Islands	ORGANIZATION	, are referred to this race , and are stated to differ only as local varieties of one great type .

		The peoples of
Syria	LOCATION	and
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, past and present , are examined and referred to the same race .

		The Iberians ,
Pelasgians	LOCATION	,
Etruscans	LOCATION	, and Ligurians are
South Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans , of the Mediterranean Race , who have migrated by various routes from the old African home .

		The extension of the race northward is claimed upon British , French , Swiss , German , Bohemian , Scandinavian , and Russian evi - dence .

		The light doliehocephals -LRB- long-heads -RRB- of the north are only locally-modified dark doliehocephals from the south .

		Sergi holds that the diffusion of the
Mediterranean Race	ORGANIZATION	was interrupted by the immigration , from
Asia	LOCATION	, of the Eurasian Aryans , who in physical type , in language , and in culture , were unlike the Eurafricans .

		They were inferior in culture to the older population of
Europe	LOCATION	, but were , apparently , more vigorous and aggressive .

		The whole argument is fundamentally anthropo - logical , based upon skull-form , but much and able use is made of archaeological and other evidence .

		In the presence of this brilliant presentation we naturally ask whether it can be harmonized with the teachings of others regarding
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean ethnology .

		Three good general discus - sions of this field have been lately published --
Keane	PERSON	's ,
Ripley	PERSON	's , and
Deniker 's	ORGANIZATION	.


Keane	PERSON	has been much influenced by Sergi and by
Ripley	LOCATION	.

		For him there are three European races -- Homoeuropaeus ,
Homo	PERSON	alpinus , Homo mediterranensis .

		The first and third of these correspond to
Sergi	ORGANIZATION	's two divisions of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	Race ; the second to
Sergi	ORGANIZATION	's Eurasians .

		But
Keane	PERSON	considers the northern H. europaeus to be Asiatic and Aryan and the H. alpinus to be Asiatic and , probably , non-Aryan .

		He recognizes
Africa	LOCATION	as the oriffinal home of H. mediterranensis .

		He also
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		361 believes that an early short-headed -LRB- brachy - cephalic -RRB- population entered
Europe	LOCATION	from the south .

		Ripley recognizes three European races -- Teutonic ,
Alpine	LOCATION	, and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		So far as regards the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	Race proper he would probably agree with Sergi .

		As regards the Asiatic origin of his Alpine -LRB- brachyceph - alic -- short - headed -RRB- Race he would also agree with Sergi , but probably does not consider them Aryans .

		Regarding the origin of the Teutonic Race he is somewhat reserved .

		Deniker recognizes ten races and sub-races in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He characterizes them carefully , employing stature , complexion , hair , cephalic index , nose form , etc. , as his basis of classifi - cation .

		He presents the synonymy of his ten race-types with care , but we can hardly present or discuss it here .

		For Sergi ,
Deniker	ORGANIZATION	's ten types would be so many local varieties or sub - varieties of his two species -- Eurafrican and Eurasian .

		It will be seen that
Sergi	ORGANIZATION	's book has great importance .

		Some of his views , which , when he first proposed them , were ridiculed , have already gained acceptance .

		Whether all his views will eventually be accepted or not , he deserves a respectful hearing .

		* The appearance of the third volume of Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's '' History of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	and Protectorate , '' so soon after the publica - tion of the second volume -LRB- 1897 -RRB- , gives new foundation for the hope that the author may live to complete the monumental work to which he has devoted his life .

		The present volume shows no falling off from that high standard of workmanship which long experience has taught Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's readers to expect from his hands , -- unless possibly -LRB- one hardly more than imagines it -RRB- in some slight traces of hur - ried composition .

		As for the rest , there is the same masterly handling of material , the same keen insight into the motives of men , the same cool unbiassed judgment and unflinching cour - age in presenting results .

		tectorate Parliament ; i. e. , from
1654	DATE	to
1656	DATE	.

		It includes the incidents in
Cromwell	LOCATION	's career which are the most di # Bcult for his admirers to explain consistently with the idealizations of the cult of nineteenth century hero-worshipers .

		It goes without saying that Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	has no theory to establish , and that he strives simply to set forth the facts with that absolute integrity which has given him his high rank , not only among the historians of this age , but of all time .

		In fact , after one has read this volume , the conviction is strengthened that
Cromwell	PERSON	can never be understood , much less dealt with justly , if he is to be held up to latter-day stand - ards or be pedestaled by the side of latter-day heroes .

		His motives , his ideals , were of the seventeenth century , and of the early seven - teenth century at that .

		With these motives he was consistent ; to these ideals he was true ; but neither men nor motives nor ideals can have place in this age of political and religions light .

		Cromwell was called to the government of the three kingdoms at a time when the fires of the Thirty Years ' War were still smouldering , when its grim traditions were still fresh upon men 's minds , and the renewal of the struggle between
Protestant Europe	LOCATION	and
Catholic Europe	LOCATION	, as statesmen regarded things then , was one of the possibilities of the immediate future .

		Only so can we understand the utter obtuseness of the Protector to the actual con - ditions which confronted
Europe	LOCATION	in
1654	DATE	, and his failure to grasp the fact that the old motives which had determined the friendships and the animosities of the era of religious wars were passing away , and that a new series of motives , born not of religious traditions but of commer - cial hopes and ambitions , had taken possession of the statesmen of
Europe	LOCATION	and were to dic - tate the alliances and counter-alliances of the future .

		Cromwell was not without glimpses of the new day at hand ; but his mind was still darkened by the shadows of the night which was passing away .

		Hence he moved with un - certain step ; was frequently inconsistent with his own avowed purpose ; and , to the worldly - wise statesmen of the Continent , at times ap - parently '' infamously hypocritical . ''

		He failed to discern the threat of future commercial and colonial rivalry that lay in the upbuilding of
Holland	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and wasted his time in striving to draw the Protestant powers of
Europe	LOCATION	into an offensive alliance against the Catholic powers .

		As the immediate future was to reveal , the real menace to
England	LOCATION	was not to come from poor old bankrupt
Spain	LOCATION	, or the sorely - 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, crippled German branch of the
House of Aus	ORGANIZATION	- tria , but first from the waxing commercial power of
Holland	LOCATION	, and second from the waxing political ambitions of
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	does not try to apologize for this serious error in
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's foreign policy .

		He simply sets forth the facts , leaving them to present to the reader the real
Cromwell	PERSON	, -- not the far-seeing statesman , the wise diplomat , the founder of British foreign policy , but a blun - dering soldier , thoroughly honest at heart , who by the accident of revolution had been put in charge of the delicate machinery of diplomacy -- a machinery far too delicate for the rough hand of the swordsman .

		Hence , the great Oliver hardly appears here to advantage .

		In his negotiations with
Charles X.	PERSON	he is a well - meaning visionary , devoted to ideals which the world has outgrown , and without even the nov - ice 's knowledge of the simplest elements of Con - tinental politics .

		In his dealing with
Spain	LOCATION	, he is saved from the charge of most reprehen - sible treachery only by the plea that he did not know that his unprovoked attack upon
San Domingo	LOCATION	and
Jamaica	LOCATION	was an act of war .

		These are hard things for the admirers of Oliver 's statesmanship to accept ; but their quarrel is not with Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, but with the array of evidence which is here marshaled with the pitilessness of an indictment .

		Little , also , can be said in defence of the Protector 's cold-blooded plan of removing `` Papists and other superfluous Irish '' from the more fertile , and hence more valuable , parts of
Ireland	LOCATION	to the uncultivated , unattractive re - gions of the west and south , in order to make room for a permanent settlement of his Protest - ant soldiers .

		It may be that
Cromwell	PERSON	would '' meddle with no man 's conscience , '' as he wrote to the governor of
New Ross	LOCATION	in
1649	DATE	; yet evi - dently in his scheme of toleration he had no place for the
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		The Catholic religion in
Ireland	LOCATION	was to be virtually proscribed ; the priests were to be persecuted , and the estates of their supporters confiscated to the advantage of the Cromwellian soldiery and the ''
Adventur	PERSON	- ers . ''

		Out of a total population of less than one million souls , according to Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's estimate , fully one hundred thousand were marked for hanging or for deportation to the West Indian plantations .

		The animus which could conceive of such a wholesale attainder of an entire people can be explained only by Crom - well 's ignorance of the conditions which existed in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and by the fact that he imagined himself still fighting out the issues which had made the recently closed religious wars of
Europe	LOCATION	possible .

		The most that can be offered in his defense is that the orders were never carried out .

		Comparatively few people were deported , fewer still were hanged , and the new plantation of
Ireland	LOCATION	was only feebly under - taken .

		For this , however , the Protector de - serves little credit .

		He had really set his heart on '' the great work , '' and yielded at last only because his subordinates -- chiefly his own son Henry -- to whom he had entrusted the conduct of affairs in
Ireland	LOCATION	, shrank from firing up any such devil 's caldron as the Pro- tector 's plans would have provided for his lieutenants .

		It is easier to understand , possibly even to justify ,
Cromwell	PERSON	's conduct of domestic affairs during these years .

		Ostensibly , a constitu - tional government had been established , con - sisting of a sort of strictly limited monarchy and a strictly limited parliament , mutually de - pendent on each other , and in such a way as to prevent either party from becoming supreme .

		In reality , however , in giving the Protector entire control over the army , and in forbidding the parliament to reduce its size without the Pro- tector 's consent , the new constitution had entirely nullified any independent authority which it might seem to confer upon the par - liament , and had reduced any opposition which parliament might see fit to offer , to the nature of advice or at least a protest .

		The issue was what might have been ex - pected .

		The first Protectorate parliament had no sooner come together than it proceeded at once to strike at the foundation of the
Protec	PERSON	- tor 's power , by seeking to amend the
Instru	ORGANIZATION	- ment of
Government	ORGANIZATION	under which he and they exercised their authority , and finally denied the coordinate authority of the Protector alto - gether .

		After five lunar months were passed in useless wrangling ,
Cromwell	LOCATION	, taking advan - tage of a technicality granted him by the Instrument , dismissed his parliament and pro- ceeded for eighteen months to rule without a parliament .

		So ended
Cromwell	PERSON	's second - attempt to secure some sort of cooperation from what might be called , if not the nation , at least representatives of the classes who were trust - worthy from a Puritan point of view .

		He then proceeded to conduct the administration of the
State	ORGANIZATION	much as he would conduct the ad - ministration of his army in the field .

		He dis - missed civil judges whose loyalty he had reason to doubt , exactly as
James I.	PERSON	had done in the

		THE DIAL .

		368 days of
Coke	ORGANIZATION	; he even went a step beyond
Charles	PERSON	and
Wentworth	LOCATION	, and virtually placed all
England	LOCATION	under martial law , dividing the country into eleven great military districts and placing over each a major-general , who was responsible only to the Protector and his coun - cil .

		With their assistance , the Protector pro- ceeded to bring
England	LOCATION	up to the Puritan standard , closing up the alehouses , abolishing bear-baiting by shooting the bears in their pens , and deporting people who made themselves ob - noxious to the Puritan community either by their immoral lives or an ostentatious advocacy of forms of Christian worship which had been proscribed by
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the latter , however , it is always to be borne in mind that
Cromwell	PERSON	showed little inclination to molest the sectaries of
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	so long as their views were divorced from politics .

		But he did not hesitate to silence either Churchmen or Inde - pendent Levellers whenever they raised their voices against the existing order .

		With our modem respect for the sacred ness of constitutional forms , it is difficult to regard these acts of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	in other light than the acts of a military tyrant .

		At every step of the great Protector , the unlovely jangle of the military spur grates harshly upon the ear .

		And yet it is to be borne in mind that few men of repute in Cromweirs time had any concep - tion of the right of a majority of the people to direct the ajffairs of the nation .

		In '' the fun - damentals '' which he tried to induce his recal - citrant parliament to respect , he showed a re - markable understanding of the true relations of the various arms of government to each other as embodied in English institutions ; and yet he had no conception of the authority of the majority as the justification of government .

		He had been set , not to execute the will of the nation as voiced in the expressed will of major - ities , but '' to do God 's people some good '' ; and even '' God 's people '' did not always know what was best for their own good .

		Tried by the definitions of political science ,
Cromwell	PERSON	was unquestionably an usurper , a despot , and a tyrant , yet no usurpation was ever so justi - fied by the conditions which made it possible ; no despot was more sincere in his efforts to lead his people into righteous ways and save them from the results of vice on the one hand and anarchy on the other ; no tyrant ever tried harder to secure some legal basis for the authority which was denied him by the very laws which he strove to uphold .

		The title-page , however , reads ♦ ♦ Political Parties in the

		The book is not an outline history of the rise and growth of parties and the development of party ma - chinery , as we expected it to be , but is a sort of running commentary on the political history of the

		Professor
Macy	ORGANIZATION	defends this course upon the ground that the principal purpose of historical study is to enable us to avoid in future the crimes and blunders that have resulted in disaster in the past .

		Never - theless , speculation as to what would have hap - pened , if that which did happen had not hap - pened , is capable of no positive proof and can result merely in the balancing of probabilities .

		.

		Professor
Macy	PERSON	's principal contention is that the Civil War might have been averted had the Whig party in
1848	DATE	and thereafter taken strong ground against the extension of slavery to the territories , and made a strictly con - stitutional opposition to slavery a paramount issue .

		From this view we must wholly dissent .

		The Whig party furnished little ground for hope .

		It was a party of dead issues and pass - ing political leaders .

		It was a coalition of in - congruous elements , the protectionists of the North and nullifiers of the South .

		It had dis - claimed any principles in the campaign of
1840	DATE	, and received a deserved punishment in the accession of Tyler .

		The success of
1848	DATE	was temporary and due solely to the personal popularity of a politically colorless candidate .

		Had the Whig party embraced its great op - portunity by taking a strong stand against the extension of slavery , it would have been im - mediately abandoned by its Southern wing and have become as sectional as the later Repub - lican party .

		It might have saved itself , but would not otherwise have greatly changed the course of history .

		The opposition to a reju - venated Whig party might have been less bit - ter than the opposition to the new Republican party , but the difference could not have been great enough to avert the war .

		The reasons why the war could not have been averted are strongly stated by Professor Macy himself . ''

		We are told that the Muhammedan child is taught to lisp the word < infidel ' with all possible spite and venom .

		It is made a part of his religion to bate and despise the infidel .

		... A similar training led abo - litionist and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	' fire-eater ' to hate and despise each other .

		In many a Northern family children grew up believing that life in the South was typified by the bloodhound , the auction - block , and the mob .

		And the children of the plantations were in their turn made to regard the pure-minded , self-sacrifieing , anti-slavery philanthropists as malignant aggressors , delighting in stirring up the negroes to exterminating warfare against the white South .

		... A generation had grown up , honestly believing that the institution of slavery pos - sessed all moral and coustitutional sanctions .

		This chasm between the sections was a slow and gradual development from the earliest times .

		It could have been bridged , if bridged at all , only by going at least as far back as the abolitionist agitation , and by substituting for it a moderate and reasoning anti-slavery movement which would not have excited the counter-revolution in the South .

		But such a substitution was scarcely within the range of possibility , so that affairs were bound to come , as they did , to such a pass that a war between the sections , to use the phrase of the late Gen - eral

		qualities is displayed in this story of the Revolu - tionary War .

		There is much finish in the detail , bat there is nothing of the large imaginative sweep that should characterize historical romance .

		The best feature of Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's book is found in its account of the brutal treatment meted oat to the tories in
New England	LOCATION	during the turbulent days that followed the outbreak of hostilities .

		This aspect of our revolutionary straggle has been treated in mach too gingerly a fashion by the historians , and it is onlv of recent years that the public has been told the truth aboat the matter .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	tells the truth , and for this we may be thankful .

		Bat for the story of heroic deeds she has not the equipment , and her
Paul Jones	PERSON	, for example , offers a weak contract to the figure of that captain as it appears in ' * ■
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' or even in the slap - dash books of
Archdeacon Brady	ORGANIZATION	.

		We trast that
Miss Jewett	PERSON	will at once go back to her study of the humors of the
New England	LOCATION	town .

		Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	is better equipped with the faculty for dealing with the high and heroic mat - ters of history , but even she is well-advised to make character rather than action the main object of her attention .

		It is certainly refreshing to turn from the hackneyed story that
Miss Jewett	PERSON	has told us to the narrative uf the lost dauphin as it has been reconstructed , from legend and imagination , by Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	.

		Fur her ''
Lazarre	PERSON	'' is nothing more than the youthful history of
Eleazar Williams	PERSON	, that singular personality who was firmly believed by some to be no other than the child of the French king , rescued from the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, and brought to
America	LOCATION	.

		Both in
Northern New York	LOCATION	, where
Williams	PERSON	lived among the Indians , and in the
Green Bay region of Wisconsin	LOCATION	, where he became one of the pioneers of Western civilization , the legendary story of his origin persists , and has resulted in a curious literature of the kind at which historians look askance , but which romantic and uncritical readers are apt to accept at something like its face value .

		Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	appears -LRB- although perhaps only for the purposes of her novel -RRB- to accept the legend as true in its essentials , and has certainly achieved a remarkable success in making the figure of her
Lazarre	PERSON	stand out as a living figure from her canvas .

		She follows him from his assumed de - portation to this country , through the early years of his life as the adopted son of an Indian chief , through the period of aroused self - consciousness when he comes to believe in his own exalted birth , down to the Western time when he puts aside all thoughts of claiming bis birthright , and casts in his lot with the new nation that be is helping to build up in the wilderness .

		Before this conclusion is reached , however , the author takes her hero to
Europe	LOCATION	, and provides him with a series of surprising adventures , both at the French court and at the far Northern court of the exiled Bourbon king .

		His final renunciation is determined by his love for a noble French woman , whom chance has brought to
America	LOCATION	, and with whose fortunes his own have 866 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, been singalarly intermingled ever since his child - hood .

		We began the reading of '' Lazarre '' with many misgivings , occasioned by the difficult nature of its subject rather than by doubts of the author 's capacity , but as we read into the book , our interest grew deeper all the time , and its closing pages left OS with the feeling that , however fantastic its sub - stance , Mrs.
Catberwood	PERSON	had contrived to give reality to both situations and characters , the feeling that , considering the difficulty of her subject , she had achieved an unusual and brilliant success .

		The figure of
Aaron Burr	PERSON	is one that has long been waiting for effective portraiture at the hands of some artisan of historical romance .

		Within the last few months , two attempts have been made to attract novel-readers to this interesting personality , and both attempts are deserving of attention .

		Mr.
W. H. Venable	PERSON	, in ' < A Dream of Empire , '' takes up
Burr	PERSON	's story at the time when , his term of office ended , he leaves the East a disgraced man , and embarks upon the mysterious undertaking whereby he hopes to carve out for himself a new political fortune in the
Southwest	LOCATION	.

		The scene is first laid in
Blennerhassett Island	LOCATION	, and shows us the con - spirator in the first stages of his enterprise .

		His fortunes are followed down to the final collapse of his scheme , the ruin of the Blennerhassetts , and the arrest of
Burr	PERSON	on charges of treason .

		The story is picturesquely told , and is above the average as an example of the sort of book which it represents .

		Unfortunately , it is impossible to make a satisfac - tory hero of romance out of a man with
Burr	PERSON	's record , and the feeling that he got no more than he deserved destroys the artistic effect of the tragedy of his life .

		Mr.
C. F. Pidgin	PERSON	, whose '' Blennerhassett '' is the second of our
Burr	PERSON	stories , realizes this difficulty so fully that he takes the bull by the horns from the start .

		Instead of apologizing for
Burr	ORGANIZATION	, he champions him throughout , makes of him a com - pletely misunderstood and foully abused man , justi - fying his conduct where it has been most condemned .

		In order to carry out this plan , it becomes neces - sary to vilify both
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, which is done without the least hesitation .

		The audacity of the thing fairly takes away one 's breath .

		In order to rehabilitate his hero , the author invents imaginary documents , which are paraded with a great show of mystery ; but just as we expect to have their contents revealed , they are forever lost .

		As an illustration of the author 's disingenuousness , we may cite the statement in his preface that
Burr	PERSON	'' was elected to the highest position in the gift of the American people . ''

		We can not say that Mr.
Pidgin	PERSON	has written a very good novel -- in fact , he has not written a novel at all , but an imaginary biography , which is quite a different affair .

		It covers the whole of
Burr	PERSON	's life , from the duel with
Hamilton	PERSON	to
Burr	PERSON	's death , but the portraiture is hopelessly distorted , and is quite unconvincing .

		Mr.
Robert Neilson Stephens	PERSON	divides his attention about equally between English and American themes . ''

		Captain Ravenshaw , '' his new novel , is a romance of English life in the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		Not a historical novel in the sense of dealing with characters and happenings of resounding fame , it may be considered historical in what is perhaps a truer sense of the term .

		That is , it presents a carefully-studied picture of the life of the time con - cerned , and results from a conscientious effort to be truthful without being dull .

		It certainly is not dull , and we think the author has justified his own claim of being ' < himself at home in
Elizabethan London	LOCATION	. ''

		Like another romance reviewed in this article , '' Captain Ravenshaw '' is occupied with the designs of an unscrupulous rake upon the person and fortunes of an heiress , and of course this vil - lainy is foiled after the required number of stirring episodes and the usual amount of agony .

		The novel is a fair average example of the class of writings to which it belongs .

		The '' Cardigan '' of Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	is far more than '' a fair average example '' of his - torical fiction .

		In this story of our revolutionary period he has even surpassed himself -- which those who remember how highly we have thought of his previous work will understand to be praise indeed .

		We should call the book one of the half-dozen strongest and most fascinating romances of Amer - ican history that have been produced of recent years .

		The period is that of the single year pre - ceding the outbreak of hostilities at
Lexington	LOCATION	, and the scene is the
Mohawk	LOCATION	region whence the authority of Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	was stretched forth to con - trol the turbulence of the
Long House	ORGANIZATION	, and keep the warriors of the Six Nations on friendly terms with all the whites .

		The character of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	is depicted for us with loving skill , and we share in the tragedy of his death -- for it was nothing less than a tragedy for him to see all his efforts made un - availing through the unscrupulous intrigues of Lord
Danmore	PERSON	's agents , and to witness the hideous spec - tacle of his own English compatriots in league with savagery for the destruction of the revolting colo - nists .

		He , at least , remaining loyal to his King , and would have seen the battle fought out in accordance with the rules of civilized warfare ; it was the sor - row of his last days to see it waged with the sup - port of Indian allies .

		We spoke not long ago of the reappearance of the Indian in our American fiction .

		No better example could be afforded than the present novel , which presents to us the familiar figures of Brant and
Logan	LOCATION	, and which , further - more , exhibits a truly penetrative insight into Indian customs and modes of thought .

		We are almost inclined to look upon
Johnson	PERSON	as the true hero of this romance , so commanding is his figure , and so compulsive of respect and admiration .

		But the story deals , after all , with the adventures of his ward ,
Michael Cardigan	PERSON	, a boy of sixteen in the opening chapters , and a man of seventeen at the close .

		It seems a purely wanton disregard of the probabilities to give us so youthful a hero .

		Nothing would have been lost , and much gained , by bestow -

		THE DIAL .

		367 ing upon him at least five more years .

		The most delicate piece of psychology in the book is offered by the gradual transformation of this boy 's political ideals , through stress of circumstances , making in one short year an earnest patriot out of a fervent loyalist .

		We will not carp at this , because the author really performs the feat , although at the outset , although knowing that it must be done , we could not see how he was going to set about it .

		Novels of our Civil War are becoming increas - ingly frequent in American fiction .

		It would seem that we have at last reached the time when it is possible to take a dispassionate survey of that great convulsion , and when the spokesmen for either side can count upon a sympathetic hearing from the partisans of the other .

		This does not mean that our war novels are to acquire a neutral tint , because passion of some sort is essential to a vital descrip - tion of the war period , but it does mean that the majority of readers are ready to eschew bigotry in their championship of either cause , and are pre - pared to take a generous view of the motives of even those whom they believe to have been essentially in the wrong .

		Of recent war novels , `` They That Took the Sword , '' by Mr.
Nathaniel Stephenson	PERSON	, is a modest but unusually satisfactory performance .

		It deals with a few days only , in the
summer of 1862	DATE	, and with a single episode of the struggle .

		The scene of the book is the city of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, and its theme the attempted capture of the city by a sudden Confederate raid , abetted by the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sympathizers who formed a large part of the popu - lation of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		The boyish hero of the story is pitifully weak , and his actions are such as to estrange our sympathies in large measure ; but he makes what atonement he can , and he is only a boy , after all .

		The closing scene in
Washington	LOCATION	, when he is pardoned by the President , is much like the similar scene in Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's `` The Crisis , '' although the figure of Lincoln is not presented in as firm an outline .

		Since we last spoke of the monthly series of American novels provided by one of our oldest publishing houses , three new volumes have been added to the collection . ''

		Westerf elt , '' by Mr.
Will N. Harben	PERSON	, is a story of
Northern Georgia	LOCATION	, and introduces us to a very crude type of civiliza - tion .

		The hero is a young farmer who trifles with the affections of a rustic maiden , in consequence whereof she takes her own life and he is filled with remorse .

		Removing to a neighboring village , he buys a livery stable , and falls in love with the daughter of a woman who keeps the village hotel .

		This interferes with the designs of the village bully , who is a moonshiner and a leader of whitecaps .

		This ruffian makes several attempts upon the life of his rival , who manages to escape , although by no means with a whole skin .

		By these devices , and a miserable misunderstanding between the lovers , the story is kept going , bat it does not prove a re - markable performance .

		We may thank the writer , however , for his forbearance in the matter of dialect . ''

		The Manager of the B. & A. , '' by Mr.
Yaoghan Kester	PERSON	, is a much better book -- in fact , it is one of the best of the whole series .

		It takes us to a small town in the lumber region of
Michigan	LOCATION	, and is concerned with the efforts of a new and energetic manager to build up the business of the railway .

		His reform measures make him unpopular , and he is soon confronted with a strike .

		At the same time , a family scandal is raked up against him , and serves still further to embitter the situation .

		The young woman with whom he has fallen in love treats him badly , and at last he gives up his job , and leaves the town which has become so stirred up against him .

		Presently , the safety of the town is threatened by a forest fire , communications are cut off , and the situation grows desperate .

		At this juncture , the hero has an opportunity of coming to the relief of his former fellow-citizens , by himself driving the locomotive that brings the needed fire-engines through the blazing forest .

		This act of daring causes a complete revulsion of feeling toward him , the young woman in question also sees the error of her ways , and everything ends happily , or at least as happily as could be expected .

		The story is a specimen of crisp and vigorous workmanship , typi - fying an important aspect of American life , and carries out the purpose of the series in which it appears rather better than most of the other volumes .

		Mr.
A. Maurice Low	PERSON	, the author of '' The Su - preme Surrender , '' is a
Washington	LOCATION	journalist and correspondent , and endeavors to picture the polit - ical and social life of our capital city .

		Long practice at his business , coupled with shrewd pow - ers of observation , has given him unusual qualifi - cations for the task which he has undertaken .

		We can not escape the temptation to think of his studies of public men as partaking of the character of portraiture , although it is probable that most of his figures are composites .

		One Senator , however , is hardly to be mistaken , so accurately are his public activities and political methods presented .

		The time of the story is one of great political tension ; there is great danger of a war with
England	LOCATION	, and the conservative elements of the government find it almost impossible to keep the nation to a rational course .

		The private interest of the story centres about a conspicuous Senator and the daughter of a member of the Cabinet .

		The Senator is married , but the young woman in question falls in love with him , and has no hesitation in telling him about it .

		His feelings are reciprocated , and the affair goes on in clandestine fashion until it gets to be talked about , and they realize that they stand upon the brink of a social abyss .

		They both try to convince themselves that their love is not wrongful , and in this endeavor , elaborate a novel theory of the mar - riage state .

		Marriage , they conclude , should be a contract for three years , terminable at the pleasure of the parties concerned .

		But this theory differs so greatly from the practice of society in its present benighted stage of evolution that when the critical period is reached in their relations , the young 368 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, woman impalsively decides to marry a persistent old-time l -LRB- -RRB- ver for whom she cares little or nothing , and the Senator , after making a great speech and then resigning his ofiSce , finds the problems of des - tiny all solved for him by the fatal bullet of an anarchist , conveniently provided for the occasion .

		We do not think much of this book on its ethical side ; on its intellectual side , it has a certain hard and incisive brilliancy that attracts attention .

		It is a good deal like Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's '' Senator North , '' the resemblance being rather closer than ought to exist between two novels by different hands .

		For the last time , so Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	assures us , has he drawn upon the Canadian storehouse for the material of his fiction .

		This is a matter of regret , for no one before him has made the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian past , as embodied in history , or the Canadian present , as embodied in the humble lives of the eoureur de hois and the habitant , so vivid to our gaze , or so pregnant with dramatic or pathetic possibilities . ''

		The Right of Way '' is a story of rather recent times , and the scene -LRB- except for a sort of prologue -RRB- is laid in a remote village of Que - bec .

		It is a strong and beautiful story , telling how a brilliant but dissipated lawyer of
Montreal	LOCATION	becomes dead to the world through an accident , and how he takes up life anew in the humblest of village surroundings , and becomes in some sort the good genius of the place .

		He will not return to his old home , although his reputation has been unjustly blasted , because his return would bring mictery to others ; and he is content to leave a tar - nished name among the circles in which he once moved that he may save from suffering the wife who , believing him dead , has become happily married to another .

		This is , no doubt , a very high pitch of moral heroism , and , taken together with his ready acceptance of a life against which all the instincts of such a man would have revolted , it strains the reader 's credulity almost to the breaking point ; but , once admitting the essential improbability of the situation , the working-out is both ingenious and logical . ''

		The Right of Way '' is not a better book than Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's two other long novels , but it is upon about their level of achievement , and is certainly one of the eight or ten best novels of the year .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's new novel is a story of the
India	LOCATION	that he knows so well -- a story entirely without love-making or other sentimental interest of the conventional sort , yet singularly enthralling .

		It is entitled * '
Kim	PERSON	, '' which is the name of the principal character .

		Kim is a child of Irish par - entage , cast as a waif upon the sea of Indian life when an infant , and growing up under native in - fluences .

		He is a preternaturally shrewd little beggar , and has had to learn the lesson of living by his wits from his earliest years .

		Although he speaks English , he prefers
Hindostanee	PERSON	, and the racial traits that are his by inheritance seem to have been almost wholly submerged .

		They re - appear after it is discovered that he is
Kimball O'Hara	PERSON	, the son of a former soldier , and when his education is taken in hand by his father 's regi - ment .

		His unusual gifts are marked out by certain government officials , and be is put in training for the
Secret Service	ORGANIZATION	, in which department we feel quite sure that he will become distinguished , although the book ends when he is upon the threshold of his new career .

		The story offers us a great variety of Oriental types of race and character , including the winning personality of a Thibetan holy man , seek - ing through long years and in strange lands for the river of cleansing whereby he may gain the longed - for release from the
Wheel of Change	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Bud - dhist attitude toward life is very sympathetically figured in this venerable character , who seems to us quite as interesting as Kim himself .

		It is need - less to say that few Europeans understand the workings of the Oriental mind as Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	understands them , and far fewer have his gift of imparting the understanding to their readers .

		Among English writers , he has been matched by Mrs. Steel , but hardly by any other in our day .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's ' • Sister Teresa '' is a sf quel to ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	. ''

		It describes the growth of the singer 's determination to forsake the world , the breaking of her relations with the two lovers who had so influenced her life , her tentative experience of the convent , the death of her father , and the taking of her religious vows .

		The scene of the book is laid for the most part in the convent , and the story is little more than the analysis of her swaying emotions as she is urged now this way and now that , as the world and the church alternately appeal to her distracted spirit .

		The book is unde - niably a dull one -- as dull as the `` En Route '' of
M. Huysmanns	PERSON	, which it inevitably brings to mind , -- and it is a book which leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth .

		Its best pages are those which deal , as in its predecessor , with musical themes . ''


Philbrick Howell	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Albert Kinross	PERSON	, is a novel of modern English life , chiefly concerned with the fortunes of a young man of letters .

		He is in love from childhood with a girl who seems worthy of him , but who in reality is shallow and sel - fish .

		His own generous nature can not see in her the defects that are evident to others , and his devotion is unbroken until in the end she reveals herself in an unmistakeable light .

		He finds the usual conso - lation in the love of another girl , but this part of the story is not very convincingly managed .

		Nor are the probabilities very strictly observed in de - scribing the hero 's career as a novelist .

		Such im - mediate success as comes to him is anything but the rule of authorship .

		The story is pleasantly told , with animation and genuine sentiment .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	is doubtless a fair mark for ad - verse criticism , yet we can not hold to be either generous or fair the dead set that the English re - viewers have made against '' The Eternal City . ''

		Granting that the novel is extravagant and has many faults of taste , granting that improbabilities meet the eye in every chapter , granting that its

IAL	ORGANIZATION	.

		set style is often mechanical and of gaide-book inspi - ration , yet there remain qualities sufficiently im - pressive to deserve for the book a more respectful hearing than it is receiving from most quarters .

		In the first place , its idealism , although both Utopian and sentimental , is on the whole of the inspiring sort .

		Then its picture of the social and political conditions of modern
Italy	LOCATION	, although drawn with melodramatic intent , is correct in its main outlines , and has been carefully studied from the documents .

		Finally , the plot of the story , although far from original , and audacious beyond what is fairly per - missible , is well put together , and keeps the interest of the reader in a condition of breathless tension .

		`` We certainly do not believe in the practicability of Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's special type of Christian socialism , nor do we condone his half-veiled apology for the methods of violence in revolution , but we believe that the book is a sincere expression of the author 's outlook , clouded by sentiment as that may be , and distorted by his unbalanced judgment .

		And , after all , the author 's vision of a purged
Italy	LOCATION	, of a spir - itualized papacy and a republican polity , is essen - tially no other than the vision of
Mazzini	PERSON	, and that is the divinest vision that has been vouchsafed to any Italian of the last century .

		We can not help balking at the improbability of the heroine 's con - duct in betraying her husband .

		A woman of
Roma	ORGANIZATION	's finesse and penetration could not have been tricked so easily , and would never have succumbed to the pressure put upon her .

		The appearances of the Pope as a character in the story are usually unfor - tunate .

		Despite labored attempts to maintain the dignity of his office and the saintly character of the venerable man , the author has distinctly failed in investing him with the attributes that both art and historical fact demand .

		For in spite of certain deliberate confusions of character and biography , this figure is in the main intended for that of the present pontiff , just as the figure of the
King	ORGANIZATION	is that of the present ruler , and just as the figure of
Banelli	LOCATION	is that of the prime minister so recently deceased .

		But for all these strictures we are not disposed to visit '' The Eternal City '' with utter condemnation , or to deny it the possession of many remarkable qualities . ''

		The Lady of
Lynn	PERSON	, '' a posthumous novel by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, is an excellent example of the art , or artifice , of this pleasant story-teller .

		It is a tale of the
last century	DATE	, and has for its theme the machinations of a
London	LOCATION	gambler and rake , who learns of the existence of an unsophisticated heiress in the quiet seaport of
Lynn	PERSON	, and who marshalls his disreputable allies to descend upon the town , and help him bear her off .

		It takes a good deal of rather ponderous machinery to carry this plot into effect , and
Lvnn	PERSON	for a time is turned into a gay resort of fashion .

		We need not say that the villain is foiled , and that the virtuous maiden bestows her charms and her wealth upon the man who loves her for her - self , and who is instrumental in rescuing her from her persecutors .

		NOTES ON NOVELS .

		The student of character will detect a certain incon - sistency between the recent public speeches of Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Allen White	PERSON	and his well-told stories of American political life , now gathered together in a book with the excellent title of '' Stratagems and Spoils '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In the speeches , Mr.
White	PERSON	extols the glory of
America	LOCATION	, and urges the extension of our beneficent inflaence throughout the world ; in the stories he paints with merciless truth the complete lack of idealism in our political methods , selecting typical examples of thieves and robbers in the States and nation , and apologizing for the universal deference to money , however obtained , by stating in his preface that our politicians are quite as moral in their way as our lawyers , merchants , and clergymen , in theirs .

		This combination of political optimism and pessimism in one personality , the reader of Mr.
White	PERSON	's book is permitted to account for as best he may .

		Certainly the graphic and convincing tales he has here set down contain the trnth graphic - ally set forth , and with much knowledge of literary art .

		They are interesting to a degree .

		Mr.
George Horton	PERSON	has contrived a pleasant disap - pointment in his new tale of modern
Greece	LOCATION	, ** The Tempting of Father Anthony '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		With a humor and quaintness quite bis own , be gives the his - tory of a lad , the son of the village priest , who feels himself called to a life of extreme asceticism after the manner of
St. Anthony the Great	ORGANIZATION	.

		With little of pa - rental encouragement , he implants himself in a monas - tery not far from his home , leaving this , after years spent in holy living , for a life in a distant retreat .

		But in his wandering he meets a beautiful girl , nature as - serts herself above austere religion , and , it being the policy of the
Greek Church	ORGANIZATION	to discourage monasticism , Mr.
Horton	PERSON	is able to make that time honored happy ending to his book which should end all romances .

		Messrs.
Samuel W. Merwin	PERSON	and
Henry K. Webster	PERSON	continue to develope the vein of commercial romance they discovered in their first book through the last from their joint pens , '' Calumet ' K ' '' -LRB- filacmillan -RRB- .

		The narrative is chiefly concerned with the erection of a huge elevator on the bank of the
Calumet River	LOCATION	in
South Chicago	LOCATION	, its completion within a given time being absolutely necessary in order to break a `` corner '' in wheat .

		The undertaking calls forth all the resources of the modern contractor , complicated by chicanery on the part of the railways interested in the `` corner , '' by labor troubles , accidents , and a number of minor causes .

		A simple romance is threaded through the exciting and well-told story , which is one for business men to find interest in , as well as the classes more ac - customed to reading fiction other than that provided by the daily papers .

		With painstaking and patience , Mr.
John Uri Lloyd	PERSON	is reaching toward literary comprehension . ''

		Warwick of the Kuobs '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is a second ''
Stringtown	LOCATION	'' story , dealing with the primitive religion and passion of the provincial Kentuckians of that locality .

		The hero , from whom the book takes its title , is a hard-shell
Bap	ORGANIZATION	- tist preacher during war times .

		A Southern sympa - thizer on the border , he is drawn into the conflict upon which his two eldest sons have entered with much un - willingness , only to come into greater grief through the betrayal of his daughter by a Northern college student who has been his guest while investigating the geolog - ical formations of the neighborhood .

		There is the 870 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, tendency to discursiveness so marked in the former books from this hand , though in less degree ; and a gen - eral formlessness in structure , though this again shows improvement .

		Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	will do better still .

		A well-finished novel from a new hand may be rec - ommended in Mrs.
Elinor Macartney Lane	PERSON	's `` Mills of God '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The name of the author is an as - sumed one , taken for the purpose of aiding the veraci - ousness of the story , which deals with aristocratic life in
Virginia	LOCATION	at the close of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth .

		The heroine is of royal descent on one side , and the hero an English no - bleman with whom , though married , she fell in love .

		The child of this passion plays an important part in the prettily told narrative , disagreeable as the facts dealt with must be considered .

		The feeling of the period is transferred successfully , though there is an absence of what might be called national Americanism rather startling to contemplate .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	, a Republican city , is in the hands of a political machine quite as corrupt and irresponsible as Tammany in its worst days .

		It is of an imaginary character who attains the headship of this vast ring that Mr.
Francis Churchill Williams	PERSON	writes in ``
J. Devlin	PERSON	-- Boss '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , a political novel of more than ordinary interest .

		Devlin comes into view as the '' copy boy '' on a morning newspaper , entering into politics as he grows older as naturally as an American business man keeps out of it .

		Climbing on the heads of his fel - lows through sheer strength of character , he soon be - comes the boss of the water-ofBce , withstanding until the close of the book the desultory efforts of the re - spectable element in the community to oust him .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	lets his readers see what it is that gives Dev - lin his power , and adds greatly to our general knowledge of municipal affairs .

		A pleasant love-story runs beside the political exposition .

		The '' Portrait Series '' which the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	are publishing shows the widest variance in the stand - ard of the short stories that make up the several vol - umes .

		Mr.
Van Tassel Sutphen	PERSON	's `` The Nineteenth Hole , '' for example , contains the lightest trifles written around the game of golf and the fashion of riding in self-moving vehicles .

		It requires a decided interest in either pursuit to make make them readable , the cumu - lative effect of a volume of them being almost appall - ing .

		On the other hand .

		Miss
Elizabeth C. Jordan	PERSON	's ```` Tales of a Cloister '' afford a most interesting glimpse into convent life in the
United States	LOCATION	, being drawn largely from the writer 's own education in a convent school .

		The sweetness and sincerity of the sisters , the innumerable problems presented by their pupils from the outer world , the beautiful atmosphere of unques - tioned faith and hope combine to make the book note - worthy and attractive .

		Not the kailyards , but the Scotch mid die - classes , are drawn upon for the material Mr.
George Douglas	PERSON	uses in '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	with the Green Shutters '' -LRB- Mc -
Clure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story deals with the ac - cumulating misfortunes of a family whose head has made much money by shop - keeping .

		A slattern of a wife and a fool of a son combine to bring the story to an unmitigated tragedy , the doom of degeneracy .

		Sombre and unrelieved , there is a searching of hearts and analysis of motives which place the novel on a high plane among its fellows .

		Quite incidentally , the evils of unrestricted competition are shown without pal - iation .

		However little the commnnity in which the | story is placed may appeal to the reader , it serves as an admirable human background for the fate which creeps so relentlessly upon the house of
Gourlay	PERSON	.

		`` The Road to Ridgeby 's '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a tender romance in which the asperities of farming life in
Iowa	LOCATION	are softened and idealized .

		It is by the late
Frank Burlingame Harris	PERSON	, a young newspaper writer of fine ambition , and is remarkably free from the errors which so often go into a first book .

		It tells the tale of a rich young man who is seized with the desire to wander .

		His journey brings him to the home of a col - lege girl , the adopted daughter of a farmer .

		Her academic career ended , she returns home and bravely seeks to repay her foster parents by pledging her hand to the man who holds the mortgage on their farm .

		The vivifying power of true love shines through the story , and keeps it sweet and spiritual .


Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	is a prime favorite in song and story , and the prevailing taste in historical novels leaves his memory no opportunity for neglect .

		It is about his career in early life that Mr.
Hamilton Driim	PERSON	- mond has written the first of two recently published novels , giving the book an appropriate title , from the faithful servant of the
King	PERSON	who attends his fortunes through its pages , `` A King 's Pawn '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		Mr.
Drummond	PERSON	has filled his story with war and mi - nor battle , the clashing of swords and rattling of ac - coutrements .

		Having done this , he is content to leave love quite out of the question , -- a woman 's vengeance taking its place .

		In the other story , '' The Seven Houses '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , compensation is made by giving the book a heroine and hardly a hero at all .

		Here again
France	LOCATION	is dealt with , and there is some little fighting ; but it is rather a war of wits than of armed men .

		The narrative is well put together , and the astrological prediction of the first chapter governs the rest .

		Mr.
James O. G. Duffy	PERSON	has taken a most dramatic incident in the history of one of the curious religious sects with which
America	LOCATION	is filled , for the foundation of his first novel , `` Glass and Gold '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A girl , misled by her teacher , a clergyman in the sect , is beloved by an artist .

		Reading a book on confession , by her betrayer , she is persuaded by its reasoning to make public confession of her fault to the Californian congregation to which she belongs , in order to bring a clean record to her affianced husband .

		The rest of the book tells how she sought to live down the consequent scandal , essaying an entrance upon society in
New York	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, after being left a fortune by her heart-broken father .

		Two recent collections of stories show a remarkable similarity of contents .

		Both are written in an English provincial dialect , both deal with the somewhat primi - tive passions of a simple village folk , and both are told in an artless manner , differing wholly from the treatment an American usually gives such themes .

		One is `` Dunstable Weir '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by `` Zack '' -LRB- Miss
Gwendoline Keats	PERSON	-RRB- ; the other , '' The Striking Hours '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	.

		The differ - ences in treatment are largely due to the difference in sex of the two authors .

		He tells , for example , of fights , with a zest that is somewhat lacking in those which she describes .

		The dialects used are , to an American , very much the same , -- or no further apart , let us say , than the speech of
Virginia	LOCATION	and of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	. ''

		The Last of the Knickerbockers '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- is a di - verting little book , fully carrying out the promise of Mr.
Herman Knickerbocker Viel	PERSON	^ 's earlier '' Inn of the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 Silver Moon . ''

		It deals with the two classes that go to make up
New York	LOCATION	`` society , '' -- the old Dutch fami - lies on one side , and the newly - rich on the other .

		At the boarding-house of Mrs.
Bella Ruggles	PERSON	, a number of the old families sequester themselves in shabby - genteel splendor .

		Not far away , the largest operator in Wall Street inhabits a palace of Roman magnifi - cence .

		Between these two households the action of the book is divided .

		The story is interesting in itself , and the manner of telling it is still better , with wit and satire , and a love for
New York	LOCATION	which is almost pathetic in its intensity .

		Jones Berwick is the hero of Mr.
B. K. Benson	PERSON	's '' A Friend with the Countersign '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as he was of '' Who Goes There ? ''

		But it is a
Berwick	ORGANIZATION	freed from the incubus of a dual personality , though still en - gaged in scouting for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	armies .

		Engaged to
Lydia Khayme	PERSON	as he was at the close of the former book , the element of romance is lacking here , as well as that of mystery ; and the author relies upon the fascinat - ing life of a scout for holding his readers ' interest .

		Though the book is unusually long , it will be read with unabated interest by those who like hairbreadth escapes , the frequent references to official documents m the foot - notes giving it the air of complete reality .

		As an excellent bit of fun .

		Miss
Molly Elliot Sea	PERSON	- well 's latest story , '' Papa Bouchard '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , may be cheerfully commended .

		It deals with the revolt of an elderly bachelor , an advocate of
Paris	LOCATION	, against the domination of an elder maiden sister with whom he has lived for more years than he cares to acknowledge in his emancipated condition .

		He is joined by a faithful valet , and even by the family parrot , which developes into the most ribald of birds in his new-found liberty .

		The hero , from whom the book is named , comes upon a designing widow at the beginning of his independent career .

		She and his ward and niece , and the latter 's husband , an army officer , contrive to get him into a tri - angular difficulty over a diamond necklace , which pro- duces a ridiculous and laughable situation . ''

		Sprightly '' is a favorite word of Miss
Seawell	PERSON	's , and it well de - scribes the narrative .

		Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	has written a sequel to his previous accounts of the life-history of a strange man , with the title '' ' Farewell ,
Nikola	PERSON	' '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- ; and having disposed of this character for a time , has gone on with a detective story of the approved sort , called '' My Strangest Case '' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		In the former book , there is the usual combination of hypnotism , ability to read the future , experimentation with unknown drugs of un - known powers , revenge , and death .

		Doctor
Nikola	PERSON	is still engaged in attempting to discover the secret of life , and the book closes with his future apparently bound up in a Thibetan lamasery , whither he has gone to learn the mystical lore of its inmates .

		In the latter story , one man robs his two companions of the jewels they have discovered in
Burmese China	LOCATION	, and they de - vote their lives henceforth to the attempt to bring him to justice , the Chinese having captured the twain , blinded one , and cut out the tongue of the other .

		Fair - fax , the famous
London	LOCATION	thief-taker , is called in .

		Tra - gedy closes the book as it opened it .

		Incidentally , a number of
Fairfax	LOCATION	's other experiences are narrated .

		Dealing with all that is weird and uncauuy , Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	holds the secret of keeping his readers ' attention , and the two books are certainly exciting .

		Somewhere between the Alleghenies and the Miss - issippi River lies the little town in which the scene of `` Jack Racer '' -LRB- McClnre ,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is placed .

		The author , Mr.
Henry Somerville	PERSON	, has made a faith - ful picture of American life in a minor town under settled conditions , his knowledge of young manhood and womanhood enabling him to give his readers a subtle and interesting account of the manner in which the hero comes into his own , -- which means , among other things , the love of a charming girl .

		A bit of politics , of the better sort , enlivens the story .

		As may be expected in Miss
Anna B. Fuller	PERSON	's lit - erary work , `` Katharine Day '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a worthy novel .

		The scene is laid in a
New England	LOCATION	college town -- which is quite unmistakably
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Here the fortunes of the heroine are followed from her motherless infancy , through a disappointment in love and sorrow over the incapacity of an only brother , to a finding of herself as a trained nurse visiting among the poor , and eventual happiness .

		Four or five of the characters stand out as vivid portraits and studies of American types , not the least notable being a grand - mother who represents the best
New England	LOCATION	tradi - tions and inherited common-sense .

		One of the more recently formed territories of the
United States	LOCATION	makes its bow to literature in Mrs.
Helen Church Candee	PERSON	's dramatic `` Oklahoma Romance '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Suitably enough , the story turns on a contested land-claim , in which a villainons Westerner tries to wrest from a recent importation from the East his well-won acres near a growing '' city , '' only to be baffled in the end by the
Westerner	ORGANIZATION	's own daughter , who loves and is loved by the '' tenderfoot . ''

		A vivid impression of life in a new and unsettled community is given , with ambushes , murders , and all the varied incidents of the frontier .

		Abandoning his field of historical romance for a comparatively modern day , Mr.
Halliwell Sutcliffe	PERSON	sets an amiable example to his fellow romancers .

		But `` Mistress Barbara '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is a compromise at best , for the tale is concerned with love , like his older romances , its modernity being only partially apparent in the setting in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	about the year
1830	DATE	.

		There is a strike in the woollen mills in the neighborhood , which the hero does not suffer from because he has always treated his own men with consideration -- a distinct advance over such a contest between capital and labor as
Charles Reade	PERSON	once dealt with .

		It is pleasant to observe that Mr.
Sutcliffe	PERSON	is not a man with a single string to his bow , and it is to be hoped that he will write more books of this latter sort .

		Mrs.
Sarah P. McL	PERSON	.


Greene	PERSON	has woven a somewhat intricate love-story into her latest book , `` Flood - Tide '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The scene is placed in a fishing village on the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	coast , a region just now popular with authors .

		The '' natives '' -- curiously individual folk , and strongly suggestive of the loss in picturesqe - ness which city polish entails -- throng the pages with their quaint sayings and beliefs , expanding the book to twice what its size would otherwise be , and making it delightfully desultory .

		Religion plays no small part in the argument , the ancient salty expounder of the Apocalypse being a treasure to be cherished among characters of fiction .

		Now that Mr.
Mark Ashton	PERSON	has called attention to it in '' She Stands Alone , the Story of
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's Wife '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , all the world will wonder why this woman has so long been neglected in Christian song and story .

		As the author says , it was
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's wife alone who pleaded for the life of Jesus when all his followers had 872 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, denied or left him .

		Utilizing the scanty legends that have grown up about the life of
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	, introducing several historical characters of the day , and informing the whole with knowledge of classical times , Mr.
Ash	PERSON	- ton has written a strong story , certain to command attention .

		The tone of the book is dignified and ele - vated ; but it is doubtful taste to make pictures that have been made for other purposes serve as illustra - tions here .

		A very pretty and vivacious story has Miss
Frances Aymar Mathews	PERSON	made of '' My Lady Peggy Goes to Town '' -LRB- Bo wen-Merrill -RRB- .

		The influence of the play - wright 's art is shown in the manner in which the work is put together , and few changes would be needed to fit it for stage presentation as a comedy .

		Lady
Peggy	PERSON	takes on the apparel of her twin brother , and under - goes the most surprising adventures , at one time being at the point of hanging as a highwayman .

		Not much attention is paid to the historical or other probabilities ; but the rapidity of the action and interest of the dia - logue would carry oflP even greater faults .

		The illus - trations by Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	are excellently done .

		A charming humanity lifts '' ` Lias 's Wife '' -LRB- Page -RRB- far above most studies of American rural life .

		The inhabitants of one of the little islands off the coast of
Maine	LOCATION	constitute most of the characters , but the hero - ine is of French descent and daintiness , and the story revolves around the coming of a young clergyman to the island to spend a
summer	DATE	.

		Quaint Yankee humor , the ability to draw a personality in a few sharp and unerring strokes , and a most interesting body of men , women , and children , make this latest of Mrs.
Martha Baker Dunn	PERSON	's books a pleasant one to read .

		The tender history of a crippled foundling , adopted by a young woman of means after her convalescence from serious illness in the hospital at the door of which the baby has been left , will be found delicately and sympathetically told in `` As a Falling Star '' -LRB- Mc - Clurg -RRB- , from the pen of Miss
Eleanor Gaylord Phelps	PERSON	.

		The little boy is one of those hopeless physical wrecks of our civilization whose end is bound to come when life is hardly begun , but his spiritual service to the girl who loves him shows that he has not lived in vain .

		The theme is a difficult one , but handled with skill for a first literary effort .

		It must be something of a tax on the inventors of detective stories to bring their leading characters back to life after killing them at the close of an earlier book .

		`` Raffles : Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracks - man '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is an illustration of this , the hero be - ing left some miles from human aid in the
Mediterra	LOCATION	- nean Sea in a previous work narrating his exploits .

		But he is very much alive indeed here , and after a life of intelligently conducted criminality puts a climax to it by going to
South Africa	LOCATION	to shoot burghers .

		Though left for dead again , it will doubtless be possible for his creator , Mr.
E. W. Hornung	PERSON	, to bring him forth once more , at least .

		In the way of historical romance .

		Miss
Lafayette McLaws	ORGANIZATION	's `` When the Land Was Young '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is both dramatic and picturesque .

		Much of its action re - volves around the old city of
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Spaniards take a
Carolina	LOCATION	Huguenot from the hands of his captors , the
Yemasee Indians	PERSON	, and one of his neigh - bors goes to his rescue .

		With the help of a Choctaw chief , the Frenchman and his charming daughter are released , although the rescuer falls a prisoner in their stead .

		He in turn is released by a buccaneer ; and after a period of stress under
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, with plenty of good fighting , the book closes peacefully enough at
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		There is action and to spare , with no flagging in inter - est from beginning to end .

		Mrs.
Katharine Tynan Hinkson	PERSON	provides her public with another tale of Irish life among the gentler classes , in '' That Sweet Enemy '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Here the daughter of an impoverished house with a private feud against the descendants of those who have come into their former estates is taught , after a long strug - gle , to love the enemies of her family -- who have been living in complete ignorance of the prejudice .

		A taste of the revolt against British tyranny always in the hearts of the oppressed Irish peasantry adds life and action to the pages .

		The Rev.
Robert Mclntyre	PERSON	appears as the author of a • ' first novel '' in '' A Modern Apollos '' -LRB-
Jennings & Pye	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is a great deal of the author himself in the narrative ; his clerical experience , his knowledge of the Scotch character , and his early life as a black - smith , all being drawn upon .

		A huge conspiracy against the currency of the nation gives him a small army of desperate villains for a background , and through their instrumentality the hero proves himself a very muscular Christian indeed .

		There is material enough for twenty stories in the work , which is here rather ill digested into one .

		A modern novel , half Scotch and half English , and a collection of short stories with their scenes laid in
Scot	PERSON	- land and
Austria	LOCATION	, are Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's contributions to the fiction of the day .

		In '' Cinderella , '' a little Scotch girl is defrauded of her heritage by her most respectable uncle , who goes to the extent of ordering her arrest for the theft of one of the rubies brought her by her father from
Burmah	LOCATION	, all the others being in his possession .

		In `` Love Idylls , '' nine tales of various length , all concerned with the master passion , combine to entertain the reader .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	is always inter - esting , and these exercises in various styles of the art of fiction will please many readers .

		Both books are published by
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hostilities with the Indians on the Western frontier during the second war of independence against
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	give Mr.
James Ball Naylor	PERSON	the materials for `` The Sign of the Prophet '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , General
Harri	PERSON	- son and Chief Tecumseh both appearing among the characters .

		The siege at
Fort Meigs	LOCATION	, and the rein - forcements brought to
Harrison	PERSON	by
General Clay	ORGANIZATION	, close the story , which owes much of its interest to the daring of Mr.
Naylor	PERSON	's hero , a scout .

		The book is simply con - structed and of considerable historical interest .

		A somewhat conventional love-story is to be read in `` The Marriage of Mr.
Merivale	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Mr.
Cecil Headlam	PERSON	.

		The hero is forced to care for an invalid mother during the ten years that elapse before seeing the girl of his heart again , and in that time he gets into trouble with the inevitable Frenchwoman of the English novelist , -- a woman so much more attract - ive than the other that the reader 's sympathies are in danger of confusion .

		The book begins with a cricket - naatch , -- reminding one of the rarity of that game in English fiction .

		Still more conventional , though a society detective story , is Miss
Adeline Sargent	PERSON	's '' My Lady 's Dia - monds '' -LRB- Buckles -RRB- .

		A woman received freely into the best houses of
England	LOCATION	turns out to be the wife of a convict who has served his term , using her position for the purpose of robbing her hostess .

		She manages to
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 878 throw suspicion on the betrothed of an Englishman , who is certainly not a
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, and his blun - dering spins the story out to the usual length .

		The wrongfully accused girl suffers much through her lover 's stupidity , but it all comes right in the end .

		Life in a little town on the
New England	LOCATION	coast is described in Miss
Mary Devereux	PERSON	's '' Up and Down the Sands of Gold '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is discursive , filled with anecdotes of the quaint folk who populate the place in rather abrupt contrast with a family of Creoles living iu one of the old houses .

		The book is not as impressive as the author 's earlier * ' From Kingdom to
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, '' though its action takes place in the present day .

		Such an atmosphere as dwells around the Knights of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	is used with great skill by K. and
Hesketh Prichard	PERSON	in their '' Karadac , Count of Gersay '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , `` Gersay '' being an ancient spelling of the name of the island between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	better known as
Jersey	LOCATION	.

		The time is that of William the Conqueror ; but the hero is a Celt , the deeds are those of romantic chivalry , and the book is in no strict sense historical .

		Such legendary lore as it utilizes is more than welcome , and the idealism and interest of the book make it notable among its fellows .

		Mrs.
Hugh Eraser	PERSON	-LRB- a sister of Mr.
Marion Craw	PERSON	- ford -RRB- has made a readable book of `` '
Marna	PERSON	's Mutiny '' -LRB-
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is concerned , like others of her writings , with the always interesting country of
Japan	LOCATION	; a daughter of one of the Scandinavian consuls being the heroine .

		Into every incident of the book something of the country itself is brought , and it makes an admirable background for the little idyl it enshrines .

		In addition , there is a minor love story or two , by way of variety .

		Piety is the dominant note in Miss Amy Le Feuvre 's ''
Heather	PERSON	's Mistress '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Twin girls , orphaned in early life and left quite alone in the world , except for faithful servants , by the subsequent death of their stern old grandmother , are taken from
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	sur - roundings out into the great world .

		Then , after tast - ing of its pleasures , they return home to find peace and comfort in religion .

		We think Miss Le Feuvre is writing without knowledge of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	life , thought , or ideals , turning that amiable sect into an evangelical Christian body without compunction .


Austria	LOCATION	is seemingly remote from the world of the novelist , and it is with unusual interest that
Madame Longard de Longgarde	ORGANIZATION	's novel , `` The Million '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will be read .

		The author 's earlier books , in which she made her maiden name of
Doro	PERSON	- thea
Gerard well-known	PERSON	, is guarantee of good work - manship , and her residence since her marriage in
Austria	LOCATION	opens up a new field for her English readers .

		The action of '' The Million '' takes place in a city of
Galicia	LOCATION	, not far from the Roumanian frontier .

		The story is strong and convincing , and must add to the reputation of the author .

		A sculptor in posse catches a glimpse of a pretty girl who has gone in bathing with some of her fellows in a decidedly unconventional manner , as he is passing with a tray of plaster casts on his head .

		The girl 's mother befriends him , when she hears that he is ambi - tious to study in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		A few years after , the family go to that delightful land , and learn in
Rome	LOCATION	that the young peddler has risen to fame through a statue which he has made .

		This achievement gives name to Mr.
Franklin Kent Gifford	PERSON	's '' Aphrodite , the Ro - mance of a Sculptor 's Masterpiece '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The resemblance of the statue to the girl who really inspires it gives rise to gossip .

		The narra - tive is clouded by doubts as to whether the sculptor is really in love with the mother who befriended him , or the daughter who admired him .

		The characters are well drawn , and the theme a novel and entertaining one .

		The main situation , it may be noted , is not unlike that treated by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	in one of his latest short stories .

		``
Caleb Wright	PERSON	, a Story of the West '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a good , hearty , wholesome account of a married couple from the East who went out West to grow up with the country , and in the operation made the country grow up with them .

		It is written by Mr.
John Habberton	PERSON	, and shows that understanding of the inventive Amer - ican and his abilities in many directions which makes the story a criticism of life in something like
Arnold	LOCATION	's comprehension of the phrase .

		One of the few lads who sees life as it really is , without illusions , is the hero of Mr.
Henry M. Hyde	PERSON	's '' One Forty-Two , the Reformed Messenger Boy '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- .

		Told in a dialect that is distinctive from its free use of slang rather than from any marked vari - ance from the standard iu pronunciation , the sixteen tales in the book are vivid , picturesque , and , it may be worth while adding , strictly true .

		If not a pleasing picture of life in a great American city , the story has the merit of accuracy , and , within the limits set , of literary feeling and proportion .

		There is a humorous side to house-moving , for all
Franklin	PERSON	's ranking it among the calamities ; and this is brought out to the full by Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	in '' The Van Dwellers '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Though concerned with
New York	LOCATION	, the name is not derived from the Knickerbockers , but signifies those mortals who spend so mnch time in changing their domicile that they are said to dwell in the furniture vans which convey their chattels .

		A couple come from
Oshkosh	ORGANIZATION	to the metropolis to live .

		They find just the place they have longed for .

		Experience proves it undesirable .

		They move on .

		More experience teaches the same les - son .

		After passing through all the grades of knowl - edge , they complete a post-graduate course and become `` commuters , '' -- it is so good for the children .

H. G. Wells	PERSON	, the English
Jules Verne	PERSON	, again challenges comparison with his prototype in scientific fiction by '' The First Men in the Moon '' -LRB-
Bowen	PERSON	-
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		By the discovery of a substance which is as impervious to gravity as iron is to light , it becomes possible to shut off the earth 's attraction from a prop - erly constituted hollow receptacle , which thereupon goes over to the moon .

		Though dead on the surface , as astronomers hold , the inmates of the receptacle find an abundance of intelligent folk iu the caverns that extend through the satellite , and these creatures are shaped something like insects externally but with as - tonishing diversities of habit and structure .

		We like
M. Verne	PERSON	's story best .

		`` The Grip of the Bookmaker '' -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- is a better book than its title .

		Mr.
Percy White	PERSON	is not telling the story of a commonplace entanglement with a gambler , but the life of a young Oxford man whose father , an usurer and seller of chances on the turf , has determined to make a gentleman of him , though he still forces him into constant companionship .

		The young man loves above his father 's station , as a matter of course , and his trials are spiritual in good part and very real .

		Old
Holland	PERSON	' ^ ^ ® quaintness and picturesqueness in picture of
Holland	LOCATION	, so long as they endure , and text .

		^ jj | form a tempting subject for pencil and brush , and a charming pleasure-ground for the still larger class of sojourners in quest of the artistic .

		Messrs.
Boughton	PERSON	and
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, a dozen years ago , indulged in a `` Sketching Ramble in
Holland	LOCATION	'' ; and nothing that has appeared since has equalled their account in good-humoured apprecia - tion of the Dutchman and his country .

		The volume with the title '' Old Dutch Towns and Villages of the Zuider Zee '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , which has for the writer of the text Mr.
W. J. Tuyn	PERSON	and for its illus - trators Messrs.
Nieuwenkamp	PERSON	and Veldheer , is far more sumptuous in appearance , but can hardly be said to convey the charm of its predecessor .

		The text , though it brings to light many interesting bits of antiquarian lore , is little more than a collection of notes setting forth pertinent information in re - gard to the subjects of the illustrations .

		It is for the latter that the work will be examined by those interested in artistic
Holland	LOCATION	.

		It can hardly be said that the artists ' severe , poster-like treatment of the old Dutch architectural lines , mellowed and even decrepit with age , at all carries with it the feeling which the originals inspire .

		The intense conventionalization of black and white that is cul - tivated by artists who come close up to their sub - jects seems decidedly inappropriate for old
Holland	ORGANIZATION	, which very properly demands a modest share of the enchantment of distance .

		The scenes chosen are , on the whole , typical and pleasingly reminiscent .

		The omission of the entire east coast of the
Zuider Zee	ORGANIZATION	detracts from the comprehensiveness of the work and deprives the artist of some choice material , such as may be found in
Franeker	LOCATION	,
Harlingen	LOCATION	,
Workum	LOCATION	,
Hindelopen	PERSON	, and several other cherished embodiments of departed glory .

		The volume will be valued by those to whom scenes quaint and Dutch have a peculiar fascination ; but it can hardly be said to fill the very real need for an adequate and sympathetic account of what
Holland	LOCATION	offers to the artist and the tourist .

		In
1894	DATE	, Professor
J. F. McCardy	PERSON	l : n : r ; ri `` * * ^ `` university of
Toronto	LOCATION	issued the first volume of his '' History , Prophecy , and the Monuments '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In
1896	DATE	, the second volume appeared , carrying the history down to the fall of
Nineveh	LOCATION	in 606 B. C .

		After nearly five years we have the third and con - cluding volume , which closes with the end of the Babylonian exile .

		The whole series is a remarkable presentation of Semitic history previous to and con - temporaneous with the writers and literature of the Old Testament down to the fall of Babylon .

		More than this , it weaves together both the contempo - raneous and Old Testament records in such a man - ner as to present the facts in their interrelations .

		The work is thus a kind of historical commentary on the Old Testament writings down through the
Second Isaiah	ORGANIZATION	, or to 538 B. C .

		This third volume is divided into three books : Book IX .

		treats of '' Hebrews and Egyptians '' ; Book X. , of '' Hebrews and Chald '' ans '' ; and Book XL , of `` Hebrews , Chaldseans , and Persians . ''

		The larger part of the volume is a discussion of historical questions and material .

		But the author presents two chapters of more than ordinary interest : ''
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	and Hebrew Literature '' -LRB- pp.
19-80	DATE	-RRB- , and '' Religion and Morals '' -LRB- pp. 81-125 -RRB- .

		In the first of these , the author specifies the beginnings and growth of Hebrew literature .

		He discusses the origin of writing , and even the source of the alphabet now in use -- showing that the Phoenicians probably did not get their alphabet in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		In tracing the origin of Hebrew literature , the author has reached grounds quite surprising to most Old Testament scholars .

		The Pentateuch is composed of the dif - ferent documents now commonly found there by Old Testament scholars .

		Belief in
David	PERSON	's Psalms is `` impossible '' -LRB- p. 51 -RRB- .

		Even Psalm 18 contains a theophany -LRB- vss .

		7-17 -RRB- '' to which
David	PERSON	and his age were incompetent . ''

		The book of
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	, '' found '' at the time of
Josiah	PERSON	, was the chief source of inspiration in the reformation inaugurated by that ruler .

		The chapter discussing the '' religion and morals '' of
Israel	LOCATION	is full of interesting facts regarding the prevalence and power of religion among the Israelites during the successive ages of their history .

		The remaining chapters of the vol - ume are replete with the results of a careful and discriminating scholarship , fully abreast of the latest discoveries in archaeological fields touching the Old Testament .

		The volume is concluded by indices to the complete series , but we have no maps on which to trace out the momentous history pictured in these full volumes .

		The study and criticism of Italian art .

		Mr.
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	's latest work , '' The Study and Criticism of Italian Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a col - lection of seven essays written at intervals during a period of ten years , but all having a common pur - pose -- to illustrate a method of studying the his - tory of art more abstractly than it has been studied , and freed as much as possible from entangling irrelevahcies of personal anecdote and the sterile prosings of so-called connoisseurs .

		The world 's art , he urges , should be studied as independently of all documents as is the world 's fauna or the world 's flora .

		Documents should be consulted chiefly for mere convenience of naming .

		The most striking of the present essays is one which applies this method to certain pictures hitherto variously ascribed to either one of the Lippis , to
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, or to Ghirlandajo .

		In these pictures , not only their characteristics in common but their differences from each of th © others seem to Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	a sufficient warrant for constructing a new artistic personality , -- prob - ably a follower of
Sandro Botticelli	PERSON	, whom he names ''
Amico	PERSON	di Sandro . ''

		Even the famous
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 < *
Bella Simonetta	PERSON	'' of the
Pitti	LOCATION	, ascribed to
Botti	PERSON	- celli by 80 many generations , is taken away from him and given to ''
Amico	PERSON	, '' on the ground that '' no serious critic who looks at the gawkiness of the figure and the timidity of the execution will think of
Sandro	PERSON	as the real author '' ; whereas certain merits -- drawing , folds , lighting and perspective of the o -RSB- -RRB- ening -- are distinguishing merits of * '
Amico	PERSON	. ''

		By similar processes of comparison , Filippino loses and ' • Amico '' gains several pictures ; the general conclusion being that this newly discov - ered personality was artistically neither so deep nor so gifted as
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, more fascinating but not so serious as
Filippino Lippi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each of the essays is illustrated by fine and clear full-page copies of great paintings , forty-three in all ; and text and pictures combine to make this one of the most at - tractive art-books of the year .

		Agmidelo the byyeayt o /
Surrey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Surrey is the subject of the new vol - ume in Dent 's '' County Guides '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Unlike the tra - ditional guide-book , it makes delightful reading for the stay-at-home ; and any tourist who gets hold of it will certainly steal a day or so from
London	LOCATION	highways to make some of what its author felicit - ously calls its * ^ intimate excursions '' along the by - paths of
Surrey County	LOCATION	.

		The book is in three parts , of which the first and most important deals with the story and scenery of the county , grouping its detail in seven itineraries .

		The author , Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	, is apparently an enthusiastic cyclist and pedestrian , a lover of scenery , and finely apprecia - tive of the literary and historic associations of the county whose quaint chroniclers are all his friends .

		With equal zest -- and always in charming English -- he tells us of the yew-lined Pilgrims ' Way , of the Thames meadows where
Shelley	PERSON	lounged and wrote '' Alastor , '' of the castles visited by
Elizabeth	PERSON	in her stately
summer	DATE	progresses , or of Moor Park where Swift flirted with
Stella	PERSON	and learned of
William III	PERSON	.

		how to cut asparagus .

		Then the author drops a hint to the cyclist to avoid a rut - ted bit of road , or calls attention to a picturesque little coppice with an alluring foot-path through it ; so that the reader who finds nothing to interest him must indeed be difficult to please .

		The second part of the book consists of special articles upon the bird life , flowers , moths and butterflies , geological for - mations , and cycling tours of
Surrey	LOCATION	; while the third contains a gazetteer of the county .

		Maps and illustrations add much to the interest and practical value of the book , which is attractively bound in flexible cloth covers .

		Bote to build a Church .

		That there is need in this country for expert information on the subject of ecclesiastical architecture , reduced to such form that it can be used practically by church builders , one has but to take a cursory view of our church buildings to determine .

		But it is doubtful if Mr.
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	's '' Church Building , a Study of the Principles of Architecture in their Relation to the Church '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will fill any such '' long-felt want . ''

		It is pitched in too high a key to be of much practical service to those who are forced to face the problems of church building .

		It is a beautiful book , and so abundantly illustrated -LRB- there are 125 illustrations besides frontispiece and vignettes -RRB- that one might almost '' read the book by looking at the pictures '' ; and such a process would not be without profit or the acquisition of new ideas .

		But after the beauty of the typography has impelled one to pursue the letter-press , one feels that he finds therein but one man 's ideas , and that , if it were desired to build any of the churches therein recommended , but one architect could be found who could design it .

		The book presents high ideals , -- which is quite right ; but where , under the conditions of life existing in this country , would it be wise or possible to build the style of '' Country Chapel '' -LRB- costing
$ 5	MONEY	.

		000 to
$ 10,000	MONEY	-RRB- which is here recommended ?

		And the author 's `` Village Church '' -LRB- costing S30 ,000 -RRB- seems misplaced in a small town , as things are in
America	LOCATION	.

		The author 's dogmatism is likely to be repellant to many who would in an exigency turn to this book for help , and his style is flippant in some cases and likely to be misunderstood .

		His use of such terms as `` wicked '' and `` vicious , '' in connection with things pertaining to the church , brings them in the category of slang .

		The book is a collection of articles recently published serially in a religious periodical , and in preparing them for republication the author has not quite given them that quality of permanence which should differen - tiate a book from a magazine polemic .

		`` Deafness and Cheerfulness '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the Rev.
A. W. Jackson	PERSON	-LRB- who will be remembered as Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's biographer -RRB- , can not fail to bring comfort and strength to those dwellers in a world of silence , more or less complete , who have ceased to invoke the aurist 's aid and now turn to the phy - sician of the soul for such balm as he may have to offer .

		Himself a sufferer , and an uncomplaining one , the writer deprecates any excess of tenderness from those about him . ''

		I would rather , '' he says , '' have them take it for granted that , though the way of suffering is appointed me , there is yet some toughness in my fibre , that I can take the natural discomforts of my infirmity with a reasonable de - gree of equanimity . ''

		He compares the deaf and the blind , and , judging from personal observation , thinks the latter the happier , as they certainly are the more fortunate in eliciting sympathy .

		Distract - ing head noises harass the deaf , as a rule , which may partly explain the apparently greater serenity of the blind .

		The chapter on '' The Pathos of Deafness '' is enlivened with anecdotes , amusing as well as pathetic .

		It is of interest to learn , from a noted aurist 's experience , that more than sixty per cent of an average community are below the normal DwelUrtii ^ aworU iff lUtMoe .

Nov. 16	DATE	, in hearing power -- generally without consciousness of their defect .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	urges the deaf frankly to acknowledge their infirmity , to use an ear - trumpet , and , most important of all , to learn lip - reading if possible .

		The book was written , as we are in a position to know , from an intense desire on the author 's part to do something for those who suf - fer as he has suffered , and is from beginning to end a reflection of his own experience .

		It thus appeals with conviction to all readers , and especially to the deaf .

		Both practical and spiritual is its lesson , manliness and courage its dominant note .


Felix Reville Brunot	PERSON	, the subject of iitiri ^ ti ^ itum .

		an appreciative memoir by
Dean Slattery	PERSON	, of
Faribault	LOCATION	,
Minn.	LOCATION	, was a good man and a devout Episcopalian , whose life touched closely that of the nation , particularly dur - ing the troublous period of the Civil War , and subsequently in dealing with the Indians and in attempting a solution of the Indian question .

		Mr.
Brunot	PERSON	was a successful business man of ample fortune , and during the Civil War he gave largely of his means to aid the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause and to mini - mize the sufferings of the brave boys in the field .

		Perhaps Mr.
Brunot	PERSON	will be longest and most grate - fully remembered for his ef & eient labors among the Indians , and especially for his services as presi - dent and a member of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	of Indian Com - missioners .

		It was his constant purpose to see that the Indian agents did their duty by the poor red men in their keeping .

		This was a herculean task ; for practically all the government 's agents had pur - sued an almost uniform policy of looting the Indians of that which was allotted to them .

		But most of all , Mr.
Brunot	PERSON	pursued a policy of peace and edu - cation among the Indians .

		And this policy was suc - cessful in a marked degree .

		He was able to prove to any fair-minded person that General
Sheridan	PERSON	's terse statement that `` the only good Indian is a dead Indian '' was not true .

		The absolute unsel - fishness and deep religious convictions of the sub - ject of the memoir are marked features of the book .

		Perhaps it is quite natural that this should be so , coming , as it does , from one of his own faith , and an admirer .

		The book contains several excel - lent illustrations , and a map of the Indian reser vations in

		^ * ^ * ° * ^ kindly student of the bird world than Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	shows himself to be in the beautiful little volume en - titled `` Footing it in
Franconia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifl3.in & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a series of nine essays recounting the au - thor 's experiences during vacation rambles through the woods and over the hills of
Franconia	LOCATION	.

		It may be well to state that the
Franconia	LOCATION	in the case is neither a duchy nor a district in
Germany	LOCATION	, as the reader outside of
New England	LOCATION	might suppose , but a delightful region in
Grafton County	LOCATION	,
New Hamp	LOCATION	- shire .

		The bird-visitors to
Franconia	LOCATION	, and the author 's efforts to catch sight of some of the rarer among them , are the chief themes of the essays , which are , however , quite informal , even pleas - antly rambling in manner , and in no sense constitute a '' loird book . ''

		It is the lover of birds , and the wild woods and hillside nooks which they most fre - quent , rather than the professional student of birds , who speaks in these essays .

		Indeed , it is clear that the author could no more kill a bird for the purpose of classifying or mounting it than he could kill a human being for that purpose .

		The reader who is not a bird enthusiast , however , need hardly fear that the book will bore him , since it is written in a refined and very pleasant style .

		Moreover , a mild and engaging humor , not so obvious or insist - ent as to interfere with the main purpose , is dif - fused throughout , and helps the book to escape tediousness -- a fault which the general reader may feel is not always avoided by some otherwise admir - able nature books .

		It is not too much to say that `` Footing it in
Franconia	LOCATION	'' is a very good book in a fine if not a very widely popular kind , as popu - larity is measured in these days .

		In `` An Introduction to Psychology '' Anewtexi-book -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Miss
Mary W. Calk	PERSON	- of psychology .

		V - or c `` du-i u j ins , Professor ot Philosophy and Psychology in
Wellesley College	LOCATION	, has added a note - worthy volume to the existing aids to the teaching of Psychology .

		The work represents the results of the author 's teaching experience , and conveys a vital sense of close-range instruction .

		It embodies no particularly novel or unusual features , but pre - sents a very comprehensive range of psychological topics with lucidity and interest and with apprecia - tion of the bearings of recent discussion and research .

		The inclusion of chapters upon Comparative and upon
Abnormal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	is a praiseworthy step ; as is also the constant illustration of psychological principles by direct reference to experiences of every - day life .

		The value of a text-book , apart from its readability , has come to lie more and more in its adaptability to the peculiar needs of courses , and to the points of emphasis maintained by instructors .

		Those who share
Miss Calkins	PERSON	's views of the gen - eral plan and scope of a collegiate course in Psy - chology will find in her book direct aid and much indirect stimulus .

		It seems not inappropriate to note in connection with this contribution , that it is the first text-book in Psychology written by a woman ; that this distinction should be reserved for
America	LOCATION	argues well for the cause of American education .

		The Spinster 's Own Book .

		The unappropriated blessings of the earth need not suffer for the conso - lations of literature , when such a work as Miss Myrtle Reed 's '' Spinster Book '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is to be had .

		To be sure , nine-tenths of the volume is about love and marriage ; but in giving such preponderance to those subjects , the author only proves her intimate knowledge of the spinster heart .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 The last chapter , which encourages every singly blessed woman to hope that the belated Prince noay yet arrive , is especially sympathetic and consoling .

		But perhaps the greatest charm of the work is that the writer has so far lived up to the motto '' Not for ourselves '' -- which all spinsters have apparent - ly adopted toward man -- as to extend it to books also , even her own .

		Her chapters will consequently be a delight not only to the '' unattached '' but to everyone .

		The wedded in every degree of bliss , the widowed and the widowered as well as the un - wedded in every grade of approach to the confirm - ed state -- which it seems spinsters never reach -- will find something here to learn and to laugh at , about themselves and about each other .

		With a great fund of shrewdness and wit , and no little delicate sentiment ,
Miss Reed	ORGANIZATION	has explored the matrimonial side of man 's vanity and man 's tender - ness , of woman 's folly and woman 's virtue .

		Her style is a little too pretensely Emersonian , and the brittle and unwelded sentences sometimes grow monotonous .

		Nor has she always escaped the temptations of the epigrammatic to sound more cynical than they are , and to appear anxious to say clever things .

		But underneath these few surface faults there is much genuine `` Stardust '' -- worthy to be found and enjoyed by men , women , and spinsters .

		Never have the Jesuits been so numerous and prosperous in En - gland as now , with their seven col - leges , their numerous churches , and their two hun - dred and fifty fathers engaged in active work , be - sides lay brothers and those under training and absent on foreign missions .

		But the outlook was decidedly dreary for them when the first emissa - ries of the Society courageously landed on British soil in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		Rev.

Taunton	LOCATION	's painstaking '' History of the Jesu - its in

Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- fills acceptably a gap in the voluminous annals of the Society of Jesus .

		But the author seems to underrate the difficulty of the historian 's ta ^ k when he says , in closing his preface : '' In these days when archives are open to all , an author can proceed with a firm and sure hand in unraveling the records of the past . ''

		This jaunty attitude is hardly the one to be assumed , we should think , by a writer who has to handle a perplexing topic like the Gunpowder Plot , which still baffles the ablest historians .

		In point of style , this bulky volume can scarcely be said to possess the fascination of romance .

George James Bayles	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains in comparatively little space , a discussion of the legal condition of woman - kind in
America	LOCATION	.

		The treatment is popular , in the sense of not being technical , and is not uninterest - ing , when the nature of the information given is taken into account .

		Marriage , divorce , and ali - mony take up the first of the three parts , and here the seeker after knowledge can obtain it on points as widely removed as the '' Plural Marriages of the Mormons '' and the `` Change of Name after Di - vorce . ''

		Less space is given to woman in connection with business but the discussion is still thorough , and few questions could be propounded for which an answer is not at hand .

		Such topics as feminine citizenship , the suffrage , the appearance of women in court as attorneys or as witnesses , and the em - ployment and protection of women , take up the last part .

		Throughout , the differences in the reg - ulations of the several States is made clear ; and the value of the work is enhanced by a preliminary essay on '' The Study of Law for Women , '' by Professor

Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing could be more significant of the tyranny of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An English - woman 's Love Letters ' on the one hand , and the utter lack of interest in ` The Love of an Uncrowned Queen ' on the other .

		NOTES 456 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 457 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 467 THE RIGHT READING FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN .

		In considering the old-world and classic Nursery Books for children , and in discussing their suitability and value , one is confronted with two difficult problems , about which there has been of late much difference of opinion expressed .

		One problem is as to the literary style , and the other as to the content of the stories .

		There are those who desire to reduce all the classic stories to one uniform level of langaage , suited to what they consider to be the child 's stage of mental development .

		On the other hand , there are those who believe that it is de - sirable to give the stories as nearly as possible in the form in which they were originally written .

		There are those also who object to anything like what may be called , for the want of a more definite expression , the '' blood and thunder '' element in some of the older nursery tales , and would eliminate altogether from the children 's reading such stories as `` Jack the Giant - Killer , '' ``
Jack	PERSON	and the Bean Stalk , '' etc. ; while there are others who do not deem such stories to be harmful .

		Now , the selection of books for children should not be governed by any fads or passing fancies , but should be based upon principles that lie deep down and are permanent ; and as a great responsibility attaches to all who have anything to do with the upbringing of youth in connection with the choice of their books , it is very desirable to find out the right path and to pursue it .

		It should be premised that the 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, class of books to which I am referring are books intended to be pleasure-books for children , not lesson-books out of which they are to be taught , but books which they may read for their delight and gratification , and out of which they may get some mental nourishment to aid their growing intelligence and power of imagination , and help in the development of character .

		First , as to this question of style .

		Will not the child in reading for his pleasure , to get at the sense of a story , unconsciously absorb a more varied vocabulary , and therefore acquire a greater power of self-expression , if we give him books which have various and distinct charac - teristics of style ?

		In the old-world wonder stories , as they may be called , the flavor of the style is that associated with books that belong to an earlier period of our history , a style adapted to the thought and action of the story ; and is it wise to attempt to reduce them to the common level of '' schoolbookese , '' carefully adapted to every grade of school work , in order to make the task of the teacher smooth and his path straight ?

		These stories , with their archaic flavor , written in a style remote from the present , are not as a rule unintelligible to the child in his pleasure reading at home or in school .

		Should not the child , from the beginning of his read - ing , be accustomed to varied styles in liter - ature , for the very same reason that his food should be varied ?

		Do we not want the child to absorb , not to discriminate , by means of his pleasure reading ?

		Many of the archaisms which are objected to in these stories have a current value as much as those in the
Bible	LOCATION	and in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		They are employed in later life , on rare occasions it is true , and gen - erally when the emotions are most deeply stirred ; they have the ring of true metal in them .

		I would not give children stilted or awkward sentences , or bad grammar , or coarse and vulgar language ; but I think there is much to say in favor of retaining the flavor of these earlier versions as much as possible .

		With reference to this question of variety of style , I have found in some very young children , long before one would have expected it , very considerable variations in the degree of their sensitiveness and appreciation .

		One child will enjoy the lilt of the ballad , while another child will become impatient with it .

		A very interesting story was recently told me , by an intelligent and highly cultivated lady , of her experience with her own little boy .

		One day , before he could speak , he was very un - quiet and fretful .

		She took him in her arms to quiet him , and purely by accident took up a book of English ballads and began to read aloud .

		She continued for some time , until the child , soothed , fell asleep .

		The next day at about the same hour the boy went to his mother and said , ''
Mamma	LOCATION	,
Mamma	LOCATION	, la-la , la-la . ''

		She could not understand what he meant ; but he continued persistently .

		She put her hand upon everything within reach , and finally upon the green book from which she had read the ballads the day before .

		With intense excitement the child cried , ''
Mamma	LOCATION	, la-la ;
Mamma	LOCATION	, la-la , '' and she repeated the reading of the day before .

		Day after day for months that child insisted upon having his dose of ballad ; and now that he is a grown-up young man , he still keeps his love for that particular form of literature .

		A careful observation of children will indi - cate , too , that character is early indicated by the tastes they evince in these directions .

		The first bit of rhyme learned by a little boy whom I once knew well was the action - verse of Mother Goose , -- `` There was a man of
Thessaly	LOCATION	, And he was wondrous wise , He jumped into a bramble bush , And scratched out both his eyes . ''

		The next thing that attracted him as he grew older , and which he appropriated of his own accord , was '' Drive the nail aright , boys , Hit it on the head . ''

		Vigorous rhymes of this kind always appealed to him ; and when he grew up he became a sturdy , indomitable , forceful man of action .

		Now , with regard to the content of such stories as those of the ''
Jack	PERSON	'' series , it is necessary to repeat that they are not put before children with a view to teaching them the tales ; but is there any reason why healthy children of to-day should not read these stories with as much delight and as little possibility of harm as the children of past generations have done , whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary ?

		If a boy is left to grow up without making acquaintance with such stories in his early days , is he not far more likely to get hold of the '' blood and thunder '' literature which he will find on the news-stands , at an age when it is more likely to be hurtful to him , than if the natural desire for reading about deeds such as those described in the tales to which I am refer - ring had been satisfied at an earlier period ?

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	tells us that the love of fight is '' biological and self-preserva - tive '' ; behind all that we call moral courage there must be something of the physical to back it up .

		In fact , what we call moral courage is the outgrowth of something physical ; and do not the pictures of physical courage and prowess in these stories , without always exactly impel - ling the child to go and do likewise , inspire him with a sense of conflict and conquest , which , when once stirred , can be led in directions where it tends to the making of strong char - acter ?

		A great deal has been said on the subject of the heritage of fear with which every child may be said to be born .

		I know of a boy who was never painfully disturbed by any of the ''
Jack	PERSON	- the-Giant-Killer '' stories , but who was rendered miserable and unhappy for many years of his little life by the nameless horrors with which the teaching of the doctrines of Calvinistic Christianity filled his little soul .

		It is quite right to shield the young from needless and nameless terrors , but the most fearful child thrills with delight and glows with satisfaction when he finds that the giants and other beings that inspired him with terror are defeated ; and are not these perfectly legitimate sensations to evoke ?

		We older folk are stirred to the depths of our being by a dramatic representation , but all the while at the back of our minds we know that the actual tragedy is not actually taking place before our eyes ; and has not the boy , long before he reaches the age of scepticism about his fairy stories , a similar kind of sub - consciousness which does not interfere with the emotions evoked ?

		THE BOOKS CHILDREN PREFER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
Thk	ORGANIZATION	Dial . -RRB-

		Wishing to know what books children prefer -LRB- rather than what books parents prefer for their children -RRB- , I recently took the vote of about two thousand young people , between the ages of nine and fifteen , belonging to the '' Advance Society , '' an association which I organ - ized several years ago for the encouragement of good reading among the young , and which has a weekly department in the
St. Louis	LOCATION	`` Christian-Evangelist . ''

		These children live in thirty-nine states , and
Canada	LOCATION	, and I feel justified in the conclusion that the lists for - warded are fairly representative of the tastes of Ameri - can childhood .

		I have often suspected that joTenile works are writ - ten upon the supposition that youthful minds can not digest strong intellectual food .

		When I was young , I looked with disfavor upon all works ostentatiously '' for boys and girls . ''

		But was I an exception ?

		It was this point I determined to settle .

		Why are juve - nile works usually for the day , only ?

		If they reach the heart of the young , should they not possess the perennial freshness possessed by great novels -- since the young we have always with us ?

		But if the young prefer books which older readers enjoy , why should we seek to disguise the truth ?

		That such works can not be appreciated in all their depths , is apparent enough ; but do young people find so much which they can appreciate in mature works , that they prefer them to books carefully written down to the comprehension of boys and girls ?

		When the cautious mother presents her daughter with a copy of `` Little Flossy 's Rainy Day , '' or '' How
Lena Did	PERSON	, '' is that daughter secretly wondering if
David Copperfield	PERSON	will find his aunt 's house , or if
Jean Yaljean	PERSON	will reach a happy , serene old age ?

		In taking the vote , each child was requested to send a list of his or her ten favorite books , in the order of preference , and a list of the three authors found per - sonally most enjoyable .

		I was assured by mature readers that few lists would be sent , since children of from nine to fifteen years of age have not read ten books for pleasure ; but , still mindful of my own youth - ful experiences , I put from me the thought that I might have been a g ^ at exception to the human race , and waited .

		I heard from nearly all of the two thou - sand members , and the thiity-five books which fol - low are those oftenest named in the lists forwarded .

		The little girl who , in her list of ten , named the books which received the greatest popular vote , was ten years old .

		I name the works in the order of their popularity : Little Women ,
Uncle Tom	ORGANIZATION	's Cabin ,
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, Old Fashioned Girl ,
Black Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, Little Men , Under the Lilacs ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	's Poems ,
Dickens 's Child	ORGANIZATION	's His - tory of

Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's Tales from

Alice	PERSON	in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, Through the Look - ing-Glass ,
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	, Titus .

		A great many other books were general favorites , coming close behind the leading thirty-five .

		A few of these , standing high in the list of favorites , were the following : Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table	ORGANIZATION	, Prince of the
House of David , Deerslayer	ORGANIZATION	, Thaddens of
Warsaw	LOCATION	,
Scottish Chiefs	ORGANIZATION	, Old Curiosity Shop ,
Adam Bede	PERSON	, Mad - cap Violet , Scarlet Letter , Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	,
Frank	PERSON	- lin 's Autobiography .

		The following authors proved the most popular :
Miss Alcott	LOCATION	,

John Richard Grebn	PERSON	.

		* The author of `` A Short History of the English People '' was born in
1837	DATE	, and died in
1883	DATE	, at the comparatively early age of forty-five .

		Although eighteen years have elapsed since his death , his life has not hith - erto been written .

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	has at last undertaken the task , at the request of Mrs.
Green	PERSON	, and the result is a biography , chiefly compounded of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and thus essen - tially autobiographical in character , which is one of the most important books of the year , and one of the most fascinating books of its kind in English literature .

		Just why there has been so much delay in the publication of this material , which is treasure-trove in the highest sense , is not explained .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	simply asks his readers '' to take for granted that there have been sufiicient reasons '' for the postponement .

		The work consists mainly of the letters , as has already been stated , and the editor 's own contributions to the text con - sist of introductory narratives to the four chapters into which the book divides , and a few connective and explanatory passages .

		For this matter , Mrs.
Green	PERSON	supplied most of the facts , although the editor has also drawn upon articles by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	,
H. K. Haweis	PERSON	,
E. A. Freeman	PERSON	, Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, and one or two others .

		Most of the early letters are ad - dressed to Professor
Boyd Dawkins	PERSON	, the famous geologist , who was a life-long friend of the historian , while the later letters are mostly addressed to
Freeman	PERSON	, who always had a warm place in his affections for the `` Johnnie Green '' whose early efforts he had encouraged .

		An appendix to the work contains a bibliog - raphy of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and the text of the sermon which he preached in memory of his dear friend , Mrs.
Henry Ward	PERSON	, mother of Mr.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, who died in
1862	DATE	.

		Green was born at

Magdalen Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	at the age of eight .

		Here is a reminiscence from those earliest days of his self-consciousness . ''

		All was not fun or poetry in those early school days .

		The old brutal flogging was still in favour , and the old stupid system of forcing boys to learn by rote .

		I was set to learn Latin grammar from a grammar in
Latin !	LOCATION

		and a flogging every week did very little to help me .

		I was simply stupefied , -- for my father had never * Letters of

		struck me , and at first the cane hurt me like a blow , -- but the ' stupid stage ' soon came , and I used to fling away my grammar into old churchyards , and go up for my ' spinning ' as doggedly as the rest .

		Everything had to be learned by memory , and by memory , then , as now , I could learn nothing .

		How I picked up
Latiu Heaven	ORGANIZATION	knows ; but somehow I did pick it up , and when we got to books where head went for something I be - gan to rise fast among my fellow schoolboys .

		But I really hated my work , and my mind gained what it gained not from my grammars and construing , but from an old school library which opened to me treas - ures I had never dreamed of . ''

		This distaste for the routine methods of edu - cation debarred him from high university distinctions , but was in reality , as the event proved , his scholarly and artistic salvation .

		His genius was too original to suffer compres - sion into the academic mould , which would have deadened his most vital intellectual im - pulses .

		Religion was an early preoccupation with him , and for a time his youthful bent seemed to be in the direction of Catholicism .

		But this inclination never went any farther than the announcement , at the age of fifteen , that he intended to join '' the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	as soon as his brother Anglicans should be ready to accompany him . ''

		Since this amounted to putting the matter off until the
Greek Kal	ORGANIZATION	- ends , there does not seem to have been any real danger .

		Green was matriculated at
Jesus College	ORGANIZATION	in
1855	DATE	, and it was there that he contracted the friendship with
Dawkins	PERSON	for which the readers of these letters have such cause to be thankful .

		The chief intellectual influence of those col - lege years was
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, who helped him when he most needed spiritual succor , and probably determined his choice of the clerical vocation by making him realize that the church stood for something more than Oxford theology .

		When it came to his examination for orders , he '' flatly refused to read
Paley	PERSON	's ' Evidences ' even at the cost of rejection , because , he said , the argument was out of date . ''

		Stanley ap - preciated the difficulty , and told him to take up the '' Horse Paulinae '' instead .

		When the examination came , the bishop , who was strong on
Paley	ORGANIZATION	, made difficulties , and summoned the young man to an interview .

		Green told the story , and the bishop said , '' O
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, Stanley ! ''

		During his college years , he wrote busily on his favorite subjects , but also min - gled with people , and gave evidence of his remarkable social talent .

		He even indulged in an occasional flirtation and began to think of marriage .

		This is his ideal in the year of his majority :

		431 '' I have not settled on the individoal , but I can tell you the species .

		Xot the beautiful -- your Junos , Min - ervas , or Venus 's , -- but some quiet , demure , little party whose beauty at the best will be that of expression ; who wo n't mind pets , humors , and eccentricities ; who will never invade my study or pop in on my musings with some vapid suggestion to visit the Blinks 's or some bothering inquiry about papering and painting .

		Some one who can play without being constantly strumming ; who can paint without having her fingers always smudgy ; who can contrive a good dinner and yet not degenerate into a mere housekeeper . ''

		Green 's friendship with
Dawkins	PERSON	gave him a lively interest in science , and this contributed not a little to the value of his historical work .

		He always wrote history with an eye to the physical characters of the scenes wherein it was enacted , and readers of his most popular book will know the charm of his descriptions .

		One of the finest qualities of his writing results directly from the fact that he consulted nature as well as books and brasses , manuscripts and monuments .

		But humanity always had the first place in his interests .

		Writing once to
Dawkins	PERSON	, he said : '' Interesting as ' the anti- clinal axis of Old Red , ' ' the flexures and dips ' of the Mendip range may be , Man and Man 's History to my mind is worth them all .

		XihU geologicum a me alienum puto , but still Tri - lobites and
Echini	PERSON	are only
Kingcrabs	PERSON	and Starfishes , while Man is Man . ''

		Speaking of his scientific interests , we may note that the epoch-making book of
Darwin	PERSON	found him ready to understand it without making the usual theological di
# Bculties	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was one of those who witnessed , with glee at the discomfiture of the theologian , the famous passage-at-arms between
Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	and Huxley in the Sum - mer of
1860	DATE	.

		The story has had several versions , and
Green	ORGANIZATION	's is one of the liveliest of them all . ''

		I was introduced to
Robert Chambers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the supposed author of the ' Vestiges ' -RRB- the other day , and heard him chuckle over the episcopal defeat .

		I have n't told you that story , have I ?

		On
Saturday	DATE
morning	TIME	I met
Jen	PERSON	- kins going to the Museum .

		We joined company , and he proposed going to section D , the Zoology , etc. , `` to hear the Bishop of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	smash
Darwin	PERSON	. '

		`` Smash Darwin !

		Smash the Pyramids ! '

		said I , in great wrath , and muttering something about ' impertinence , ' which caused
Jenkins	PERSON	to explain that the Bishop was < a first - elass in mathematics , yon know , and so has a right to treat on scientific matters , ' which of course silenced my eavils .

		Well , when Professor
Draper	PERSON	had ceased his hour and a half of nasal Yankeeism , up rose '
Sam	PERSON	- mivel , ' and proceeded to act the smasher ; the white chokers , who were abundant , cheered lustily , a sort of * Pitch it into him ' cheer , and the smasher got so up - roarious as to pitch into
Darwin	PERSON	's friends --
Darwin	PERSON	being smashed -- and especially Professor Huxley .

		Still the white chokers cheered , and the smasher rattled on .

		< He had been told that Professor
Huxley	PERSON	had said that he did ` nt see that it mattered much to a man whether his grandfather was an ape or not .

		Let the learned Professor speak for himself ' and the like .

		Which being ended -- and let me say that such rot never fell from episcopal lips before -- arose
Huxley	LOCATION	, young , cool , quiet , sarcastic , scientific in fact and in treatment , and gave his lordship such a smashing as he may meditate on with profit over his port at Cuddeston . ''

		The rest of the story , as contained in the words of
Huxley	LOCATION	's reply , has frequently been printed , and is familiar to the public .

		Green 's clerical career began at the close of
1860	DATE	, and lasted for over eight years .

		He oc - cupied five posts , and his work was mostly done in the East End . ''

		He made friends with the poor individually as he did with more culti - vated persons .

		He sympathized with their troubles and planned amusements for them , getting up penny readings or taking them to Rosherville or
Epping	LOCATION	Forest . ''

		Green 's activity during his clerical period would be astonishing in a strong man ; it is doubly astonishing in a man of his delicate consti - tution .

		He was early threatened with danger - ous disease , and the
last fifteen years	DATE	of his life were one protracted struggle against the ravages of the malady that finally proved fatal .

		But he worked manfully away at his parish duties besides doing an incredible amount of
Saturday	DATE	Reviewing and other miscellaneous writing , and at the same time gathering material and strength for his own most serious work .

		A great grief came to him early in his clerical life in the death of Mrs.
Henry Ward	PERSON	, the wife of his incumbent , and the sermon here re - printed as an Appendix gives expression to his appreciation of her character .

		The letters to
Freeman	PERSON	begin in
1864	DATE	, and become increas - ingly frequent and meaty .

		The following , written with reference to the second volume of the `` Xorman Conquest , '' is a typical speci - men : `` My dear
Freeman	PERSON	-- this is simply to tell you I have done it -- appendices and all -- and vote for the greatest living historian we have .

		But never mind -- you are the Gt .

		now living , and you have a right to be as mad as a hatter , and to believe what you please .

		Q. E. D. -- Good-bye . ''

		A sharp attack of pleurisy in
1867	DATE	gave
Green	ORGANIZATION	warning that he must change his mode of life if he would not speedily terminate his career .

		After much hesitation , he decided to give up the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and devote himself to his - torical writing in more favorable surroundings than he had hitherto enjoyed .

		How he felt about this change of life is indicated in the letter from which we take this passage : '' I have a great wish not to part cable altogether -- the hold the church has over me , however slight , is a really healthy hold to a mind like mine .

		Moreover , I have still a great faith in the capacity of the
Ecclesia Anglicana	LOCATION	to meet the national requirements of En - gland in a way that no sectional action can do .

		And then , too , there is the feeling of honor which tells against quitting a ship when she looks as if she were getting into rough water . ''

		A sort of commentary on these words may be taken from an earlier letter describing an excursion of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's parishioners to
Eosher	PERSON	- ville . ''

		One never realizes what the monotony and narrow - ness of the life and thoughts of the ordinary shop - keeper is , till one spends a whole day in the midst of them , as one does on the excursion day once a year ; twice a year it would kill me .

		Luckily I have immense social powers with these people , and they all voted me most chatty and agreeable ; but the blank burthen of the day was indescribable .

		I retreated from it coming home into a corner and found a charming little maiden of 17 who prattled to me of everything in heaven and earth , with a great many ` Mr.
Green	PERSON	's ' in every sentence .

		I told her I usually carried a book in my pocket in case I had nothing to do for half an hour .

		`` Oh , yes , ' she said , `` I suppose it is the
Bible	LOCATION	. '

		Ah , me !

		it was the Physiologie du godt .

		But are these the thoughts of little maidens concerning parsons -- are we ideals with perennial Bibles in our pockets ? ''

		When
Green	ORGANIZATION	found himself at last freed from clerical duties , the sense of relief was very great , and even the knowledge that his physical condition was precarious could not curb his ex - uberance of spirit . ''

		Wo n't it be jolly to have no sermons to preach on Sundays ! ''

		he writes to
Freeman	PERSON	; and a few days later , '' Oh ,
Freeman	PERSON	, my good fellow , how I wish you were here .

		I am in such tearing spirits at the prospect of Freedom .


William Tell	PERSON	, ora pro nobis .

		Oh ,
Leonidas	PERSON	,
Garibaldi	PERSON	, all illustrious Bards of freedom , hoorah-te pro nobis ! ''

		The next five years of his life belong to the '' Short His - tory '' -- '' Little Book , '' he calls it in his let - ters .

		The
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	had offered him terms which relieved him of the problem of liveli - hood , -- at least in its more pressing aspects -- and he was not called upon to struggle against poverty and disease at the same time .

		His long projected work on the
Angevin	PERSON	kings was set aside , for he realized that the chances were against his living to complete it .

		But the '' Short History '' represented a task that lay well within his powers and the span of life that probably remained to him , and he set about the work with zest .

		The plan is first mentioned in a letter dated near the close of
1869	DATE	, and from that time on the correspondence is largely concerned with the progress of the work .

		The remainder of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's life was spent largely abroad .

		He had visited
Normandy	LOCATION	in
1867	DATE	, and
Anjou	LOCATION	the following year , but it was not until the autumn of
1869	DATE	that he had his first glimpse of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He wrote of this trip : ' `` I came back last week very tired , but with a new sense of the world 's beauty , and -- what will you say to me -- a resolve to go to
Italy	LOCATION	every year till I die .

		The land has cast its spell on me as it did on Theodoric and the Ottos . ''

		It was just after his return from this visit that a consultation with his physician revealed the fact that his life was hanging by a thread .

		Instead of discouraging him , this knowledge seemed to supply a new inspiration for work ; and , for a man in his condition , his activities during the remaining years of his life seem almost incredible .

		A letter of
1871	DATE	has this acute bit of philosophy : '' The
Piazza	PERSON	at
Florence	LOCATION	gave me the same thrill that I remember on the Lake of
Lucerne	LOCATION	: -- I am afraid an even more delightful thrill , for after all Swiss dem - ocracy is a democracy of institutions , we admire its constitution , its landesgemeinde and the like , but Flor - entine democracy was a democracy of men .

		Teu - tonic freedom is too often a development of man on one side only , the political , while Italian was -LRB- I feel all the answer that lies in that ♦ was ' -RRB- a development of the whole man -- political , intellectual , religious , artistic . ''

		The next extract is written from
San Remo	LOCATION	: '' I am going to high mass to-morrow , inasmuch as Catholicism has an organ and Protestantism only a harmonium , and the difference of truth between them do n't seem to me to make up for the difference of in - struments . ''

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 433 This seems to indicate that it was just as well Green should have given up his duties as a priest of the Anglican communion .

		His sense of humor remains as keen as ever .

		Meeting Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	in
Rome	LOCATION	, he writes thus of the encounter : '' He was on his way to
Athens	LOCATION	, and simply picking up stray bits of Hellenism , sculptures and what not , by the road .

		One of his aims is to verify Greek busts ; he doubts `` Pericles , ' and a little doubts Alexander -- whereat I wept and fled .

		Likewise he is seeking to know how Hellenic youug women kept their clothes on , a question wrapped in the deepest mystery , and in - soluble by the
Highest Germany	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps it was too insoluble for the Hellenic young women themselves , as to judge from the later sculptures they seem soon to have dropt the effort to keep their clothes on .

		Per - haps that is why
Mahaffy	PERSON	calls the Periclean time the age of Decadence . ''

		The '' Short History '' was published in
1874	DATE	, and had a great and immediate success .

		It took the public by storm , much as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's history had done a quarter of a century before .

		It was no sooner off his hands than Green was busy with projects for extension and revision .

		The revision of the one-volume work proved beyond his powers , but the extension into the four-volume '' History '' became an accomp - lished fact in
1880	DATE	. ''

		The Making of Eng - land '' followed in
1882	DATE	, and '' The Conquest of
England	LOCATION	'' a year later , the year of the author 's death .

		The '' Stray Studies from
England	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	'' were first collected in
1876	DATE	, the '' Readings from English History '' were edited in
1879	DATE	, and the '' Short Geography of the British Islands '' was published in the same year .

		This latter work was done with the help of his wife , for Green was married in
1877	DATE	to Miss
Alice Stopford	PERSON	, and his last six years were blessed with a wedded companionship of unusual sympathy and intimacy .

		A series of articles on '' Oxford during the Last Century '' and a selection of the '' Essays of Joseph Ad - dison '' completes the list of books bearing
Green	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		The series of '' Primers '' which he edited should not go unmentioned , nor the many articles written for the ''
Saturday	DATE	Re - view , '' of which over one hundred and sixty are here listed .

		And all this work was done by a man who never knew what robust health meant , and the last fifteen years of whose life were one protracted struggle with the arch enemy .

		His life was heroic in a higher than the usual sense , and the revealing record now published endears him to our memory even more than do his books .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Clipping the `` Wings of Romance .

		* Many a reader today , as he looks back over the current flood of historical fiction , will re - member the time when it first became apparent that Realism was not the only force in litera - ture .

		With some '' The Ballad of East and West '' marks the moment , with some `` The Prisoner of Zenda , '' with some '' Under the Red Robe . ''

		With some it was `` Doctor
Pascal	PERSON	' * or '' Lourdes . ''

		There were many even , watch - ers in the dawn , who felt the truth within them when they confessed a wild delight at ''
King Solomon	PERSON	's Mines , '' when they speculated deeply upon '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	, '' when they sat up all night over `` The Wreck of the Grovener . ''

		Whatever the moment , the time came when Realism was not the one thing needful , when Naturalism seemed unnatural , when
Psycho	LOCATION	- logy was captured by the laboratory , and Human Documents were no longer seen in the magazines .

		Then began for many a very happy time : they could read a novel , enjoy it immensely , and yet feel that they were literary .

		Then
Stevenson	PERSON	became the idol of the hour .

		We have lived on since those days with minor literary movements , but still we remain in the temper to think well of Romance , to like to read about it , in fact to welcome such a book as Professor Beers 's '' History of English Ro - manticism . ''

		We feel in touch with Romance to-day .

		This new volume of Mr.
Beers	PERSON	's work is more interesting in its subject than was the first , on the
eighteenth century	DATE	, as anyone will under * stand .

		But not the subject only is interesting .

		The book is easily written , has much curious detail , much just criticism .

		It informs us on many points , recalls to mind a good deal with which we were sub-consciously familiar , differs with us on a good many points where we can argue pleasantly .

		It is not too scholarly for general reading , nor so popular as to be useless for the student .

		I do not myself agree with the author as to his conception of Romanticism .

		This may be ancient history now , for that conception was put forward in the previous volume and debated by his critics a year ago .

		But the matter is even more important in this volume , and as it is hardly possible to give an idea of the book without saying something about its subject , I * A History of English Romanticism in thb Nine - teenth Century .

		By
Henry A. Beers	ORGANIZATION	.

		New York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		434 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, make no apology for discussing the matter again .

		Prof. Beers defines romanticism as medieval - ism in modern letters and art .

		He explained and defended this view in his first volume , and now he remarks upon some criticisms , that * ' every writer has a right to make his own definitions ; or at least to say what his book shall be about . ''

		His own book he wishes to be about the revival of medievalism in nine - teenth century literature .

		Hence he writes of
Scott	PERSON	's poems and of some of his novels , of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's poetry and of
Keats	PERSON	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, of the romanticists of
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, of the Pre-Raphaelites and the neo-Pre-Raphaelites ; and , finally , of the medievalising tendencies outside of litera - ture , such as the Anglo-Catholic movement , the revival of interest in Gothic architecture and the socialistic interpretation of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		That is surely an interesting set of topics ; if a man likes to read of those matters and write of them , why not read his work with pleasure ?

		I have read his book with pleasure ; indeed I rather think that that is the reason why I can not be wholly satisfied with it .

		Call it ro - manticism or not , I feel that there should be something more .

		If only Professor Beers would say , '' All in good time , my little sir . ''

		Perhaps he is about to write other volumes still .

		Quarreling about the definition of terms is stupid business for third parties , but after all is it not tantalizing for a man to give you a book about the romance of '' Ivanhoe '' and * '
Quentin Durward	PERSON	'' and yet say nothing about `` The Bride of Lammermoor '' and `` Waver - ley , '' to tell of the romance of
Tennyson	PERSON	and yet be silent concerning the Brontes , to tell us about '' Lautrec '' by
Payne	PERSON	and '' Lays of
France	LOCATION	'' by O'Shaughnessey and to omit en - tirely all mention of
Stevenson	PERSON	?

		Ivanhoe is a romanticfigure and so is
Quentin Durward	PERSON	.

		But is not
Lucy Ashton	PERSON	?

		Her brother thought so .

		And is not
Edward Wa	ORGANIZATION	- verley ?

		He himself at least , felt that he had known romance .

		Professor Beers chose to write of the medieval part , but how can one write well of one without saying a word of the other ?


Lucy Ashton	PERSON	and the Master of Ra - venswood are typical romantic figures , -- typical certainly of the romance of their time , which no doubt had its weak and its silly side .

		But aside from all that , it had something posi - tive , and its positive power was not different from that of
Rebecca	PERSON	and
Wilfred	PERSON	when the stage tinsel of medievalism had been taken away .

		Scott went directly from one to the other ; how can we say , it was romance in the
summer of 1819	DATE	but not in the
spring	DATE	?

		Surely there must have been something in com - mon , and that something very probably the thing worth knowing about .

		Medievalism was largely stage setting , -- even Professor Beers sees nothing very meritorious in it , -- just as the sighing and sternness was largely sentiment ; but how can one look beneath and not see that the real thing is that which they have in com - mon ?

		Scott set a fashion of medievalism , and there were other fashions too in the years following the Waverleys .

		Professor Beers is not writing of Realism and he has nothing to say of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		But
Dickens	PERSON	himself -LRB- who can doubt it ? -RRB-

		had his fancy for romance .

		Without counting
Sidney Carton	PERSON	on the scaffold , think of Lady Dedlock lying before the grated ruin where her lover was buried , of
Lizzie Hexam	PERSON	rowing her father about as he plied his strange vocation on the river , of
Miss Haversham	LOCATION	in her rotting wedding dress and her one satin slipper , and of how many more .

		Dickens often thought of himself as dealing with romance , as he says in the preface to ''
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	, '' the romance of real life .

		Better examples still of the same sort of thing are ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' and ''
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	. ''

		Not medievalism of course , but that spirit of romance was not so different from the spirit which underlay the medievalism , that we can appreciate the one without the other .

		And then
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Surely Professor Beers might have let him in .

		He was of the nine - teenth century and he wrote '' The Black Ar - row . ''

		It is true that he cared very little for '' The Black Arrow '' -LRB- called it tushery , never , oh never , read it , once published -RRB- ; but after all is the spirit of the book so different from that of ' • Kidnapped '' and '' Treasure Island '' ?

		Professor Beers does not write of Stevenson : he prefers to write of the medieval revival , and he holds that he has the right to use the defini - tion of romanticism that he finds in the dic - tionary .

		Quite so : a man should certainly have preferences and he certainly can not be blamed for using a dictionary .

		Still , a historian of literature will want to be something more than a chartered libertine and a colleague of the Earl of
Chatham	LOCATION	and
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	.

		He will want to be one who in all the superficial appearances of literary history perceives the true tendencies , one who is not misled by fancies
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		435 and eccentricities but perceives true likenesses and affinities , one who can make clear and intelligible and interesting matters which had been confused and without sense .

		The fact that men of letters were interested in medievalism , though it may itself be ex - plained , does not do much to explain the course of literature in the nineteenth century .

		I should like an explanation of '' Waverley , '' for instance , and especially of '' St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well '' ; I should like
Byron	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	given a place in the general movement ; I should like to know why
Dickens	PERSON	loved the romance of real life ; why the Pre-Raphaelites became aesthetics and then decadents ; in what ways , beside the individuality of genius ,
Stevenson	PERSON	differs from
Scott	LOCATION	.

		Doubtless Professor Beers has no desire to explain these matters .

		I avoid saying what I consider romance .

		Professor Beers describes others who offer definitions as seeking '' to express the true in - wardness of romantic literature by analyzing it into its elements , selecting one of those elements as essential and rejecting all the rest as accidental . ''

		That process seems to me well enough , provided always that the one element selected turned out really to be essential .

		Such a result I should say was one of the tests as to whether the work were well done or not .

		Professor Beers certainly can not imagine that the true critical method consists in analyzing something into elements and considering them all equally important .

		That at least is not his own method , for he goes through no analysis at all , but settles on one quality -LRB- an accidental one , by the way -RRB- and decides that his book shall be about that .

		All this discussion about the name of a book may seem hypercritical .

		It is not , for only when we understand just what his subject is , can we understand why Professor Beers does not say upon it anything really illuminat - ing or final .

		I should say he failed to explain the one element which he considers .

		In dealing with the romance of medievalism apart from the other forms of romanticism , he makes it im - possible to get the true understanding of either .

		That is why his book , though careful and abounding in curious and interesting points , does not have any of those real generalizations and keen bits of insight that are so exhilarat - ing to the reader , and when well-founded so valuable to the student .

		Professor Beers really knows better .

		He knows that romanticism is something more than medievalism , for he often uses the word in the broader sense .

		And if it means something more , that is only because a greater number of things to which the word may be applied have something in common , and if they have something in common , it is probable that they will be better understood by an exposition of it .

		This Professor Beers is well aware of For it is the principle which guided him in his first volume , which , although based on the same definition , really deals with many things which have not the slightest touch of medi - evalism .

		He saw that a true history demanded a treatment of various things which lay out - side his definition .

		I am sorry that he did not take the same liberty in the present volume .

		A Queen 's Comrade .

		Yet there was the material for a fascinating narrative , and Mr.

		Gossippy of course so intimate a narrative is bound to be , but the gossip is authentic and no modern invention .

		Judged by a narrowly conventional standard Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	is open to criticism for a tendency already noted to disregard the requirements of a strict sense of unity .

		For nearly a chapter every now and then we lose sight of the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	, while we read of club life in Queen
Anne	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	, of
Monmouth	LOCATION	's rebellion , or
William	PERSON	's intrigues , presented with a detail that has little if any direct bearing on the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		But her royal acquaintances are so well worth knowing that we are very willing to condone the lack of subordination resulting from undue attention to their high - nesses , merely for the sake of the broader out - look thus afforded .

		Also -- and here is the real defense for the introduction of so much seemingly extraneous material -- there is noth - ing in the book which does not help the reader to a grasp of the curious ethical standard of the times , without an understanding of which the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	would be incomprehensible , -- a monster of insincerity , cupidity , and ingrati - tude .

		As it is , she moves before us very hu - man , completely in and of the world around her , now the centre of that world 's shifting interest , then pushed into the background .

		So , like all but the greatest of mankind , -- the few indisputable heroes who can hold the stage against all comers , -- she played her varying part , now heroine , now supernumerary ; and thus Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	has wisely chosen to repro - duce her .

		She was born on the gala May-day of Charles II .

		's glad return from exile , and spent much of the impressionable period of her life at the
Merry Monarch	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant and vicious court , as playmate to the shy little Princess
Anne	PERSON	and maid of honor to the second Duchess of York ,
Anne	PERSON	's step-mother .

		It was while she was acting in this latter capacity that Col.
John Churchill	PERSON	, Master of Robes to the Duke of York , met her at a ball and was caught fast in the toils of her wilful beauty .

		Utterly incapable apparently , even in girlhood , of any deep affection ,
Sarah	PERSON	was keenly appreciative of her lover 's brilliant prospects ; and , after repeated avowals of love undying on his part and insolent rebuffs and accusations of insin - cerity on hers , she was finally pleased to be gracious ; and at the age of seventeen became Col.
Churchill	PERSON	's wife .

		In spite of her self - ishness , her caprices , her frightful temper , and her dangerous outspokenness which ultimately wrecked his career at its height , her husband seems always to have loved her warmly and to have found his truest happiness in her society .

		She , on the other hand , appears to have re - garded him from the first as chiefly a tool of her ambitions , a convenient threat to hold over the head of the hapless
Anne	PERSON	when , like the traditional worm , she ventured to turn upon her oppressor .

		It was not until the close of the tragic reign of
James	LOCATION	, whose hard fate it was always to act against himself , that Lady Churchill , whose influence over
Anne	LOCATION	had by this time become absolute , began to take an active part in politics , her first move being , characteris - tically enough , to incite
Anne	PERSON	against the king who had been to her the kindest of fathers and to the Churchills the most generous of bene - factors .

		Highly typical of the heartless fri - volity of the time is the account Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	gives us of
Anne	PERSON	's light-hearted desertion of her father .

		Accompanied by
Lady Churchill	PERSON	, who seems to have planned the affair as a con - venient means of escape for herself from the monarch her husband had betrayed , the doting Anne '' stole down a backstairs '' to the coach which was awaiting her . ''

		The escapade had for her something of the excite - ment and pleasure of an elopement .

		The fact of her high-heeled shoe sticking in the mud caused much merriment , and Lord
Dorset	LOCATION	's pulling off his leather gauntletted glove and begging her to slip her foot into it as he half carried her to the coach , gave him the air of a second-hand
Raleigh	LOCATION	.

		She was in such mirth that none who heard or saw could think there was a possi - bility of her father losing his crown or of the nation being in a state of civil war . ''

		Lady
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's next step was to influence
Anne	PERSON	to forego her claim to the crown in favor of
William	LOCATION	.

		In her '' Account of her Con - duct , '' written years after , she tells us that she was then '' so very simple a creature '' as never to guess
King William	PERSON	's real design in coming to
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Having never read , nor employed my time in any - thing but playing cards , and having no ambition myself , I imagined that the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	's sole design was to provide for the safety of his own country by obliging
King James	PERSON	to keep the laws of ours ; and that he would go back as soon as he had made us all happy . ''

		The Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	as a type of guileless simplicity is very amusing , but it is

		THE DIAI .

		437 probably true that
William	PERSON	did deceive her as well as her husband and many another of
James	PERSON	's whilom friends .

		How the '' glorious Revolution '' dwindles , when Mr.
MoUoy	PERSON	shows us the men behind the issue , from a great blow struck at tyranny to a clever bit of political chicanery foisted by the crafty
William	PERSON	upon a bewildered and unsuspecting people -- a cow / > d'etat almost as dramatic and quite as unprincipled as
Napoleon	PERSON	's of the eighteenth Brumaire I In spite of the services Lord and
Lady Marlborough	LOCATION	had rendered in securing
William	PERSON	his throne , they straightway fell out of favor for their violent partisanship of Anne .

		Lady
Marlborough	LOCATION	's dismissal shortly became the bone of contention between the two royal sis - ters , who ceased wrangling over it only when
Mary	PERSON	died .

		Then
William	PERSON	, who `` entered into the quarrels of women as if he had been one , '' saw fit to patch up a reconciliation , which was empty and formal , and was followed , both for the Princess and her favorite , by just such slights and insults as had preceded it .

		All this must have been exceedingly trying to the high-spirited
Sarah	PERSON	, who assures us , how - ever , that she was not glad at hearing of
William	LOCATION	's death , -- '' so little is it in my na - ture to retain resentment against any mortal -LRB- however unjust soever he may have been -RRB- in whom the will to injure is no more . ''

		In view of later events we commend the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	's sincerity in adding the final clause .

		With the accession of
Anne	PERSON	begins the most familiar and likewise the most brilliant chap - ter of the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	's story .

		As she herself puts it : '' From this time I began to be looked upon as a person of consequence , without whose approbation , at least , neither places , nor pensions , nor honours were be - `` towed by the Crown .

		The intimate friendship with which the Queen was known to honour me , afforded a plausible foundation for this opinion .

		And I believe therefore it will be a surprise to many to be told that the first important step which Her Majesty took after her accession to the government was against my wishes and inclination ; I mean her throwing herself and her affairs almost entirely into the hands of the Tories . ''

		Whatever the '' many '' may have thought of
Anne	PERSON	's mild self-assertion .

		Lady
Marlbor	PERSON	- ough 's surprise was genuine and her displeas - ure too keen to be afPected by any obligation that
Anne	PERSON	's munificent bounty could bind upon her .

		The war of words that followed between poor peace-loving
Anne	PERSON	and the haughty in - tolerant Duchess is very vividly presented by means of extracts from their letters or bits of the gossip that buzzed about the court with reference to their stormy meetings .

		Increas - ingly turbulent interviews and impertinent letters marked the stages of the famous quar - rel which raged for four weary years and rent the whole court in twain .

		Finally the Queen , sick of lectures and reprimands , forbade the Duchess the court .

		The long and unpopular reign of the Marlboroughs was over .

		The Duchess , furious at her husband 's counsel of mildness , flung her keys of o #
Bce	ORGANIZATION	at the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's head and he carried them to
Anne	PERSON	, who a few months later wrote him that he too was dis - missed from her service .

		But though thus summarily stripped of her power , neither the distaste for court life which she declares she had felt ever since she was fourteen , nor her advancing years , brought the indomitable Duchess any desire for peace or real retirement .

		To the end of her days she was busy , like
Martha	PERSON	before her , about many things ; '' though her activity was not productive of peace or good will to any man . ''

		We get a very vivid picture of her old age , spent in marrying off her granddaughters , acting as nurse and purser to the Duke , or swearing at his physician , quarrelling with her daughters , reviling
Anne	PERSON	and the Georges in - discriminately , husbanding her vast wealth , and publishing first a lively '' Account of her Conduct , '' and then a vindication of the afore - said '' Account '' and of her character in gen - eral from the storm of condemnation her first book had drawn upon her .

		So did the first Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	continue to war with the world until she left it ; the art of which she had most perfect control being that of making enemies .

		No brief review of '' The Queen 's Comrade '' can do it real justice , for its chief charm is its detail .

		The interest is well sustained and pungently spiced with variety .

		It is meant for leisurely , luxurious reading , which it well repays ; but it is made available to the student in search of a particular point by the very co - pious synopses that head the chapters .

Standards of Typographic Taste	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Printing , as ordinarily practised , is a mere question of craftsmanship , like stone-cutting , or wood-carving , or a score of other trades .

		But , just as the line that separates the stone - cutter from the sculptor , or a Swiss peasant from an
Andreas Zorn	PERSON	, is a difficult one to draw , so printing proceeds by stages infinitesimally small from the status of a post-mediaeval mys - tery to that of a handicraft , and finally to that of a fine art .

		Indeed , taken in connection with its kindred perplexities of type-founding , paper - making , and book-binding , it was the one art that fairly baffled the genius of
William Morris	PERSON	, the one over which he never obtained complete mastery .

		Of late years there has been a woeful falling off from typographical excellence on one hand , and a most determined attempt to revive its an - cient glories on the other .

		The renascence of the ars conservatrix was at first complicated by the endeavor to do too much , -- to substitute for modest and simple excellence in typography an effect that was largely decorative or pictorial .

		It was here that
Morris	PERSON	made his most conspicu - ous failure , ^ hat time of experimental groping was succee ^ ^ by a series of more or less doleful imitators of the work of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	, some of whom have not yet gone to their reward in the limbo reserved for false prophets .

		Many of our ambitious workers and self-imagined ex - perts have yet to learn that the best printing fol - lows the good old rule embodied in the phrase ars celare artem ; and they must learn it in the good old school of experience .

		Nothing , per - haps , is better suited to bring a neophyte to some degree of typographical connoisseurship than some of the monstrosities that pass for fine books among a sadly misled class to-day , -- ill - shaped pages printed on pretentious and inap - propriate paper , from grotesque or freakish type , with poor ink unevenly applied , and given to the world in flimsy or tawdry binding , a work un-proof-read , unregistered , and inept .

		Such poisonous-looking volumes have a single merit : they carry with them their own antidote to all discerning minds .

		But the love of luxury which grows with increasing wealth demands excellence , since it can afford to pay for it ; and in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	printers who retain for themselves the noble simplicity of the best traditions of their art are striving worthily to supply this new demand .

		Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	-
Sanderson	PERSON	, with the newly established
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, and in this country the De
Vinne Press	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and the special book-making department established in
1899	DATE	at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	under the direction of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	, are the most notable examples of this praiseworthy movement .

		It is with three notable volumes put forth this season by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Miffin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	at the latter press , that we are now concerned . ''

		Obermann , '' the masterpiece of
Etienne Pivert de Senancour	PERSON	, is known to English - speaking people chiefly through the two poems of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	which bear the name of
Senancour	ORGANIZATION	's book , and those others that attest its influence .

		This work , almost inaccessible even to the few to whom it makes its timid but passionate appeal , and , when obtained , found to hold between its covers much that has lost its savor '' in this our troubled day , '' is an ideal book to be issued in selections and in a fastidious edition , with discreet editorial super - vision .

		Accordingly ,
Miss Jessie Peabody Frothingham	PERSON	, pleasantly remembered for her translation of the '' Journal '' of
Maurice de Guerin	PERSON	, has rendered the vital portions of '' Obermjmn '' into English , prefixing a critical and biographical essay on the author and his work , and adding copious notes that reveal her width of reading and keenness of critical per - ception .

		This is the first of the three volumes under consideration .

		Xavier de
Maistre	ORGANIZATION	's widely known and greatly admired '' Voyage autour de ma Chambre '' is the second .

		Popular as this book is , and justly so , among those of literary judgment , it is known chiefly through the repeated editions of it that have been pre - pared for the use of school-children .

		Ad j udging it worthy of a better fate , Professor de Su - michrast of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	has written a charming little preface for this new edition , from that authorized in
France	LOCATION	, in which he says , among other things : '' ' U ne s ' ^ tait pas dont6 , ' dit Sainte-Beuve , ' qu'il devenait durant ce temps-l ^ , un de nos anteurs les plus connus et lea mieuz aim ^ s .

		The third of these books needs no introduc - tion , since it has steered its way successfully for a long generation between the semi-oblivion of slender appreciation and the merciless popu - larity of a text-book .

		This is '' Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's Letters to a Young Man about Town , '' con - tributed by
Thackeray	PERSON	to the columns of * ' Punch '' during the year
1849	DATE	.

		These letters , addressed by an elder among men of the world to one just about to enter upon the pleasant life of the leisure class , are as witty and sound to-day as when first published , and abundantly deserve the characterization given them by
James Hannay	PERSON	, quoted in the publishers ' note , as being `` inimitable , wise , easy , playful , worldly social sketches . ''

		Most fit , like the other books mentioned , are such writings for a limited edition suited to their luxurious content .

		So much for the literary and intellectual side of these three works ; we will speak briefly of the habiliments in which they are clad . ''

		Ober - mann '' is printed in two volumes , in a style following closely , but without servility , that in vogue in
France	LOCATION	at the time of their publication a century ago .

		The heavy unsmoothed paper , the clear print , the complete absence of decora - tion and color , the perfect registering of the pages , the accurate and intelligent proof - reading , the chaste binding in heavy cadet - blue paper with paper labels on the back , all combine to give the book a pleasing aus - terity of appearance in happy harmony with its • contents .

		In de
Maistre	ORGANIZATION	's book more of decoration is permissible .

		The frontispiece is a likeness of the author , from a portrait hitherto unpublished .

		The title-page is printed from an engraving on copper by Mr.
Sidney L. Smith	PERSON	, after the man - ner of the eighteenth century .

		Engraved head - pieces , and half-title vignettes and tail-pieces from wood , are employed with good effect .

		The initials , in rococo style , are rubricated .

		Where * '
Obermann	PERSON	'' has the effect of chasteness and austerity , this volume is more light and fanciful .

		The vellum back alone seems out of complete harmony .

		Thackeray 's book is bound in boards , like the others , but these are covered with a marbled paper in S-shaped sworls , admirably old fash - ioned , -- even , like the '' Letters , '' to the point of the sentimental .

		A vignette , in a manner not unlike
Thackeray	PERSON	's own , decorates the title - page .

		The type and paper reflect the feeling of the book to a remarkable degree , and the whole effect is finely and completely har - monious .

		It is a pity that some benevolently disposed person , in an age when money for libraries is flowing in millions , can not establish small collections of these correctly made books at in - tervals throughout the land , for the purpose of establishing comparisons , and cultivating typo - graphic taste .


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		The iNxrsGS of the Animai ^ s. * The hunting instinct is by no means eradi - cated from the human breast , though it plays but little part , directly , in the economy of the civilized life of to-day .

		The old habit still lurks in our veins , and most of us follow a good animal story with something of the zest of the chase .

		Authors -- and publishes too -- have found this out ; and , following in the wake of '' The Jungle Books '' and '' Wild Animals I Have Known , '' come new claimants for our in - terest .

		Some naturalists and more scientists are half inclined to quarrel with this newly-fledged method of depicting animal life , and some would even relegate the whole anthropomor - phic menagerie to the forests of
Wonderland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Seton-Thompson	PERSON	seems to have heard of these criticisms , for in the preface of his latest collection of stories , `` Lives of the Hunted , '' he takes particular pains to state that '' The material of these accounts is true .

		The chief liberty taken is in ascribing to one animal the adventures of several . ''

Dec. 1	DATE	, and it looses nothing in the telling -- on the authority '' of three bronzed mountaineers . ''

		It is obviously unfair to ask for an extension of the list of authorities .

		It is equally unfair to fail to recognize the fund of animal lore from which the material of these tales is drawn .

		They should not , however , be judged as scientific re - ports upon the habits and instincts of animals where unvarnished fact and cold logic admit of no embellishment for the reader 's delectation .

		They are essentially and primarily stories with an underlying basis of fact and observation .

		In any case , the court of final appeal is open , and we can all take to the woods and plains and ob - tain a first-hand acquaintance with their furred and feathered denizens .

		The stories in Mr.
Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's present collection include his recent as well as some of his earlier con - tributions to periodical literature .


Krag	PERSON	,
Biddy	PERSON	and
Randy	PERSON	,
Johnny Bear	PERSON	,
Tito	ORGANIZATION	, Chink , and the Kangaroo Rat , are most of them old friends ; and whether old or new are sure of a welcome from hosts of readers among the children of all ages .

		In the humor and the human element which this author finds in his animal friends , lies one of the secrets of his well-deserved popularity .

		In Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's '' The Outcasts '' we have an example of what a fellow-writer is pleased to call '' the archaic method , making the animals talk . ''

		His theme is the origin of the
Wood Buffalo	LOCATION	, the surviving herd of American bison in the forests of
Athabasca	LOCATION	.

		The characters are A'tim the outcast dog-wolf , and Shag the old bull driven from the herd .

		The portrayal , which at times is Kiplingesque , may be true to life , but as a story it lacks humor entirely , and the chief actors are not pleasing additions to one 's animal acquaintances .

		The grim horror of the struggle for life is the main impression to be derived from the book , while the springs of the reader 's sympathy are not touched as by the work of Kipling and
Seton-Thompson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tales which Mr.
Foster	PERSON	has gathered together under the title '' In the Forest '' deal with the larger beasts of the woods .

		They are in some cases biographies in which the animal traits , good and evil alike as judged by human standards , are portrayed with equal faithful - ness , and withal with force and vividness .

		The ring of genuineness and the spirited treatment add further charm to these tragic tales of wood - land life .

		Perhaps it is true , as Mr.
Seton	PERSON	-
Thompson	PERSON	has said , that the only way to make an animal 's history un-tragic is to stop before the last chapter .

		Mr.
Dallas	PERSON	Lore Sharp 's '' Wild Life near Home '' belongs in a somewhat different cate - gory of animal books .

		These sketches recount the rambles of a naturalist whose sharp eyes and indefatigable patience have brought to light much of interest concerning the birds and fishes , rabbits and opossums , muskrats and squirrels , in their haunts in the fields , woods , and swamps of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		The book follows the conventional lines of nature-books , but with more than the usual diversity of theme and with exceptional vivacity of style .

		The illustration of nature books has come to be a fine art , -- indeed , a very special fine art .

		In the books here reviewed we have the work of several artists , exemplifying as many methods .

		The stilted wood-cuts of our older natural histories look strangely out of place be - side the work of the artists of to-day .

		The pictures in '' The Outcasts '' are the least ef - fective .

		They are stiff and wooden , and one instinctively looks for evidence of the taxider - mist 's work .

		The illustrations by
Rungius	PERSON	for '' In the Forest '' are very spirited , full of ac - tion , and wonderfully life-like , though the one entitled '' The Yearling Buck '' is evidently in - correctly named .

		In '' Lives of the Hunted ' * the author is the illustrator -- a rare and most effective combination .

		These illustrations are as unique as the text .

		Their great effective - ness lies in the suggestiveness of the drawings -- the greater at times by reason of their some - what hidden meaning .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's work is abundantly illustrated by Mr.
Bruce Horsfall	PERSON	with much delicacy and skill , the artistic finish of the work standing in strong contrast to the few bold lines of Mr.
Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's mar - ginals and tail-pieces .

		The two books last named are fine examples of the bookmaker 's art , showing taste and skill in every detail .

		If both of the books are to be at one 's disposal , Mr.

		A map in the back of the volume , and the characteristic drawings of Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, of which there are some eighty or ninety , help very much to a vivid realization of scenes and places .

		It is a region of but little more than thirty miles square , and yet there is crowded in it so much of lake and river , of mountain , brook , and fell , that , but for the author 's ani - mated showing , it would be hard to believe that all of its localities are genuinely interest - ing .

		Many of the places he fastens in our memories indelibly by a telling story or a characteristic anecdote .

		Here on the border of
Scotland	LOCATION	there were stirring deeds for many centuries ; and indeed , to say nothing of the border warfare , the annals of the internal affairs of this part of the country are not lacking in dramatic interest . ''

		It is
Cicely	LOCATION	, the yonngest of all these , that with pale face and golden hair now looks down on us from the window in
Penrith	LOCATION	church .

		She was a famous and haughty beauty , well-known in
London	LOCATION	, where she was commonly styled `` proud Cis of

		Her chief claim to notoriety , however , lies in the distinction acquired by her marriage and her motherhood .

		For she became the wife of
Richard Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	, the Yorkist heir - presumptire to the English throne , and mother of Ed - ward IV .

		Castle , church , village , all call up legend or more recent story , and each takes color from Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's ready understanding of the spirit of time and place .

		In the new edition of the '' Literary Asso - ciations of the English Lakes , '' first published in
1894	DATE	,
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	touches not so much upon the scenes and their historic interest , as upon the lives of men of letters who have spent here a day or a month or a year .


Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	are perhaps the heroes of the book , and it seems at times that the writer 's attitude toward them is , to say the least , not seriously critical .

Wordsworth	PERSON	very freely , and seems not to have any idea of the feeling about the poet which Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	expresses : '' One may be permitted , I think , some disappoint - ment that
Wordsworth	PERSON	seems to have been almost in - different to the moving pageants of history , the passions , the humours and the pathos of olden days .

		It is nothing that he wrote a few unremarkable poems on such sub - jects , or published a guide-book which deals chiefly with landscape detail and breaks ultimately into verse .

		Nor will the few notes he has left on manners and customs seem of much moment when compared with the ampler evidence of local antiquaries and historians .

		... It is not in the least strange that wherever in the
Lake Country	LOCATION	yon find a man or woman of literary tastes you find an enthusiastic dis - ciple of the Rydal bard ; but their pious belief that suck devotion is common to all Anglo-Saxondom is more noteworthy . ''

		The list of literary celebrities who have been in some way connected with the
Lake Region	ORGANIZATION	is a long one ; and whether they came for a chance view , for a vacation ramble , or for the purpose of establishing a home , we here make acquaintance with them in an inti - mate fashion .

		What we learn of each is always significant .

		In the putting together of so many things unrelated save for the fact of a common place of action , it inevitably results that the reader feels the lack of some unifying thread of nar - rative or of argument .

		Here came
Shelley	PERSON	with his young wife , and here the poet-reformer grew to have a bitter aversion for
Southey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Christopher North the hearty and happy ,
Coleridge	PERSON	the mystical ,
Carlyle	PERSON	the strenuous and prophetic ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	the polished , and Gray the delicate , met here , drawn by a common interest .

		The company is a motley one , but the keen observer will not fail to get many new items of understanding of those that come and pass .

		In the presence of the mountains and the lakes , each man becomes himself , and the best and the worst in him be - comes clear to us as the face of nature .

		442 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, HOIilDAT PUBL.ICATIONS .

		I. r No figure in contemporary art-history is more imposing than Professor
Hubert von Herkomer	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	.

		It is therefore quite fitting that the most distinguished of the art books of the season should be a study of his life and works -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is a truly magnificent super-royal quarto of one hundred and thirty-five pages , with special binding designed by Professor von
Herko	PERSON	- mer himself , and illustrated with sixteen photo - gravure plates and about ninety half-tone blocks .

		As a sympathetic study of an unusual and versatile genius , nothing could be better than the text of Mr.
A. L. Baldry	PERSON	.

		To the average mind , why and how an artist paints pictures or brings into existence great achievements in bronze or marble is an un - accountable mystery .

		In the general estimation , there is an uncanny touch of heredity in the way that an artist 's personality stamps an odd family likeness upon everything that comes from his hand .

		The public , not understanding the facts of art , in - vests it with an array of fancies , and allows imag - ination to run riot in sentimental ideas about the men who can put their thoughts into a tangible form .

		The skilful biographer is he who shows there is a necessary and most intimate relation be - tween an artist 's personality and his life-product , a vital connection of cause with effect , although not always written where he who runs may read .

		In the present case , this dissection -- or , perhaps more properly , vivisection -- is greatly satisfying .

		It gives us the clue to an understanding of a man who gives the lie to the old proverb about Jack-of-all - trades .

		It explains what are the elements , and how mixed , in this artist , that at one moment it is a portrait or a picture that engages him , at another it is an enamel , or he turns for awhile to music , teaches , lectures , does etchings , invents a new pro- cess of engraving , goes deeply into artistic crafts - manship , makes audacious innovations in theatrical art , and intrudes into many professions that ac - cording to the popular notion are quite outside his sphere .

		Eight chapters are given to the record of this varied activity year by year ; the two concluding chapters describe the unique Herkomer art colony in the English country village of
Bushey	LOCATION	, and the sumptuous dwelling he has built for himself there .

		But , unlike many of his brother artists , the building of this house was not through a desire to construct an impressive pedestal for himself , but through an almost devotional intention to be true to a tradition that has been handed down to him from his ances - tors .

		For , in the last analysis , pride of race is the leading motive in
Herkomer	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		His wholly En - glish art is the production of a man who , in mind , habit , and temperament , is strongly and character - istically German .

		He is now in the best period of his maturity , with capacities highly trained , and a deep and comprehensive knowledge of the details of his profession .

		As there is no symptom of wan - ing in his energies or of weakening in his entha * siasm , his development in coming years is almost certain to be as significant as it has been during the time that has passed .

		To the supply of new editions of Shakespeare there seems to be practically no end .

		The latest comes from the house of
Lippincott	LOCATION	, consists of twenty handy volumes , and is called '' The
Twentieth Century Edition	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The special feature of this edition lies in the numerous full-page illustrations , some forty in all , finely reproduced in colors from designs by prominent English illustrators of the day , in - cluding Mr.
Byam Shaw	PERSON	, Mr.
Patten Wilson	PERSON	, and others .

		Except for these illustrations , and the gor - geously decorative title-page , the books are severely simple in style , entirely lacking in critical comment - ary , and are issued without any editorial name .

		The only introduction to the respective plays consists of two lines -- one giving the date of first publication , and another the number of acts , scenes , and lines .

		Each play is also provided with a glossary , and , where the folio or quarto text is obscure , a note stating on whose authority the present reading has been adopted .

		Numbered lines , and an index of Shakespearean characters with the plays in which they occur , are also useful features .

		The general appearance of the volumes , and their lightness in the hand , commend them ; and readers wearied with the over-weight of comment and of `` editing '' in some editions .

		of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may find here a wel - come relief .

		Art lovers will give a warm welcome to the new and enlarged edition of Mr.
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	's valu - able work on `` French Art '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with its forty-eight fine full-page illustrations of famous masterpieces , and a new chapter devoted to ''
Rodin	PERSON	and the Institute . ''

		The earlier edition closed with '' The New Movement in Sculpture '' ; since that edition appeared nine years ago , this new movement has firmly established itself , with
Auguste Rodin	PERSON	as its master spirit .

		The distinction between
M. Rodin	PERSON	's art and the art of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	sculptors is well expressed by Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	when he says : '' The
Institute	ORGANIZATION	is inspired by tradition and guided by nature ;
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	is inspired by nature and guided by tradition . ''

		There can not be much doubt as to which type produces the higher art .

		To be guided by tradition is legitimate ; an originality that is a pure abstraction is characteristic of no great artist since the evolution of art began .

		Everything de - pends upon the way in which one makes use of his patrimony .

		There is an eternal opposition between using it in a routine and mechanical way , drawing the interest on it , so to speak , from time to time , on the one hand , and on the other reinvesting it according to the dictates of one 's own feeling and faculty .

		The latter is what every great artist has done , and what
M. Rodin	PERSON	is now doing .

		He has been called a French
Michael Angelo	PERSON	; but , with a temperament in some measure analogous to that of the great Florentine , his art is his own .

		Some of his figures are conceived in somewhat the same
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 443 spirit as Angelo 's , bat they are never ran in the same moald .

		Both the old portions and the new of this beaatifal volume are fall of fiae and jast criticisms of art , and the illastrations place it among the best of the season 's art-books .

		The ^ ' Other Famous Homes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and their Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- will find an eager public awaiting it , the two earlier books of the same series having won a host of friends .

		Like its predecessors , the present volume is edited by Mr.
A. H. Malan	PERSON	, the separate descriptive articles being written either by the owners of the homes , or by those closely as - sociated with the reigning families .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	, by favor of her governing class , possesses artistic treasures -- pictures , sculptures , and articles of virtu -- in a series of private galleries which no other country can hope to rival .

		What yoanger nations , later in their awakening to artistic life , are striving to do in their museums and public galleries has already been done by the aristocracy of En - gland in their own homes .

		They have lavished their wealth upon the purchase of sculpture and pictures , and with a generous hospitality have , in a large sense , made them the property of the public .

		Scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land , these stately homes stand with doors open to the student , the owners and occupiers regarding themselves as trustees and custodians for the public weal .

		The descriptions of twelve of these ancestral houses , with their traditions , their treasures , and their architectural and picturesque features , are illustrated by about two hundred photographic plates , making a traly sumptuous as well as in - stractive volume .

		`` New Tales of Old
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the newest of that delightful series of archaeological books on
Rome	LOCATION	which , from time to time during the last dozen years , have come from the pen of Mr.
Rodolfo Lanciani	PERSON	.

		In this volume the author 's his - torical and archaeological researches are brought down to date , and classified under eight different heads , as follows : The New Discoveries in the Forum , The New Discoveries of the Sacra Via , The Sacred Grove of the Arvales , The Truth about the Grave of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, Strange Superstitions in
Rome	LOCATION	, Jewish Memorials in
Rome	LOCATION	, Scottish Me - morials in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The present campaign of ex - ploration is one which will remain memorable for - ever in archaeological records of the
Eternal City	LOCATION	.

		Former undertakings seldom touched the deepest levels , but this new movement has for its object to reach the early imperial , the republican , the kingly , and even the prehistoric strata , wherever it is pos - sible to do so without special injury to the later and higher structures .

		In the course of the work , many important discoveries have been made , the most im - portant being a cenotaph which Professor
Lanciani	PERSON	believes to be the veritable national monument of
Romulus	PERSON	, the founder of the city , raised not long after his death .

		This discovery is regarded by the author as a distinct victory for the conserva - tive body of stadents , to which he has always be - longed -- even at a time '' when a lecturer could not name the founder of the city as a man who had actu - ally existed , without blushing before his audience . ''

		The history of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	can not longer be written in the distrustful spirit of the hypercritical school .

		The twenty-three full-page plates and the one hundred and seventeen illustrations in the text are important features of this learned and beautiful work .

		A romantic interest always attaches to lands of which not very much is known ; and hence from the earliest times the countries of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	have been invested with a peculiar charm .

		As long ago as
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, we find it written : '' Here the light of the setting sun lingers on until sunrise , bright enough to dim the light of the stars .

		More than that , it is asserted that the sound of his rising is to be heard , and the forms of the gods and the glory round his head may be seen . ''

		For hundreds of years stories such as these , and others , of the battles between grods and giants , were repeated at
Norse	ORGANIZATION	firesides in the long winter evenings ; and at last , more than one thousand years after
Tacitus	PERSON	, they were brought together in books known as the
Eddas	LOCATION	.

		These an - cient books , which a brave and noble race carried in its heart through all its wide wanderings and conquests , take one back to the beginning of time , and tell of the birth of the worlds and the coming of the gods to rule over them .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have this year given us a new collection of these ''
Norse Stories	ORGANIZATION	, '' re-told by Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	in a very pleasant way , and illustrated by ten colored plates and marginal decorations on each page by Mr.
Greorge Wright	PERSON	.

		There are seven - teen of these tales , beginning with '' The Making of the World '' and the creation of man .

		Out of the ash and the elm trees were created the first human pair , the gods calling the man Ask and the woman
Embla	LOCATION	.

		The last two stories are '' The Twilight of the Gods '' and '' The New Earth . ''

		We are continually hearing that all the good work of the world , whether in literature , music , or art , be - longs to the past , -- to which frequently is added the corollary that none of it exists or has existed in
America	LOCATION	.

		Especially when American art is in ques - tion it is likely to be set aside as briefly as ' ■ ^ Snakes in
Iceland	LOCATION	'' in the famous treatise .

		But that there is no American art will be hard to prove after reading Mr.
Sadakishi Hartmann	PERSON	's two delightful volumes , `` A History of American Art '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , with its sixty-six reproductions of sculpture and painting from American hands .

		In most cases each artist is represented by but one picture , the exceptions being three from
C. J. Brush	PERSON	, and two each from Hunt , Fuller , La Farge ,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and
Sargent	LOCATION	.

		The or - derly treatment of the text is shown by the headings of the chapters : American Art before
1828	DATE	, Our Landscape Painters , The Old School , The New School ,
American Sculpture	ORGANIZATION	, The Graphic Arts ,
American Art	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	, Latest Phases .

		These topics are treated discriminatingly , with much frank censure where censure should be , but also with con - 444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Bcientious recognition that there is a nobler and far more difficult mission compulsory upon the critic , namely , to seek out and set forth the innermost essence of every work , -- the thought the artist has endeavored to express .

		The lives of all great men furnish interesting stories in connection with their labors , but it is quite a surprise to find how often these have appealed to artists as subjects for pictures .

		Last year , Mr. `` Wal - ter
Rowlands	PERSON	published two volumes devoted re - spectively to the musicians and the authors ; now we have from the same hand '' Among the Great Masters of Painting '' and '' Among the Great Mas - ters of Oratory '' -LRB-
Dana Bates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which carry on the same scheme and are equally fascinating and instructive .

		In dealing with the artists , the unique feature is that instead of reproductions of their own works we have some incident in their lives as con - ceived by the imagination of some brother-artist of a much later generation .

		Phidias giving a '' private view '' to Pericles and
Aspasia	PERSON	of his newly-com - pleted frieze of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	, by
Alma-Tadema	PERSON	;
Cimabue 's Madonna	ORGANIZATION	carried in procession through the streets of
Florence	LOCATION	, by Sir
Frederick Leighton ; Raphael	PERSON	and
Michael Angelo	PERSON	in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, by
Horace Vernet	PERSON	, -- these are instances of the nature of the pictures , while the text recalls the attending circumstances and gives some account of the modern artist .

		In '' Among the
Great Masters of Oratory	ORGANIZATION	, '' the text is naturally devoted chiefly to quotations from the respective '' Masters , '' the range being through a list extending from Demosthenes to Lin - coln ,
Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, and
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		There are thirty - two illustrations in each volume , and in all respects , exterior and interior , these books will please the fas - tidious .

		There have been seven English editions of the famous work by
W. Hepworth Dixon	PERSON	called '' Her Majesty 's Tower . ''

		But there is still room for the American holiday edition of
Messrs , Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, issued under a new name -- `` The Tower of Lon - don . ''

		The subject is of course perennially inter - esting , both to students of history and of literature .

		The Tower colors
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's page , casts a mo - mentary gloom over
Bacon	LOCATION	's story , and
Raleigh	LOCATION	's History of the World was evolved in its gloomy vaults .

		By turns a prison , a palace , and a court , the whole edifice is alive with story -- the story of a nation 's highest splendor , its deepest misery , and its darkest shame .

		But if the imagination needs any aid in such a case , it is here abundantly sup - plied by sixty choice illustrations , largely new , and representing a truly wide range of research , often in private galleries not easily accessible to the pub - lic .

		From the collection of
His Majesty King Edward VII.	ORGANIZATION	, at
Windsor	LOCATION	, we have portraits of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	as a young Princess , two portraits of
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	, the
Holbein	PERSON	portraits of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Thomas Howard	PERSON	third Duke of Nor - folk , and Van Dyck 's
Charles I. Hatfield House	PERSON	,
Sherbourne Castle	ORGANIZATION	, and
Montague House	ORGANIZATION	have fur - nished other pictures , while the list of artists rep - resents nearly every European nationality in addi - tion to the English names .

		In '' A Child of Nature '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	tells a very sweet and touching story of an unsuccessful life -- as the world counts success .

		As a lad ,
John Foster	PERSON	seemed set apart and alone in his fellowship with Nature , while all his neighbors were fighting the stubborn fields inch by inch ; if he had ambitions , he never spoke of them ; there was no touch of romance in the work or in the home ; there were few books to read , and these , with a single exception , had nothing to say to the boy who had found that another and a finer crop could be taken o # P the farm , if one knew how to harvest it .

		His discovery of the heart in Nature came to him very young ; later he grew into a sense of the
Universal Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, and lived in the light which has shone on the path of every poet since time began .

		He dwelt in the creative mood , although the power to create was denied him .

		But , in the end , every man comes to his own .

		With
John Foster	PERSON	, this was only years after his death , when another man , a kindred spirit , found in the old farm-house the loose sheets which bore the faint and disconnected tracings of
Foster	ORGANIZATION	's inarticulate experience .

		With the generosity of a fine spirit , the young man interpreted the life of the older man through the rich atmosphere of his own tempera - ment ; thus at last the life sown in secret bore harvest in the wide field of the world .

		Illustrations , in photogravure , and decorations are provided for this volume by Mr.
Charles Louis Hinton	PERSON	, and none more refined and beautiful are to be found than on these artistic pages .

		It has often happened that a novelist or poet , by the sheer force of his creative imagination , has given vitality to regions otherwise almost unknown and quite dead .

		In this way , Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	has resuscitated , one may even say recreated , the old half - forgotten kingdom of
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	.

		Before his time , those who used this term at all were thinking of a land made memorable by the ravages of a horde of sea-borne adventurers who gradually drove before them the earlier possessors of the country-side .

		But
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	as a living , breathing reality ,
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	as a part of nineteenth - century life , sprang first into existence under the touch of the magic wand of its novelist .

		Accord - ingly , Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's ardent admirer , Mr.
Bertram C. A. Windle	PERSON	, assisted by the artist Mr.
Edmund H. New	PERSON	, has issued a goodly octavo of three hun - dred and twenty-five pages called '' The Wessex of Thomas Hardy '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , text and pictures combin - ing to identify the localities of the different tales .

		The plan of the book is to take readers to the scenes where the stories are laid , and when there to allow Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	himself to describe them .

		There are those who do not care greatly for his type of rustics ; there are those who dislike his themes ; but there are few who will deny that when he writes of scenery and of nature he is almost unrivalled .

		Therefore these twenty chapters of commentary , with their
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 445 illastrations , maps , and with their incidental refer - ences to the tragedy and comedy of the novels as each place is visited , famish forth an attractive and asefal volume , and one freed from the occasional unpleasantness of this master of English fiction .

		To old and young , to the wise and the simple , the collection of oriental tales known as the '' Arabian Nights ' Entertainments '' has for many generations afforded a source of abounding delight .

		The French were its first translators among Europeans , and through them our first English versions were ob - tained .

		The first complete translation of the '' Ara - bian Nights '' direct from the Arabic into English was that made by Mr.
E. W. Lane	PERSON	, about the mid - dle of the present century ; the first attempt among English artists to portray the life and customs of the mysterious East as unfolded in these stories was that of Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	`` Wood .

		But these pictures were made for a limited edition , while Mr.
Lane	PERSON	's monu - mental work was published without illustrations .

		To combine this test and these illustrations in a popular edition is to supply a real want ; and this has now been done by the publishing house of
J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The work consists of six volumes , has a hundred illustrations in photogravure , is neatly but simply bound , and is handsome enough to serve as a gift for anyone who has grown a bit tired of psychological introspec - tion in fiction , and who will be glad to return for awhile to the harem or the caliph 's court `` in the golden prime of good Haroun Alraschid . ''

		In one sense ,
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	was the pioneer of the modern short story in
France	LOCATION	.

		At least he was the first to apply this form of literary art to a passing phase of thought , to a momentary emotion , and to incidents that are psychological in character rather than anecdotic .

		Reading life deeply , he found that the least important event is full of sol - emn significance , that the humblest life holds in itself potentially the elements of the sublimest drama , the profoundest tragedy .

		* ` The least page he has ever written will preserve the vibration of his soul as long as onr language shall exist , '' said Zola at his grave .

		The new holiday edition of his best short stories , ''
Monday	DATE	Tales '' and '' Letters from my Mill , '' published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is as exquisite in outward appearance as in subject-matter .

		The ''
Monday	DATE	Tales '' are trans - lated by Miss
Marian Mclntyre	PERSON	.

		To the '' Letters from my Mill '' are added '' Letters to an Absent Ooe , '' both translated by Miss
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	.

		Each of the two volumes is supplied with four photogravure illustrations by such artists as
Moreau	PERSON	,
Avril	LOCATION	,
Bourgain	PERSON	, and
Rossi	PERSON	. ''

		A `` Widow and her Friends '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of Mr.
C. D. Gibson	PERSON	's sixth book of published drawings .

		The '' widow '' is , of course , the ''
Gibson	PERSON	girl '' in crepe garments , and perhaps just a little more charming in consequence .

		Her adventures occupy about half of the volume , the remainder being devoted to social satires of one kind or an - other . ''

		Good wine needs no bush , '' nor do Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's drawings need any praise-words .

		That no one can do more with a few lines than Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, has been granted long ago ; and from those who care for his thendes there is sure to be instant de - mand for everything signed by his name .

		In `` Travels Round Our ` Village '' -LRB- Button -RRB- ,
Miss Eleanor G. Hayden	PERSON	shows that she is mistress of the '' art of putting things '' by making an enter - taining book of three hundred and twenty pages out of what to most persons would appear material un - profitable to the last degree .

		Old-world customs and archaic forms of speech still linger in this
Berk	PERSON	- shire village of rural
England	LOCATION	, whose name is not to be found in
Bradshaw	LOCATION	nor yet in the Postal Guide .

		Men there go about their tasks in a spirit of serene leisureliness ; the village touches the high - way only to fly from it again , as if in an excess of shyness .

		Yet even in such a sequestered corner there are humors , homely comedies , and simple pathos .

		Of these the author writes , believing it to be good in these days of bustle and strife to drift for awhile into some quiet backwater which the tide of progress stirs but just enough to avert stagnation .

		The leisurely reader will find much suited to his mood in this handsome volume , with its picturesque drawings by Mr.
L. Leslie Brooke	PERSON	; but lovers of the sensational or the thrilling may spare themselves the trouble of cutting its leaves .

		In '' The Isle of the Shamrock '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	adds to a reputation already established by his previous volumes of a similar character entitled `` Among English Hedgerows '' and `` Along French Byways . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	travels with his camera , and furnishes his own illustrations of poverty-stricken but picturesque
Ireland	LOCATION	. ''

		A Knitter on the Highway , '' '' A Farmyard Pump , '' '' A Jaunting Car , '' the subjects of some of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's photographs , are wayside pictures that hardly could be seen elsewhere .

		The author 's diffi - culty in identifying the shamrock will appeal to all tourists who have had similar experiences .

		Al - though several of the chapters have had previous publication in various magazines , the book is not without unity , and is one of the pleasantest records of travel that has been offered this season .

		A Japanese author ,
Onoto	PERSON	`` Watanna , and a Ja - panese artist ,
Genjiro Geto	PERSON	, have combined to pro- duce a book of rare beauty -- `` A Japanese Night - ingale '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		From the charming colored frontispiece depicting the lovers with '' the thousand petals of cherry blossoms falling about them '' in the Japanese garden , to the end of the last chapter , there is a delightfully oriental flavor to the whole volume , which gives it a distinctive place in the holiday list .

		The story is unusual , the scene being laid almost entirely in
Japan	LOCATION	; and after numerous tragic and pathetic episodes it finally ends happily .

		The admirers of '' Madame Butterfly '' will give this new work an equal place in their affections .

		Daintily bound in white and gold , and boxed together , come two volumes from
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, `` Jan Oxber '' and `` Love in Our `` Vil - 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, lage , '' by
Orme Agnus	PERSON	.

		These are tales of rustic life in a remote English village , seven miles from any railway or telegraph station ; and the charac - ters use a curious dialect governed by no rules of grammar .

		But for him who has eyes to see , the peasant is something more than an awkward man with a sun-tanned face and wearing a smock .

		Village life has its palpitating dramas , and the ele - mental passions of mankind exist wherever men and women congregate , be it in obscure hamlets or crowded cities .

		They only await their chronicler of sufficient insight to behold and sufficient skill to set forth .

		Whether or no the village called '' Bar - leigh '' exists on any map , or the character of '' Jan Oxber '' ever existed outside of the author 's imagi - nation , certainly this is a most touching and tender story .

		In the mean cottages of Barleigh shines the magic light that kings have desired in vain to see , and careworn faces are the masks of saints .

		The illustrator .

		Miss
Bertha Newcome	PERSON	, has availed herself of the picturesque opportunities of these books with charming results .

		Upon the first publication of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's '' Dutch Republic , '' forty-five years ago , it was recognized immediately as one of the most interesting histori - cal books ever written in any language .

		Few pre - vious historians had so united laborious scholarship with dramatic intensity .

		In truth , the work is essentially an epic , having
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	as its hero ; and , like the ^ aeid , recounts the fortunes of a noble nation .

		Consequently , after the lapse of nearly half a century
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's work continues to hold its general popularity as well as the force of its appeal to cultivated minds .

		For many rea - sons , the new holiday library edition just issued by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	outranks all previous editions .

		An introduction by Professor
John Franklin Jameson	PERSON	of
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	gives a summary of the principal events of interest in the life of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, and reveals the plan and underlying purpose of his writing ; over fifty illustrations , many of them reproductions from rare portraits and famous paintings , help to a realization of the characters and scenes ; the colored map is probably the most elaborate one of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	yet printed in this country .

		This general literary and artistic excellence is sustained in the fit setting given the edition by the publishers . ''

		Beasts of the Field '' and ' < Fowls of the Air '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are the titles of two beautiful com - panion volumes that come side by side in a flat white box .

		The author of these books , Mr.
William J. Long	PERSON	, is not a stranger to the nature-loving pub - lic ; indeed , these volumes include most of his pre - vious sketches dealing with life as it is lived by the animals in the woods and the fields , with enough of new material to give variety and a wider range of acquaintance with the
Wood Folk	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the human interest -- if the paradox may be per - mitted -- in these animal lives that strikes the key - note of these stories .

		Each animal is endowed with a distinctive personality , and a name borrowed from the Milicete Indian .

		For example , `` Meeko the Mischief-Maker '' is the red squirrel ; '' Kagax the Bloodthirsty '' is the weasel ; '' Little Tookhees the ` Fraid One '' is the wood-mouse , etc. .

		In the marginal decorations , by Mr.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	, each page shows us the creature in the performance of some characteristic act ; and this feature fur - nishes a continual artistic delight .

		There are also a dozen delightful full-page illustrations by the same hand .

		The volumes are dedicated to the teachers of
America	LOCATION	who are striving to make nature-study more vital and attractive by revealing a vast realm of Nature outside the realm of Science , and a world of ideas above and beyond the world of facts .

		Nearly half a century ago , when
Charles Dick	PERSON	- ens was giving public readings from his own writ - ings , among the most popular of his selections both here and in
England	LOCATION	were those taken from '' The Holly Tree . ''

		The public has always ranked this composition high among the minor writings of
Dickens	LOCATION	; and now , bound together with his earlier Christmas story , `` The Seven Poor Travellers , '' and copiously illustrated by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	, this old favorite will rank high among the Christmas books of this year .

		The names of Dent of
London	LOCATION	and
Lippincott	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	are a guarantee that nothing is wanting artistically .

		The introduction , by Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	, sets forth the nature of the inspiration for the motive which
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	frankly avowed in all his work .

		Granting that strained sentiment and unreal pathos may be found here and there in the wonderful series of
Dickens	LOCATION	's books , there are by no means wanting stories where the sentiment is as real as it is beautiful , and where the pathos is absolutely unquestionable .

		And even after making all deductions that the most captious critic can suggest , who can name a successor to
Charles Dickens	PERSON	in the marvellous gift of telling tales for the Christmas-tide ?

		Two new volumes of the '' Thumb-Nail Series '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are entirely worthy of the good com - pany of their predecessors .

		Lincoln and
Horace	PERSON	are the respective subjects of these volumes , and their unlikeness is indicated by the cover-design in each case -- one modern and American in its sym - bolism , the other classic and poetic , but both daintily developed in stamped leather of the familiar coloring .

		The Lincoln volume consists of thirty-seven ex - tracts from his most famous speeches and lectures , prefaced by a sympathetic introduction by Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	has selected passages which show Lincoln at his literary best , namely , those that were uttered when he was dealing with a cause in which his whole heart was enlisted .

		Through all the prose of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's later life there runs , like a Leitmotif in music , a burden of high hope , touched with a heroism which is akin to pathos .

		-- The '' Odes of
Horace	PERSON	, '' a hundred in number , selected by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	, are given in translations representing English authors of all periods , from

		THE DIAL .

		447 Proat , and show how attractive
Horace	PERSON	has been to the poets of saccessive generations .

		It was a happy thoaght to bring this little sheaf of ancient poems to modern hands in so acceptable a form .

		`` Among Flowers and Trees with the Poets '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- conjures up all sorts of idyllic images ; and these are not shattered , but supple - mented , by the charming book of selections com - piled and arranged by Miss
Minnie Curtis Wait	PERSON	and Professor
Merton Channing Leonard	PERSON	.

		The original purpose of the volume was to place at the disposal of teachers a multitude of poems such as are needed in connection with nature-study , but which , from being so widely scattered , are not readily available .

		But the book will serve a much wider circle than this , and , indeed , will be wel - comed not only by all lovers of nature , to whom it is dedicated , but by all lovers of poetry as well .

		The poems are classified into six groups : Flowers , in General ; Flowers , Specified ; Trees and Shrubs , in General ; Trees and Shrubs , Specified ; Flower - less Plants ;
National Flowers	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are sixteen full-page illustrations , the frontispiece being an illustration of the opening lines of
Bryant	PERSON	's ** Fringed Gentian '' -- * '
Thon	PERSON	blossom bright with antnmn dew .

		And colored with the heaven 's own blue . ''

		The latest addition to the '' Travel-Lovers ' Series '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is a work on
Florence	LOCATION	, by the late
Grant Allen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated with eighty photogravure and half-tone plates , bound in two volumes of white and gold , with cover design of Florentine symbolism , and neatly boxed , the familiar little hand-book is transformed into one of the choicest holiday books of the season .

		The text is well worthy of this new setting .

		Whoever undertakes to write about Flor - ence finds himself burdened by an embarassment of riches .

		But Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's scientific order of mind , bis power of classification , and his ability to separate the essential from the non-essential , serve a good purpose here ; and thus the arrangement of the book is of great value , whether one consults it as student or as traveller , or simply as a lovely picture - book .

		In looking through its pages one realizes anew the force of Shelley 's lines : ''
Florence	LOCATION	, beneath the son .

		Of cities , fairest one , '' '' The Maids and Matrons of
New France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Mary Sifton	PERSON	Pep - per , is the story of the part played by women in the making of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Twelve years before the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	landed on
Plymouth	LOCATION	Rock , a ban - ner bearing the lilies of
France	LOCATION	was planted on the headlands of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		A comparison between these two companies of pioneer women , the Canadian gentlewomen and the Pilgrim mothers , would result in no discredit to the former .

		Although the French - women were dominated by strange superstitions and frequently inspired by supernatural visions , they never became slaves to witchcraft , as did their
New England	LOCATION	contemporaries .

		Many of them would even nowadays be looked upon as '' emancipated '' and '' advanced . ''

		The author is well equipped for deal - ing with her subject , owing to similar works in the same field ; so that the book is important from an historical standpoint , and for the first time justice has been done to the brave and gentle women who made civilized life a possibility in a land of bar - barism .

		The illustrations , twenty in number , are mainly copied from authentic life-portraits .

		Abundant illustrations of excellent quality , be - sides a large number of colored maps , are features that serve to bring even so substantial and standard a work as
Duruy	ORGANIZATION	's '' General History of the World '' into the category of Holiday publications , for which
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new two-volume edi - tion is obviously intended .

		The two photogravure frontispieces and forty-odd plates in half-tone are copied from famous engravings and paintings , form - ing together a collection of much interest .

		The historical record is brought down to the present year , its continuation from
1848	DATE	, where Duruy left it , having been made by Professor
E. A. Grosvenor	PERSON	of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, who has performed this diffi - cult task , and also that of editing the entire work , with marked ability and success .

		It is a tribute to
Duruy	ORGANIZATION	's great work that after more than half a century it still holds a place which no other world - history quite fills ; and this complete pictorial edi - tion will be deservedly prominent among the sea - son 's books of the more solid and enduring sort .

		The picturesque costume and romantic adventure of colonial life in
America	LOCATION	furnish a fine field for the illustrator as well as the story-teller .

		That stirring novel of
Bacon	LOCATION	's Rebellion in
1676	DATE	-- `` White Aprons '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	, gains in its already well - established favor by its half-dozen illustrations from different hands .

		The portrait of the heroine , Pen - elope
Payne	PERSON	-- a frontispiece in colors , by Mr.
Thomas Mitchell Pierce	PERSON	, -- is especially captivating .

		Mr.
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	has already won wide recognition as a poet , using the dialect of his race .

		A selection of nine of these poems , bearing the name '' Candle-Lightin ' Time '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , beau - tifully illustrated with photographs by the
Hampton Institute Camera Club	ORGANIZATION	, and with marginal decora - tions by
Miss Margaret Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	, will be likely to win him fresh popularity .

		The book also reveals the great possibilities of artistic photography for purposes of illustration .

		No studied `` composition '' by the engraver or etcher could surpass some of these glimpses of picturesque nature , or the poses of the human figures .

		The three interiors and the one landscape of the opening poem -- '' Dinah Kneading Dough '' -- are enough to establish the artistic value of the book , and those following are equally good .

		Similar in subject and in dialect is the volume of '' Plantation Songs '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- by Mr.
Eli Shep	PERSON	- perd .

		This too is illustrated by photographs from life , by Mr.
J. N. Otis	PERSON	, reproduced in half-tone .

		Both these books are handsome and do great credit to their respective publishers ; but the differences 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, between the two are , after all , very marked .

		Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	writes poetry ; Mr.
Eli Shepperd	PERSON	writes more or less musical dialect verse .

		There is a ♦ ' catchy '' lilt in Mr.
Shepperd	PERSON	's lines that possibly will win for them a place among classic negro mel - odies to be sung .

		The major part of the volume is given to '' Hymns of the Black Belt '' ; they show an intimate knowledge of the church-life of South - ern negroes , and are marked by artlessness and spontaneity .

		In the `` Glories of
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles W.	PERSON	`` Wood writes as delightfully as in his pre - vious volume , '' The Romance of
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Compara - tively few tourists visit the regions chiefly described in this volume , yet all who read it will certainly wish to do so .

		Whether one 's interest be in archae - ology , architecture , picturesque scenery , history , or humanity , he will find good meat here .

		A land so old that it contained cities of a million inhabitants before the coming of
Christ	LOCATION	, and that it still uses as a prison the house once occupied by
Pontius Pilate	ORGANIZATION	; 80 rich that for centuries Moors and Christians strove for its possession ; so beautiful that
Byron	PERSON	and many other poets have made it the theme of song ; so happy in some ways , so unfortunate in others that it arouses us to sympathy whenever we speak the name , -- these are the materials which both text and illustration serve to reveal in all their variety and charm .

		There are about eighty-five illustrations , and the book externally forms a fit setting for the content .

		The permanent value of
Philip Gilbert Ham	PERSON	- erton 's works on art is shown by the fact that among the multitude of entirely new books his writings are still sufficiently in demand to make re-publication desirable .

		Although more than thirty years have elapsed , his `` Contemporary French Painters '' and `` Painting in
France	LOCATION	'' are still charming and profitable reading .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	have furnished the earlier volume with sixteen illustrations in photogravure , the front - ispiece being
Bouguereau	PERSON	's `` The Eldest Sister '' ; the later volume has fourteen illustrations , with
Aubert	PERSON	's '' The Flower '' as frontispiece .

		French art will not be likely ever to have a more just as well as sympathetic interpreter than
Hamerton	LOCATION	.

		A more fortunate illustrator for Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's '' Dolly Dialogues '' than Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	could hardly have been chosen .

		The piquant personalities of '' Dolly '' and '' Mr.
Carter	PERSON	'' seem thoroughly congenial to this artist 's pen , and add to the already long list of his '' fair women and brave men . ''

		Doubtless Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's book will take on a new lease of popularity , with this edition , the publisher , Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	, hav - ing given it an attractiveness in form and execution that will satisfy the most fastidious of holiday purchasers . ''

		Amos Judd '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- by Mr.
John A. Mitchell	PERSON	, editor of '' Life , '' is a story of love end - ing tragically , in which the interest centres around the occult power of the hero to foresee future events .

		Those who like to read with cold shivers chasing up and down the spine , may enjoy this book ; for it is well-written , sparkling and gay when it is not uncanny .

		This new edition is for - tunate in having for its illustrator Mr.
A. I. Keller	PERSON	, whose eight drawings , reproduced in colors , do much to relieve the tension of the weird and mystic tale .

		Public interest in the great artistic crusade that marked the middle of the nineteenth century in
England	LOCATION	has never flagged , consequently it is not sur - prising that Mr.
Percy Bate	PERSON	's '' The English Pre - Raphaelite Painters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should have reached a second edition .

		The letterpress has been carefully revised , completed , and brought up to date ; the illustrations include an even more com - plete and representative selection of pictures by the Brethren and their associates , with others by painters who were temporarily under their in - fluences , and still others of the most typical recent manifestations of Pre-Raphaelism .

		Among the lat - ter , Mr.
Bate	PERSON	gives the place of prominence to the work of Messrs.
Cayley Robinson	PERSON	and
Byam Shaw	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, though still young , has given evidence already of great technical accomplishment and daring in the use of pure color , along with an intense desire to express his theme clearly , with a distinct preference for subjects of a high poetic order .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, on the other hand , is a dreamer of dreams , and a dweller in the twilight land of old romance .

		The author is convinced that the prin - ciples of Pre-Raphaelism remain as essentially true to-day as when first promulgated ; he feels , also , that there is reason to trust that the coming men may do as fine work as their forerunners .

		The noblest poem of religious faith in the En - glish language is
Robert Browning	PERSON	's ''
Saul	PERSON	. ''

		It has been called a '' Messianic oratorio in words . ''

		It is also a great picture-poem , and even a very unimaginative mind can hardly read it without con - juring a series of mental images .

		Such verse nat - urally attracts the illustrator , and more than ten years ago a large volume with photogravure illus - trations drawn by Mr.
Frank 0	PERSON	.

		Small tempted the book-buyer of liberal purse .

		Now the same choice work is furnished to the more economical buyer by Messrs.
T. Y	PERSON	,
Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a duodecimo , bound in cloth with gilt top , beautiful paper and letter-press , and nineteen fascinating illustrations .

		In an introductory note of seventeen pages by Pro- fessor
John Angus MacVannel	PERSON	of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity ,
Browning	PERSON	is classed with
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	as a '' consecrated voice , '' one of `` God 's truth-tellers . ''

		This poem , among
Browning	PERSON	's re - ligious utterances , is described as expressing the attitude of the poet 's middle life , while certain '' Pauline '' passages voice the early years , and the '' Reverie '' in '' Asolando '' the final confession of faith .

		To any lover of
Browning	PERSON	this volume can - not fail to be a most acceptable gift . ''

		Famous Actors of the Day in
America	LOCATION	'' and '' Famous Actresses of the Day in

1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 have each reached the `` Second Series , '' and in - clude a practically complete history of the stage in this country up to date .

		The present volumes differ from the first series in giving criticism prominence , rather than biography and anecdote .

		Thus , where noteworthy work has been done recently the same names occur that have been considered before , but this time with the stress laid upon their charac - terizations rather than upon their careers .

		Illus - trations representing each character in some favorite part add to the interest ; but why the peacock design of the cover ?

		This is something which we can imagine might be repugnant to a serious-minded actor or actress .

		The
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	have been the means of adding several delightful gardens to modern literature , -- such as ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and her German Garden , '' Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's ' • Old Time Gardens , '' etc. .

		In now publishing '' The Garden of a Commuter 's `` Wife '' they give us another , less attractive in title but really a peer of the others .

		The scene is a
New England	LOCATION	garden of the old-fashioned sort , in the real country , not in a '' tailor-made '' suburb .

		There is a good deal about flowers , but there is even more of sparkling generalities and piquant personalities apropos of the human characters con - cerned in the garden-making .

		Each chapter has its date , but this is only a starting-point , and , like the text of a good sermon , may develope in mani - fold directions .

		The name of the author of this charming work is withheld , as is also the name of the artist of the eight beautiful photogravure illus - trations .

		Balzac 's `` The Chouans '' in the ''
Luxembourg	LOCATION	'' edition -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- will , if possible , be more enjoyable than ever .

		The novel furnishes many opportunities for the illustrations which form a prominent feature of this edition , and the introduction , by Professor
William P. Trent	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, is all that can be desired .

		It tells us the date of the publication of this story , its place in the ''
Comedie Humaine	ORGANIZATION	, '' its purpose and chief characteristics .

		The photo - gravure frontispiece , as well as the twelve illustra - tions in half-tone , are by
Julien Le Blant	PERSON	. ''

		Mother and Baby '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is a collection of twenty-six lullaby poems by Miss
Mary D. Brine	PERSON	, with a full-page picture in illustration of each poem .

		The poems voice the maternal sentiment with much sweetness of melody and depth of feeling .

		The pic - tures are sometimes copies of paintings by famous artists , sometimes photographs from life ; but all are beautiful , and the volume as a whole will appeal strongly to the Mother-Heart of womankind .

		A capital book to while away dull moments -- if any such there be -- at a country club is '' The Gol - fer 's Rubdiydt '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- by Mr.
H. W. Boynton	PERSON	.

		It is a clever adaptation of the metre and philosophy of
Omar Khayydm	PERSON	to the scenes and emotions of the golf links .

		There are seventy-nine stanzas , each illustrated with a pictorial border that fills the page , these being unsigned but full of ingenuity and variety .

		As a sample of the book 's quality , here is the opening stanza : '' Wake !

		for the snn has driven in eqnal flight The stars before him from the
Tee of Night	ORGANIZATION	, And holed them every one without a Miss , Swinging at ease his gold-shod Shaft of Light . ''

		Books for the
Young	ORGANIZATION	.

		L It seems cause for congratulation that there are com - paratively few books designed particularly for children this year which deal with battle , murder , and sudden death .

		The English-speaking nations , giving an example and a warning to all the world in
South Africa	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	, have apparently grown weary of much fighting , and the national distaste for the course they have taken is apparent in the character of the volumes put out for the instruction and amusement of our chil - dren .

		This has led to an increase in the number of books of travel and adventure , as well as of those that stimulate the imagination -- fairy stories , and the like .

		More volumes of the sort that has long had the esteem of the world , -- works , that is , of real and approved merit , in some cases made over for little people , -- are also to be noted .

		The prevailing fondness for sociological studies shows itself in this minor department of human activity also .

		Reflecting even better the spirit of the times are the various works telling of boys earning a living for themselves , or of the roads to commercial success .

		Historical subjects , giving the author an oppor - tunity to amuse and instruct at once , have lost none of their popularity in the books for children both large and small .

		If there is a growing desire for the rare quality called serenity in our literature , the great library now announced for the young fails to show it .

		And , generally speaking , there is a woeful lack of all literary quality here , the old rewritten stories exhibiting it far more than the new ones .

		Apart from these works , which shine by reflected light , there is hardly a title in the long list which bids strongly for renown beyond the passing year .

		Boys ' books are still greatly in the majority , and those in which both boys and girls play a part are hardly fewer in number than those designed for girls alone .

		A noticeable feature of the children 's books for the holiday season of
1901	DATE	may be foimd in the lack of eminent names of those concerned in their production .

		The great masters of English fiction did not think that writing tales to tell to their juniors was in any way be - neath their dignity a generation ago ; to-day there seems to be a great gulf fixed , and those who write of the juvenalia have little or no reputation in the broader paths of literature .

		The exceptions , by their rarity , prove the existence of the role .

		The best of the books of travel and ad - Bookjo/trarel venture is probably Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	's and adventure .

McClure	ORGANIZATION	,
Phillips & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which Mr.
William Wallace Denslow	PERSON	has provided the colored pictures in a manner that leaves little to be desired .

		A change or two has been made from the accepted version of the rhymes , but it is too palpable to set the reader wrong .

Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- keeps strictly to the text , which
Miss Blanche McManus	ORGANIZATION	has drawn all sorts of pleasant de - signs for .

		-- '' The Pirate Frog and Other Tales '' -LRB-

Robin Hood	ORGANIZATION	cycle among others , and turning them into prose narrative with
Miss Fanny Y. Cory	PERSON	's pictures to help her .

		Such work could not well be less than interesting , bnt an argument may arise over its being done at all .

		-- ''
Rosey Posey	PERSON	's Mission , '' as Miss

Rosey Posey	PERSON	being her little colored maid .

		-- ''

New England	LOCATION	coast and eventually cures him of the drink habit in one of its most violent forms .

		Mr.

		To Mr.

Harry Roberts	PERSON	.

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	is the publisher of a pretty edition of ''
Casa Guidi Windows	PERSON	, '' with an introduction , dated ten years ago , by
Miss A. Mary F. Robinson	PERSON	, now
Madame Duclaux	ORGANIZATION	.

		< `` The Conquest of the Old Northwest and Its Settle - ment by Americans '' is an excellent reading book for young people .

		Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	is the author , and the publishers are the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Asgard Stories '' of Miss
Mary H. Foster	PERSON	and Miss
Mabel H. Cummings	PERSON	, are told in simple language for children , and include the most important myths of Norse antiquity .

		Messrs. Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are starting a series of '' French Novels of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and Flaubert 's '' Salammbo '' appears as the first volume .

		Mr.

Arthur Symons	PERSON	supplies an introduction .

		Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	, of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, publishes a '' Readers ' Guide to Periodical Literature , '' which ap - pears monthly , and indexes the contents of sixteen periodicals .

		The method is cumulative , like that em - ployed in the
Cleveland	LOCATION	'' Index . ''

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an atlas of '' Outline Maps for an Historical Atlas of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' prepared by Professor
F. H. Hodder	PERSON	.

		These maps are to be colored by the student to represent the progressive territorial development of the nation , and provide a series of nineteen exercises , for which careful directions are given .

		Teachers will find this a useful auxiliary for their work in
United States	LOCATION	history .

		M.
Marcel Provost	PERSON	's latest novel , '' Fr ^ d ^ rique , '' translated from the French by Miss
Ellen Marriage	PERSON	, the well-known Balzac translator , will shortly make its American appearance in an authorized edition from the press of
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Henry C. Lahee	PERSON	has written a little book on `` ' Grand Opera in
America	LOCATION	'' for the '' Music Lovers ' Series , '' published by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an interesting compendium of facts , making no pre - tensions to literary form , illustrated with portraits .

		The '' Lovers ' Library '' of Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, embodies an excellent idea , but the publisher does not seem to have made the most of it .

		Three new volumes have just been added to the series , and contain , respectively , selections from the '' love poems '' of
Burns	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	.

		A book which certainly belongs in the class of Lamb 's biblia abiblia is '' The Physician 's Visiting List , '' now in the fifty-first year of publication , which comes from
Messrs. P. Blakiston 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is neatly gotten up , and contains various useful tables , besides the blank pages for daily memoranda .

Maestro Tirso de Molina	PERSON	, '' is introduced to Amer - ican students of the Spanish language by an annotated text of his famous comedy , ''

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce for early publication a life of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, President of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be complete to date , and comprehensive in every particular .

		The lack of any reliable biography of
Spencer	PERSON	will undoubtedly insure a favorable reception for a volume by so eminent an authority .

		The ''
Oxford India Paper Dickens	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, is to fill seventeen volumes .

		The first of the seventeen is before us and contains '' A Tale of Two Cities '' and '' A Child 's History of
England	LOCATION	, '' which seems a most unfortunate bracketing .

		There are over eight hundred pages in this volume , which is never - theless easily pocketable .

		The original illustrations of
Cruikshank	PERSON	, '' Phiz , '' and others are used .

		An important addition to the source material for historical study is provided by the '' Select Documents of English Constitutional History '' which has recently been edited by Professors
George Burton Adams	PERSON	and
H. Morse Stephens	PERSON	, and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The whole period from the Conquest to the present time is covered by this compilation , and by means of judicious abridgment a very large aggregate amount of material is provided .

		The French and Latin documents are given in translation .

		Mr.
J. M. Dent	PERSON	seems determined to republish the whole of English literature in the neat and artistic little volumes with which readers have of late years become so familiar .

		Thackeray and the
Bible	LOCATION	are his latest enter - prises , ' • Vanity Fair , '' in three volumes , and ``'' Genesis , '' in one , being now at hand .

		The Bible is in the favorite '' Temple '' form , and will make twenty-four volumes .

		There will also be an introductory volume by the Bishop of

		The Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	are the American publishers of this most charming of Bibles , for which we predict a very large sale .

		Dr.
Nathaniel Lord Britten	PERSON	's * • Manual of the Flora of the
Northern States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	'' is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is based upon the text of the `` Illustrated Flora `` of Messrs.
Britton	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	, but the descriptions are condensed , and the cuts are omitted altogether .

		This makes it possible to condense the three volumes into one , and the use of thin paper , small type , and narrow margins makes this one of very moderate dimensions , considering the immense amount of matter it contains .

		The number of species is 4,162 , and there are 1,080 pages .

$ 18	MONEY	net ; half morocco ,
$ 30	MONEY	net .

		ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE AND IMPORTANT WORKS IN THE LANGUAGE DEVOTED TO THIS DEPARTMENT OF ART AND INDUSTRY , Architecture and building , which are treated together in this book , has never had in the English language so complete and encyclopedic a dictionary ... This work aims to treat not alone of technical terms , but to deal in historic architecture and give brief biographical sketches of the prominent men who have practiced the art ... Cross - references are freely given , and the whole work shows a well studied scheme and careful , conscientious execution by able hands .

		It is one of great magnitude , and will prove a most valuable contribution to the professional and technical literature of the language .

		-- JSew York Architects ^ and Builders ^ Magazine , A WORK for the use of the architect who desired to in - ^ vestigate special points in the history or practice of the profession , and not less of the layman who desired to ac - quire that knowledge of architectural history and practice which belongs to general culture , there has not been , until now , in the English language , ... The plan of the work is so sound , the execution so adequate , and the popular interest in the subject so extensive and so growing that the success of the book , from the bookseller 's point of view , seems assured .

		Indeed , both plan and execution so com - mend themselves that it seems almost safe to say that , although the '' American Dictionary of Architecture '' may and should be supplemented from time to time , it does not seem at all likely that it will be superseded .

		--
Montgomery Schuyler	PERSON	in the
International Monthly	ORGANIZATION	, pERHAPS the thoroughly modem spirit which dominates and inspires the whole work is the feature that distin - guishes this book most strongly from the works in other languages which the seeker for definitions hitherto has perforce consulted .

		The writers of these articles are schol - arly men , but they are something more than scholars .

		They are not living in the past ; they are doing their work in the world to-day , and their point of view and their tone is a most satisfactory and practical mixture of culture with the recognition of the needs of the average American ... Now that it has appeared , this dictionary , many of whose articles extend to the dimensions of those in encyclopaedias , becomes indispensable in its field .

		--
Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` THE execution of it could not have been put in better hands .

		... Its excellent typography , illustration and general manufacture , and close examination of the text justifies the conclusion that the dictionary will be one of the most satisfactory works of reference ever issued in this country .

		NOTES 523 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 624 TWO C ENTE NNIALS .

		A few weeks ago , a famous
New England	LOCATION	institution of learning celebrated , with cere - monies at once brilliant and dignified , the sec - ond centennial of its birth .

		The occasion was in every way impressive ; the sense of its par - ticipants for the spectacular and the artistic was gratified by the pomp and circumstance of academic processions and convocations ; the intelligence of those who shared in the event , whether as eye-witnesses or as observers from a distance , was gratified by the exhibition of high intellectual ideals and by the lesson of historical continuity of aim and achievement which the celebration evoked .

		Two hundred years of an ever-widening influence for good upon the community , of an ever-deepening de - votion to the truth that makes men free , con - stitute a heritage in which the men of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	may take a just pride , and afford an earnest of the fact , half-forgotten at times by the most thoughtful of us in the stress of our modern materialism , that the life of the spirit still has its share in our national development , and still urges its insistent claim upon the better part of our nature .

		A few weeks later , a famous newspaper rounded out the first century of its existence , and , with pardonable pride , seized upon the occasion for a review of its past .

		The incidents of this celebration were a special historical issue of the newspaper , a complimentary banquet tendered to its present proprietors and editors , and the publication of a remarkable collec - tion of congratulatory letters and testimonials .

		502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, There were no processions , no costumes , no academic functions -- in the nature of the case , there could be none of these things -- but there was a widespread feeling , which received mani - fold and often unexpected expression , that the newspaper in question had been one of the most active and beneficent agencies in the his - tory of our civilization during the entire hun - dred years of its publication .

		Those who are now directing the course of the '' Evening Post '' of
New York	LOCATION	have cause for self - congratulation in the record made for them by their predecessors , in the progress or triumph of the good causes for which their journal has unswervingly contended , and in the steadfast - ness with which its original aims have been pursued .

		No one to-day , with the century 's history of that newspaper for a guide , could frame a more exactly truthful statement of its work than is provided by the programme printed in its very first issue : '' The design of this paper is to diffuse among the people cor - rect information on all interesting subjects ; to inculcate just principles in religion , morals , and politics ; and to cultivate a taste for sound lit - erature . ''

		It is not our present purpose to speak in detail of the history or the achievements of either the college or the newspaper , but the close coincidence of their centennial celebra - tions has set us to thinking about their com - parative influence , and stai-ted the question as to which of the two has proved the more potent agency for good .

		The question is obviously one that can not be decided definitely , yet some analysis of the equation presented may prove interesting , and an examination of its several terms will afford some basis for an intelligent opinion .

		Stated in its simplest form , the comparison takes the following shape : the college influ - ences a few hundred men , but its influence is exerted during the formative period of life , is steadily exerted for a number of years , and usually dwarfs all other influences during that period .

		The newspaper , on the other hand , appeals to many thousands of men , but its ap - peal is intermittent , and always subject to the competition of other influences .

		It is , more - over , an appeal made to men whose intellectual outlook is fairly well fixed , and whose opinions are not easily to be moulded .

		The college has the additional advantage of exerting social , artistic , emotional , and other extra-intellectual influences upon the men whom it brings to - gether ; while the newspaper , not bringing men together at all , is deprived of every hold of this sort upon them .

		On the other hand , the life of the collegian is a semi-cloistered exist - ence , offering limited opportunities for making actual use of the guidance so amply offered ; whereas the man for whom the newspaper is produced is in the thick of the world 's con - flict , confronted every day by practical prob - lems of conduct , and to him the newspaper -- that is , the sort of newspaper which provides the text for these reflections -- comes just at the time of need , and brings its trained intelli - gence or its broad social philosophy to bear upon the question at issue .

		This is its special opportunity , and here , in proportion as the reader believes in its honesty and its sincerity , does it directly influence him to action .

		We hesitate to strike a balance in a case like this , where none of the terms concerned can be reduced to quantitative shape , yet it seems reasonably clear that the right sort of newspaper -- the one that always puts truth above party , intelligence above passion , and philosophy - above prejudice -- may be at least as worthy an agency of the higher civilization as the largest university .

		Specifically , we should hesitate to say that any one of our edu - cational institutions had wrought more effect - ively for good during the past hundred years than the newspaper now under consideration .

		But it would be impossible to name another American newspaper of which this might be said for so long a period , or perhaps for any period .

		However , one example is enough for proof of our contention , and that example is afforded by the hundred years of honest and independent journalism for which the paper of
Hamilton	LOCATION	, and
Coleman	PERSON	, and
Bryant	PERSON	, of Messrs.
Schurz	PERSON	, White , and
Godkin	PERSON	, stands to-day in the estimation of the educated public .

		The striking thing about this example of successful journalism in the higher sense is that the success has been achieved under competi - tive conditions .

		The newspaper in question has been a paying enterprise without sacrific - ing anything of its honesty or independence .

		While other journals have achieved a commer - cial success by the sale of editorial opinions , or by allying themselves with special interests , and suppressing the truth wherever it was likely to imperil those interests , this journal has kept clear of all such entanglements and insincerities , and furnished an object-lesson of clean journalism unaffected in its course by the claims of the counting-room .

		The plea for venal and vulgar newspaper enterprise usually
1901	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL .

		503 takes the form of saying that papers must be sold and advertisers placated ; this newspaper has by its example retorted that the truth must be told and honest opinion expressed , no mat - ter what the effect upon sales and advertise - ments .

		And it is a great thing to have proved , even by a single courageous example , that un - der such conditions the financial returns may safely be left to take care of themselves .

		This may be taken as an argument against our old hobby of the endowed newspaper , but we propose to convert it into an argument in favor of such an undertaking .

		For with all that has been legitimately achieved for dignity and independence in the case now under con - sideration , we believe that much more might be achieved were a newspaper freed from the necessity of making itself pay .

		In the first place , it might appeal to a far wider range of interests , and enlist the cooperation of a far greater number of authoritative writers .

		If it were frankly to assume the position assumed by every college of high standing and offer its beneficiaries a service that did not pretend to be measured by what was paid for it , there would be an immeasurable enlargement of its possibilities for good .

		This is the result that might be reached by a liberal endowment , and this alone would place a newspaper upon the footing of a university .

		Even the best of newspapers is forced to depend upon the ad - vertiser for its main support , and the columns which are filled with advertisements must stand in startling contrast to the columns that are filled with news and expert opinion .

		In the very nature of the case , and under the best possible conditions , the advertising columns of a newspaper are largely given up to special pleading and misrepresentation .

		The com - mercial newspaper , however good its inten - tions , must make this compromise with con - science , trusting to the intelligence of its readers to make due discrimination between the printed page that is bought and the printed page that is unpurchasable .

		The great advantage of a newspaper that should be strictly an educa - tional enterprise , properly supported by en - dowment , would be that it need not depend upon the advertiser for any part of its support .

		Our attention has been directed to this aspect of the case by an incident in the late history of the very journal of which we have been speaking in such terms of deserved praise .

		During the recent political campaign in the city of its publication , that journal was enlisted heart and soul upon the side of civic right - eousness .

		Yet in the very thick of the contest , its columns gave daily display , in the form of paid advertisements , to the specious special pleadings of the partisans of corruption and civic disgrace .

		There was no disguise about the proceeding ; the advertisements were marked as such , and , according to the accepted ethical code of the journalist 's profession , the thing was perfectly legitimate .

		Yet a higher code than this is readily conceivable , and such a code would be made possible by the endow - ment of journalism .

		Since we are determined to view the ideal newspaper as belonging in the same category with the university , the ab - surdity of the existing practice appears clearly enough when we point out that its educational analogue would be offered by a university that should open certain of its classrooms to the advocates of dishonest money and faith-healing and astrology , thus flouting the very image of truth , in whose name alone a university has the right to exist .

		The fact that the institu - tion derived support from this barter of its shelter and its sanction would not condone such an offense against educational morality , nor , rightly considered , is the corresponding offense on the part of a newspaper to be condoned .

		llEMlNISCENCES OF AN ENGLISH Caricaturist .

		* Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	is given the distinction by some of being the greatest caricaturist En - gland has ever known , -- and a short review of the satirical art in that country reveals the most famous names in the history of caricature .

		Although it does not come within the scope of the interesting volumes which Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	has given us in '' The Confessions of a Carica - turist , '' it may be timely , in view of the pre - vailing interest in the subject , to glance back a few score years .

		We find little of importance in the history of English art in the grotesque and comic prior to that time when the appear - ance of
Hogarth	PERSON	marked a new epoch .

		And it would be superfiuous here to recapitulate in detail the achievements of that great domestic painter ; particularly as his powers in caricature , properly so called , though great , were subordi - nate to his higher merits as a painter of `` genre , '' as the French phrase it , a delineator of popular scenes and incidents into which the humorous only entered as an ingredient .

		As a political caricaturist ,
Hogarth	PERSON	was a failure ; he left no school of followers .

		It was later , when the incubus of the war with
America	LOCATION	was removed , and domestic faction reappeared in all its pristine vivacity , that there appeared the first great English comic artist --
James Gill	PERSON	- ray .


Gillray	PERSON	has been described as the Rubens of caricature .

		Anyone who has studied Ru - bens 's crowds of nude figures which approach nearest to the order of caricature will appreciate the justice of the parallel .


Gillray	PERSON	was coarse to excess , both in conception and execution .

		He possessed only one quality which was Ap - parently discordant with his ordinary char - acter : his delineations of female beauty were singularly successful , and he dwelt on them with special pleasure , for the sake , perhaps , of the contrast with his usual disfigurements of humanity .


Rowlandson	PERSON	was endowed with much of
Gillray	PERSON	's coarseness , but with little of his satirical power and none of his artistic genius .


James Sayer	PERSON	, a contemporary of Row - landson , possessed a certain amount of original talent as a political caricaturist .

		Henry
Bun	PERSON	- bury was but the forerunner of the famous * The Confessions of a Caricaturist .

		By
Harry Fup	ORGANIZATION	- nisa .

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .

		New York :
Harper	PERSON	& 13 roth ers .

		French school of grotesque artists .


George Cruikshank	PERSON	is now almost forgotten as apolitical caricaturist ; it was as an etcher of small figures that he excelled , in which humor and an ex - quisite appreciation of the ludicrous alternate with beauty and pathos .

		He was the last actual representative of the school of political caricaturists of the reign of
George lU	ORGANIZATION	.

		But another worthy name follows upon his time : we refer to
Richard Doyle	PERSON	, the famous '' H. B. '' of the past generation .

		When
Doyle	PERSON	ceased his labors , the '' Punch '' school of satirists began theirs , and the spirit of the art survived -- as it will do so long as
England	LOCATION	retains a sense of the ludicrous .

		English caricature in the early days was characterized by the unnatural qualities of ferocity and truculency .

		Subjects were por - trayed in such phases of life as civilization shudders at and veils .

		To the caricaturist nothing was indecent or inappropriate .

		Un - popular politicians were shown only as types of human depravity .

		It was a sad contrast to the commendable work of Du Maurier and Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	.


Charles Keene	PERSON	, one of the truest humorists of them all , played upon the follies of the middle and lower classes in a manner that delighted the drawing-room , and the people of to-day applaud his efforts .

		Gillray is as remote from them as
Aristophanes	LOCATION	;
Rowland	PERSON	- son as impossible as Rabelais .

		At the present time the prime requisites of English carica - ture are neatness , grace , good-breeding , a touch of sentiment , and a clear understanding of life .

		We can now appreciate Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	's posi - tion as the greatest caricaturist
England	LOCATION	has ever known .

		His work is distinguished by a remarkable versatility of talent , by a great fecundity of imagination , and by a skill in grouping quite equal to that of
Gillray	PERSON	.

		His criticism of life , thoroughly conventional as it is , is so roundly and vigorously expressed as to command attention , and is moreover touched with the elemental quality of pure and genuine humor .


Harry Furniss	PERSON	was born in
Ireland	LOCATION	, in the town of
Wexford	LOCATION	, on
March 26 , 1854	DATE	.

		When a child his parents moved to
Dublin	LOCATION	, and at the age of twelve he entered the Wesley an Con - nexional School , now known as
Wesleyan Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , where he struggled through his first pages of CaBsar and '' stumbled '' over the '' pons asinorum . ''

		While yet a boy in knickerbockers he edited a periodical , under the ambitious title of '' The Schoolboy 's Punch , '' and it was a car -

		THE DIAL 506 toon drawn for this juvenile publication which determined the great caricaturist 's career .

		Drawing seemed to come to him naturally and intuitively .

		In
1873	DATE	, after an encouraging con - versation with
Tom Taylor	PERSON	, then presiding gen - ius of the '' Punch '' table , he left
Dublin	LOCATION	, and his imaginary walks down Fleet Street became a reality .

		His first serious work in
London	LOCATION	was for the '' Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News . ''

		In
1880	DATE	his first contribution to * ' Punch '' appeared , and thereafter his humor - ous hieroglyphics were a regular feature of that famous weekly .

		His work , however , was not limited to po - litical satire and Parliamentary caricature .

		When one of the leading religious journals wished to present , as a series of supplements , portraits of the leading clergy , he was selected as the artist . ''

		If I confess as a caricaturist , surely I must uot cari - cature my confessions by any mock-modesty . '

		Punch ' required funny little figures , and I supplied them ; but my metier , I must confess , was work requiring more demand upon direct draughtsmanship and power .

		I am a funny man , a caricaturist , by force of circumstances ; an artist , a satirist , and a cartoonist by nature and train - ing .

		The one requires technical knowledge -- in the other ' drawing does n't count . '

		The .

		serious confession that I have to make is that I have been mistaken for a caricaturist in the accepted and limited meaning of the term .

		* It is the ambition of every low comedian to play Hamlet , that of every caricaturist to be able to paint a picture which shall be worthy a place on the walls of the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, ' are my own words on the platform ; but I do not essay to play Hamlet , nor do I paint pictures for posterity in my studio .

		There - fore I do not place myself in the category of either , for I am neither a low comedian nor am I strictly and solely a mere caricaturist . ''

		As we glance over the two hundred odd illustrations included in his volumes , we realize that Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	's range is practically unlim - ited .

		He is possessed of the power of rendering the traits of all ages , temperaments , and call - ings , -- boys and girls , men of letters and women of society , the gay and the thoughtful , the vicious and the good .

		He presents them to us in their pleasures , their pursuits , their joy , and their gravity .

		Whatever the subject , it has the air of being native and spontaneous .

		His male figures redound with a certain vigor , and are discriminated by the strongest traits of individuality .

		In the sentiments he ex - pressed on the countenances , he had often the choice of many moods , and he always appears to have selected the ruling passions .

		When he departs from the literal flesh and blood facts , he magnifies the mental traits .

		Mr. ` Furuiss desciibes a caricaturist as an artistic contortionist , who is grotesque merely for effect . ''

		A contortionist twists and distorts himself to cause amusement , but he is by nature straight of limb and a student of grace .

		Thus also is it with the caricaturist and his pencil .

		The good points of his subject must be plainly apparent to him before he can twist his study into the grotesque .

		Perchance he may even entertain a feeling of admiration for the subject he is holding tip to ridicule , for serious moments and serious work are no strangers to the caricaturist . ''

		For some years Mr.
Farniss	PERSON	worked with ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, '' in illustrating that author 's humorous books . ''


Carroll	PERSON	was as unlike any other man as his books were unlike any other author 's books .

		It was a relief to meet the pure , simple , innocent dreamer of children , after the selfish commercial mind of most authors .


Carroll	PERSON	was a wit , a gentleman , a bore , and an egotist -- and , like
Hans Andersen	PERSON	, a spoilt child .

		He was not selfish , but a liberal-minded , liberal-handed philan - thropist , but his egotism was all but second child - hood ... To meet him and to work with him was to me a great treat .

		I put up with his eccentricities -- real ones , not sham like mine .

		I put up with a great deal of boredom , for he was a bore at times , and I worked over seven years with his illustrations , in which the actual working hours would not have occupied me more than seven weeks , purely out of respect for his genius .

		I treated him as a problem and I solved him , and had be lived I probably would have still worked with him . ''

		He speaks of
Gladstone	LOCATION	as a study as fascinating to the artist as to the politician , and claims that no portrait ever drawn by pen or pencil can hand down to future generations the mys - terious subtlety in personality of the all - powerful leader .

		It was in
1887	DATE	that Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	perpetrated his celebrated artistic joke -- a bold parody on a large scale of an average
Royal Academy Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	.

		This exhibition , which , it has been said , any man of less audacious and prodigious power of work would have shrunk from in its very inception , was held at the
Gainsborough Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		It consisted of some eighty-seven pictures of considerable size , exe - cuted in monochrome , and presented to a mar - velling public travesties -- some excrutiatingly humorous and daringly satirical , others really exquisite in their rendering of physical traits and landscape features -- of the styles , tech - niques , and peculiar choice of subjects of a number of the leading artists , ''
R. A.	PERSON	's '' and others , who annually exhibit at
Burlington House	ORGANIZATION	.

		As one reviewer puts it : ''
London	LOCATION	had never seen anything so original as
Harry Furniss	PERSON	's
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work of one man , and that man one of the busiest professional men in towu !

		ludfcd it might be thought that at the age 506 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of thirty , with all the foremost magazines and journals waiting on his leisure , with a handsome income and an enviable social position , ambition could hardly live in the bosom of an artist in black and white .

		Unlike
Alexander	PERSON	, our hero did not sit down and weep that no kingdom remained to conquer , but set quietly to work to create a new realm all his own .

		His
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, although presented to the public as an ' artistic joke , ' showed that he could not only use the brush on a large scale , but that he could compose to perfection , and after the exuberant humor of the show , nothing delighted and surprised the public more than the artistic quality and finished technique in much of his work -- a finish far and away above the work of any caricaturist of our time . ''

		On his first visit to
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	was amazed at the commercial spirit which characterized
New York City	LOCATION	, and felt that the streets were simply museums of grotesque ad - vertisements .

		What impressed him most about the metropolis was not the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Bridge , nor Wall Street , nor the elevated railway , but -- the number of chiropodists ' advertise - ments !

		Speaking of the American newspaper interviewer , he says : '' Major Hospitality arrested me on the moment I arrived , and banded me over to Inky Inquisition -- eight gentlemen of the press -- who placed me on the interviewer 's rack at the demand of insatiable modern journalism ... And then to be handed a bad pen , and worse paper , and have to draw pictures in pen and ink , in the space of five minutes , for the eight gentlemen who were watching to see ` how it 's done . '

		I have sketched crowned heads on their thrones , bishops in their pulpits , thieves in their dens , and beauties in their drawing-rooms ; but I never felt such nervousness as I did when I had to caricature myself on the occasion of my first experience of American interviewing . ''

		Though his visit to this country was merely a pleasure trip , he soon found himself in the hands of the '' irrepressible lecture agent , '' of whom he says : '' Major Pond is a typical American , hospitable , kind , with an eye to business , but I do not appear in his interesting book , nor was I ever on his business books either . ''

		In a reminiscent manner he frames his opinions of metropolitan life -- from the hungry politician to the American girl , from the Bowery to
Central Park	LOCATION	, from
Baxter Street to Fifth Avenue	ORGANIZATION	.

		Comparing the seats of government in
America	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, he submits the following un-English view : '' The seating of the senators in these two assemblages -LRB- the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is typical of the countries they represent .

		In the
British House of Lords the Peers	ORGANIZATION	loll about on scarlet sofas ; in
America	LOCATION	the chosen ones sit at desks .

		The British Peer has forsaken one lounge to occupy another ; the American has left the office desk for the desk in office .

		In Brit - ain the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	is composed of Princes and i Peers , with an admixture of bishops , brewers , and other political party pullers ; it is also an asylum for stranded political wrecks from the
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Soldiers and sailors , too , are honored and sent there , not as politi - cians , but merely to exist for the time being in a sort of respectable retreat , before being translated to the crypt of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	or
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.


John Bull	ORGANIZATION	has made this hereditary hotch-potch , and he must swallow it .

		Jonathan selects his senators to his own taste , and has them dished up fresh from time to time .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	is not sombre and sedate as our
Upper House	ORGANIZATION	, but simplicity itself -- no gilded throne , no Lord Chancellor in wig and gown , no offensive offi - cialism . ''

		Space forbids quoting further from these vivacious '' Confessions , '' which furnish many hours ' entertainment .

		Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	has written one of the most interesting autobiographies in recent English literature .

		He is a clever raconteur , and , whether describing his
Parlia	PERSON	- mentary career , his tour in
America	LOCATION	, or his
London	LOCATION	club experiences , his mind is alert on seizing the salient features of the life about him .

		The interesting drawings and sketches , which have already been referred to , form a valuable portion of the book , and the publish - ers have done their share to make the volumes attractive .

		HOWELI.S TALKS OF FICTION .

		* Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	is a master in what I may call the chronicle-chat of literature .

		His tone of kindly confidence coupled with ample authority , and always the air of conceding to the reader the right of his own opinion , makes him a delightful companion in a literary con - ference -- that solitude a deux which is as pleasant for literature as for life .

		In fact , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is that rare thing , a genuine essayist , -- a man who in a richly human way and with frank impressionism tells us of his likes and dislikes , inviting confessions in return .

		This impressionism in letters is most winsome and stimulating , -- in the right hands , as here .

		The reflection is inspired by his latest con - tribution to literary criticism , the '' Heroines of Fiction , '' furnished bravely forth by the publishers , as befits the season , in two large handsome volumes for which sundry capable artists have made some seventy full-page draw - ings .

		It may as well be said here that nothing is more dangerous than to force the eye phys - ical to see a creature of fiction already familiar

		THE DIAL 507 to the eye spiritual .

		Even when the render - ing is sympathetic and charming , it is another girl , for the girl you know , -- and so a shock .

		Personally , I prefer my heroines un illustrated .

		This is not at all a stricture on the admirable art-work of these seemly books .

		The field covered is a wide one , practically the whole life of English fiction from
Richard	PERSON	- son to our own day .

		For although Mr.
Howells	PERSON	proposes at the outset to confine himself to the nineteenth century heroines of Anglo-Saxon fiction , he finds the eighteenth century types not only of
Richardson	PERSON	but of such other writers as
Edgeworth	LOCATION	,
Austen	PERSON	, and
Burney	PERSON	are really modern and should come into the pur - view .

		And so some of the most enjoyable and suggestive pages deal with these earlier women of the native imagination .

		Such a study is really a sally into cultur - geschichte ; for the ideals of a period are well reflected in the social place and power of its women .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is happily sympathetic to his theme , because he is aware of this fact , and , too , because with him the underlying test of truth is always applied to a fiction , while his belief in the growth of social decency along with a finer art , makes him a keen analyst of society past and present , as well as of litera - ture .

		Readers aware of his views on fiction -- of the principles he has long championed and portrayed -- will not be surprised to meet with them here , always expressed with a winning tolerance and a welcome clarity .

		His doctrine is found in a nutshell in volume I , p. 26 , when , speaking of eighteenth century fiction , he says it '' had not yet conceived of the su - preme ethics which consist in portraying life truly and letting the lesson take care of itself . ''

		One feels like adding that this is quite ac - ceptable in the case of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, whose lessons are wholesome , but less so when the message is of another sort .

		What gives these talks on fiction dignity and value are the fre - quent glimpses afforded of bye-gone manners and morals , the atmospheric way in which the evolution of society is pictured , decade by decade , in standard novels during the life of that literary form .

		Only the really great critic , for example , can give off-hand , as it were , such an admirable explanation as does he of the successive changes of moral tone in the late eighteenth century and the early and late nineteenth century as mirrored by
Burney	PERSON	,
Austen	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and , say , a contemporary writer like Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	.

		In a general way , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is happiest with those fictional creations whose authors have used his own method -- that of the realist .

		Hence , particularly charming is his hand - ling of the women types -LRB- or female figures , as she would have called them -RRB- of
Jane Austen	PERSON	; also those of such later masters as
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- whom he very properly points out to be by no means a consistent realist -RRB- ,
Trollope	LOCATION	, or Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	.

		His attitude toward the roman - ticists makes him a bit less sympathetic perhaps to the children , fair or foul , of their making ; yet the strictures are so frank , so gently put , and so intensely honest -LRB- it is always a principle not a person with this wise critic -RRB- that they carry the more weight , whatever one 's opinion .

		Indeed , it is a triumph of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's fair - mindedness and response to the great by what - ever method conveyed , that what he writes of
Dickens	PERSON	is one of the best things in the two volumes , to be read with pleasure and profit by all lovers of the
Master of Gadshill	ORGANIZATION	.

		Often , too , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's pen unerringly pierces the gaps in the armor of some great romanticist 's art , his aim being all the surer in that his con - viction that romance is not fiction 's last and best word directs his peaceful missile -- the pen that is mightier than the sword .

		This is especially applicable to
Scott	LOCATION	, whose defects are touched with a sort of loving sorrow , while his mighty qualities are at the same time at - tested to .

		Just a word on the style of these essays .

		Idiomatic English , vernacular that is easy yet not vulgar , is what Mr.
Howells	PERSON	always writes .

		He is a deceivingly good writer ; I mean it takes some culture in speech , in literature , to realize how good he is .

		His feeling for idiom makes him daringly radical ; he uses such phrases as '' falls down , '' '' it went , '' ' • faking , '' and yet others , in their popular signification .

		But in the setting which he gives them they add piquancy , and , for my ear , are void of offense .

		The charm of this intimate , leisurely causerie can only be shown in quotation and must here be taken on trust .

		Those acquainted with Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's attractive manner of literary criti - cism need only to be assured that these volumes embody a characteristic study -- fruit of his ripest .

		For those -LRB- if such there be -RRB- to whom this leader in our letters is less familiar , let it again be said that the essay in its elder , nobler , and more alluring mood is not better illustrated in our day than by his work .

		Frequent extracts from his account books show a lavish expenditure for entertainment of friends that easily accounts for his bankruptcy , and yet reveals the strange phenomenon of a founder of a political party , who was its great - est leader , and yet for whom it is claimed that he never gave a dollar to influence an election , but on the contrary favored barring from office anyone who spent money for such purposes .

		Such a character was an ideal man for a newspaper correspondent to describe , and so Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's little volume , in colonial buff and blue , gives us an interesting collection of mis - cellaneous material that affords the reader a notion of the times in which
Jefferson	PERSON	lived , and perhaps enables him to have a better con - ception of the man than would be gained from an historian who discussed his career from a political standpoint alone .

		Some of the familiar quotations are inaccu - rate ; here and there are contemporary stories too good to be overlooked and therefore ascribed in this case to

		terials are poorly digested , so that repetitions occur which a more careful examination of the manuscript would have eliminated .

		The gen - eral impression , however , is favorable , for the volume is full of suggestions and comparisons that tend to show how the man moved in his environment , and how the society of his time differed from the surroundings of public men to-day .

		For example , the picture is a striking one which shows two rural Virginians helping each other to train for high office , the one plan - ning to have the other -- his close friend always -- for his political heir .

		The great Vir - ginians are all introduced , and then comes this stinging criticism of the Old Dominion : ''
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	honored
Virginia	LOCATION	more than any other of her sons except
George	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	; but Vir - ginia , one of the greatest and most ungrateful of states , has not honored
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		His neighbors , to whose welfare he devoted so much time and labor , and to whom his achievements brought so much glory and honor , permitted him to die destitute , and his family to be driven by poverty from their home .

		They per - mitted his estates to pass into the hands of aliens who now stand in his footprints and measure the value of his greatest gift to the people of his state , -- the Uni - versity of
Virginia	LOCATION	, which they have never fully appre - ciated .

		They allowed his grave to be trampled upon and his tomb to be desecrated , and the general govern - ment to restore the monument that was erected to his memory , and a citizen of
New York	LOCATION	to preserve and occupy the mansion in which he spent the best years of his life .

		But
Virginia	LOCATION	also allowed the house of Wash - ington to pass out of her hands , the home of Madison to be sold under the hammer , and the ruins of
James	PERSON	- town , the first civilized settlement on the continent of
North America	LOCATION	, to be bought at auction by a lady from
Ohio	LOCATION	who had the generosity to present it to a patriotic society of women .

		No state in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	has furnished more great men than
Virginia	LOCATION	; none has done so little to honor them . ''

		The idea of
Jefferson	PERSON	's fixed opposition to wholesale removals of Federalists , which finds expression in the statement that only thirty - nine officials were dropped during the eight years of his presidency , receives a rude shock when a table in this volume is examined show - ing a hundred and sixty-four changes out of a possible three hundred and thirty-four during the first term alone , -- although one oft-quoted letter is cited in which
Jefferson	PERSON	says : '' So that sixteen only have been removed in the whole for political principles -- that is to say , to make some room for some participation for the Republicans . ''

		Regarding
Jefferson	PERSON	's power , it is stated : ''
Jefferson	PERSON	intended that the new nation should be a democracy ; and he would rather have let the whole world perish than that this purpose should fail .

		Never - theless , he was the most absolute monarch that ever sat in the Presidential chair .

		Although he introduced the practice of discussing all matters in his Cabinet and

		He exercised an influence in botb bouses of the national legislature , and with the people , that has never been equalled by any of his successors .

		He formed a powerful party , be directed its action , and he selected its principles ; but he never assumed the atti - tude of a '' boss . ''

		He remained in the background , sheltered by the dignity of his office .

		He worked with singular silence and mystery , communicated his wishes to those who were loyal to him , and selected , those who were able to carry them out with the greatest sagacity .

		There has never been a more subtle or skilful strategist in American politics ; there has never been a more ae - cnrate observer of public sentiment , nor a better judge of human nature ... '' It is a curious fact that the founder of the party whose creed is that all authority belongs to the people alone was the greatest political dictator ever known in the
United States	LOCATION	; but it is equally true that the Dem - ocratic party has never been successful except under the direction and leadership of a dictator . ''

		Such quotations show the character of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's '' The True
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, '' a vol - ume of illustrative material , stating details of the life of a great leader , showing faults and virtues alike , on the whole commendatory , but most valuable by reason of comparisons showing the
United States	LOCATION	of

1801	DATE	, and indicating the place of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	as a leader from the view-point of a century after his great achievements .

		* At last we have a record of intellectual pro- gress coordinate with political events , in the '' Annals of Politics and Culture '' by Mr.
C. P. Gooch	PERSON	.

		One glances at first curiously at these pages , where on the left-hand is given year after year the political history of
Europe	LOCATION	since
1492	DATE	, on the right-hand the chief events for the same period in the intellectual world , -- the first being so much better known and so much more boisterous in making themselves known , the others of so much greater conse - quence for our progress from the savagery of assault and war to a basis of rational conduct .

		While on the one side we hear the thunder of cannon , the clash of arms , or the mockery of diplomacy , -- remnants of a predatory life which still repeats itself with wearisome mo - notony , -- on the other we behold the works of ♦ Annals of Politics and CuLxtmE -LRB- 1492-1899 -RRB- .

		By
C. P. Gooch	PERSON	.

		With an introductory note by Lord
Acton	PERSON	.

		peace , or of such mental strife as secures the greater victories and demands the more patient toil .

		These last achievements seem for awhile to exist only by fits and starts , the current of progress alternately advancing and receding in its course ; but gradually the beaconlights of intelligence and discovery are kindled all over the vast area , answering each other from afar , and encouraging each other as they become more numerous and bright .

		The world does progress ; these annals of culture tell us that .

		By them the hopeless are refuted , and the hopeful stimulated to greater effort .

		However much of barbarism and floundering ignorance are still left for us to combat , we may hope to see the steady growing of the light , both evil and good continuing to exist as each other 's antithesis and urging each other on to the inevitable strug - gle that serves the mysterious principle of life .

		In looking through this book on the Culture side ,
England	LOCATION	appears at first the most active and intelligent of European countries .

		This is largely for the natural reason that no other country receives such minute attention .

		Every phase of development is recorded , even such as seem to the outsider of very small moment indeed .

		For
England	LOCATION	, too , a timely explana - tion of the value of each departure in the line of intellectual or social development is added to most of the statements , while such help is often lacking in regard to the events of similar character in other countries .

		Many compilers have added to the volume of facts presented , and their contributions do not always show equal care in selection or fulness of presentation .

		The book contains the stately sum of
3765	DATE	chief events in Culture and
2326	DATE	in Politics , -- all these trebled or quadrupled in number by side-lights thrown upon other events not espe - cially recorded .

		And yet we think that the author of the Annals will be criticised , not so much for what he has put in as for what he has excluded .

		We predict that these Annals will ultimately swell to twice their present bulk , for such a work is likely to create disa - greement as to what should be included and what omitted .

		Germans and Frenchmen will doubtless have a good many things to say .

		As for us , realizing the difficulty of making a just selection in many fields , and grateful to the good Fates and Lord
Acton	PERSON	that such a book has appeared at all , we shall make only a few suggestions .

		Under the rubric Art is men - tioned in due time
Beethoven	PERSON	's `` Fidelio , '' but nothing else of his , not even his Ninth Sym - phony .

		Taking the
year 1823	DATE	as the date of 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the completion of this opera , it appears strange that a work which stands as high in the history of music as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Faust '' in literature should be passed over in silence .

		Likewise , in the account of German achievements in history are entirely omitted the two
Von Maurers	ORGANIZATION	,
G. L. and K. Von Maurer	PERSON	, father and son , -- one of whom established the study of agrarian conditions in
Germany	LOCATION	, the other known by his minute critical work in the com - parative study of Germanic laws with specific interest in the Anglo-Saxon period .

		This lat - ter subject is now attaining some importance in
England	LOCATION	, but has flourished in
Germany	LOCATION	since
1842	DATE	.

		These men are unsurpassed in their field , and are veritable founders of schools , deserving to be mentioned , surely , in a place where so many lesser lights shine .

		Further , the beginnings and final success of the
Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	, originating in
Germany	LOCATION	at the initia - tion of the imperial postal minister
Stephan	PERSON	, are events of fully as great importance as the
Zollverein	LOCATION	, which is after all but of national concern , while the
Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	is of universal significance .

		The name of
Sophie Kovalewska	PERSON	ought not to be forgotten , either ; her winning the prize of the
French Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, under the circumstances under which she gained that high honor , means a definite break with mediaeval and clerical notions of the ca - pacity of women .

		It is the logical conclusion of Mill 's famous essay .

		And we might add the query , if Du Maurier is counted worthy of mention as a draughtsman for '' Punch , '' why not also
Keene	PERSON	, who had less mannerism and at least equal wit ?

		In regard to matters of wording , and style in general , a few things might be said .

		The method of quoting the title of a book or names in English translation -LRB- which , it may be said , is not done consistently -RRB- seems unscholarly .

		Why not retain the original title , or at least print that in parentheses after the translation ?

		It is impossible to see the usefulness of trans - lating Des
Knaben Wunderhorn	PERSON	, a name that has become universally known , into '' The Boy 's Wonderhorn '' ; it strikes the reader as flat in itself , and catering too much to the En - glish habit of having everything anglicised .

		But this is not so bad as calling
Peder Dass	PERSON	's Nordlands Trompet '' The Trumpet of Nor - way , '' which is altogether misleading .

		Why should
Johann Sturm	PERSON	be called
John Sturm	PERSON	, when that is not his name , and the change serves only to confuse the reader ?

		The faulty English spelling of German names occasion - ally crops out to offend the eye : why it should be Gunther instead of Giinther ,
Moser	PERSON	instead of
Moser	PERSON	, or
Holderlin	PERSON	instead of
Holderlin	LOCATION	, is quite inconceivable , since
Bohmer	PERSON	and others are spelled properly .

		Abbt , it may be noted , should not be printed Abt .

		On the other hand , to print such hybrid mixtures as '' The fruchtbringende Gesellschaft '' or '' The Auf - klarung '' seems equally lacking in good taste ; why not `` Die fruchtbringende , '' etc. , or '' The Enlightenment , '' since this period belongs to
England	LOCATION	as well as to
Germany	LOCATION	, or even more so .

		On the death-list appear various names not mentioned before in the text , and to most people entirely unknown .

		The average reader needs an encyclopsBdia to find out who are
Ficino	PERSON	,
Alciati	PERSON	, and numberless others who figure nowhere but among the deaths , as if this was their chief accomplishment .

		That Hol - berg 's `` Peder Paars '' or
Baggesen	PERSON	's `` Comic Tales '' are put under Dutch literature , instead of under Danish , will surprise both the Dutch and the
Danes	LOCATION	.

		Attention might be called to certain other oversights .

		The sentence on page 33 , note 191 , makes it difficult to see to whom Ciceronianus is intended to belong , whether to Erasmus or to
Longolius	LOCATION	, the sentence being about as involved and obscure as if borrowed from
Longolius	LOCATION	himself .

		It is also sometimes difficult to understand the bearing of state - ments , such as the one on page 41 , note 246 , where Poor Laws and Begging are mentioned as forbidden -LRB- presumably in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- ; or in the line below , where the attempt to free land from Uses presumably concerns
England	LOCATION	again , while the succeeding line mentions manufacture of silk in
Lyons	LOCATION	by Italians , thus making the whole matter apparently concern
France	LOCATION	.

		The addition of the title of Emperor to
Ferdinand	LOCATION	, in the note on page 57 , of his sending Bubequius to
Constantinople	LOCATION	, would solve one puzzle .

		We can easily see the ne - cessity of saving space , but there is space and to spare in the book for such explanatory ad - ditions .

		It is rather a pity that the many errata must be swelled by omissions which might easily have been corrected .

		All these matters of complaint being little things as compared with the great things that have been achieved in this beginning of the systematic record of intellectual progress , we do not feel it in our heart to end with anything but hearty expressions of our satisfaction with the book as a first and conspicuous attempt to enter a new and fruitful field .

		THE DIAL .

		511 The History of a Bogus Kixg .

		* It is perhaps not greatly to be regretted that the epoch of the Civil War and the Common - wealth has hitherto so largely engaged the at - tention of English historians that the period immediately following has been somewhat neg - lected .

		But now there are signs , in such recent publications as Dr.
Osmund Airy	PERSON	's `` Charles II. , '' Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's '' Madame , '' and Mr.
Fea	PERSON	's ''
King Monmouth	PERSON	, '' that the unsavory chron - icles of Charles the Second 's court are to be made the subject of careful study on the part of specialists .

		Mr.
Fea	PERSON	's elaborate and handsome work is worthy of note , if only for the beauty of its typography and binding and the number and excellence of its illustrations .

		The ill-fated career , too , of
James	LOCATION	,
Duke of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	, the natural son of
Charles II.	PERSON	, forms an important chapter in English history ; and considerable new material for a biography has come to light since the publication , in
1844	DATE	, of Mr.
George Roberts	PERSON	's excellent life of the Duke .

		Yet it is as a picture of the times , rather than of the man , that any recital of his adventures can be of value .

		Handsome , spirited , and brave in battle though he was , there is little in his intellect or character to command admiration .

		As was well said of him by the Comte de Gramont , '' son esprit ne disoit pas un petit mot en sa faveur . ''

		In court morals , if in nothing else , there is decided evidence that we live in a better world than did our ancestors of two centuries ago .

		The Merry Monarch 's weaknesses aroused so little reprobation that we find
Lucy Walter	PERSON	's illegitimate son enjoying the honor and emolu - ments of numerous high offices .

		When scarcely out of his teens he was made Captain-General of all the king 's forces .

		Privy Councillor ,
Lord Great Chamberlain	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	, Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull , Lord Lieutenant of
East Yorkshire	LOCATION	, and more besides ; while it was only the opposition of his uncle , the Duke of York , that prevented his appointment as Lord Lieu - tenant of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		An annuity of six thousand pounds , afterward increased to eight thousand , was settled on him .

		Most astounding of all , this illiterate youngster was elected , at the age of twenty-five , to the Chancellorship of Cam - bridge

		reminded that it was largely
Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	's and
Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	's influence that procured him this rapid advancement .

		But his royal father 's fondness for the young scapegrace was such that he was sure to be well provided for in any case .

		A characteristic picture is given of the pleasure-loving monarch 's mode of life at New - market , just after seeing his son off for a so - journ on the Continent .

		A morning walk , the cockpit , dinner , the cockpit again , the play , supper , '' and so to bed , '' as old
Pepys	PERSON	would gay , -- such was
King Charles	PERSON	's daily pro- gramme .

		The chief interest in
Monmouth	LOCATION	's career cen - tres , of course , in his invasion from
Holland	LOCATION	soon after his father 's death , and in the battle of Sedgemoor which put an end to his kingly pretensions .

		Our author is inclined to support the charge of complicity on the part of the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	in the fatal enterprise , Will - iam 's motive being a natural desire to get rid of a popular and dangerous rival .

		The disas - trous issue of both
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	's and
Monmouth	LOCATION	's undertakings must have been foreseen by so shrewd a statesman and so experienced a sol - dier .

		Mr. Fea makes but the briefest mention of the
Duke of Argyll	ORGANIZATION	's unlucky raid , capture , and execution .

		As this invasion of
Scotland	LOCATION	was an essential part of the general scheme , a detailed account of it would have been desir - able .

		Of the battle of Sedgemoor -- the last fight worthy to be called a battle fought on En - glish soil -- a contemporary plan , drawn by the Rev.
Andrew Paschall	PERSON	, is here printed for the first time .

		The rout of the rebels , the capture of
Monmouth	LOCATION	, his ignoble attempts to clear himself at the expense of his followers , and his execution on Tower Hill , are all described in full ; and we are left with a feeling of amaze - ment that one so unworthy could have com - manded such devoted support .

		It was from the humbler ranks that he drew his adherents , and so constant were the people to their idol that , even long after his death , they persisted in hop - ing for his reappearance among them .

		Cre - dence had been given to a false report that one of his followers had mounted the scaffold in his stead , and that '' King Monmouth '' him - self was safe and in hiding , biding his time for a second insurrection .

		So persistent was this belief that we even find
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, some years after
George III	PERSON	.

		had ascended the throne , gravely refuting the conjecture that the '' Man in the Iron Mask '' was in reality the
Duke of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	.

		One circumstance of importance is not to be forgotten in connection with Mon - 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, month 's popularity : he stood , in the minds of the people , for the cause of Protestantism against
Popery	ORGANIZATION	, and their hatred of the latter had recently been kindled to a white heat by
Titus Oates	PERSON	and the so-called Popish Plot .

		The new material drawn upon by the author makes his book well worth the writing .

		He carefully cites his authorities in introduction and in numerous foot-notes .

		Macaulay 's asser - tion that `` the Civil War had barely grazed the frontier of Devonshire '' is shown to be very far from the truth -- thanks to a recently dis - covered and authoritative document relating to the
Bloody Assize	ORGANIZATION	.

		No reign in English his - tory lends itself to illustration as does that of
Charles II.	PERSON	, with its galaxy of court beauties and its array of gay cavaliers , so pleasingly depicted by
Lely	ORGANIZATION	,
Kneller	PERSON	,
Riley	PERSON	,
Wissing	PERSON	, and others .

		These portraits are here generously reproduced in photogravure , and many views of historic places added .

		Indeed , so attractive are the pictures that we fear they excel the text in interest .

		The dramatic side of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's career might have been turned to better ac - count .

		The treatment of the theme is scholarly , but the reader does not turn the leaves with bated breath to see what is coming next .

		How - ever , if we can not have both true history and charm of style , let us by all means have the former .

		Comedy '' satisfies our spiritual thirst , and girds '' the mind with power by bringing it into the presence of exalted ideals , intensest passions , and elemental truths . ''

		His tribute to the sacred poem is so heartfelt and sincere that readers may profit by the study which he has made of it , although that study is the re - sult of sympathy rather than of scholarship .

		We can discern in the book not only the out - lines of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's own thought , but also some - thing of the process whereby the impact of his thought has heightened the ideals and broad - ened the outlook of his commentator .

		In form , this essay is a systematic study of the '' Divine Comedy , '' prefaced by a chapter of biography , and another in which the general aspects of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's thought are considered .

		It is not as weighty a book as
Symonds	PERSON	's '' Intro - duction '' or as
Maria Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Shadow of Dante , '' but it belongs with them in the class of books that furnish helpful systematic guid - ance for those who seek to follow the poet in his spiritual pilgrimage .

		Concerning the fit - ness of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's message for our own times the author says : • • Our greatest writers are not engrossed with the actions of men , as was Homer ; they are not absorbed in delineating their passions , as was Shakespeare ; but are turning their thoughts into the deeps of the soul to learn the meaning of life and the realities confronting it .

		For this mood , which so often plunges men into doubt , if not into despair , the triumphant faith of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	offers a corrective , and this meets the deepest of our modern needs . ''

		Mr.
Dinsmore	PERSON	writes throughout with enthu - siasm , and often with eloquence .

		He some - times says a very fine thing indeed , as in the following passage : '' Only a mind of singular beauty could have con - ceived a Purgatory , not hot with sulphurous flames , but healing the wounded spirit with the light of the shim - mering sea , the glories of the morning , the perfume of flowers , the touch of angels , the living forms of art , and the sweet strains of music .

		Only a spirit of ma - jestic purity and love could have thought out a Heaven , unstained by one sensuous line , revealing glory upon glory until the ascending soul is lost in the splendor of incommuuicable truth and the ardor of unutterable love . ''

		When the Oxford '' Divine Comedy , '' in Dr.
Edward Moore	PERSON	's text , was published last year , a companion volume of notes was prom - ised for early issue .

		That volume , the work of the Rev.
H. F. Tozer	PERSON	, has now appeared , and provides the student with an extremely satisfactory handbook for the elucidation of the text .

		It is a volume of over six hundred pages , into which an immense amount of information , philological , philosophical , and historical , has
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		518 been condensed .

		Collateral references are abundant , as well as references to the sources of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's facts and references .

		The discus - sion of conflicting interpretations has been avoided , '' except in cases where the balance does not greatly preponderate in favour of any one of them . ''

		We could wish that something more of attention had been paid to the parallel - isms in which modern literature abounds , but , on the whole , we can not find any serious fault with a work which offers so much material , and so effectively condenses it .

		Each of the Cartr tiche is prefaced by a brief note , and each
Canto	ORGANIZATION	is provided with a prefatory argument .

		Among the holiday books of the present season , none is more attractive than the illus - trated edition of the ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, '' in Ros - setti 's wonderful translation .

		Rossetti 's text is given , and his own introduction .

		This is prefaced by an introduction written two years ago by his brother , Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	, and this in turn by an introduction prepared for the present edition by Mr.
Fitz Roy Carrington	PERSON	.

		After all these introductions , the reader should surely find himself on good terms with both text and translator .

		Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	's intro - duction is chiefly concerned with the pictorial features of the volume .

		These consist of fifteen full-page plates , for which , strangely enough , no titles and no table of contents are provided .

		We are left to guess at the illustrations , unless we can identify them by reference to the preface .

		Fortunately , they are for the most part familiar , including
Rossetti	PERSON	's paintings of ''
Dante	PERSON	's Dream '' and ''
Beata Beatrix	PERSON	, '' besides eleven other studies , and adding , for good measure , a portrait based upon the death-mask and the
Bargello	LOCATION	portrait , reproduced in color .

		The book is beautifully printed and tastefully bound .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		`` Five Thocsaxd Facts and Fancies , '' by Mr.
William Henrj P. Phyfe	PERSON	, is one of those miscellaneoas handbooks of curious and out-of-the-way knowledge for which there seems somehow to be a need , in spite of the regalation cyclopedias .

		It may be best described by an extract from the title-page , where we read that its con - tents include `` noteworthy historical events ; civil , mili - tary , and religious institutions ; scientific facts and tHeories ; natural curiosities ; famous buildings , monu - ments , statues , paintings , and other works of art and utility ; celebrated literary productions ; sobriquets and nicknames ; literary pseudonyms ; mythological and im - aginary characters ; political and slang terms ; deriva - tion of peculiar words and phrases ; etc. , etc. '' The editor 's practice in preparing works of popular reference has taught him what is wanted in a work of this sort , and he has made a skilful selection of material .

		IL For several successive years , Lady DLlke -- who was
Miss Eoailia Frances Strong	ORGANIZATION	and the widow of the late Rev.
Mark Pattison	PERSON	before her marriage to Sir
Charles	PERSON	-- has published valuable and author - itative works on French art in the eighteenth cen - tury .

		Her book on '' French Painters '' brought out in

1900	DATE	, and now on ''
French Decoration	ORGANIZATION	and
Farni	PERSON	- tare in the XVIIIth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , attest a wealth of reading and investigation continued through many years and presently blossoming into fine quartos .

		If it be a desirable thing to own fine furniture , it is only less desirable to have at hand such a book as this , with its wealth of illustration and description .

		For Lady Dilke is an authority who will never be satisfied with less than the best , -- and '' best '' with her does not mean the most ex - pensive , or even the most authentic , specimens of French or other furniture . ''

		Even delicacies and graces of expression , '' she says in her preface , '' finish of inlay , sharpness of carving and of chisel - ing , are worthless unless sustained by sense of style and respect for the laws of construction ... Were it not for their influence the priceless trifles which the millionaire guards behind plate glass ... would have no more title to honor , from an artistic point of view , than the wax-flowers which the thrifty mistress of a country inn protects from bouseflies with a glass shade .

		This is a hard saying , for alluring prettinesses of shining metal , gay china , and marvels of finish are readily appreciated by any who live in costly surroundings ; but the values of style and construction demand some sacrifice ; they can be recognized only by effort , patient attention , and cultivated habits of observation . ''

		What fol - lows is so varied in subject and so rich in treatment that little more than a hint can be given of the contents of the book .

		The first six chapters deal with the question of decoration -- as a background for furniture , and so discriminated from architectural effect pure and simple ; the next two with tapestries , and the remaining five with furniture of all sorts .

		Every style and model has the necessary illustra - tions to eke out the descriptions of the letter-press , most of them half-tone reproductions of photo - graphs , but many in photogravure , and several score in number .

		The book can hardly be described by a smaller word than magnificent Artist , book4over , and cat-lover in one .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a most fascinating study of the cat , from the days when she lived out her nine pampered lives in an Egyptian temple , and , dying , was ceremoniously buried in a gilded mummy case , until now , when after long dark ages of persecution and neglect she has won back a trifle of her ancient honor and reigns once more the '' little god '' of hearth and home .

		Compared with the lives of her wild brothers of jungle and plain , the story of the 514 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 16y	DATE	individaal domestic puss is likely to seem dall and spiritless ; for hers is a distinctly feminine genius , and her limited field of action , her love of chimney - corner ease , and her impenetrable reserve , combine to defeat her biographer .

		But it is her race history that Miss Repplier chronicles , thus securing novelty of treatment among present-day beast epics , as well as the largeness of interest which her little heroine 's domesticity tended to preclude .

		In this series of delightful essays she deals with pussy 's varying fortunes in different ages and climes , with the legends of her witchcraft rites and revels , the French and English estimates of her , and the treatment accorded her by art .

		Every chapter illustrates and elucidates the conception of the cat familiar to those of us who remember the previous essays upon ''
Agrip	PERSON	- pina '' and '' A Kitten . '' ''

		God of
Egypt	LOCATION	, plaything of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' witch and friend of witches , delight of Th ^ ophile
Gautier	PERSON	or Sir ``
Walter Scott	PERSON	, -- puss is always for Miss Repplier '' the little sphinx whose ways are gentle , whose heart is cold , whose char - acter is inscrutable . ''

		The present volume , then , will be welcomed by all lovers of the cat ; and it will be welcomed , too , by all who appreciate Miss Repplier .

		This new volume from her hand is characterized by all the wealth of anecdote and allusion -- the '' curious and forgotten lore '' -- with which she is wont to surprise and delight her readers , and by all the vivacity and finish of which her style never fails .

		Miss
Elizabeth Bonsall	PERSON	's charming and sympathetic illustrations deserve mention as adding a crowning touch to the reader 's pleasure .

		A sumptuous work in two volumes , abundantly decorated without and within , is '' Flowers from Persian Poets '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	and
Miss Belle M. Walker	ORGANIZATION	.

		Persian designs in gold on the cover , a Persian design in the sacred green of Islam bordering each page , speci - mens of Persian calligraphy and photogravures of Persian scenery by way of illustrations , com - bine to give the book physical beauty beyond that of good paper and careful printing .

		For its con - tents , the whole field of Persian literature has been gone over and made to yield its choicest fruits .

		A searching general introduction leads up to
Firdausi	ORGANIZATION	's ' ^ Sohrab , '' from the translation of
James Atkinson	PERSON	.

		For
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, dependence has been placed on an anonymous rendering , accredited to
E. A. Johnson	PERSON	.

		Then follow
Nizami	PERSON	's '' Laili and Maj - nnm , '' part of '' The Masnavi , '' and many of the shorter poems of Jelalu - ` Din , or Rumi , with the `` Day and Night '' of Essedi to close the first volume .

		The second contains the '' Gulistan '' or `` Rose Garden '' of Sa ` di , and selections from his `` Bustan , '' `` A Persian Song , '' and several of the odes of
Hafiz	LOCATION	, and the '' Yusuf and Zulaikha '' of
Jami	PERSON	.

		In every case critical and biographical notes precede the excerpts .

		Within the limits set , no better survey of Persian literature in verse has been given in English .

		The photogravure series of travel-books issued by
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which began with the
United States	ORGANIZATION	, has now extended to
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope ; and in the new volumes on
London	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	will be found admirable souvenirs and re - minders of pleasant journeys abroad . ''


London	LOCATION	, Historical and Social , '' by Mr.
Claude de la Roche Francis	PERSON	, is in two duodecimo volumes , filled with photogravures from the best-known scenes in the world 's metropolis , having a text which is amiably discursive , and contains abundant references to - authentic and traditional history for the better un - derstanding of the subject , with a wealth of anecdote to keep it sane and readable .

		To an American , , the evidences of age are the most to be envied of any of the cockney possessions ; and Mr.
Francis	PERSON	is right in devoting so much of his space to the portrayal of ancient customs and buildings surviving ^ into the present .

		The book begins with ^ neas , and ends with an anticipatory description of the - coronation of
Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has a satisfactory index , and a list of Mayors of the city .

		It also has - an excellent map , is well printed , substantially bound , and is in every way a book worth keeping .

		-- ''
Ireland	LOCATION	, Historic and Picturesque '' is by Mr ^
Charles Johnston	PERSON	, and will serve as an unusually fair and discriminating history of the island from the earliest times .

		The ancient Celtic mythology is given in great detail , enough to make the book serviceable as a work of reference in this field .

		The attitude is fair , neither favoring the Saxon invader overmuch nor searching out the faults of the natives ^ There is an abundance of description , and many photogravures to illustrate it .

		The great number of ruins depicted shows the effect of British oc - cupancy without need of further comment .

		The - book is in one volume , with an index and map ^ uniform with the work just commented on .

		Mr.
T. Gallon	PERSON	has shown something of the feeling of
Dickens	PERSON	in his use of grotesque English char - acters , and this is more , rather than less , apparent in `` The Man Who Knew Better : A Christmas Dream '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		The story is that of a hard - hearted man of business , a veritable Scrooge , com - placent and secure in his riches , and oblivious to alt interests of life save his own balance-sheet .

		But the years bring reversals , and , finally , through the chastening experience of poverty and starvation ^ the `` man who knew better '' comes to a real knowl - edge of life -- and of death , also .

		There are other characters in the book , not the least interesting of whom are
Bob Judkin	PERSON	and his company of strolling , players .

		The effect of the story is brightened by the illustrations of Mr.
Gordon Browne	PERSON	, which will - suffer but little in comparison with the work of
Hablot Browne	PERSON	, his father , -- the '' Phiz '' of pleasant memory .

		Author , artist , and publishers have combined to produce in `` The Man Who - Knew Better '' a book which reflects the true spirit of Christmas more thoroughly than any other title on our Holiday list .

		THE DIAL .

		515 teanx '' -LRB- Patnam -RRB- from the same skilfal hand , and , like ita predecessor , embellished with numeroas beaatiful illastrations in half-tone and photo - gravure .

		Ten little romances have been taken from their setting in history , and g ^ ven a new place and added brilliancy here .

		The literary flavor of them all is marked ; the first story , for instance , being of the three Chateaax of
Nantes	LOCATION	,
Amboise	LOCATION	, and
Blois	LOCATION	, and based on the '' Book of Hoars '' of
Charlotte	LOCATION	d'Albret .

		Not a little of the spirit of the age , so well translated here in terms of modem English , is supplied by that extraordinary gentle - man ,
Pierre d' Amboise	PERSON	, Seigneur of
Chaumont	LOCATION	, who , in giving seventeen children to the world , several of them of consequence , aided the arts as something more than a mere patron of them .

		The text ranges from the later reign of Louis XI .

		to the massacre of
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	, and the illustra - tions consist of reproductions of historical paintings as well as actual photographs of the buildings de - scribed .

		Notes and a bibliography accompany the tales , but an index is lacking .

		With the revival of formal horticulture comes Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's `` Old Time Gardens , a Book of the Sweet o ' the Year '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This learned American antiquarian has found no more congenial subject than this , nor one which better justifies the wealth of illustration lavished upon it .

		It is with gardens '' in the good old
Colony	ORGANIZATION	days when we lived under the King '' that Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	is concerned , and she must have wandered much and far to have accumulated the wealth of material from which she builds her pleasant pages .


New England	LOCATION	and the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	join in her tale , and now and again she permits something from the loveliness of the present to intrude gracefully upon the ordered beauty of the past .

		One such thing is the description of a sun dial presented by Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	to Mrs.
Katrina Trask	PERSON	, upon which the reverend poet has caused to be inscribed two senti - ments which must be given here .

		On the face of the dial , running about its edge , is this : * ' Hours fly .

		Flowers die , New Days , New Ways , 1 * 888 by ; Love stays . ''

		While at the base of the gnomon may be read : `` Time is Too Slow for those who Wwt , Too Swift for those who Fear , Too Long for those who Grieve , Too Short for those who Rejoice ; Bat for those who Love ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	is Eternity . ''

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	remarks that , though for years a student of such lore , she knows nothing to match these ' * ex - quisite dial legends . ''

		The volume , from its lovely cover to the ferny end-papers , abounds in kindliness and sunny serenity , -- altogether a book to be loved .

		That youthful humorist of the .

		Pacific coast whose sad fate it is to be known first of all as the author and perpetrator of '' The Purple Cow '' has had his varied witticisms and drawings gathered into one volume with the title , '' The Burgess Non - sense Book '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Here one may read what serves as an antidote to that most famous quatrain : '' Ah , Yes !

		I Wrote the ' Purple Cow ' -- I 'm Sorry , now , I Wrote it I Bat I can Tell yoa Anyhow , I '11 Kill you if you Quote it ! ''

		But over among the `` Poems of
Patagonia	LOCATION	'' is another version , beginning , -- '' A Mayde there was , semely and meke enow ; She sate a-milken of a purpil Cowe , '' which seems to indicate , after all , a certain lingering pride in the achievement ; the explanation being given that the color was due to '' The Master 's Mandement '' that '' His
Kyne	PERSON	shall ete of nought but Yylet Flonres ! ''

		Probably the best form of jus - tice that can be done the volume is to reproduce the title-page : `` The Burgess Nonsense Book , Being a Complete Collection of the Humorous Master - pieces of
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, Sometime Exlitor of < The Lark , ' ' Le Petit Journal des Ref us ^ es , ' & ' Enfant Terrible ' ; including the ' Purple Cow ' with Forty Odd Nonsense Quatrains , the ' Chewing Gum Man ' Epics , the '
Gerrish	PERSON	' Ghost Stories , Poems of
Patagonia	LOCATION	, Curious Cartoons , Autobiog - raphies of Famous Croops , & a Myriad

		The Whole forming a Book of
Blissful Bosh	PERSON	for the Blasd ; an Amusing Antidote to

		An
Extrageneous Tome of Twaddle	ORGANIZATION	, an Infallible Cyclopsadia of Bal - derdash ,
Ferocious Fancies & Inconsequential Va	ORGANIZATION	- garies , Than Which Nothing Could be More So . ''

		It is not an evil innovation , permitting every author thus to furnish forth his own idea of his work ; the book itself is no small proof of Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	's aphorism , '' Nonsense is the Fourth Dimension of Literature . ''

		The re-discovery of our ancestors continues apace , though the latest work in this field of re - search is devoted to possible ancestresses .

		Miss
Geraldine Brooks	PERSON	has prepared two handsome oc - tavo volumes , with photogravure illustrations by Messrs.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	and
H. A. Ogden	PERSON	, called , respectively , '' Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days '' and ''
Dames	PERSON	and Daughters of the Young Republic '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- . ''

		There may be , and there often is , indeed , a regard for ancestry which nour - ishes only a weak pride , ''
Daniel Webster	PERSON	is per - mitted to say on the title-pages of both books . ''

		But there is also , '' it is added , '' a moral and philosoph - ical respect for our ancestors which elevates the character and improves the heart . ''

		Yet it seems to be generally true that the more desirable the ancestor the fewer the descendants ; and certainly 516 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the respect for ancestors in this democracy of oars seenas to keep pace with a fine disregard of the prin - ciples many of them sought to inculcate .

		The colo - nial worthies discussed in the first book include
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	,
Margaret Brent	PERSON	,
Martha Washington	PERSON	,
Abigail Adams	PERSON	, and
Elizabeth Schuyler	PERSON	, among others ; and among those of the young Republic are
Dolly Madison	PERSON	,
Sarah Jay	PERSON	,
Theodosia Burr	PERSON	,
Patsy Jefferson	PERSON	, and
Rachel Jackson	PERSON	.

		This shows a cath - olic taste , to say the least .

		Miss
Brooks	PERSON	is happy in her manner , and the books , similarly bound and placed together in a box , are very attractive . ''

		When winter snows begrey the air .

		We '11 think of
summer	DATE	bright and fair , '' -- a sentiment which comes forcibly to mind on looking through the '' Blue Grass and Rhododendron '' of Mr.
John Fox , Jr.	PERSON	, issued in holiday attire by Messrs.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		The book has an alluring sub-title , too , -- * ' Out - Doors in
Old Kentucky	LOCATION	'' ; and all the promise of the letter-press is borne out by the numerous pictures by Mr.
F. C. Yohn	PERSON	, many of them from photographs .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	went roaming through his beloved mountains , and came upon those de - lightful survivals of a simpler age , the inhabitants thereof .

		He describes their life with the sym - pathetic comprehension which has given his tales and novels so worthy a place in our national liter - ature , and supplements his descriptions with wise comments of his own , -- the twentieth century dis - coursing upon the eighteenth , so to speak .

		This is not the place for political discussion , but we are compelled to wonder at what Mr.
Fox	PERSON	may mean by saying that the `` anti-Goebel democracy '' is '' the best in every way . ''

		Observing men in the North have thought some of these `` best '' men fugitives from retributive justice , fleeing with murder on their hands .

		Even if discussion of this sort is ever profitable , it can hardly be at
Christmas	LOCATION	time .

		Several holiday seasons have accustomed us to look for some valuable gleanings from the various fields of human endeavor , by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	, among whose previous works '' Turrets , Towers , and Temples '' and '' Great Pictures '' will be pleasantly remembered .

		Excellent as these were , they are still inferior to hef new book , '' Love in Literature and Art '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which on its literary side is a celebration both of the tender passion and of that wider spirit which promises peace and good - will to man , and on the pictorial side a bringing to - gether in compact form of no less than thirty-two finely reproduced masterpieces fitted to her theme , from the hands of the greatest painters .

		The choice is catholic .

		Botticelli and
Leslie	PERSON	,
Rubens	PERSON	and Ros - setti ,
Corot	LOCATION	and
Alma Tadema	PERSON	, indicate in brief the range of art ; while the literary classics of modern
Europe	LOCATION	have nearly all been laid under contribu - tion , with a few writers of the later Greek world added for good measure .

		Here can be found af - fectionate excerpts from the works of Theocritus and Bion , Lyly and
Peele	PERSON	,
Cervantes	PERSON	and Moli ^ re ,
Jonson	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	, Fielding and
Sterne	PERSON	, Goethe and de la
Motte Fou	ORGANIZATION	- qu ^ ,
Frances Burney	PERSON	and
Jane Austen	PERSON	, Balzac and
Gautier	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	,
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	and
Austin Dobson	PERSON	,
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	,
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, and
Rudyard Kip	ORGANIZATION	- ling .

		It will be a strange taste indeed that can not find in all this range something worth the while ; and the whole book , carefully printed and tastefully bound , is one to be treasured .

		After thirty years , Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	has revised his '' Italian Journeys '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and it is now republished with admirably dainty illus - trations by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.

		It is a thorough revision , too , done with painstaking care , sentence by sentence .

		A comparison of the new with the old edition , published first in
1872	DATE	, is an exposition in little of the well-beloved author 's intermediate life .

		Not the least valuable feature of the handsome book is the brief introduction which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has prepared for it .

		At the outset , he says , he re - turned a categorical refusal to the request for revis - ion and for a new preface .

		But having consented to one , the other followed as a matter of course .

		Then he goes on : '' From time to time it seemed to me that I was aware of posing , of straining even , in some of my attitudes , and I had a sense of having put on more airs than I could handsomely carry , and of having at other times assumed an omnis - cience for which I can now find no reasonable grounds .

		So exacting is one at sixty-four -- . ''

		But there is no need to go further .

		When the book was written , in
1871	DATE	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	was thirty-four years old .

		Now he is sixty-four years young .

		And that is why this new edition is so well worth cherishing -- with the old one beside it on the shelf .

		The sumptuous edition of
Gilbert White	PERSON	's '' The Natural History of
Selborne	LOCATION	'' published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	some time ago is now issued in a smaller size in order to permit its sale at a lower price .

		The page is somewhat reduced , but the resulting duodecimo retains all the pictorial and typograph - ical beauty of the earlier edition .

		The late
Grant Allen	PERSON	was the editor , and Mr.
Edmund H. New	PERSON	provided a most alluring series of pictures , -- birds at each chapter heading , and views of the places de - scribed interspersed through the book in appropriate places ; and the whole volume has been made a worthy memorial of the humble English country , clergyman whose little duties thoroughly done have given him an enduring fame which his most mag - nificent contemporary might envy .

		It is worth while noting that no part of the apparatus of a useful book has been sacrificed in making this a beautiful one , the copious index being a treasure in itself , just as the illustrations of birds are all drawn from life and are of scientific accuracy .

		There is no occasion for despairing of good stories as long as ''
Bob	PERSON	, Son of Battle '' can sell itself to the extent of fifty-five thousand volumes and still warrant the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in preparing a special holiday edition of this ad - mirable work of Mr.
Alfred OUivant	PERSON	's . ''

		The better I know men , the more I like dogs , '' said the
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 517 French cynic ; but the growing realization of the great democracy which nature exhibits to us would have it read , `` The better I know dogs and men , the more I like men and dogs . ''

		Even here , of course ,
Adam McAdam	PERSON	is not quite
Bob	PERSON	, but then .

		Bob is not quite
Adam	PERSON	.

		This edition has numerous illustrations from photographs of the scenes de - scribed , taken by Mr.
A. RadclifPe Dugmore	PERSON	and re - produced in half-tone .

		They depict every stage of the tender tragedy , but the desire of the subject who sat for
Adam	PERSON	to keep his physiognomy away from the stare of the camera 's eye has not helped matters greatly ; the dog was here the better of the two .

		Certainly if we were going to be a dog we would be a colly .

		But we * d rather be a boy with Christmas coming .

		• ' Historic Towns of the Western States '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- is the new volume in the '' American Historic Towns '' series , following previous volumes on the
New England	LOCATION	and the
Middle States	LOCATION	, all under the general editorship of Mr.
Lyman P. Powell	PERSON	.

		As in former instances , there is a general introduction , written in this case by Mr.
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	, preceding a series of local histories from the pens of representative residents of the several towns dis - cussed .

		In this book are dealt with , among other places ,
Cleveland	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Charles W. Thwing	PERSON	; In - dianapolis , by Mr.
Perry S. Heath	PERSON	;
Vincennes	LOCATION	.

		by the late
William Henry Smith	ORGANIZATION	;
Chicago	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Lyman J. Gage	PERSON	;
St. Loui	LOCATION	?

		, by Mr.
William Marion Reedy	PERSON	;
Omaha	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Victor Rosewater	PERSON	;
Santa	LOCATION	F ^ , by Dr.
Frederick W. Hodge	PERSON	;
San Francisco	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	; and
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, by
Miss Florence E. Winslow	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each city has its story thor - bughly illustrated , with pictures of historic spots , and of its principal buildings and monuments as they stand to-day .

		The book is not less useful than ornamental , much real learning being expended on the text , which is authoritative in every case .

		The volume is handsomely bound and boxed .

		It is a merry and a lovely book which Mrs.
Evangeline Wilbour Blashfield	PERSON	has written and Mr.
Edwin Harland Blashfield	PERSON	illustrated , with the title `` Masques of Cupid '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Four little one-act dramas make up the contents : '' The Surprise Party '' first , a thoroughly modern bit from polite society in an aspect rather less polite than usual ; '' The Lesser Evil '' next , in which
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's '' The Sire de Mala - troit 's Door '' is utilized with Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	's permission ; then a commingling of French and Americans in a French country house in
1880	DATE	, with the title '' The Honor of the Crdquy '' ; and , finally , `` In Cleon 's Garden , '' taking the reader back to
Athens	LOCATION	in the
fifth century before Christ	DATE	and to a Cleon we have long known .

		Pleasant as these little love comedies are , the pictures for them are no less charming -- reproductions of delicate pencil drawings , many in number .

		The book , a large octavo , is one of the most graceful of the season 's holiday books , and delightfully harmoni - ous in every detail . ''

		The Lark Classics '' -LRB-
Doxey	PERSON	-RRB- have already made themselves known to lovers of bibelots , and their reissuance during the holiday season in the brightest and stoutest of full leather bindings makes them available as a superior sort of Christmas card , a function for which their reasonable price makes them especially fitted .

		There are eight volumes , consisting of the '' Rubdiy ^ t '' of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	in
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's translation , with additional poems by Messrs.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	,
Porter Garnett	PERSON	, and others ; the ''
Barrack	PERSON	- Room Ballads ,
Reces	PERSON	- sional , and Other Poems '' of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	in one volume , and the '' Departmental Ditties , The Vampire , and Other Poems '' in another ; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ' *
Laus Veneris	PERSON	, and Other Poems , '' with an introduction by Mr.
Howard V. Suther	PERSON	- land ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets , with initial letters by Mr.
Porter Garnett	PERSON	;
Eric Mackay	PERSON	's * ' Love Letters of a Violinist '' ; Mr.
Wilfrid Scawen Blunt	PERSON	's `` Love Sonnets of Proteus '' ; and
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	's '' The Story of My Heart . ''

		Other volumes are announced in this admirable series , to be published soon .

		A famous spot in American history is depicted in ''
The Mohawk Valley	LOCATION	: Its Legends and Its History '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- by Mr.
W. Max Reid	PERSON	, with many illustrations from photographs taken by Mr.
J. Arthur Maney	PERSON	.

		From
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's `` Gertrude of
Wyoming	LOCATION	'' to the recent novels of Messrs.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	and
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	, this storied country has had its place in literature , and Mr.
Reid	PERSON	's book adds not a little to what has gone before it .

		The strange legend of the Indian city
Norumbega	ORGANIZATION	, which the late
John Fiske	PERSON	explained so satisfactorily , places the opening of the narra - tive before the beginnings of history , and the Five -LRB- or Six -RRB- Nations , most powerful and most imposing of aboriginal governments , lend it the interest of their checkered history .

		Jesuit mission fathers , French feudal chiefs of the new world , the soldiery of the two great nations of eighteenth-century
Europe	LOCATION	, and the final settlement of many years of conflict in the peaceful present , combine to aid Mr.
Reid	PERSON	in a task of much magnitude .

		Historical scenes , buildings , and personages comprise the sub - jects of the threescore - and-ten pictures , completing a work undertaken with ambition and brought to a conclusion with success .

		It seems fair to say that Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	was never funnier than in his latest book , which announces itself thus : '' Mr.
Munchausen	PERSON	, Being a True Account of some of the Recent Ad - ventures beyond the Styx of the late
Hieronymus Carl Friedrich	PERSON	, sometime
Baron Munchausen	PERSON	of Bordenwerder , as originally reported for the Sun - day # kiition of the
Gehenna Gazette	ORGANIZATION	by its Special Interviewer the late Mr.
Ananias	PERSON	, formerly of Jeru - salem , and now first transcribed from the columns of that Journal '' -LRB-
Noyes , Piatt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is enriched with many delicious drawings in color by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	, and is a happy caricature of a book which is itself a caricature .

		The opening , which informs a waiting world of tlie inaiuier in 518 THE DIAL LDec .

		16 , which comuiunicatioQ was established between the author and the late
Baron	PERSON	, is as good as anything to quote : '' It was not , to begin with , a dark and dismal evening .

		The snow was not falling silently , clothing a sad and gloomy world in a mantle of white , and over the darkling moor a heavy mist was not rising , as is so frequently the case .

		There was no soul-stirring moaning of bitter winds through the leafless boughs ; so far as I am aware nothing soughed within twenty miles of my bailiwick ; and my dog , lying before a blazing log fire in my li - brary , did not give forth an occasional growl of ap - prehension , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	is indefatigable in the attempt to do all that one man may to cheer his fellows .

		`` More Animals '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with both rhymes and pictures by himself , is the latest offering to this end .

		If not exactly drawn from life , the beasts and birds show a lively naturalness which is rather enhanced than diminished by the still livelier rhymes . ''

		The Do-do , '' for example , is commemor - ated thus : '' This Pleasingf Bird , I grieve to own , Is now Extinct .

		His Soul has Flown To Parts Unknown , beyond the Styx , To Join the Archceopteryx .

		What Strange , Inexplicable Whim Of Fate , was it to Banish him ?

		When Every Day the numbers swell Of Creatures we could spare so well : Insects that Bite , and Snakes that Sting , And many another Noxious Thing .

		All these , my Child , had I my Say , Should be Extinct this very Day .

		Then I would send a Special Train To bring the Do-do back again . ''

		The last four pictures in this collection are devoted to that strange beast which a boy described recently as '' half a dog tall and a dog-and-a-half long , '' the Dachshund , smaller space not serving to give his full dimensions .

		As a result , the book ends , more literally than most , with a '' tail-piece . ''

		It is very good fooling indeed .

		A curious work , evidently a labor of love in an unsuspected field , is Mrs.
Amelia Mott Gummere	PERSON	's `` The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, a Study in Costume '' -LRB-
Ferris & Leach	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Going back to the origin of the placidly demure sect who so courageously set themselves apart from worldly influences , not only in thought but in word and apparel , Mrs.
Gummere	PERSON	begins with a consideration of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	coat , most prominent of the various habiliments that went to make up the '' plain '' dress , a part of the `` pride of potential martyrdom . ''

		Chapters on the coat , the hat , beards , wigs , and bands by way of masculine attire , precede the section on the costume for women , closing with a consideration of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	bonnet .

		Much curious learning will be found in the text , and the book has numerous illustrations , many of which are reproduced in photogravure , making it an appropriate gift for all of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	descent .

		A series of the best meditative writings of the ages , under the name of '' The Cloister Library '' -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- , is to be welcomed .

		The first vol - ume , already published , is made up from the writings of Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	, containing '' Thoughts in the Cloister and the Crowd '' and '' Companions of My Solitude . ''

		It will be followed shortly by a trans - lation of
St. Teresa	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Way of Perfection , '' showing the extensive range of the series .

		The books are beautifully printed on soft paper , bound in flexible cloth , with a cloistral cover design , and of a size and weight which will permit carrying in the pocket .

		A photogravure portrait of Helps serves to introduce the text , which should be too well known to require detailed description .

		An illustrated edition has been made of Mrs.
Jane de Forest Shelton	PERSON	's '' The
Salt-Box House ; Eighteenth Century Life	ORGANIZATION	in a

Betts	PERSON	has provided most of the pictures , including full-page drawings of typical scenes of a distant day , as well as tail-pieces for some of the chapters .

		The frontispiece is from an old paint - ing showing the sort of habitation that went by the name of a '' salt-box '' house , with cabins for the negro slaves of its owner clustering at the back .

		The memory of many interesting things has been preserved in the text ; for example , the ancient name `` winkum '' for the cider brandy now known colloquially as apple-jack , the custom which re - quired the caller upon the young ladies of the household to take personal care of what was known as the '' sparking fire , '' and the text of President
Washington	LOCATION	's first Thanksgiving Proclamation .

		Pains have been taken to verify the statements made from contemporaneous documents .

		That great novel without a hero , `` Vanity Fair , '' appears in three handy little volumes as the fore - runner of a thirty-volume edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	's works complete -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- .

		A fine tinted photogravure of the author 's best portrait serves as the frontispiece , and there are numerous illustra - tions in crayon and pen-and-ink by Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	.

		A simple cover design , pretty end papers , and all that makes a tasteful book , round out the work with a fulness of excellence which the Dent imprint implies .

		Count
Tolstoi	PERSON	's ''
Anna Karenlna	PERSON	'' has attained the dignity of a sumptuous three-volume edition -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , the translation by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	being used for the purpose .

		Each of the volumes is provided with a photogravure frontis - piece after a wash-drawing by Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	.

		The type is large and clear -LRB- as may be seen from the fact that more than nine hundred pages are used to contain the text -RRB- , the paper is good , and the cover design simple and effective ; these adorn - ments , with a rubricated title-page , combine to give one of the greatest of modern novels a setting worthy of its art .

		That expected collection of good things announced as ''
Miranda	PERSON	's Library '' is favorably introduced by a gracefully designed volume reprinting Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare 's Heroines '' -LRB- Dent -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 519 Dntton -RRB- .

		The work is too well known to require any conament on the test , bat Mr.
R. Anning Bell	PERSON	has been given free scope in the decorations , and the result is charming -- suitable in every way to the fair creations of the master-poet .

		The frontis - piece and title-page are done in black and red , with a similar use of color for every chapter heading .

		In addition , numerous full-page illustrations contain portraits of the heroines themselves , done in line .

		Soft , firm paper , light in weight , and a cover design entirely in keeping , make up a gift worth giving and a volume worth keeping .

		Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	has her cult , like other writers ; and a sacrifice on its shrine is the luxuri - ous edition of '' Barabbas , a Dream of the World 's Tragedy , '' just published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a bit of symbolism in the rubrica - tion of its title-page , and Mr.
Ludovico Marchetti	PERSON	has done half-a-dozen good drawings for the book , which are finely reproduced in photogravure .

		The binding is red , stamped with gold , -- this also seem - ing to be somewhat symbolic .

		Following the holiday reprint of • '
Penelope	PERSON	's English Experiences '' last year ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	now bring forth '' A
Cathedral Court	ORGANIZATION	- ship '' -- like its predecessor , the delightful work of Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin Riggs	PERSON	.

		As before , Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	has been selected for the delicate and interpretive line drawings which so plentifully illustrate the work , and not one element of the humor implied in ' '' a quantity of lemon squash suitable for two , '' and all the rest of the so thoroughly un-American things one finds in En - gland , has been lost .

		If these British did not take themselves so seriously , there would be a native verse on `` lemon squash '' which would out -
Lear Lear	PERSON	.

		One of the little nooks of art is exploited with admirable results by Mr.
Wilbur Macey	PERSON	Stone in '' Some Children 's Book Plates , an Essay in Little , '' published by the '' Brothers of the Book , '' at
Gouverneur	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is the sort of thing that one is glad to see done by somebody , tiny as the subject is , and remote from modern ideas .

		The book has unquestioned charm , the essay being something more than an excuse for giving a series of illustrations .

		The book-plates , which are pasted in , give American , English , French , and German examples , some from a by - gone age with gaunt lettering and formal decora - tion and old-fashioned tyj -RRB- e designs for borders .

		Several are in color , and all show a firm grasp of the possibilities of the subject , from the little maid who is telling her troubles to a stalwart policeman with the motto '' Take Me Home . ''

		to the plate of the
Acorn Library	ORGANIZATION	, and its legend , '' Small Plan - nings for Large Endings . ''

		The edition is limited to three hundred and fifty copies .

		That very pretty little story by Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, ' * Her First Appearance , '' has been taken from its companionship with the other '' Van Bibber '' tales and given a setting of its own .

		with the pictures by Messrs.
C. D. Gibson	PERSON	and
E. M. Ashe	PERSON	, made into vignettes with a tinted frame .

		The story deals , as its many admirers know , largely with the stage and stage people ; but the spirit of
Christmas	LOCATION	is reflected in its bright pages , which are made more bright by the tasteful adornments with which the publishers -LRB- Harpers -RRB- have distinguished this holiday edition .

		Calendars are among the inevitable consolations of one more year gone , and this season they are sufficiently beautiful in many cases to serve their purpose .

		The **
Bryn Mawr College Calendar	ORGANIZATION	for
1902	DATE	'' is a pretty affair , and is to be had of the Students ' Building Committee at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, the profits from the sale of it to be applied to the fund for a new students ' building .

		Thirteen full-page drawing ^ , reproduced in color on drab paper , will be found , done , as in previous years , by Misses
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	,
Elizabeth Shippen Green	PERSON	, and
Ellen Wetherald Ahrens	PERSON	, from typical scenes in student life and from views in many places , both at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		The work has decided artistic merit -- '' The Bird Calendar '' -LRB-
A. W. Mumford	PERSON	-RRB- utilizes six of the excellent color pictures which have been printed in the volume called '' Birds and All Nature , '' the several months being represented by a winged creature more or less characteristic .

		The snowy owl , for example , answers for
January	DATE	and
Febru	PERSON	- ary , and the red-headed woodpecker for
July	DATE	and
August	DATE	.

		In each case a description of the bird and an account of its habits accompanies the portrait , and the general effect is pleasing .

		-- `` A
Calen	PERSON	- dar for Saints and Sinners '' has been compiled by the
Young Woman	ORGANIZATION	's
Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	of the
First Methodist Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, of
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		It consists of fifty-two cards , tied together with silk cord and tassels , and bearing an attractive cover design in red and black .

		There is a selection in prose or verse for every day in the year , the authors represented ranging from
Pythagoras to Will Carleton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Quite inimitable are the tiny volumes -- diminu - tive enough to be literal • ' waistcoat pocket books '' -- which the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	is issuing in the '' Oxford Miniature Editions . ''

		The latest of these is the ** Dramatic Lyrics and Romances , and Other Poems '' of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, with an early portrait for the frontispiece , and more than a hun - dred titles contained in eight hundred pages .

		Yet the book , for all it contains , is less than an inch thick , owing to the marvellous quality of
India	LOCATION	paper used .

		Both as a specimen of fine book - making , and for the standard value of its contents , the little volume should be a favorite with
Christ	LOCATION	- mas buyers .

		A series of rhymed skits on certain phases of modern American life may add to the hilarity of the Christmas occasion , many pictures in color framing the lines .

		The work is the product of the imaginative genius of Mr.
Leon Lempert	PERSON	, Jr. , and is put forth by the
C. M. Clark Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, 520 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, with the title , ''
Jank	PERSON	: Verses , Pathetic and Other - wise , Mostly Otherwise ; a Book to Stagger Sorrow .

		** It is dedicated by the '' Instigator , '' with apologies , to the friends of his youth , and to others who have survived the ordeal and are still his friends .

		The volume may indeed stagger them , as it has almost staggered the critic .

		If anyone in the
United States	LOCATION	has not read Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's '' The Crisis , '' his last excuse for the singularity is taken from him by the new holiday edition which the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	has just issued of this record-breaking novel .

		Enclosed in a box , with an extra board wrapper , may be found the neatly printed volume , bound in half - sheep with gilt lettering , and sides of buff buckram .

		Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	's frontispiece has been moved over to face the table of contents , and its place is taken by a portrait of the author in photogravure with a facsimile signature .

		Mr.
William B. Groos	PERSON	has phrased '' One Hun - dred and Forty-Four New Epigrams , '' and Mr.
Edwin J. Meeker	PERSON	has made a full-page picture appropriate to the sentiment he has hand-lettered below it , the book being published by
Messrs. R. F. Fenno & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Groos	PERSON	has had better success with thinking his thoughts than with setting them into words .

		For example , '' Life to the ignorant man is one long night through which he sleeps without awaking '' seems verbose , and would be the better clad in the terser form , '' Ignorance is sleep when it is not death , '' or * ' Knowing nothing is be - ing nothing , in man or monkey . ''

		But Mr.
Groos	PERSON	is writing the epigrams , not we ; and some of them are very good indeed , -- '' Law often becomes the tyrant of a republic , '' for instance . ''

		If our wishes had wings how far we could fly '' is one of the good things that was said for the epigrammatist some centuries before , however .

		Two more blossoms from Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's `` Flowers of Parnassus '' series are issued in time to serve as the best sort of Christmas or New Year 's cards , -- Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's '' Christmas at the Mermaid , '' with the pictures by Mr.
Her	PERSON	- bert
Cole	PERSON	; and
William Blake	PERSON	's '' Songs of Inno - cence , '' illustrated by Miss
Geraldine Morris	PERSON	, with a little of the spirit of the poet 's own designs .

		There is always danger of the Christian Christ - mas sinking into the heathen Yule , or
Saturnalia	LOCATION	; and this tendency is gently resisted by Mrs.
Mar	PERSON	- garet
E. Sangster	PERSON	in '' Talks between Times , '' pub - lished by the
American Tract Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		A photo - gravure portrait of the author is used for the frontispiece , most appropriately , the benevolence of the face it shows being admirably borne out by the kindliness of the little lectures on prayer , home , marriage , children , and other matters of daily life , including a timely word or two by way of `` Yule Tide Musings . ''

		If we are to be Christians , it is well to be the kind that Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	is , with sympathy for everything in the world except vol - untary evil and its effects on the innocent .

		Books for the
Young	ORGANIZATION	.

		II .

		Bookx for boys .

		Books designed more particularly for boys , including works based on history , begin with '' A Boy in
Early Virginia	LOCATION	' * -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward Robins	PERSON	, with illustrations by Mr.
John Henderson Betts	PERSON	.

		It opens on board the `` Susan Constant '' in
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	in the
April	DATE	of I607 , a boy hero being there with the redoubtable warrior and explorer .

		It follows the fortunes of the two until the return to
England	LOCATION	in
1609	DATE	, the Pocahontas incident being given due prominence .

		-- Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	, R.A.M.C , writes `` A Gallant Grenadier , a Tale of the Crimean War '' -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which Mr.
Walter Paget	PERSON	provides the illustrations .

		It is of the familiar type of historical books for growing boys ; drums , bugles , daring deeds , death , and glory inter - spersing themselves through its exciting pages .

		--
Harry Castlemon	PERSON	-LRB- Mr.
Charles Arthur Fosdick	PERSON	-RRB- re - appears this season with `` Winged Arrow * s Medicine ; or , The Massacre at Fort
Phil Kearney	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book of the sort made well known by the author to the boys of a long generation ago .

		It shows no signs of decreasing ability to interest , on one hand , or of increas - ing literary perception on the other .

		The deeds de - scribed are matters of real history and mightily creditable to the soldiers engaged in them .

		-- The fourth story on our list drawing from the recent out - break in
China	LOCATION	is Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	's '' The Dragon of
Pekin	LOCATION	, a Tale of the Boxer Revolt '' -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		An English youth of seventeen years is the hero , and he rivals the deeds done by the American boys in the American stories of the uprising -- he could hardly hope to outdo them .

		-- History made easy is the '' American Boy 's Life of
William McKinley	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the ready pen of Mr.
Edward Strate	PERSON	- meyer .

		There is not much excitement in the life story of the murdered President , at least not after the Civil War closed , but there is much to instruct , and this the author has made use of , adapting the politics of the book to the intelligence of his readers , and making the most of the anecdotes which have gathered about President
McKinley	PERSON	's memory .

		-- A pleasant and homely tale of country boys in the days before Prairie - ton had a railway is Mr.
John Habbertou	PERSON	's '' Some Boys ' Doings * ' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , with illustrations by Mr.
John Henderson Betts	PERSON	.

		It is more fact than fancy , and can be read with interest by many who were boys before the war between the
States	LOCATION	.

		-- '' Rescued by a Prince '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Mr.
Clement Eldridge	PERSON	* s account of a youngster who escapes multiform perils by field and flood , cannibals furnishing the chief excitement .

		It is really worth while getting into the most tremendous scrapes when they can be got out of so handily .

		The illustrations are uumerous The dedication of '' The Billy Stories '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' to every boy and girl in the
United States	LOCATION	who hates to go to bed when bed-time comes '' ought to secure its accept - ance .

		For the rest ,
Miss Eva Lovett	PERSON	tells of a real boy , a healthy animal with a fine capacity for amusing himself .

		He begins as an author and ends as an arctic explorer , both occupations being carried on without leaving home .

		-- Mr.
Cleveland Moffett	PERSON	touches on a little-considered side of real life in his `` Careers of Danger and Daring '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a somewhat mis - leading title , which is concerned with steeple-climbers , deep-sea divers , balloonists , pilots , bridge-builders ,
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 521 firemen , dynamite workers , and others to whom excite - ment and daily bread spell much the same thing .

		The story of the wild-beast tamer is one of the best in a book that is useful , instructive , and undeniably full of healthy interest .

		A book or two having to do with Amer - ^ ^ f ** '' . ''

		* / ican school-life may be commended for the real pleasure they give an older per - son in the reading as well as the transcripts from healthy boyish life which brings them home to the fellows of the boys they describe .

		Mr.
Ralph Barbour	PERSON	has written his third book , '' The Captain of the Crew '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , Like the two stories which preceded it , the well illus - trated volume is concerned with the boys at
Hillton Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		```` The Quarter Back , '' of two years ago , dealt with football matters ; and '' For the Honor of the School , '' last year , with track athletics .

		So this , as its title indicates , has to do with success on the river , and the earlier sorrows and later triumphs of the cap - tain and his young English room-mate are set forth with a vigor and reality that leave little to be desired .

		-- Of the same sort is Mr.
Allen	PERSON	French 's story '' The Junior Cup '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book opens in a
summer	DATE	camp where a lot of boys are having as good a time as health , leisure , youth , and irrespoasibility can unite in giving them .

		Two of them are enlisted as rivals for the prize which lends its name to the volume , and the wholesome emulation to which it gives rise is carried into the boarding school life which follows when the jolly vacation days are over .

		So successful is this book and the one just mentioned that others must follow iu the footsteps of Messrs.
Barbour	PERSON	and
Allen	PERSON	, to the lasting benefit of authors and readers alike . ''

		When Mother Was a Little Girl '' -LRB- Ja - cobs -RRB- is a title so good that we wonder at its not having been used before .

		The story is told by Miss
Frances S. Brewster	PERSON	from incidents related by her own mother .

		The life described is the simple one of a Berkshire farmhouse .

		-- The author of '' Three Girls in a Flat , ''
Miss Ethel F. Heddle	PERSON	, has written a book of the same interest , '' An Original Girl '' -LRB- imported by Seribners -RRB- .

		The tale is of Lon - don , and the heroine is the daughter of a broken down actor , with a young mother who writes little stories , a beautiful girl who hates
London	LOCATION	, a sort of fairy god - mother , and various matters of interest .

		-- A book of similar content is Mrs.
Evelyn Everett-Green	PERSON	's '' Miss
Marjorie	PERSON	of Silvermead '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , an English story for girls who are just becoming young women .

		But here the scenes are laid in the country for the most part .

		There are lords and ladies throughout , and love at the end of the book Another English book for girls is Miss
Izola L. Forrester	PERSON	's '' Rook 's Nest '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , a book for a younger set of people than the others .

		It describes a great deal of innocent fun and frolic , and all its troubles come right in the end .

		-- A sweet little story is ''
Bernardo	PERSON	and Lanrette '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , the tale of a little boy and little girl in the
Savoyard Alps	ORGANIZATION	, written by Miss
Marguerite Bouvet	PERSON	and excellently illustrated by
Miss Helen Maitland Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not without excitement , though uniformly sane , and it deserves reading .

		-- ```` The Colbum Prize '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a '' story of girls for girls '' as the sub-title announces , by Miss
Gabrielle E. Jackson	PERSON	.

		It tells of two girl friends at school , each of whom , though healthily anxious to ` win a prize , makes a sacrifice of her own ambitions for her fellow .

		-- Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	writes and Miss
Ida Waugh	PERSON	illustrates '' Mistress May '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , Books / or girlt .

		Fairy lalet in plenty .

		the biography of a little girl who has illnesses and naughtinesses in the human manner , by way of diversi - fying a wholesome and generally happy little life .

		-- '' The Story of Live Dolls , Being an Account by Jo - sephine
Scribner Gates of How	ORGANIZATION	, on a Certain
June Morning	DATE	, All of the Dolls in the
Village of Cloverdale Came Alive	ORGANIZATION	, with Many Pictures Made at the
Time	ORGANIZATION	by
Virginia	LOCATION	Keep '' -LRB- Bowen-Merrill -RRB- is the wording of the title-page of a really clever tale for very little girls .

		The bringing to life and speech of all the children 's puppets is told with a fine air of reality .

		-- Romance and mystery clustering about a priceless ruby lends excitement to '' The King 's Rubies '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , the story of a little girl .

		A boy or two , an old negro , some thieves , and other miscellaneous folk , give the book a large variety , and the action is incessant .

		It is written by
Miss Adelaide Fuller Bell	ORGANIZATION	.

		-- A tale of school-girl life in
Washington	LOCATION	, by
Miss Armour Strong	ORGANIZATION	, has been given the appropriate title of `` Dear Days '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The setting of the book on historical ground has given the author the opportunity to tell many authentic anec - dotes of statesmen and others , and the book is an ex - cellent one to place in the hands of growing girls .

		Fairies , goblins , and sprites are the most popular of imaginary beings , though modern fairy stories are like modern ballads : better technically , it may be , but lacking that indefinable something which is the soul of the whole matter .

		Precedence in this category belongs to '' A Real Queen 's Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Davis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which have been translated by Miss
Edith Hopkirk	PERSON	from the orig - inal by
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, Queen of
Ronmania	LOCATION	, and illustrated by Messrs.
Harold Nelson	PERSON	and
A. Garth Jones	PERSON	.

		Mr.
George T. B. Davis	PERSON	provides an introduction , in which the life of ''
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	'' is told , itself so near a tale of enchantment as to serve its purpose with rare fitness .

		The stories themselves are based upon ancient Rou - manian legends , and have in consequence an atmosphere and air -LRB- similar wurds of divergent significance -RRB- which are beyond mere imitation .

		They were written , we are told , in three weeks , in order to assist in raising a fund for the suffering Roumanian soldiers in the
Russo	PERSON	- Turkish war of
1877	DATE	; and the old traditions upon which they are based have been used many times in recent years , in such compilations as those of Mr. An - drew
Lang	PERSON	, for example .

		The book is a desirable one , but it is the people long dead and forgotten , rather than the living monarch , to whom its interest is due .

		-- Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	apparently is joining the ranks of the literary indefatigables , but without any appearance , so far , of being jaded .

		In '' Folly in Fairyland '' -LRB-
Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- she has told a nnmber of stories merrily and well , even to the inclusion of an alphabet of limericks , of which one is , '' H was a humorous Hen , W ^ ho could n't count further than ten ; So when she got through With the numbers she knew , She just began over ag ^ in . ''

		The pictures in the book are by Mr. W ^ allace
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	.

		--
E. Nesbit	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Hubert Bland	PERSON	-RRB- has told `` Nine Un - likely Tales for Children '' -LRB- Dntton -RRB- , which are as '' likely '' tales -LRB- using the American instead of the British dialect -RRB- as any written for this year 's children .

		The method lies chiefly in introducing the apparatus of a whimsical fairy-land into the practical affairs of every-day life In ''
Gobbo Bobo	PERSON	, the Two-Eyed Griffin '' -LRB-
Warne	PERSON	-RRB- , Miss H. E < cott-Inman the author , and
Miss E. A. Mason	PERSON	the illustrator , have seized upon
London	LOCATION	as it is to make something that is decidedly
London	LOCATION	as it is n't .

		These veracious chronicles hesw 522 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, with ```` When the Clock Struck Thirteen '' -LRB- which is very late at night indeed -RRB- , and end in '' The Wonderful Land of Zoologocady , '' which is north of day-after - to-morrow and south of day-before-yesterday .

		It is very good foolery .

		-- Aborigines -LRB- of
America	LOCATION	and sev - eral other lauds -RRB- supply the material for Mrs.
Jane Pentzer Myers	PERSON	's '' Stories of Enchantment '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , for which Mrs.
Harriet Roosevelt Richards	PERSON	has made the pictures .

		Telling of ancient things , the stories have simplicity ; but this is sometimes forced .

		-- Miss
Kath	PERSON	- arine
Pyle	PERSON	has both written and illustrated '' As the Goose Flies '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which tells of five little pigs , seven little dwarfs , the magic lamp .

		Princess Goldeuhair , and a number of other unusual animals , persons , and things .

		The book and its pictures are ad - mirably suited to one another , and interesting to a degree .

		-- Because it treats of some fairies , though the pictures are from photographs of really live boys and girls , Mrs.
Elizabeth B. Brownell	PERSON	's `` Dream Children '' -LRB- Bowen-Merrill -RRB- may be included here .

		Mrs.
Brownell	PERSON	is among the best known of those conscientious workers who are making a fine art of photography , and some of her most notable achievements in portraiture are used to supplement and interpret the letter-press of the book , which is drawn , both prose and poetry , from the most various sources .

		The introduction , by
Miss Clara E. Laughlin	PERSON	, is a pleasant bit of writing .

		It must be said that , charming as the illustrations are in subject and treatment , the process of reproducing in half-tone has destroyed some of their most valuable characteristics , reducing to mechanical woodeuness much of the photog - rapher 's best effort Quite as strange as any fairy story , and rather more improbable , are the adventures of the young electrician recounted by Mr.
L. Frank Baumin	PERSON	`` The Master Key '' -LRB- Bowen-Merrill -RRB- .

		The hero makes a small bracelet which serves all the pur - poses of the enchanted carpet of old , a garment which saves him from the possibility of bodily harm , a tube which paralyzes his foes for an hour when used against them , and so on .

		Favorite Amidst the immense output of books for authors in the day and hour , it still happens that new .

		/ orm .

		books of a generation ago , re-issued with the aid of modern pictorial resources , are often those which seem best worth attention .

		This is true especi - ally of such a work as
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's '' The Heroes ; or , Greek Fairy Tales for My Children '' -LRB- Russell -RRB- , which comes this year with the sixty drawings , many of them in color , of Misses
M. H. Squire	PERSON	and
E. Mars	ORGANIZATION	.

		The old stories seem doubly hallowed by their association with the genius of the parson of
Eversley	LOCATION	, and the generous octavo is a possession to be treasured So of
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	's `` Tales from Shakespeare , '' re-issued by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with half a dozen color plates , and seventy half-tone illustrations in the text , by Mr.
Walter Paget	PERSON	. '

		`` What these tales have been to you in childhood , '' say the gentle pair , '' that and much more it is my wish that the true plays of Shakespeare may prove to you in older years -- enrichers of the fancy , strengtbeners of virtue , a witli - drawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts , a lesson of all sweet and honorable thoughts and actions , to teach you courtesy , benignity , generosity , humanity ; for of examples teaching these virtues , his pages < are full . ''

		Such words are as apples of gold in pictures of silver , and it would be well if no child 's book were published which could not worthily bear such a senti - ment on its title-page `` Ten Boys from Dickens '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is offered by Mrs.
Kate Dickinson Sweetser	PERSON	as a substitute for the novels of the master himself .

		Her method is simple : Tiny
Tim	PERSON	, or Traddles , or
David Copperfield	PERSON	, or Pip , is made the central figure in as many narratives , whereby their biographies are extricated from all extraneous matter and re-told in Mrs. Sweet - ser 's , not
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's , language .

		The work is certainly well done , and the portraits of the boys , by Mr.
George Alfred Williams	PERSON	, are satisfactory ; but are children not to be permitted to go to headquarters any more ?

		There is an inevitable difference between water from the living
spring	DATE	and the same water boiled and filtered .

		Nature books are excellent reading for ^ v '' , 7 the young , and one of the best of them nature hooKt .

		• ' * '' .

		, , _ , , , „ / - , , , , this year is Mr.
Edward B. Clark	PERSON	s '' Birds of Lakeside and Prairie '' -LRB-
Mumford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has rambled over nearly all of
Northern Illinois	LOCATION	, hunting birds with an opera-glass rather than a fowling - piece ; and as a result he has a most interesting tale to tell at first-hand of birds and their haunts and habits .

		Sixteen illustrations in color , of a high order of merit , make the book a most desirable one A brand-new edition , fully revised , of the four `` Nature Readers '' of Mrs.
Julia McNair Wright	PERSON	brings into present usefulness those really valuable adjuncts of study . ''

		Seaside and Wayside '' is their general title -LRB-
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and nearly all natural science , from conchology to astronomy , falls into the purview of one or another of them .

		They are the sort of text-books that may be read for enjoyment as well as studied for instruction '' Pussy Meow , the Autobiography of a Cat '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is written by Mrs.
S. Louise Patterson	PERSON	for the purpose of making the same plea for kindness to cats that '' Black Beauty '' did for horses and '' Beau - tiful Joe '' for dogs .

		Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	has written the introduction , and photographs from life are re - produced for illustrations '' In the Days of Audubon '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a simplified account in reasonable com - pass of the life of the great naturalist , written by Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	for the purpose of assisting the
Audubon Societies	ORGANIZATION	in their work of justice and mercy .

		Nothing could be better calculated to teach kiuduess and courtesy to the feathered folk than the life history of '' the Protector of Birds , '' and the book goes forth with the heartiest wishes for the success it abundantly deserves .

		-- Mr.
Edward B. Clark	PERSON	, already referred to , is also the author of '' Bird Jingles '' -LRB-
Mumford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a series of pleasant little rhymes for children about the more notable birds , with colored plates of the same sort used in his other work , commented on above .

		-- These same pictures serve also to brighten the `` A B C of Birds '' -LRB-
Mumford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Miss
Mary Catherine Judd	PERSON	, and the merit of the book becomes doubly valuable through the authenticity of its bird portraits .

		The verses are called '' nonsense rhymes '' by their author , but they do not quite reach that level .

		-- '' Flower Legends for Chil - dren '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- are fanciful little tales from history and tradition , by Miss
Hilda Murray	PERSON	, set in beautiful color plates by Mr.
J. S. Eland	PERSON	Mr.
Clifton Bingham	PERSON	's '' The Animals ' Picnic '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is made up of humor - ous rhymes , and quite as humorous pictures by Mr.
G. H. Thompson	PERSON	.

		It is not a nature-book exactly , but tliere is a great deal of nature in it of a human sort .

		This seems to be a day when text and pictures long linked in the public mind are being cruelly dissociated . ''

		Non - sense Songs by
Edwin Lear	PERSON	'' used to have the author 's pictures -- not many in number , it is true , but with a Songi and jingles .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 52S certaiu feeliug of cougruity which made them valuable .

		For this season 's fine new edition -LRB-
Warne	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of a book which is now classic , Mr.
L. Leslie Brooke	PERSON	has provided abundant illustrations in color , far better in point of art than
Lear	PERSON	could ever hope to attain to , but still with the something lacking which was not lacking before .

		Bat the book is for children who do not know what their elders knew about the snbj `` ct -- and is it any of their elders ' business , in any event ?

		-- `` History in Rhymes and Jingles '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a work of profes - sorial dignity , the text by Dr.
Alexander Clarence Flick	PERSON	, who holds the chair of European history in the
Syracuse University	ORGANIZATION	, and the pictures by Mr.
Carl T. Hawley	PERSON	,
B.P.	LOCATION	, who is the associate professor of drawing in the same institution .

		It is a most inclusive work , ranging from ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra , '' which opens thus : `` O foolish Antony !

		Why do you stay ?

		Do n't you know that
Rome	LOCATION	wants you ?

		You should n't go away , '' to '' The Battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, '' which reads thus : '' In the great battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, See what a scrape the Mexicans got into , They fought it at a fearful cost .

		The state of
Texas	LOCATION	then they lost .

		In the battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	.

		-LSB-
April 21 , 1836	DATE	. -RSB- ''

		A little of that goes quite a distance .

		-- '' Songs of the Days and the Year for
Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren Old and Young '' -LRB-
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is quite another thing .

		In it Mrs.
Harriet F. Blodgett	PERSON	, `` thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised , '' in
Dickens	LOCATION	's phrase , has done some really graceful and beautiful little verses for the g ^ tification of any au - dience , however critical .

		It proves , though the proof should not be needed , that literary flavor need not be lacking in children 's songs and verses , and we are sure the little folk will be the better for it .

		-- As '' cunning '' little volumes as ever gave pleasure to a childish heart can be found in `` The Bairn Books '' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- , written by Mr.
Walter Copeland	PERSON	and illustrated in color by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	.

		One of them is called '' The Farm Book '' and the other '' A Book of Days . ''

		Both prose and verse are contained in them , and they would make an ideal present for twins -- being small enough for Saint
Nicholas	PERSON	to slip into a stocking '' hung by the chimnev with care . ''

		XOTES .

		An '' Introduction to Csesar , '' by Mr.
M. L. Brittain	PERSON	, is a Latin book for beginners published by the

Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Freshman English and Theme-Correctiug in Har - vard College , '' by Messrs.
C. T. Copeland	PERSON	and
H. M. Rideout	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,

		The Marble Faun , '' edited by Mrs.

		An abridgment of
Jean de la Brute	ORGANIZATION	's `` Mon Oncle et Mon Cur ^ , '' edited by Dr.
T. F. Colin	PERSON	, is published for school use by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also send us Theodor Storm 's '' In St.
Jiirgen	PERSON	, '' edited by Profes - sor
Arthur S. Wright	PERSON	.

		The ''
Thornton	PERSON	'' series of the
Bronte	PERSON	writings , im - ported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is now rounded out by a twelfth volume which reproduces Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's '' Life of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	. ''

		It is reprinted from the first edition , and edited , with introduction and notes , by
Messrs. Temple Scott	ORGANIZATION	and
B. W. Willett	PERSON	.

		There is a portrait frontispiece .

		Professor
Ira Remsen	LOCATION	's '' College Text-Book of Chem - istry , '' just published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & , Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a manual that occupies an intermediate position between the two other text-books by this writer .

		It is a Tolume of nearly seven hundred pages .

		Two of the pamphlet publications of Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	have recently reached us .

		In the Oriental series we have '' The Babylonian and the Hebrew Genesis , '' by Dr.
Heinrich Zimmern	PERSON	, and in the Romance series , '' The Mabinogion , '' by Mr.
Iver B. John	PERSON	.

		Two ''
Columbia University Germanic Studies	ORGANIZATION	'' are `` Ossian in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Rudolph Tombo	PERSON	; and '' The Influence of Old Norse Literature upon English Literature , '' by Mr.
Conrad Hjalmar Nordby	PERSON	.

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of these monographs .

		Dr.
James Harrington Boyd	PERSON	's `` College Algebra , '' ' published by Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a formidable text-book indeed , and we pity the luckless collegians who have to work their way through it .

		It is a book of nearly eight hundred exceptionally solid pages , fortified against hard usage by a substantial half morocco binding .

		The ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	''
Shelley	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is similar in form to the other ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' poets of this house , and is edited , as is entirely fitting , by Professor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	.

		The '' Victor and Cazire '' volume is not included , although an account of its fortunes is given by the editor .

		There are nearly seven hundred pages in this edition .

		An '' Elementary Zoology , '' by Professor
Vernon L. Kellogg	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a handsomely-illustrated work , well-equipped for class-room and laboratory use .

		The treatment is pri - marily systematic , but the ecological aspect of animal study also receives careful attention .

		We are not acquainted with a better book of its scope , and for its purposes .

		Professor
Edward E. Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, has prepared for
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a volume of `` Selections from Walter Pater '' which promptly takes its place with the Arnold and the
Newman	PERSON	in the same series .

		We have often commended these '' English Readings , '' and this admirable addition to the series impels us to renew our words of praise for their competent and tasteful editing .

		A recent '' Library Bulletin '' of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	is a bibliography of '' Books on Education in the Libraries of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work has been prepared under the supervision of Mr.
Charles Alexander Nelson	PERSON	, and fills over four hundred double-columned pages , the number of titles being 13,500 .

		Columbiana are not included , nor are text-books ; since these categories would seem to be important enough to justify special catalogues . ''

		A List of Serials in Public Libraries of
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Evanston	LOCATION	, '' corrected to the beginning of the pres - ent year , has been compiled by the
Chicago Libhury Club	ORGANIZATION	, and makes a volume of nearly two hundred octavo pages .

		Fifteen libraries are included , and the serials catalogued reach the surprising number of
6640	DATE	.

		Of this number , no less than 3755 are currently received in one or more of the libraries , and
2360	DATE	are in foreign 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, languages .

		No more eloquent testimony than these fig - ures could be offered in taking an account of the im - portance of periodical literature in the intellectual activity of the day .

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	has edited , and
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , '' A Year Book of Famous Lyrics . ''

		There is a poem or two for every day of the year , all taken from English or Amer - ican sources .

		There are also sixteen portrait illustra - tions , a collection of notes , and all kinds of indexes .

		Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	has a pretty taste in verse , and we can commend his anthology . ''

		The
Young Folks	ORGANIZATION	' Cyclopaedia of Literature and Art , '' by Mr.
John Denison Champlin	PERSON	, is a third volume in his popular series of reference books for boys and girls .

		A notable deficiency in the earlier volumes , which dealt mainly with science and history , is thus supplied .

		The three books together would constitute the best sort of a gift for a young person of inquiring mind .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Among the recent publications of the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	is a work of the greatest value to the geographer and the historian .

		It is `` A List of Maps of
America	LOCATION	in the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' including all material of this sort in the national collection at the time when the new building was opened four years ago .

		The compilation has been made by Mr.
P. Lee Phillips	PERSON	, and the volume extends to over eleven hundred large pages .

		Mr.
Reginald Rankin	PERSON	's English version of the text of
Wagner	PERSON	's '' Nibelungen Ring '' is now completed by the publication of the second volume .

		This work is a continuous poem in blank verse , rather than a simple translation , although the actual words of the text are used as far as possible .

		A great many descriptive and connecting passages , however , are necessarily original with Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are the publishers .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' A Brief French Course , '' by
M. Antoine Muzzarelli	PERSON	.

		The work is a school text for beginners , having for its distinguishing feature the embodiment of the reformed syntax de - creed by the French government last
March	DATE	.

		In spite of governmental action , the new rules have not met with the approval of the best French scholars , and we can not but regret their appearance in an American manual of the language .

		The Messrs.
Seribner	PERSON	send us a revised edition of '' The Evolution of Sex , '' by Messrs.
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	and
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	.

		The book is now twelve years old , and a restatement of the case seemed necessary , although the authors see no occasion to modify the essentials of their theory .

		The interesting confession is made , however , that in the past ten years the authors have '' been diverging biologically -- the one towards a Neo-Lamarckiau position , the other towards a Neo - Darwinian one . ''

		`` * Government in
State and Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
J. A. James	PERSON	and
A. H. Sanford	PERSON	, is a text-book for the use of secondary schools .

		It adopts the approved method of proceeding from local forms of government to the government of the nation .

		The book seems to be logical in its development , and historical in its treat - ment .

		The suggestions for independent work are well - considered , and there are abundant references to the sources of information .

		The work is published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

JOHN S. WISE	PERSON	.

		Large crown 8vo ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	.

		7 ^ Outlook says : '' This is a work of compelling interest .

		It is a particularly charaiing aatobiography , bat it has greater value as a contribution to our knowledge of American history .

		Written from an ardently Southern and Confederate standpoint , and with a
Southron	ORGANIZATION	's winning impulsiveness , it gfives to us Northerns real pictures of life as lived in the
South from 1850	DATE	to the end of the Civil War .

		It gives as well to all readers what , perhaps , they do not find in more ambitious accounts of the war , namely , first-hand impressions of some of its distinguished participants .

		Notably valuable to read in connection with other accounts are Mr.
Wise	PERSON	's descrip - tions of the Know-Nothing campaign , the
John Brown	PERSON	raid , and the Merrimac-Monitor fight . ''

		Time and the Hour ,
Boston	LOCATION	, remarks : `` No book that has yet been written about the events preceding and during the Civil War from the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	side deserves to be as enduring as ' The End of an Era , ' and it is doubtful if any other book of the kind has been capable of accomplishing as much good in the way of restoring a harmony of national feeling . ''
