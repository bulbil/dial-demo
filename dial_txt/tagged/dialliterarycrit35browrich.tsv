		On the principle that good wine needs no bush , the illustration of literature would seem to be a work of supererogation .

		While it is theoretically true that pictorial art may prop - erly be employed for the elucidation of literary art , and while this dual alliance is occasionally brought to a successful issue , yet it must be confessed that as a general rule the divergence of aim and method is so great that the mutual heightening of effect to be desired is not achieved .

		Each kind of art may be good in its own way , but neither artist has so penetrated into the consciousness of the other as to become truly interpretative of his work , or entirely sympa - thetic in the expression of his spirit .

		The illustrator plays about the text , or , in the less common reverse case , the writer plays about the picture ; but in neither case is the relation other than external , and a genuine interfusion of the two idealisms is rarely accomplished .

		When the poet or the novelist becomes his own illustrator , a successful marriage of the two arts is of course possible , provided that the writer be not a mere amateur in design .

		The case of
Rossetti	PERSON	naturally comes to mind as the one conspicuous modern instance of the two forms of genius united in one personality .

		One of
Rossetti	PERSON	's sonnets illustrated by one of his own drawings offers a perfect example of the two arts in happy conjunction .

		But the case of
Rossetti	PERSON	is almost unique , for it is gen - erally true that pictures for poems are not the work of poets , and that poems for pictures are penned by hands that have had no practice in the use of the brush .

		If the pictorial art is to stand in its ideal relation to the literature with which it is occupied , it must be more than the mere complement of the printed page ; it must add to the meaning of the text , and must in turn be itself illuminated by that text .

		In a word , each of the arts thus allied must have a far deeper meaning when taken in connection with the other than it could possibly have when standing by itself .

		Mr.
Tedder	PERSON	's series of illustrations made for
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's paraphrase of Omar affords an extraordinary example of what it is possible for a painter of genius to do for a poet .

		These noble drawings might well claim recognition on their own account , but their impressiveness is raised to the second power through their asso - ciation with the quatrains of the Tent-Maker .

		And it is hardly too much to say that the im - pressiveness of the quatrains is similarly raised through their association with the drawings .

		But here again we have the exceptional in - stance , which serves only to make more glaring the shortcomings of all ordinary attempts to produce pictures that shall suitably interpret works of literary art .

		Even when we get good designs for good literature , as with
Flaxman	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	,
Kaulbach	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Cruikshank	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, we are somehow made uncomfort - ably conscious that the one form of expression does not fit in with the other .

		And we do not 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, always get even this .

		Sometimes an artist of genius will waste his powers upon the illus - tration of a third-rate text , and we get such a production as
Blair	PERSON	's '' The Grave '' illustrated by
Blake	PERSON	, which we prize only for the drawings , which never tempts us to read the words sup - posed to have been their inspiration .

		On the other hand , we sometimes find a great master - piece of literature cheapened -- as far as such a thing is possible -- by sensational and mer - etricious illustration , of which the most con - spicuous modern instance is offered by
Dore	ORGANIZATION	's drawings for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		These examples will show sufficiently for our present purpose how hazardous a thing it is to enlist the one art in the service of the other , and how frequently the result of so doing is a product that must be called incongruous , even if we spare it a harsher name .

		But if the illustration of literature is a ques - tionable procedure , it is quite otherwise with the illustration of the history of literature .

		That history , while primarily concerned with the writings that are cherished by mankind for their artistic form or their intellectual grasp , must also be concerned to a considerable extent with such matters as the personal characters , the biography , the homes and haunts , the man - ners and customs , and the historical setting of the authors dealt with .

		And , like all the other aspects of the history of culture , its interest may be greatly enhanced by judicious illustra - tion .

		The history of literature is apt to be dry stuff at best , unless illuminated at many points by light from the well-stored mind of the read - er , and every device should be welcomed that tends to make it inherently attractive .

		This principle has long been given practical recog - nition by the European writers in this field , and nearly every nation of the Continent has produced a richly illustrated history of its lit - erature , supplementing a scholarly text with a great variety of pictorial adornment .

		Books of this class have been of incalculable benefit in popularizing literary study , and they have ac - complished their purpose in a strictly legitimate way , without lapsing unworthily from the dignity of their theme .

		A work of this type , dealing with the fifteen hundred years of English literature , has long been desirable , and it is a wonder that we should have had to wait until the
twentieth century	DATE	for its performance .

		Such a work is at last in pro- cess of publication , undertaken by competent hands , and we give it the most cordial welcome .

		There are to be four volumes altogether , the first of them , extending from the Old English period to the time of
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, being the work of Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	.

		The remaining three have been entrusted to Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's volume , and the second of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's three , covering the period from
Milton	LOCATION	to
Johnson	PERSON	, are already at hand ; the two others are promised for autumn publication .

		For this praiseworthy enterprise Mr.
William Heine	PERSON	- mann is primarily responsible , and the publica - tion for the
United States	LOCATION	is in the hands of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The mechanical execution of the work is sumptuous , and in beauty of typo - graphy and illustration the volumes leave little to be desired .

		They are open to criticism only on account of their extreme bulkiness , which results from the use of heavy glazed paper al - most as thick as cardboard .

		We believe that the publishers would have been well-advised to use paper of half the thickness , and to present the work in two volumes instead of four .

		Among the illustrative features of this work , portraiture naturally occupies the place of first importance .

		For the earlier centuries of the history , this material is of course meagre and of doubtful authenticity , but from Chaucer on - ward we have portraits in abundance , although there must remain serious gaps in complete - ness all the way through the Elizabethan period .

		When we come to the age of
Milton	PERSON	and the
eighteenth century	DATE	, there is no serious lack of material , and the third volume presents us with a superb series of plates in process and photo - gravure that are a delight to the eye .

		The lack of portrait interest in the first volume is , however , more than compensated for by the use of manuscript facsimiles , many of them illuminated .

		The richest treasures of the muse - ums and libraries have been drawn upon for these reproductions .

		Autograph letters are also reproduced in great numbers , and pages of holograph illustrating the choicest examples of our literature .

		Title-pages of historical interest and old wood-cuts are also supplied in great profusion .

		The homes of authors , the places associated with them , and the many buildings and monuments that have a quasi-literary in - terest are pictured for us by hundreds .

		Such things as coins , seals , effigies , old bindings , and musical scores are not neglected .

		There are also a number of illustrations of the mod - ern imaginative type , such as a page from the
Keltnscott Chaucer	PERSON	, and
Stothard	PERSON	's picture of the
Canterbury Pilgrims	ORGANIZATION	.

		In short , nothing seems to have been omitted that could in any way lend itself to the illustration of this aspect

		THE DIAL of history , and help to make vivid the lives , the personalities , and the surroundings , of the men whose names are remembered in our literature .

		Of the accompanying text , we may say briefly that it is competent and pleasing .

		Both Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	are graceful writers , and neither of them is now dealing for the first time with his material .

		Three sizes of type are used ; the largest for the running commentary which is the substance of the work , a smaller size for the biographies , and one still smaller and closer for the extracts .

		These extracts are well-chosen and typical , but do not encroach too bulkily upon the narrative and descriptive text .

		The plan of the text as a whole has a balance and a proportion that have evidently been carefully studied , and to which no serious exception can be taken .

		In this general account , we do not wish to indulge in microscopic criticisms , of which many might doubtless be made .

		We are too glad to wel - come the history to be captious regarding mat - ters of minor detail .

		This work is evidently one that no gentleman 's library should be without , and we fancy that even
Charles Lamb	PERSON	would have excepted it from his general ex - communication of such works .

		WHAT IS A `` BUCKO MATE '' ?

		Referring to Mr.
Albert Sonnichsen	PERSON	, whose '' Deep Sea Vagabonds '' was noticed in The Dial of
June 16	DATE	, page 407 , your reviewer says that '' the author had the wit to avoid American merchantmen and their bullying bucko mates . ''

		As the word '' bucko '' is not recognized either in the `` Century '' or the '' Oxford '' Dictionaries , will your reviewer kindly explain exactly what it means ?


Albert Matthews	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	,
June 21 , 1903	DATE	.

		-LSB- The word '' bucko , '' as applied to the mates of American merchant vessels who are distinguished for fighting qualities in the handling of their crews , is used freely in all recent works dealing realisti - cally with deep-sea voyaging , written by American authors , Messrs.
Paul Eve Stevenson	PERSON	,
Morgan Rob	PERSON	- ertson , and
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	among them .

		It is not found in any of the standard dictionaries , and a conjecture may be risked that it is an adaptation of the word `` buck , '' used in the sense of dandy , -- very much as the word `` dandy '' is itself used colloquially .

		We have heard it in the mouths of Irishmen , -- '' Ah , me fine bucko , '' '' He 's the bucko lad for me , '' etc. , -- in what seems to be precisely this significance The Reviewer . -RSB-

CHARLES LiAMB	PERSON	.

		*
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's humor is not exactly of a sort to shake the midriff of despair with laughter ; it is better than that , -- it is gentle , pensive , pervasive , sometimes pathetic , and never leaves in the reader that feeling of a slight loss of self-respect which is apt to follow outbursts of more demonstrative merriment .

		This mirth that cheers but not inebriates is not so com - mon that we can afford to lose any hitherto neglected or unrecognized specimens of it that may have made their appearance anonymously or pseudonymously in
Elia	LOCATION	's lifetime .

		It was partly to rescue from the pages of '' The
London	LOCATION	Magazine '' such unsigned or falsely signed productions of the gentle humorist , that Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	undertook the compilation of his `` Sidelights on
Charles Lamb	PERSON	. ''

		The revival of an interest , never really dormant , in the inimitable
Elia	LOCATION	, is attested by the prepar - ation now in progress of a new biography and of a new and more nearly complete edition of his letters ; and it is this interest that must excuse , if excuse be necessary , a somewhat extended notice of a small and unpretentious , but scholarly , sympathetic , and entertaining volume on Lamb and his circle .

		Though '' Elia '' was Lamb 's recognized signature to most of his ''
London	LOCATION	Magazine '' articles , yet a few of his acknowledged con - tributions to that periodical were either anony - mous or otherwise signed .

		By diligent search Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	seems to have found eleven ad - ditional pieces that Lamb may at least be strongly suspected of writing .

		If he did not write them , or some of them , he ought to have done so .

		What could be more in the vein of the creator of Mrs. Battle than the following from '' A Hint to Whistplayers '' ? ''

		I can put up with an occasional bad card-hand , as Job-like as anyone .

		A sorry , solitary deuce of trumps , now and then , does not put me beside my tenour .

		I can go trumpless even once , twice , or thrice , without an im - precation .

		-- I can sort , without pouting , some thirteen rabble-cards , and endure , as heroically as
Brightelm	PERSON	- stone tradesfolk , a temporary privation of king and court favour It would be strange if the losses and crosses I have suffered in human dealings , had not taught me philosophy to endure any reasonable pro- portion of Whist adversity .

July 1	DATE	, tell over a beggarly account of pips .

		... To judge from our faces , -- 't is a drawn game , -- a fourfold dis - appointment -- but Whist , as the world knows , is in - capable of such lame and impotent conclusions . '

		Two , ' ■ ays Mrs. Battle , the eloquent encomiast of Whist , • two are exalted -- two again are mortified ' -- but it would puzzle a disciple of Lavater to say which was which at the close of our melancholy rubbers .

		As far as physi - ognomy goes , the winners protest that they would as lief have foregone the double points , and the money .

		-- They have not achieved success , but had it thrust upon them . ''

		Besides ferreting out , with much critical acumen , articles by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, or very much in his manner , Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	has brought to light many pieces , in prose and verse , relating to him .

		In '' An Evening with
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , '' contributed by '' S. Y. '' to `` The Monthly Repository '' soon after
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's death , a bit of personal description is of especial interest .

		`` The character of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's person was in total contrast to that of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		His strongly marked , deeply lined face , furrowed more by feeling than age , like an engraving by
Blake	PERSON	, where every line told its separate story , or like a finely chiselled head done by some master in marble , where every touch of the chisel marked some new attribute .

		Yet withal there was so much sweetness and playfulness lurking about the corners of the mouth , that it gave to the face the ex - traordinary character of flexible granite .

		His figure was small even to spareness .

		It was as if the soul within , in its constant restless activity , had worn the body to its smallest possibility of existence .

		There was an equal amount of difference in his conversation from that of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, as there was in his person .

		It was not one uninterrupted flow , but a periodical production of sentences , short , telling , full of wit , philosophy , at times slightly caustic , though that is too strong a word for satire which was of the most good-natured kind ... The perfect simplicity , absence of all conceit , child-like enjoyment of his own wit , and the sweetness and benev - olence that played about the rugged face , gave to it a charm in no way inferior to the poetical enjoyment derived from the more popular conversation of his friend . ''

		Will Lamb 's admirers be more shocked or amused to learn that he once sat in the stocks ?

		As the malefactor himself scrupled not to make `` copy '' of the experience -LRB- see '' Delamore 's Con - fessions '' in the third volume of '' Blackwood '' -RRB- he evidently wishes us to smile with him at its ludicrous features .

		He protests that his punish - ment , which lasted `` but for a pair of minutes or so , '' was '' for a thing of nought -- a fault of youth , and warmer blood -- a calendary inad - vertence I may call it -- or rather a temporary obliviousness of the day of the week -- timing my Saturnalia amiss . ''

		Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, au - thor of the forthcoming life of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, assures Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	that the essayist 's pseudonymous and playful account of this little affair is sub - stantially true ; that evidence exists of his hav - ing once sat in the stocks ; but that the punish - ment was probably as much a jest on the part of those ordering it as was the untimely merri - ment by which it was provoked .

		The well-known '' Reflections in the Pillory '' is doubtless a fur - ther literary result of this madcap adventure ; and thus we have the Bumbles to thank for two most characteristic examples of Elian humor .

		A last , and best , quotation shall be from '' The Monthly Repository , '' on the character of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, as '' minuted down from the lips of the late
S. T. Coleridge	PERSON	. '' ''


Charles Lamb	PERSON	has more totality and individuality of character than any other man I know , or have ever known in all my life .

		In most men we distinguish be - tween the different powers of their intellect as one being predominant over the other .

		The genius of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is greater than his talent , though consider - able .

		The talent of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	is greater than his genius , though respectable ; and so on .

		But in
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	it is altogether one ; his genius is talent , and his talent is genius , and his heart is as whole and one as his head .

		The wild words that come to him sometimes on religious subjects would shock you from the mouth of any other man , but from him they seem mere flashes of fireworks .

		If an argument seem to his reason not fully true , he bursts out in that odd desecrating way : yet his will , the inward man , is , I well know , profoundly religious .

		Watch him , when alone , and you will find him with either a Bible , or an old divine , or an old English poet ; in such is his pleasure . ''

		The allusion to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's wild words on reli - gious subjects recalls his stuttering reply to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's expression of surprise at the pro- digality and intensity of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's utterances on religion . ''

		Ne -- ne -- never mind what
Cole	PERSON	- ridge says , '' was Lamb 's tranquillizing response ; '' he 's full of fun . ''

		To correct a very common error of pronunci - ation , it may not be amiss to give here once more Lamb 's phonetic spelling of the mispro - nounced word .

		In a letter to
Taylor	PERSON	the pub - lisher , having occasion to refer to
Elia	LOCATION	, he perenthetically adds , '' Call him Ellia . ''

		One word of criticism on Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's book .

		Its compilation is a little careless .

		One page or chapter is made to correct or supplement a pre - ceding , at the cost of compactness and orderli - ness ; and the author -LRB- or printer -RRB- observes no rule in the use of small type , sometimes putting quoted extracts in fine print , but oftener not .

		The `` sidelights , '' too , occasionally throw their rays somewhat farther outside the circle of which
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	is the centre than might seem de - sirable ; but they at least well illustrate the rich - ness of unsuspected material lying hid in the musty pages of old magazine files .

		THE DIAL 9
America	LOCATION	's Place in History .

		* More than a passing mention is the just desert of a book of less than 300 pages , in which Mr.
William Justin Mann	PERSON	suggests , without taking the time or space necessary to develop fully , the position of ''
America	LOCATION	in its Relation to the Great Epochs of History . ''

		The epochs during the short life of our republic which the author characterizes as '' great '' are designated by the dates
1492	DATE	,
1620	DATE	,
1788	DATE	, and
1850	DATE	, -- the first-named being the era of the Discovery of
America	LOCATION	; the second , that of the Settlement of our States ;
1788	DATE	standing for the era of the establishment of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	and the preparation of its forms of Constitution ; and
1850	DATE	, not so much in the matter of a date as in that of an epoch , representing the trial of those constitutional forms by the Civil War and the political struggles preceding it .

		These several landmarks in American history are shown to be very largely correlated with those which point us to the leading and crucial phases of modern history in general .

		It is not alone political , but scientific , literary , and commercial history which are here illustrated .

		World - movements are those to which the commen - tator 's attention is directed ; the races of mankind are blended into one family ; the welfare , the interests , and the progress of all are interdependent ; and the growth , the rights , the privileges , and the liberties of any one race , or of any one political section of humanity , can not but affect and influence the mass .

		To illustrate the part which
America	LOCATION	has played , at each one of the great epochs of her own history , in accomplishing results beneficial to all other political aggregations in the world , and thus to show forth her relative place among these other aggregations , is the object of the thesis which this author has assigned to him - self .

		What
John Fiske	PERSON	soberly postulated as the '' Manifest Destiny '' of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Mann	PERSON	now seeks more particularly to elu - cidate , with some specifications .

		Yet within the space he has undertaken to occupy , he has necessarily confined himself to a generalization , that disappoints the hearty interest which his treatment of his thesis awakens .

United States	ORGANIZATION	has found the opportunity to discharge its political mission , is recognized by the author as the coming form of govern -

		mental operations in all systems which have any assurance of success .

		This proposition is advanced by him , time and again , in these pages ; yet there is no distinct portion of the thesis which seeks to elaborate the proposition .

		Four of the chapters of the small book are devoted respectively to the four epochs above named , and the fifth and last expounds the '' Correlations '' between the aspects of Amer - ican experiences and those of general history , during each of those epochs .

		At least one reader would have been pleased , had an addi - tional chapter undertaken to trace , throughout the entire calendar of these four epochs , the office , the usefulness , and the political mission of the wonderfully successful principle of
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration .

		To deprecate the fashion of pompous glori - fication of
America	LOCATION	by our own people is not to belittle or minimize the value of commen - taries , such as this one , upon the salient facts of our political progress .

		A sane and studious investigation of the facts of our history , a hum - ble acknowledgment of their exceeding im - portance , and a calm inquiry into their place in the greater history of the human race , -- these are among the simple duties of those patriots who properly appreciate the privileges of their American citizenship .

		It is time that inquiries such as these should be propounded with dignity and examined with sincerity .

		A new understanding of American history is promised to the people of this country , and a higher appreciation of their political duties will follow .

		The study of our history will proceed along new lines in our colleges and schools , and will weave its new .

		fascinations around the intellects of their students .

		Several months ago , one of our Western universities announced that , in its presentation of the study of the history of the
United States	LOCATION	, it would aim '' to illustrate the place and office of this Republic in the arena of the world 's activities , and the relation of our history to the world 's progress . ''

		To the key-note thus sounded , this small but weighty thesis by Mr.
Mann	PERSON	gives a clear and distinct response .

July 1	DATE	, A Book of Entertaining Biographies .

		* Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	's '' Studies in
Contem	LOCATION	- porary Biography '' is one of the books to which the much abused adjective `` fascinating '' may properly be applied .

		Good biography is the most entertaining form of good literature , its only drawback being sometimes its portent - ous length ; and from this defect these sketches are of course free .

		They are , in fact , estimates of character which assume or give in barest outline the necessary personal information ; and their rounded brevity is not their least charm .

		Their greatest charm will be found in the penetration , the candor , the sympathy , and the literary skill of the writer .

		Anything that Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	may choose to write is sure to command the attention of all thought - ful Americans -- long since won for him by his '' American Commonwealth '' ; and these '' Studies , '' most of which have been separately published in the
United States	LOCATION	, will only add to the admiration felt in
America	LOCATION	for this at - tractive Englishman .

		There are twenty essays in the present volume .

		One of these is an estimate of an American by adoption , the late
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	; the other nineteen are devoted to eminent British and Irish statesmen , ecclesiastics , scholars , and men of letters , whose deaths fell within the years from
1881	DATE	to
1902	DATE	inclusive .

		The chronological order of the death-years is followed , except in the case of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	-LRB- died ls98 -RRB- , for whom the concluding and longest paper in the book is reserved ; possibly this was done to keep him as far as possible from
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, the subject of the opening sketch .

Robert Lowe	PERSON	-LRB- Lord

		A notable omission is
John Bright	PERSON	, whose death came in
1889	DATE	; we must conclude that this great man did not fall under the category sug - gested in the Preface , where Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	says : `` My aim has been rather to analyse the character and powers of each of the persons described , and , as far as possible , to convey the impression which each made in the daily converse of life .

		We shall not look for warmth in his estimate of Disraeli or
Parnell	PERSON	; nor fail to note it in his loving tribute to his friend Sidgwick .

		But his criticism is kind , though keen ; these were great men that he describes , and served their generation well ; and Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	is not the man to pick enviously at their laurels .

		In delivering his judgments , Mr.

		Himself a profound student and profound writer of history , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	might well be ex - pected to speak with special authority on the work of such men as
Edward A. Freeman	PERSON	and

		A master of style may be a worthless historian .

		We have instances .

		A skilful investigator and sound reasoner may be unreadable .

		The conjunction of fine gifts for investigation with fine gifts for exposition is a rare conjunction , which can not be prized too highly , for while it advances historical science , it brings historical methods , as well as historical facts , within the horizon of the ordinary reader . ''

		Americans will naturally turn with special interest to what Mr.

Edwin L. Godkin	PERSON	, the uncompromising editor of the '' Weekly Day of Judgment , '' as
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	used to call the

America	LOCATION	but in the world . ''

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's courage and independence are fully recognized ; his undeniable bitterness and oc - casional prejudice are not overlooked ; but his unique service in establishing a journal which did what '' The Nation '' has done for literature and politics is most emphasized in Mr.

		Aspects of Philosophic Thought .

		* The late Professor Sidgwick occupied a dis - tinctive place among modern thinkers .

		What he perhaps lacked in speculative subtlety , he more than atoned for by the singular sanity and fairness of his judgment , his admirable caution , and the firmness with which he held to the broad basal facts of common experience .

		After the pyrotechnic displays that character - ize some tendencies of recent thought , it is with a sense of relief that one turns to a writer who eschews paradox , has always a clear and defi - nite meaning to convey and conveys it in words that mean just what they say , and back of whose utterances one can always feel sure there is a weight of judicious and deliberate conviction .

		Professor Sidgwick represents the best tradi - tions of Common Sense in philosophy ; and this has at least certain advantages in a book intended , like his recent one on the Scope and
Relations of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, to form a general in - troduction to the study .

		The reader here finds himself within the range of familiar concep - tions ; he is not perplexed by over - subtleties at the start ; and the problems raised come home to him as real ones .

		The book has no adventi - tious attractions .

		It is a piece of solid and sober reasoning , with no graces beyond clear - ness and straightforwardness , and an occasional touch of dry humor which usually hits the mark very neatly .

		For example , the following sen - tence : '' The differences of philosophical schools are so fundamental that it would seem to be only by a polite fiction that a philosopher of one school allows a philosopher of another to possess philosophical knowledge on the sub - jects that he treats ; and the politeness that consents to this fiction is not universal . ''

		But one who surrenders himself to the interest of the problems with which the book deals , will find it both interesting and stimulating .

		Where the interest in philosophy can be presupposed , it is perhaps as good an introduction to general questions about the scope and relationships of philosophy as could be found .

		As a positive contribution , also , to philosophical thought , the value of the book is due primarily to the gen - * Philosophy : Its Scope asd Relations .

Hegel 's Logic	ORGANIZATION	.

		An Essay in Interpretation .

Professor of Logic	ORGANIZATION	in

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, eral sanity of its judgment , and the refusal to allow the demands of partial points of view , or of mere logic , to lead to conclusions that will not stand the test of an appeal to universal human convictions .

		Most philosophers , prob - ably , will not hold that in falling back upon common-sense dualism , the author has reached a finally satisfactory position .

		But in view of the wide-spread haziness in which the domi - nant tendencies have enveloped the relation of mind and the outer world , and the persistent juggling by which the real separateness be - tween them has come to be obscured , it is a service to have emphasized the actual position of our natural judgment in the matter .

		The book falls into two main parts .

		The first deals with questions about the general nature of philosophy , its problems and its delimitations .

		In this one would not expect to find much that is essentially new .

		The lines of distinction which it draws are , nevertheless , on the whole so simple and natural as at times to be really illuminating .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	and his conception of philosophy are in view pretty constantly in the discussion .

		The latter half of the book is , however , the most original and perhaps the most important part .

		It is a forcible argument against the extreme claims for the historical method , more especially in the form represented by the new dogmatism of the sociologists , where it is made all-sufficient , not simply as an account of the origin and practical utility of beliefs , but as a criterion of their truth as well .

		In vindi - cating the necessity of an independent philo - sophical criterion of truth , Professor
Sidgwick	PERSON	has performed a useful and needed piece of work .

		The enthusiasm for a new point of view has been the occasion of a plentiful lack of clear thinking , which has stood badly in want of a sober criticism such as Professor Sidgwick supplies .

		The general type of result which Professor Sidgwick represents is that of the philosophical development peculiarly associated with
Scot	PERSON	- land .

		In his work on '' Scottish Philosophy in its
National Development	ORGANIZATION	, '' Professor
Laurie	PERSON	, of the
University of Melbourne	ORGANIZATION	, has given a brief and readable account of the part that
Scotland	LOCATION	has played in the history of philo - sophical thought .

		The book was intended originally for the projected series , now aban - doned , which was to deal with philosophy in its various national developments .

		The present volume is sufficiently catholic in its selection of names , ranging from
Hume	PERSON	to Lord Mon - boddo .

		There is enough of the personal and biographical element to give an atmosphere , and the summaries are clear , well proportioned , and not too lengthy .

		The purpose is primarily historical , and the book does not , accordingly , have the interest of a positive contribution to philosophical criticism such as attaches to Pro- fessor
Seth	PERSON	's lectures on Scottish Philosophy .

		But as a brief historical survey , it satisfies essentially all the requirements of any save the special student of the period .

		The distinctively national philosophy -- that which is associated with the name of
Reid	PERSON	, and whose exposition in connection with its various representatives occupies over half the present volume -- has in recent years suffered a very general eclipse , although in our own country at least it was for some time the dominant tendency .

		Probably it never will get back more than a tithe of its former importance .

		It is lacking in the finer qualities of insight , and only the enthusiasm of the historian can prevent much of it now from being rather dreary reading .

		Neverthe - less it is quite possible we have not even yet learned all its lesson .

		There are worse things than Common Sense ; and the philosophy which affects to despise it is not wholly free from danger .

		The common-sense philosopher is a middle-man , who mediates between the more daring theorist , and the natural beliefs of man - kind which , after all , it is the business of thought to interpret , not to reject .

		And so long as the peculiar dangers of the speculative life exist , there will always be a function for him to fulfil .

		In Hegel we have what is commonly re - garded as the very opposite of the type of mind characteristic of a sober and common-sense philosophy , and between the representatives of the two temperaments there probably always will be war .

		It may be permitted to confess a certain sympathy with the mixture of despair , ridicule , and indignation , which is apt to be the feeling that results from the attempt on the part of at least the less persistent reader to get at the meaning of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's enigmatic utterances .

		There really is no sense , in this busy world , in making a thing harder than it needs to be .

		Hegel can scarcely be acquitted of the charge of going out of his way to say obscurely what could perfectly well have been made clear and intelligible .

		As a matter of fact , he shows himself quite capable of being intelligible when he chooses .

		He can hardly complain , therefore , if sometimes there arises in the mind of even a moderately sympathetic interpreter a sense of futility and weariness , and a question whether after all the game is worth the candle .

		In spite of this , however ,
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 the time has certainly gone by for dismissing
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	contemptuously as a mere charlatan or scholastic .

		That he has a distinct message , and that this has vitally influenced the thought of his century , it is impossible for the informed student to deny .

		The point of this message one may get in other ways than by going to
Hegel	PERSON	himself .

		But if he wishes to come into more direct contact with the fountain head , and has not the time or the inclination to study
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	at first hand , there is perhaps no better way than through Professor
Hibben	PERSON	's recent volume on the
Logic of Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is probably quite the clearest exposition for the less ad - vanced student that is available , -- one might almost say , the first clear exposition .

		In the Logic one may find the gist of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's positive contribution to modern thought .

		In so far as this stands for a complete philosophy , it has indeed aspects which may well be considered doubtful .

		But this does not affect the value of the main insight which it represents , an in - sight which is by no means so far removed from a true empiricism as is popularly sup - posed .

		Professor
Hibben	PERSON	makes no attempt to complicate the matter by raising questions of ultimate criticism .

		He gives , rather , an exposition and commentary , following very closely
Hegel	PERSON	himself in his more lucid mo - ments .

		The task is done with a high degree of success .

		The book does not pretend to be written for scholars , and exception might be taken to some of its interpretations .

		Nor , of course , as an elementary exposition , are all the parts equally perspicuous .

		But taking it as a whole , the reader ought to be able to get from it a good notion of the spirit of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's thought , and a possibility of estimating something of its value as a tool for attacking the perplexities in - volved in any attempt to understand the world .

		This more permanent form has an additional ad - vantage , for the letters of the German literat - teur are here given in the original language as well as in translation , and one may thus appre - ciate more fully some of the subtle phrases which are not perfectly Anglicized .

		The friend - ship which these few letters attest was frank and strong in interchange of sentiments as well as in philosophic reflections .

		Though the pages are not many , the reader carries from them many a vivid impression of the personality of the German scholar and not a few rare glimpses into unfamiliar phases of
Emerson	LOCATION	's nature .

		His geniality and sympathy found frequent utterance in the letters to the distant philoso - pher-historian and his more effusive , gifted wife
Gisela von Arnim	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Holls	PERSON	has written briefly , in the Intro - duction , of the circumstances which permitted the printing of these letters , -- the suggestion made to him by
Grimm	PERSON	a few days before the sudden death of the German author in
June , 1901	DATE	.

		To the last he retained his devotion to the memory and writings of
Emerson	LOCATION	, to the spiritual tonic therein , -- * ' but when I read his sentences again , the magic breeze seemed to touch my heart anew ; the old worked-out machinery -LRB- Getriebe -RRB- of the world seemed to be freshened up , as though I had never felt such pure air . ''

		The correspondence which began with a letter from
Grimm	LOCATION	in
April , 1856	DATE	, expressing gratitude for personal inspiration from
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays and humbly proffering some of his own essays and poems , was con - cluded by a letter from
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	in
December , 1871	DATE	.

		Scattered among sentences of deep thought and literary insight , called forth by the his - torical essays of
Grimm	LOCATION	,
Emerson	PERSON	interspersed an occasional word of familiar and affectionate regard : -- '' Come and see our quiet river , and its skiffs , our woods and meadows , in this little town , whose chief contribution to the public good is , that every farmer sends milk and wood to
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Again , he concludes a long letter of appreciative comment upon the writings of
Grimm	PERSON	and the dramas of his wife , with the hearty remembrance , -- '' Yet it is not books , but sense and sympathy , which I wish to offer you . ''

		Grimm 's '' Life of Michelangelo '' gave Emerson special pleasure .

		In acknowledging a copy of it to its author , he well expressed his own literary characteristics : '' The book has 14 THE DIAL .

		I hate circular sentences , or echoing sentences , where the last half cunningly repeats the first half , -- but you step from stone to stone and advance ever . ''

		It is a cause of congratulation to American readers of to-day that
Emerson	PERSON	's centenary finds a few of his younger contemporaries still active in literary work , and ready to contribute , in varied , sincere expressions , their personal memories and recognition of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's influ - ence upon their own generation .

		From
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, Professor
Norton	PERSON	, Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, Mr.
Conway	PERSON	, and others , have come graphic in - cidents and strong testimony .

		Among the youth who sacrificed much to follow the independent and progressive thought of
Emerson	LOCATION	was the Rev.
John Albee	PERSON	.

		Two years ago he pub - lished a volume of '' Remembrances of Emer - son , '' and this is now reprinted in recognition of the theme of the hour .

		A chance talk with
Emerson	PERSON	, or a walk by his side , has given nucleus for many an elaborated sketch during these months of search for some new word or impression about his personality .

		`` A Day with
Emerson	PERSON	, '' in
1862	DATE	, affords the author material for a chapter of rare interest .

		The happy hours spent in the
Emerson	LOCATION	home , where Thoreau uttered keen and combative ideas on college education and literature , and '' in the evening devoted himself wholly to the children and the parching of corn by the open fire , '' are recalled with tender gratitude .

		In addition to the scattered impressions of that first visit , Mr.
Albee	PERSON	has two chapters of reflection and interpretation , -- ''
Emerson	PERSON	's Influence on Young Men '' and ''
Emerson	PERSON	as Essayist . ''

		In tracing the unequalled influence of Em - erson 's lectures and essays upon the youth of his own time , Mr.
Albee	PERSON	expresses many ac - cepted truths with new vigor and personal em - phasis .

		Quoting
Emerson	PERSON	's words in a letter to
Miss Peabody	LOCATION	, -- `` My special parish is young men inquiring their way in life , '' -- he further pictures the dominant leadership of the new master : '' I see
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	at our head , leading his extraordinary collection of boys ; some overbold and opinionated , others facile and docile ; some with long locks , poetic and melancholy ; others eager to apply literally and at once to all existing evils the Emersonian remedies .

		The master has hard work to keep us in order , but he allows a considerable lati - tude and idiosincracy , and is overflowing with confidence in our future .

		At last he leads us smiling to the seat of the Muses , and introduces us as worthy of the palm , the oak , the olive , or more humble parsley . ''

		The methods of pre - paration , the wide range of themes , '' the ex - cursive mind , '' the beauties and enigmas of form in
Emerson	LOCATION	's Essays , are studied in outline ; and in summary the author has well phrased their characteristics : '' The Essays contain the harvests of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's lifetime ; plain food for daily life , rare fruit and dainties for life 's holi - days .

Scribners	ORGANIZATION	.

		Americans may well be proud to claim her as their fellow-country - woman by birth .

		She is a daughter of the late
Charles King	PERSON	, president of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	from
1849	DATE	to
1864	DATE	, a sister of Captain
Charles King	PERSON	, and a granddaughter of
Rufus King	PERSON	, our second minis - ter to
England	LOCATION	under the Constitution .

		From the last-named she appears to have inherited her apti - tude for the duties of her high station , and it seems the most natural thing in the world that she should enjoy something like intimacy with the English royal family and be on the best of terms with noble and distinguished personages the world over .

		Her let - ters , written to members of her family , are dashed off amid the hurry of diplomatic functions , and record freshly and vividly the impressions of the moment .

		They thus have a value that no premeditated records could possess .

		They date from
1883	DATE	to
1900	DATE	, and give us , among other lesser matters , excellent ac - counts of the coronation of

		The male reader notes with approval the writer 's occasional superiority to these unessentials , and her good-humored indifference when she finds herself not quite correct in some matter of dress or equipage or attendance .

		The suc - cess of Mr.
Edwin M. Bacon	PERSON	's '' Historic Pilgrim - ages in

Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein our old friend
Percy Denison	PERSON	, '' grown from a handsome lad into a manly youth , '' is pi - loted by the author over much the same ground as in the earlier volume , but with a different end in view .

		One is inclined to question whether anything is gained by adopting this Rollo-book plan .

		The fictitious
Percy	PERSON	is created only for younger readers , and they are the very ones to detect the fraud im - mediately and to refuse to have anything to do with a book that begins as a story and straightway turns out to be '' improving reading . ''

		To them this '' fine type of the high-bred American youth of to - day '' will seem an insufferable prig , with his
Gargan	PERSON	- tuan appetite for literary items .

		It is , then , we think , in spite of , and not because of , the manner of presentation adopted , that the genial author suc - ceeds in making his matter so interesting .

		Elimi - nate
Percy Denison	PERSON	and let the book stand simply for what it is , a series of well-informed chats on literary
New England	LOCATION	, and the work would be by so much improved .


Massachusetts	LOCATION	, of course , claims the most space ;
New Hampshire	LOCATION	is represented by

Portland	LOCATION	and
Brunswick	LOCATION	in
Maine	LOCATION	receive attention ; and the
Nutmeg State	ORGANIZATION	has considerable of interest to offer in
Hartford	LOCATION	and
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		The Green Moun - tain
State	ORGANIZATION	and Little Rhody are left out in the cold .

		A map of
New England	LOCATION	and more than one hundred and fifty illustrations , including portraits of varying excellence , and a few facsimiles of manuscript , add to the book 's attractiveness and value .

		The nickname , `` Everybody 's Bishop , '' BUh ^ ^ * be8towed on the lat e
Bishop Westcott	PERSON	, was fairly descriptive of his warm and generous nature , and of his liberal unsectarian atti - tude in all matters pertaining to his calling .

		He is perhaps best known to the general reader as the co - editor , with Dr.
Hort	PERSON	, of the authoritative edition of the
Greek New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , brilliant as was his scholarship , he expresses a positive distaste for the very sort of work he has so admirably performed in textual criticism , affording apparently an ex - ceptional instance of a man 's doing well what he heartily dislikes .

		He was two large a man to find refreshment and inspiration in the study of Greek enclitics .

		His work as a writer was devoted chiefly to Bible studies , and he made himself recognized as an authority on the writings of
St. John	ORGANIZATION	.

		Seven pages of his biography are filled with the titles of his published works . ''

		Build solidly and do n't stuff up holes with putty , '' was his advice to his son
Arthur	PERSON	, who has acted as his biographer ; and most faithfully and lovingly has he performed his self - imposed task .

		He wisely leaves his father to tell his own story , in large measure , in his letters .

		They convey the impression of an earnest , ener - getic , reverent nature .

		An important service ren - dered by
Bishop Westcott	PERSON	, outside his proper field of work , was his mediation between miners and mine-owners , eleven years ago , to settle a strike , -- a service that he performed to the hearty satisfac - tion of both parties .

		Although the workmen had their wages reduced by ten per cent. , they cheered him until they were hoarse .

		Among his other ac - complishments ,
Westcott	PERSON	was unusually skilful as a draughtsman , as is made evident by a number of bis sketches reproduced in the Life .

		He also made his mark as a mathematician -LRB- as well as in the classics -RRB- at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		He was an all-round scholar and a large-souled man , and his life is well worth studying .

		The biography is published in substantial two-volume form by the

		_ A .

		published a book on Italian art of such importance that it deserves to be brought to the attention of all lovers of Medieval and
Renais	PERSON	- sance painting .

		The first portion -- 150 pages -- is written by Mr.
William Hey	PERSON	wood , well known as an authority on the history , the life , and the customs of old
Siena	LOCATION	.

		His chapters are the result of many years of research , and are a marvel of compact in - formation , as well as a necessary preparation for the second part .

		This part -- practical and artistic -- is written by Miss
Lucy Olcott	PERSON	, a serious art - critic in her own right , who has enjoyed through - out the preparation of her work the personal aid of the best authorities on the subject , Mr.
F. Mason Perkins	PERSON	and Mr.
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	.

		The intro - ductory essay , on the Architecture ,
Sculpture	ORGANIZATION	, and Painting of the city , brings out the charm of this comparatively neglected subject ; while in the practical part , where Miss
Olcott	PERSON	takes the readers through the streets , or guides them in the churches or galleries of
Siena	LOCATION	, she is as accurate as she is suggestive .

		The uninitiated will not realize the amount of special and valuable information this lit - tle book contains .

		In dealing with the works of art , it does not retail uncertain legends as facts , but gives in attractive form the latest results of modern scientific criticism , and this not as an end in itself , but as a means toward the greater under - standing and appreciation of a charming school of 16 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Moreover , the author is certainly the first writer of a guide-book to give due prominence to the hitherto neglected quattrocento painters and sculptors , to
Vecchietta	LOCATION	, to
Francesco di Giorgio	PERSON	, and to
Neroccio di Landi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not the least impor - tant part of the guide-book is the list of English works on
Siena	LOCATION	, with valuable critical comments on each .

		In a word , this is at once the most accurate and best informed guide to
Siena	LOCATION	, and a serious contribution to the history of art .

		The book is well printed , with type so clear and large that it is a pleasure to read it .


Horace Greeley	PERSON	once said of the oflAnein biographers of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, that many attempts had been made on the life of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, that of Booth being a little worse than some of the others .

		He had in mind the many persons who came in contact with the strong individuality of Lincoln and tried to meas - ure it by the usual yardstick .

		A picturesque and unusual character is always a good mark for anec - dotes .

		Lincoln has been selected by
William Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	, the well-known newspaper writer , as a fit subject for that ephemeral phase of composition known as `` true '' biography -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The volume is an indiscriminate collection of striking passages from
Herndon	LOCATION	,
Lamon	LOCATION	,
Nicolay	LOCATION	, Carpen - ter ,
Ben	PERSON	.


Perley Poore	PERSON	, and
McClure	PERSON	, interspersed with reminiscences and anecdotes probably culled from newspaper clippings .

		All the old Lincoln stories may be found here , regardless of the num - ber of times they have been denied or disproved .

		Douglas still arrives with the
thirty-seven cents	MONEY	, and
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is still after `` bigger game '' in the sena - torial debates .

		This newspaper method of writing biography does no particular harm except to the feelings of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's ultra admirers .

		Indeed , it is quite readable .

		But the present volume is marred by those inexcusable errors of haste which unfortu - nately characterized a previous '' true '' biography from this writer .

		For instance , to say that the compromise on the admission of
Missouri	LOCATION	forbade slavery `` north of its northern boundary , 36 ° 30V is to mislead .

		Even the few lines in the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	which prohibited slavery in the Territory can not be quoted correctly .

		Many other things will be disputed , where the author turns from story - telling to statements .

		Long since it would seem that Americans had abandoned the ground that
England	LOCATION	's proclamation of neutrality in
1861	DATE	`` practically recognized the Confederate States as an independent government and conceded it the privileges of a belligerent power . ''

		Under the thin disguise of editorship , TaZuu ^ ^ Mr -
George Gissing	PERSON	has collected , in `` The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , musings on life and literature , with now and then a chapter on art or philosophy or religion .

		Introspective and retrospective , the book may be assumed to give , with some degree of faithfulness , glimpses of Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's own struggle with untoward conditions and his toilsome ascent from obscure hack-writership to successful author - ship .

		A sombre , almost depressing , tone is given to his pages by the persistence with which the au - thor emphasizes the harsh and repulsive features in tliis battle of life .

		A certain tendency to material - ism and selfishness in his philosophy shows the uses of adversity to have been to the writer less sweet than might have been wished . ''

		I think , '' he de - clares , '' it would scarce be an exaggeration to say that there is no moral good which has not to be paid for in the coin of the realm . ''

		And again : '' It is all very well to talk about doing moral good , in practice there is little scope or hope for any - thing of that kind in a state of material hardship . ''

		His strivings and aspirations begin and end with himself . ''

		For me , '' he does not hesitate to admit , '' it is a virtue to be self-centred ; I am much better employed , from every point of view , when I live solely for my own satisfaction , than when I begin to worry about the world . ''

		The semi-fictitious character of these confessions is betrayed by an oc - casional note that lacks the true ring .

		Hunger and weariness and other ills are dwelt upon with a little too much unction , a little too much of the literary artist 's delight in the cleverness of his workman - ship .

		Who , moreover , after spending half a life - time over books , would have eyes strong enough to finish reading
Walton	PERSON	's life of Hooker by moonlight , having begun it under the fading rays of sunset ?

		This ,
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	is represented as doing , sitting in his garden '' amid the evening scent of roses . ''

		What one likes best in this supposititious recluse is his passionate love of literature and learning , his almost equal delight in painting and music , and his abhorence of the meaningless conventionalities of polite society .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The lect - ures , six in number , are on the following topics : '' The Chinese Language , '' '' A Chinese Library , '' '' Democratic
China	LOCATION	, '' ''
China	LOCATION	and Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, '' ``
Taoism	LOCATION	, '' and `` Some Chinese Manners and Customs . ''

		It will be seen that these lectures do not comprise a systematic treatise on the subject-title of the book , but are somewhat desultory , although their value is by no means impaired by that fact .

		The first two sentences in the book naturally at - tract attention , and strikingly depict the massive - ness of Chinese civilization : '' If the Chinese people were to file one by one past a given point , the inter - esting procession would never come to an end .

		Be - fore the last man of those living to-day had gone by , another and a new generation would have grown up , and so on for ever and ever . ''

		That first chapter ,
China	LOCATION	and the Chinese
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 moreover , is a very clear though brief statement of the peculiarities of the Chinese language , especially the written language .

		The second chapter gives a good bird 's - eye view of the immense literature that a Chinese '' scholar '' must master before he is well equipped for his career . ''

		Democratic
China	LOCATION	'' is a vivid picture of the political and social conditions of the empire ; and the last chapter sets forth some of the peculiar manners and customs of the people .

		The chapter on ''
Taoism	LOCATION	'' is a very careful explan - ation of the doctrines of
Lao Tzu	ORGANIZATION	.

		Too is a word meaning '' Way , '' which appears to be sufficiently broad to include a great variety of speculations and superstitions .

		The most suggestive chapter , to some , is the one in which the lecturer makes some in - teresting comparisons between the civilizations of
China	LOCATION	and
Ancient Greece	LOCATION	, in which he makes this claim : '' Those mental gymnastics , of such impor - tance in the training of youth , which were once claimed exclusively for the languages of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, may be performed equally well in the Chinese language . ''

		The microbe plays an important rdle of Baeierioioyy .

		m ^ e ^ e ° * civilized nations to-day as the servant of man .

		The part that it has always played as man 's insidious and secret foe is being rapidly exposed , thanks to the unceasing labors of many investigators in our own and other lands .

		The pathogenic germ has found its place even in the fiction of the day , and its capa - bilities in this field are as yet but imperfectly real - ized .

		It is this pathogenic germ with which Mrs.
Percy Frankland	PERSON	is most concerned in her little volume on '' Bacteria in Daily Life '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The author outlines the birth and subsequent growth of the science of bacteriology in the Victorian Era , and then in the interesting chapters which follow she describes the sources of disease and death which lurk in the air , water , ice , milk , and other human necessities .

		The book is free from unnecessary technicalities , and is well written .

		It will make a valuable non-technical but reliable souree of infor - mation for the school and public library , because of its relative simplicity and directness .

		The sup - pression of germ diseases , such as typhoid fever and tuberculosis , will be much more feasible when people are fully aware of the possibilities and dan - gers of contagion which science has revealed .

		Books such as this are much needed to make possible the growth of social and individual responsibility in these matters of public and personal hygiene .

		Tovm-ii/ein The twelve volumes comprising the yew
England	LOCATION	`` Memoirs '' of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	after the Revolution .

		& TQ made up l argely of his diary .

		These memoirs have been for many years of para - mount value for writers and students .


J. Q. Adams	PERSON	's grandson ,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, now gives to the public an earlier portion of the diary under the cap - tion , `` Life in a
New England Town	LOCATION	, 1787-1788 '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		During these two years , young
Adams	PERSON	was a law student at
Newburyport	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, following the custom of days when law-schools were unknown .

		The diary for these years , portions of which have appeared from time to time in the publications of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, shows an earnest student , an - noyed sometimes by his fellow-readers , occasionally joining them in revels which leave a flagellating headache , and always taking a very serious view of young women and of life in general .

		For instance , this young man of twenty found himself opposed to the Federal Constitution as framed . ''

		My feelings , '' he wrote , `` upon the occasion have not been pas - sionate or violent ; and as upon the decision of this question I find myself upon the weaker side , I think it my duty to submit without murmuring against what is not to be helped . ''

		At another time , he was indignant because the men who participated in the
Shay	PERSON	's Rebellion were pardoned , while a man who stole silverware to the amount of twenty pounds was sentenced to death in the same courts .

		An exhaust - ive set of foot-notes explains each proper name .

		The volume is of value to those interested in
New England	LOCATION	genealogy and those seeking local color of the early days .

		Necessarily , political and public life is not touched upon to any extent by this young law-student .

		Writers on English versification are BngfuSLtr * .

		usually dogmatic , and sure that everybody else is hopelessly wrong .

		Indeed , one comparatively recent prosodist admitted at the outset that his views would hardly find ac - ceptance , and another only last year reprinted his magazine articles chiefly because they had fallen flat -- an unfair infliction upon posterity .

		Mr.
T. S. Omond	PERSON	's '' Study of Metre '' -LRB- Grant
Richards	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , however , appears in book form because the essays that compose it have already met with approval .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	has not been hasty in making his book ; he published an article on prosody so long ago as
1875	DATE	.

		Moreover , he is neither dogmatic nor revolutionary .

		He points out , much more clearly than anyone else thus far has done , how hopelessly misleading is our use in English of the terms of classic prosody .

		To be sure , when you read `` duple rising '' in the table of contents , it sounds rather strange , but after you have read his exposure of '' iambic , '' the new term sounds fairly satisfactory .

		The best of the book , fortunately , is constructive .

		The '' period , '' or foot , occupies a definite and regular space of time , which may or may not be completely filled by syl - lables .

		In `` duple rising '' measure , for instance , you may have from one to three syllables in each period , with indefinite variations of stress , accent , and pitch .

		It is true that this explanation leaves the individual to think as he pleases about the rela - tive importance of a good many things , and in that respect it seems to dodge the issue .

		The reviewer , however , can not help thinking that Mr.
Omond	PERSON	has come pretty close to the heart of the matter , and that he does not dodge any question of fundamental importance .

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, The Lone-Star Commonwealth .

		In the preface to one of the earlier volumes of the '' American Common - wealths '' series -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , it was asserted that '' the changes of sovereign as well as subordinate jurisdiction have been greater in
Michigan	LOCATION	than in any other part of the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can Union . ''

		The writer of that volume must have been forgetful of
Texas	LOCATION	, which was under the juris - diction successively of
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and both Im - perial and Republican Mexico , before becoming an independent Republic , preparatory to its admission to the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		And while
Michigan	LOCATION	of - fered an opportunity for a history of governments ,
Texas	LOCATION	and the exceedingly interesting train of events by which Latin institutions therein gave way at last to those of Anglo-Saxon origin present the best field upon the North American continent for a study of a contest of civilizations .

		It is such a study based upon history , rather than the history itself , that Prof.
George P. Garrison	PERSON	, of
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, has contributed to the above-named series , in his book on
Texas	LOCATION	.

		For the writing of the book he has had peculiar advantages in his access to the archives pre - served in the capital of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and he has made good use of the rich materials at hand .

		His style is crisp and clear , and he has presented the history of the
Lone-Star State	ORGANIZATION	in most readable form .

		If , however , the average Texan is disappointed in the author 's rather calm treatment of such heroic incidents as the slaughter of the Alamo defenders and the battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, and in his neglect of biographical details regarding the heroes of Texan history , many readers will be grateful to him for the sidelights he has thrown upon the whole course of a great commonwealth in its relation to the expansion of our territory to the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	and westward to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thomas Francis Moran	PERSON	is the author of a brief book on the '' Theory and Practice of the En - glish Government '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		In common with many similar publications , the purpose of the work is to present in condensed yet attractive form the general principles of government rather than exact details .

		The danger of such an attempt lies in its very generality , in the impossibility of accurate description where exceptions to general rules are not noted .

		Mr.
Moran	PERSON	has not escaped this danger , and in this respect his book is no better than its predecessors .

		On the other hand he shows himself gifted in clear , entertaining statement , and apt in historical illustration .

		His work is very readable , and if not regarded as a complete and authoritative analysis of English government -- and a claim to any such merit would probably be denied by the author -- should meet with general appreciation .

		The publication of Mr.
A. E. Galla	PERSON	- AubreTBel ` dley .

		tin ' 8 work entitled ``
Aubrey Beards	PERSON	- ley 's Drawings : A Catalogue and a List of Criticisms '' -LRB-
Godfrey A. S. Wieners	PERSON	-RRB- , shows that interest in that eccentric genius was something Principle * of the English Government .

		more than a passing fancy .

		The compiler has done his work well , and in his effort to be comprehensive has included miscellaneous reviews and even casual mention of
Beardsley	LOCATION	in books and periodicals .

		We note , however , the omission of any reference to the review by Mr.
Twose	PERSON	entitled ''
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	in Perspective , '' in The Dial of
June 16 , 1899	DATE	, and the communication called forth by it entitled '' A Reviewer out of Perspective , '' which appeared in the issue of
July 16 , 1899	DATE	.

		Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	's book is a handsome quarto printed on hand-made paper .

		It is illustrated with two portraits of
Beardsley	PERSON	, one of them a hitherto unpublished drawing by Mr.
Will Rothenstein	PERSON	.

		There are also several drawings by
Beardsley	PERSON	, one of which is also published for the first time .

		Professor
Hoffman	PERSON	, of
Union Col	ORGANIZATION	- pZfZogy .

		le 8f ' ha8 P ut i0X -RCB- h a 8ma11 book in which the sub-title , '' A Survey of the
Present Results of Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, with Special Reference to their Bearings upon the
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- ests of Every-day Life , '' is perhaps more significant than the main title , '' Psychology and Common Life '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The series of chapters set forth in a somewhat irregular fashion the relations of mind and body , the functions of memory and attention in health and disease , and culminate in a presentation of hypnotism , faith-cures , and the alleged phenom - ena of telepathy and clairvoyance .

		The data are accumulated with industry rather than with discre - tion ; and the fatal defect of the book is the absence of an illuminating and firm critical grasp of the status of present-day psychological discussion .

		The book is likely to catch the popular ear , but is as likely to mislead as to interest .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A volume of '' Discourses on War , '' selected from the writings of
William Ellery Charming	ORGANIZATION	, has just been published for the
International Union by Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a volume of peace literature in the series which already includes the work of
Jean de Bloch	PERSON	and the orations of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	.

		These works are published in substantial form , but at a merely nominal price , and are deserving of a very wide circulation .

		Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	contributes an elaborate and eloquent introduction , and the work of Channing which is thus prefaced is itself surprisingly applicable to the needs of the present day .

		The peace movement , now so rapidly growing , has had no abler exponent than this New En - gland divine of the early nineteenth century .

		`` Homophonic Conversations in English , German , French , and Italian '' is a small manual compiled and published by Mr.
C. B. Waite	PERSON	and Mrs.
C. V. Waite	PERSON	.

		The phrases included are such as bear a marked resem - blance to one another in all four of the languages , which accounts for the '' homophonic '' of the title .

		The following is an example : '' Let me see your assort - ment of books '' = ''
Lassen Sie	ORGANIZATION	mich Ihr Sortiment der biicher sehen '' = '' Faites-moi voir votre assortiment de livre 's '' = '' Mostratemi il vostro assortimento di libri . ''


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

Hammurabi Code	ORGANIZATION	.

		The

		Caesar ,

		Ainsworth 's '' Old Saint
Paul	PERSON	's '' is imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in the ''

		We have also

		Both volumes have flexible leather covers and are exceedingly attractive in execution .

		■ Humanities Gone and to Come , '' a Phi Beta Kappa address given by Professor
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	, is pub - lished in pamphlet form by the
University of Pennsyl	ORGANIZATION	- vania .

		The pamphlet also contains '' Ad
Astra	ORGANIZATION	, '' an ode prepared for the same occasion by Mr.
Francis Howard Williams	PERSON	.

		An announcement of especial timeliness and interest , in view of the recent tragedy in
Servia	LOCATION	, is a book of '' Famous Assassinations , '' to be published shortly by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will give accounts of some thirty of the most significant political assassinations in the world 's history .

		Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish in pamph - let form a stage version of
Browning	PERSON	's '' The Return of the Druses , '' arranged by Miss
Charlotte Porter	PERSON	.

		This commemorates the first performance of the tragedy '' on any stage , '' which was given by the
Boston Brown	ORGANIZATION	- ing Society on the 25th of
March , 1902	DATE	, and afterwards twice repeated .

		`` The Novels and Poems of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	'' are being reissued in a '' Library Edition '' by
Messrs. J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Four volumes are now at hand , two of them being '' Hereward the Wake , '' and the other two ■
Alton Locke	PERSON	. ''

		The special feature of this edition is found in the introductions to the several works , prepared by Mr.
Maurice Kingsley	PERSON	, the oldest son of the author .

		In the notice of Professor
Sargent	PERSON	's work on '' Trees and Shrubs , '' in our last issue -LRB- p. 406 -RRB- , an error of statement occurred which we are glad to correct .

		The statement that the new work supplements , and , when completed , will add two new volumes to , Professor
Sar	PERSON	- gent 's '' Silva of
North America	LOCATION	'' is incorrect ; for the work on `` Trees and Shrubs '' is quite independent of , and only in a general way supplementary to , the earlier work . ''

		The Silva of
North America	LOCATION	'' was originally planned for twelve volumes , but the discovery of new arboreal species during its publication made necessary two additional volumes , which , with the Index , were published late last Fall .

		Our notice confused these two volumes with the two parts of '' Trees and Shrubs '' now issued .

		An examination of the principles on which
Poe	PERSON	con - structed his metrical work will be made anew in a vol - ume of his critical writings , prepared by Mr.
Sherwin Cody	PERSON	, to be issued next Fall by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will contain a considerable number of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's best poems , but the greater part of it will be filled with selections from his critical writings , which , embodying as they do the principles that governed his own poetic compositions , ought to aid greatly in a study of his creative work .

		A growing interest in the work and influence of Wil - liam
Morris	PERSON	is indicated by the recent organization of the
Morris Society of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, with a general programme which provides for the dissemination of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's ideas by means of publications , a library and museum , and workshops and schools of design .

		The purposes of the society are chiefly educational , and relate to the social and artistic ideals of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
E. J. James	PERSON	is President of the society , and Prof.
Oscar L. Triggs	PERSON	its Secretary .

		Persons interested are requested to address the latter official , at 5634 Madison Avenue ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Two novelettes of real merit , even though they fall a little short of the author 's previous work , appear in a single volnme , by Mr.
Arthur Cosslett Smith	PERSON	, '' The Turquoise Cup '' and '' The Desert '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Each serves as a foil for the other , -- the former dealing with an Italian cardinal , an English nobleman , and a beauti - ful Irish girl ; while the latter concerns itself with the love of a caravan leader in the
Sahara	LOCATION	and a
Bedouin	LOCATION	maid whom her own father is selling into the most de - graded slavery .

		Both possess the charm of delicate material when delicately handled , the atmosphere be - ing admirably reproduced and the style clear and bold .

		That both depart a little from the ordinary convention , is rather in their favor under Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's treatment .

		NOTES 44 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 46 CHATTER ABOUT JANE .

		It is now more than twenty years since the death of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and nearly as many years since Fronde completed his publication of the nine volumes of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	biography , autobiog - raphy , and correspondence , that resulted from the discharge of the trust imposed upon him by his dead friend and master .

		The controversies excited by that publication constitute a memor - able episode in our literary annals , but one not altogether pleasant to remember , and certainly not deserving resuscitation , except under the plea of the strongest necessity .

		Unfortunately , although no such necessity has been proved to exist , the controversy is again upon us in all its former acrimony , and '' chatter about Jane '' bids fair to usurp the places hitherto held in quasi-literary discussion by the '' chatter about Harriet '' which once loomed up so unpleasantly in the foreground when the genius of the great - est of English lyric poets came up for discus - sion .

		The prime cause of the present offending was offered , a few weeks ago , by the publication of two volumes of '' New Letters and Memorials of
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		For this publication , Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	is responsible ; and to it Sir
James Crichton	PERSON	-
Browne	PERSON	has contributed an introduction which abuses Fronde with even greater virulence than was displayed by the bitterest of his antagonists in the early eighties .

		Since
Froude	PERSON	is as dead as
Carlyle	LOCATION	, the case has to be conducted by counsel on both sides , and the rebuttal in the present instance comes from the members of
Froude	PERSON	's family , taking the shape of the publication of certain manuscript matters left by the historian to provide for his personal vindication .

		With great self-restraint ,
Froude	PERSON	kept these matters unprinted , in spite of the attacks made upon him during his last years ; but his family has now thought it best to give them to the world .

		In a certain sense , their interest is petty -LRB- except for the patho - logical element -RRB- , but the attack upon
Froude	PERSON	has all along been characterized by pettiness of spirit , and the defense , if any were resorted to , must needs be in kind .

		30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, The underlying animus of the whole attack upon
Froude	PERSON	has been occasioned by the single fact that , in his portraiture of the man whom he so loved and honored , he employed the methods demanded by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's own grim hero ,
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	, and enjoined upon him by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's express behest .

		In a word , he painted the warts as well as the general con - tours of the visage .

		The sleek and decorous form of biography made no appeal to him , and his artistic conscience revolted from the methods of the easy hero-worship that idealizes its subjects out of all recognition .

		Unfortu - nately , his scholarly conscience did not keep pace with his artistic conscience .

		As a histo - rian , he was deplorably careless , and even wanton in his disregard for exactness of state - ment and quotation .

		We do not need to instance in support of this proposition the long list of inaccuracies in his transcription of the
Carlyle	PERSON	correspondence and memoirs ; it may be proved with equal certainty from almost any part of his other work , from his treatment of the archives at Simancas or of the letters of
Erasmus	LOCATION	.

		His defense on this point is inade - quate .

		He says of the
Carlyle	LOCATION	papers : '' I copied out the greater part of the ' Reminiscences ' myself .

		A large part of them I copied twice ; I had to work at them with a magnifying glass , and in many hundred instances I was at a loss to know exactly what particular words might be .

		My own hand is not a good one , and there was a further source of error in the printer 's reading of this . ''

		We may make some allowance for these condi - tions , but they do little to weaken the force of the charge that
Froude	PERSON	was constitutionally in - accurate in his scholarly habit , and that he re - sorted to an unjustifiable degree of license in all his dealings with documentary material .

		Admitting all this , we still believe that the attacks made upon him , both before and since his death , by the injudicious partisans of the Carlyles , have been unwarrantably unfair and brutal .

		The charge of inaccuracy , which is one thing , has been quite unjustifiably per - verted into the charges of sensationalism and treachery , which are wholly different matters .

		It is proper to protest against the method of relentless setting-forth and unsparing exposure in biographical writing ; but it is highly im - proper , when a man employs that method in all sincerity , to accuse him of making a de - liberate attempt to pull his subject from the pedestal .

		This accusation , indeed , carries its own refutation to those who read
Froude	PERSON	's frequently expressed admiration for his friend and teacher .

		`` Falsehood and concealment , '' he says , '' are a great man 's worst enemies ; such at least is the doctrine about the matter which I learnt from
Carlyle	LOCATION	himself . ''

		The man whose warfare upon shams was lifelong would have been the last to sanction a sham account of his own life , and there is abundant evidence that
Carlyle	PERSON	knew what he was doing when he placed his private papers in
Froude	PERSON	's bauds , to be made use of at his discretion .

		The following words , from the author 's state - ment now for the first time published , deserve to be pondered by those who have been hasty in their judgment . ''

		My book , if it is still to be condemned at present , will be of use hereafter .

		A hundred years hence , the world will better appreciate
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's magnitude .

		The sense of his importance , in my opinion , will increase with each generation .

		The unwillingness to look closely into his character will be exchanged for an earnest de - sire to know all which can be ascertained about him , and what I have written will then have value .

		It may not be completely correct , but it will have made con - cealment impossible , and have ensured that the truth shall be known .

		The biographies of the great men of the past , the great spiritual teachers especially , with whom
Carlyle	PERSON	must be ranked , are generally useless .

		They are idle and incredible panegyrics , with features drawn without shadows , false , conventional , and worth - less . ''

		It is peculiarly unfortunate that the
Carlyle	PERSON	controversy should have excited to such exces - sive partisanship almost everyone who has shared in it .

		It is amusing , but not altogether edifying , to read in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's prose of '' the eminent writer who chose to make his en - try into literary life under the self-selected name of Devilsdung , '' and for whom `` the com - paratively inoffensive designation of Coprostom or Cloacinus '' is suggested as not unbecoming , or in the same author 's verse to read of '' this dead snake , '' '' Let worms consume its memory with its tongue , The fang that stabbed fair Truth , the lip that stung Men 's memories uncorroded with its breath . ''

		But we prefer even this violence of invective to the shameful insinuations of Mr.
W. S. Lilly	PERSON	, who in a recent article suggests that
Froude	PERSON	wished above all else to make his biography a succes de scandale , and that '' the practicality of Judas covenanting for the thirty pieces of silver '' offers a fair parallel to the mean mer - cenary motives imputed to the biographer .

		This is all very distressing , and yet how typical it is of much that has been said and written about
Froude	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	since the publications that precipitated the controversy !

		It is obvious that neither fairness nor sanity is to be expected from the partisans of either camp when they indulge in such empty rhetoric .

		Sir James
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 Crichton-Browne has sinned heavily in again opening the flood-gates of this sort of intem - perate talk , and in personally adding to its muddy volume .

		The letters for which he stands sponsor have nothing that is essentially new to tell us about the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	, and he himself has for us nothing more convincing than stale re - petitions of the old abusive language for their literary executor .

		It would have been far bet - ter to let the whole matter rest where it was before .

		As it is , the facts which
Froude	PERSON	himself con - cealed , or at least obscured , have been brought into the light by the printing of his own self - vin - dication , hitherto kept from the public .

		While '' My Relations with Carlyle '' does not perform the impossible task of revealing patient and ac - curate scholarship beneath the impressionism of
Froude	PERSON	's literary methods , the pamphlet does make it clear that his portrait of
Carlyle	PERSON	was , if anything , softened in outline rather than made unduly harsh .

		It also makes clear the fact that
Froude	PERSON	suffered in silence during the last years of his life from calumnies that he might have refuted by a little plain speaking , but that he preferred to bear with dignity rather than re - veal certain matters intimately touching the re - lations of the Carlyles -- matters which , with all his hatred of concealment , he had yet thought it wise to suppress .

		The pamphlet also clears him completely of the accusation that he was in any way actuated by a sordid motive in his publication of the manuscript material left by
Carlyle	PERSON	so unreservedly at his disposal .

		But , although the net result of these new publications , on both sides , is to leave
Froude	PERSON	's reputation in better shape than it was before , we can not but regret their appearance .

		They have reopened the whole question of the ill - assorted Cheyne Row menage , and have given a renewed opportunity for vulgar persons , curi - ous in malicious gossip and petty personalities , to roll their tongues over the private affairs of the irritable
Thomas	PERSON	and the exasperating
Jane	PERSON	.

		Twenty years ago we were treated to more than enough of moralizing upon these unprofitable themes , and now the tongues are all set wag - ging again , and '' chatter about Jane '' is once more to the fore in conversation .

		It is a sad business , and the worst of it is that the affair seems more likely than ever before to become imbedded in the history of English literature , although everything essential to that history might very well be set down without so much as mentioning the fact that
Carlyle	PERSON	was married .

		We left

		We were blocked up by the ice in British Channel for fourteen days .

		We reached

		Querini was sent back by
Cagni	PERSON	while still within sight of
Prince Rudolph Island	LOCATION	.

		The weather was cold , but fine , dur - ing the following days , the ice was in contact with the coast , and everything was exceptionally favorable to his return .

		It is with great grief that I must suppose that his loss and that of his two men must have been caused by some accidental mishap .

		The steadfast cour - age and determination manifested by the leader of the sledge expedition and by all who composed it , in spite of immense hardships , assured its success , and acquired fresh glory for our country , by making its flag wave at the highest latitude which has hitherto been reached .

		All present are in excellent health .

		May your Majesty deign to accept the loyal homage of all the members of the expedition . ''

		This succinct report not only summarizes the actual deeds of the most successful of all polar expeditions , but between its lines may be read the sorrows and joys and varied personal experiences which humanize such an under - taking .

		Apart from the actual tragedy under - lying the total and unaccounted for disappear - ance of the three unfortunates of the first detachment , the manly surrender , by the Prince of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	himself , of all his longings to lead , when he learned , after repeated trials , that his frost-bitten hand incapacitated him for the task to which all his energies had for sev - eral years been directed , is quite the finest thing in the book .

		Yet it does not appear from any - thing he himself writes -LRB- and the first volume is wholly given up to his personal account of * he voyage and journey -RRB- that he took this de - privation much to heart .

		Indeed , if it were not known that he had shown the utmost possible courage , determination , and perseverance , in his mountain climbing , especially in his ascent of
Mount St. Elias	LOCATION	in
Alaska	LOCATION	, it might be pos - sible to think unworthily of his staying behind when confiding the lives of his subordinates to the pitiless rigors of the ice-pack .

		The Prince is free to ascribe much of his success to the counsels of Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	, who manifested in the most practical way his in - terest in the undertaking through a series of months while the preparations for it were in hand .

		The Prince 's own contribution to its success , indeed , lies chiefly in his selection of guides from the Val d'Aosta , men to whom snow and ice , in a form more difficult than the ice-pack ever presents , were affairs of daily life .

		The testimony of Commander
Umberto Cagni	PERSON	, whose personal narrative occupies two-thirds of the second volume , to the qualifications of his three companions in the attainment of their ambition , is unqualified ; and it may be hoped that all future explorers in the far North will be so fortunate as to provide themselves with equally useful and efficient aids to success .

		Though the Pole was not reached , the man - ner of carrying on the task prescribed the con - ditions for ultimate success .

		As will be seen from the summary , the plan of operations was for three several detachments to set forth at once , their joint and several tasks being thus outlined : `` The first detachment was to advance from
Cape Fligely	LOCATION	to the 85th parallel , carrying supplies to feed the entire expedition during the first stage of its march , and for its own food during its return to the ship .

		The second detachment was to go on farther to the north , up to the 88th parallel , with provisions for the rest of the expedition in its march to the north , and for itself when on the way back ; and , lastly , the third detach - ment was to advance from the 88th parallel to the
Pole	LOCATION	. ''

		The circumstances of the expedition of the Prince of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	, though fortunate in some respects , were by no means ideally fitted for the achievement of success .

		It is quite within the possibilities that another expedi - tion , similar in every respect , might have stood upon the spot men call the
North Pole	LOCATION	.

		It is quite within the possibilities that , even under the conditions here , had a fourth detachment been practicable to advance the final body somewhat farther , the Pole would have been attained .

		In any event , it is doubtful if there is anything more to be learned of the Arctic zone than has now been disclosed .

		Barely two hundred miles now separate man from this hardly profitable spot , the men of the `` Polar Star '' having surpassed those of the '' Fram '' by 20 ' , no more .

		This being true , it is the
South Pole	LOCATION	which remains to be conquered ; and if human energies and the desire for adventure are to be exhibited outside of the ordinary walks of life at all , who shall say that such trials and glories are not better than those of war or the subjugations of '' inferior '' peoples ?

		The company was composed of twenty men , eleven Italians and nine Norwegians , four from each nationality being officers .

		There was per - fect harmony and sacrifice of self for common ends on the part of both nationalities , widely differing in racial characteristics as they might be supposed to be .

		The exigencies of princely and naval etiquette forced the two classes to occupy different sleeping apartments and tables , but the accommodations and food were alike for all .

		Though less democratic in this respect than Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's arrangements , every -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 thing worked out satisfactorily , all hands joining in the festival days of both
Italy	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	, the differences of faith manifesting themselves not at all .

		It really seems to be true that one
Gino Gini of Acquapendente	PERSON	, an Italian cook picked up in
Norway	LOCATION	, showed no less straightforward courage in the perform - ance of his arduous daily tasks in and out of health than any member of the ship 's company .

		Interest naturally attaches to the diary of Commander
Cagni	PERSON	, and an extract from his diary on
April 24 , 1901	DATE	, the day when the highest latitude achieved by man was reached , is worthy a place here .

		He writes : '' We go out into the open air .

		The thermometer indicates -35 ° ; hut , nevertheless , I see , for the first time , the guides walking np and down after the soup .

		They are talking of their country !

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		led to extended preliminary studies in the great Slavery controversy , and the biography of Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	was finally postponed to allow the pre - paration of these two volumes .

		They were practically ready for the press when their au - thor died , leaving the original task unfinished .

		The portion which had been put into form was turned over to Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's son-in-law , editor
Charles R. Williams	PERSON	of '' The Indianapolis News , '' who has the biography now in course of active preparation .

		As this severed to some extent the close connection originally intended between the two works , certain por - tions of the '' History of Slavery , '' particularly those concerning President
Hayes	PERSON	, were turned over to Mr.
Williams	PERSON	for use in the biography .

		The manuscript has also received an addition in the form of a chapter on '' The Failure of Reconstruction , '' by
John J. Halsey	PERSON	,
Professor of Political Science in Lake Forest University	ORGANIZATION	.

		We understand , indeed , that the entire work has had the advantage of Professor
Halsey	PERSON	's scrutiny and suggestions , though there is not the recognition of this fact that one would naturally expect .

		In the Introduction , by Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, the distinguishing feature of the work is claimed to be '' the relatively smaller impor - tance attached by the author to sentimental agitations and agitators , and in the greater honor awarded to those who instead of bril - liantly saying things that alienated support soberly did things that compelled it . ''

		Nothing is easier than to throw stones at the man who gives his life to agitation for some neglected moral principle .

		The '' foe of compromise '' can never be a popular man , and as the reform for which he works is pretty sure to come , if at all , through channels not of his choosing , it is a very easy thing to overlook or deny his causal relation to its coming .

		To suppose , however , that ordinary political agencies would have emancipated and enfranchised the Amer - ican negro during the
third quarter	DATE	of the past century , or for many generations thereafter , without the preceding decades of fiery agitation by
Garrison	PERSON	and his kind , is to suppose what is contrary to human nature and experience .

		We are not sure , therefore , that Mr.
Reid	PERSON	might not better have said that the most conspicuous defect in the work is the author 's failure to appreciate the relative importance of the early Anti-Slavery agitators in building up an ele - ment of determined moral opposition to the system large enough to compel the attention of the masses and force the question into practical 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, politics , in spite of the efforts of machine poli - ticians to keep it out .

		The subject has been worked over too much to leave Mr.
Smith	PERSON	anything essentially new for these volumes .

		Occasionally we get a letter never before in print , -- as , for instance , a letter from
Richard Smith	PERSON	, of the
Cincinnati Gazette	LOCATION	, deploring the second candidacy of
Lincoln	LOCATION	; but it is always of a class already well known .

		The real value of the work lies in its massing together of so large a store of material not otherwise readily accessible .

		The author has not divested himself of partisanship , and yet he is open to a recognition of the better characteristics of lead - ers of the opposition , and to the faults of promi - nent Whigs and Republicans .

		The power of
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	as a debater receives due credit , as well as his sturdy and effective loyalty to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	at the outbreak of the war .

		The moral deficiency of
Webster	PERSON	's famous seventh of
March	DATE	speech is noted , and the incompetence and insubordination of
Fremont	LOCATION	's course in
Missouri	LOCATION	receives some attention .

		The deserved criticism of the War Department under
Bu	ORGANIZATION	- chanan , however , is not followed by a similar treatment of the glaring mismanagement and dishonesty which was rife in the same depart - ment during the early portion of the Civil War and compelled the retirement of
Simon Cameron	PERSON	from the Secretaryship .

		Professor
Halsey	PERSON	's chapter on '' The Failure of Reconstruction '' is a renewed exposition of the patent fact that the drastic legislation for the enforcement of the War Amendments did not prove able to secure the ends which its sup - porters in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the country had in view .

		He is convinced , and reasonably enough , that either the Congressional or the Presidential plan put in force without any serious clash be - tween the two would have secured much better results than were possible in the midst of the bitterness engendered during the struggle be - tween the President and the Republican major - ity in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great harm done by the '' carpet-bag '' rule which the poli - tical disqualifications of the Fourteenth Amend - ment and the Reconstruction acts made possible is fully recognized , and Hon.
Daniel H. Cham	PERSON	- berlain 's scathing record of this disgraceful episode in American history is referred to and heartily endorsed .

		In the light of subsequent history , one can - not read these volumes without continual cause to reflect upon the short-sightedness of our poli - tical vision .

		Our authorities rushed forward to annex
Texas	LOCATION	at the cost of a war , when we now know that a little waiting would have seen it fall into our lap with no outside opposition .

		Our people were wrought into frenzy over the Mexi - can accessions , -- the one party in fear , and the other in hope , that they might be filled with slaves , -- when we can now see that the Slavery interest was utterly powerless to colonize any material part of the territory in question , and was destined to remain so , even if Slavery itself had not been abolished when it was .

		Much blood , both good and bad , was spilled to decide the question whether
Kansas	LOCATION	should come into the
Union	ORGANIZATION	with a slave or a free constitution , though the backward glancing eye can now de - tect at once the certainty that the population was to be so overwhelmingly free as to be able to wipe Slavery out of existence at its will be - fore as many years should have elapsed as may be counted on one 's fingers .

		What shall be done to give us the clear insight , in the midst of our political struggles , that we may apply our energies to better purpose ?

China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	, and
Siam	LOCATION	, it was with the statement that their far-away people cherish no scheme of territorial aggrandizement in that region of the world , and that their only desire was to secure mutual benefit from the establishment of trade , and to extend the influence of Christian civ - ilization . ''

		This passage , taken from the last chapter of Mr.
John W. Foster	PERSON	's recent monograph on `` American Diplomacy in the Orient , '' states well the proposition which it has been his aim to sustain and illustrate in his book .

		By his extended public services as an official of the

		It is a timely supplement and companion to his his - torical sketch of two years since , '' A Century of American Diplomacy , '' which was at once accorded a high position .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 35 nized as peaceful in its general methods , scope , and operations .

		That it has been such from the beginning , has not been so fully under - stood .

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	carefully reminds his readers that the Oriental policy of national exclusion , which the western powers have had to com - bat , was of modern origin , but was in full operation when the
United States	LOCATION	, in
1783	DATE	, assumed a position among the commercial nations ; that this young State at once en - tered into the campaign for the opening of the closed Orient to trade , and in time became a leader therein ; and that we have waged peace - ful contests for such opening , in strong con - trast to the forceful operations of the European powers .

		That the ports of the Orient , which had been formerly open to free trade , were closed in the
seventeenth century	DATE	to the vessels of the western nations , was due to the aggressive and often vio - lent conduct of their
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	visitors .

		Seclu - sion became the fixed policy of the leading
Ori	PERSON	- ental powers , as a measure of self-defense .

		The
United States	LOCATION	mariners were under this handi - cap at the beginning of their eastern voyages .

		It took time to demonstrate that the Yankees were neither marauders nor land-grabbers , but were simply peaceful traders .

		When they finally achieved this reputation , the progress to the pres - ent high position of the
United States	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	- tic sentiment was steady and sure .

		With but one exception , the advances made by the
Ameri	PERSON	- cans toward a sustained commercial intercourse in the far East have been eminently pacific .

		The ill-starred attempt of
1871	DATE	, to inflict sum - mary punishment upon
Korea	LOCATION	for resisting an American effort to open trade between the two countries , Mr.
Foster	PERSON	characterizes '' the most serious blunder of American diplomacy in the Orient . ''

		The first American vessel entered the port of
Canton	LOCATION	in
August , 1784	DATE	.

		Our merchants at once sought to take advantage of the limited facilities for commerce with that one port , al - lowed by the Chinese ; in
1789	DATE	they began to construct vessels expressly for the
Canton	LOCATION	trade , and thereafter they soon began to compete with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the leading nation in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	traffic .

		Fairness , justice and courtesy won for the westerners the good opinion of the Chinese merchants and some of their neighbors ; so that , whereas
Great Britain	LOCATION	compelled
China	LOCATION	by force of arms to enter into the treaty of
1842	DATE	, the
United States	LOCATION	secured , in her peaceful treaty of
1844	DATE	, advantages not theretofore granted by the Chinese to the Occidentals .

		With equal ease , an American treaty of commerce was arranged with the
Sultan of Borneo	ORGANIZATION	in
1850	DATE	.

		America was thus attaining to a capacity for melting away by kindness , in the fulness of time , the icy isolation of
Japan	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	details graphically the successive triumphs of the
United States	LOCATION	, in
Perry	LOCATION	's open - ing of
Japan	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	, and the
Harris	PERSON	treaty with that empire in
1858	DATE	, of which he says : '' The genius of
Perry	PERSON	had unbarred the gate of the island empire and left it ajar ; but it was the skill of
Harris	PERSON	which threw it open to the commercial enterprise of the world . ''

		These triumphs were shown also in the subsequent transformation of
Japan	LOCATION	in conscious conform - ity to
American National	ORGANIZATION	ideals ; in the just popularity of
Burlingame	LOCATION	's management of the interests of the
United States	LOCATION	in
China	LOCATION	, and in the new treaties and the
Burlingame	LOCATION	embassy to the western powers which followed ; in the wise and firm disapproval by
America	LOCATION	of the odious opium traffic ; in
Commodore Shufeldt	PERSON	's Korean treaty of
1882	DATE	; and in the rapid but sure advance of our nation to favor and influ - ence in the affairs of
Korea	LOCATION	.

		The eminent posi - tion which the
United States	ORGANIZATION	occupied in the Chinese imbroglio of
1900	DATE	, and the opportu - nities thus granted to her for guiding the Pow - ers toward a fair settlement with the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	, are thus shown to be the result of a gradual evolution , traceable from the date of the entry of the western republic into the world 's politics .

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	makes it clear that these Ameri - can successes have been due primarily to two causes , -- skill and energy in developing mer - cantile traffic , and wisdom and discrimination in pushing missionary enterprises .

		The mer - chant and the missionary have , hand in hand , advanced the
United States	LOCATION	flag in the far East .

		This author 's recognition of the value of the work of the American missionaries is hearty and unstinted ; and it is the more worthy to be noted here , because it comes from the point of view , not of the sentimentalist or the philan - thropist , but of the historian and the diplomat .

		He gives cordial endorsement to the tribute of Minister
Denby	PERSON	to the missionaries in
China	LOCATION	, '' that their influence is beneficial to the natives ; that the arts and sciences and civilization are greatly spread by their efforts ; that many use - ful Western books are translated by them into Chinese ; that they are the leaders in all chari - table work ; and that in the interest , therefore , of civilization , missionaries ought not only to be tolerated , but ought to receive protection . ''

July 16	DATE	, In the concluding chapter , on '' Results of the Spanish War , '' Mr.
Foster	PERSON	traces into our recent national experiences as a world-power the natural effect of the restraint , suavity and dis - crimination with which our earlier and smaller efforts in Oriental diplomacy were ventured .

Hugh McCulloch	PERSON	have `` Written in
Florence	LOCATION	'' for a title , -- in
Florence	LOCATION	, `` Where even
Winter	DATE	brings a soft caress , And all the flowers of art together cling . ''

		The verses are reflections from a cultivated mind , susceptible of the charms of art , nature , and his - torical association , and tinged with a not unnatural hue of melancholy .

		They have little of the singing quality , and their diction is often merely prosaic , but at their best they please , and exhibit a talent that now we may only mourn .

		A poem '' To the Medi - terranean , '' seems to us one of the most genuine in the collection , and we quote from it a pair of stanzas : '' All memories which hannt the heart of man Cluster on yon like bees about a rose ; Upon your shores our history began , -- Perchance your smile will hover o'er its close .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 37 Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's second volume is called '' From the Green Book of the Bards , '' and is frankly a volume of nature lyrics , in which the spirits of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	seem compounded with the mysticism of the latter-day Celts .

		The poems in this book are briefer than those in the other , and about three times as numerous .

		We have been particulary impressed with `` The Madness of Ishtar , '' for thus does the poet personify the passion of Springtime . ''

		She will gather the moonlight and starshine , And breathe on them with desire , And they shall be changed on the moment To the marvel of earth 's green fire , -- `` The ardour that kindles and blights not , Consumes and does not destroy .

		Renewing the world with wonder , And the hearts of men with joy . ''

		For this is the purpose of Ishtar , In her great lone house of the sky Beholding the work of her hands As it shall be by and by : '' Out of the passion and splendour , Faith , failure , and daring , to bring The illumined dream of the spirit To perfection in some far
spring	DATE	. ''

		These may be called wild and whirling words , and we are not sure that we know what they are all about , bat they have the true singing quality , and the essence of poetry is in them .

		Mr.
George Cabot Lodge	PERSON	's second volume of poems is , if anything , more Swinburnian than his first .

		He imitates with fair success nearly all of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's metrical schemes , and reproduces the sensuous and pagan spirit of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's early work , with an occasional touch of the austere ideal - ism that afterwards so completely replaced it .

		He even ventures to write a '' Song of Man , '' in bold imitation of the great poem suggested to the older singer by the -LRB-
Ecumenical Council	ORGANIZATION	of
1870	DATE	. ''

		To the gods who are sure and sufficient , who are free and more fatal than Fate , Who can tally the love of a virgin or the heart of a man in his hate , Who are wise with a perfect remembrance , who reject not a creed nor a crime , Who compassionate all , who interpret the ways and the wonders of Time ! ''

		Who have builded and broken all laws of the Heaven and
Earth	LOCATION	, who are free .

		Who have lifted the seals from the sunrise , made pregnant the womb of the sea .

		Who have scattered the phantoms of heaven , wrecked the thrones of the world and their spell , Who have sown and reaped harvest of flowers in the fire - waste deserts of hell ! ''

		For my God is the friend that I cherish , and my God is the woman I love , My God is the
Spring	DATE	on the hillsides , the Sea and the marvel thereof , My God is the justice of sunlight unhindered by power or pelf , And vast beyond all and inclusive of all things , my God is Myself . ''

		This is the tacit creed of many a young poet , im - patient of the old restraints upon reckless living , but it does not often receive so frank an expression .

		Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	has a certain mastery of the long-drawn anapaest that would challenge our admiration were it not so obviously imitative . ''

		Let us press in the hidden wet ways of the forest filled full of the shadows and sounds of the past , Let us travel the fields by the River of Years till the ways of the waters are open at last ; And our steed shall be staunch tho ' he weary and wince at the spur , tho ' his nostrils are purple with blood , For the craving of Soul and the power of Love , for the freedom of Faith and the friendship of God ! ''

		It is no easy matter to keep this sort of movement up for pages at a time , as Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	more than once does .

		The following is perhaps the finest verse he offers us : '' Life 's choice is this : the world or all the rest , '' but we are more than once made suspicious of his ' own ethical interpretation of the terms of this choice .

		His '' all the rest '' seems to be self-indulgence more than anything else .

		Here is where he has studied his Swinburne to little profit , and where his fail - ure to comprehend the spirit of '' The Pilgrims '' and '' Super Flumina Babylonis '' is most noticeable .

		• • Message and Melody '' is Mr.
Richard Bur	PERSON	- ton 's fourth book of verse , and we are inclined to think that it is the best of the four .

		It shows more ripeness of experience than the earlier ones , and a deepening of the human sympathies .

		We quote '' The Reformer , '' a piece which suggests the grave thoughtfulness of Sill . ''

		A man once stood before a frowning wall
Whereon	PERSON	was writ a lie since ancient days .

		And threw his heart 's blood by the cupful straight Against the legend , so to wipe it ont Tapping his veins of all their purple yield In his desire .

		At last he grew so weak That , tottering-limbed , he heaved glazed eyes to heaven , Sighed like a weary child , smiled once , and fell .

		And when his dust was mingled with the mould That giveth birth to flowers , the people woke One morn , and looked upon the wall , to see A clean erasure of the glozing words Had grieved the man so , he that calmly slept .

		Oblivious alike of loves and lies That make our human story .

		Then there ran A whisper , soon a cry , across the land : ' God urged him to the act , and he was glad To spill his blood and make us clearer-eyed . '

		Whereat the very folk who carelessly Passed by that day he drained his throbbing strength And paled his flesh , upreared a cenotaph And deified his name to after-times . ''

		We could wish that Mr.
Burton	PERSON	had taken his own teaching sufficiently to heart to prevent him from penning the following apology for imperialism : '' Yet the earth 's stern law is spoken In the march of centuries .

		That the weak for good are broken , That the strong must rule the seas . ''

		We ru iv conquer in all gladness If the cause be pure and high ; We can bear the passing sadness For the blessing by and by . ''

		These are `` glozing words , '' if ever such were spoken , and this '' lie writ since ancient days '' 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, should not find among its defenders the author of so fine and true a poem as the one which we first quoted .

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's '' Lyrics of the Dawn '' is a companion volume to '' The
Lutes	PERSON	of Morn , '' published a year or two ago .

		Like the earlier volume , it is a collection of poems mostly upon Oriental themes , the aftermath of a sojourn in the
East	LOCATION	which seems to have left a deep impression upon the poet 's imagination .

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	has a touch that frequently suggests the lyrics of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and his
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	pictures have the advan - tage of a basis of close observation in place of the bookish stimulus upon which the elder poet relied .

		We select '' At
Ephesus	LOCATION	'' for our quotation . '' '

		Great is Diana ! '

		Ah , the mockery It seems to-day , the old Ephesian cry !

		Beholding what a waste the highways he , And how downthrown the mighty temples lie .

		`` On shattered columns build the storks their nests ; Stealthy as fate the slinking jackals prowl : Where poured the plaudits at the actors ' jests In-ghostly irony declaims the owl . ''

		The silt of centuries chokes the harborage ; And where the pharos beaconed from the height , Guide to great galleys , weighed with outland wage , Now broods , unchallenged , immemorial night . ''

		Nothing the vision rests upon reveals ffiifc The temporal grandeur that once here had birth ; And , gazing on the desolate scene , one feels How mutable are all the things of earth . ''

		This is a weak enough ending , but the image of the owl with his '' ghostly irony '' redeems the poem and makes it noteworthy . ''

		The Count of Mirandel , '' a mediaeval tale too long for repro - duction , is one of the most effective pieces in this volume , and one of the few that depart from its general Eastern subject-matter .

		We are inclined to think that Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	writes too freely and publishes too frequently for the best interests of his reputation , although we never take up a new volume from his pen without a sense of anticipatory satisfaction .

		We know what it will be about , but we also know that it will have much nature-imagery of an exquisite sort , and that it will offer us a highly spiritualized conception of life .

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's latest volume is called ** A Voice on the Wind , and Other Poems . ''

		It may be rep - resented fairly by '' The Dead Day . '' ''

		The West builds high a sepulchre Of cloudy granite and of gold , Where twilight 's priestly hours inter The day like some great king of old . ''

		A censer , rimmed with silver fire , The new moon swings above his tomb ; While , organ-stops of God 's own choir , Star after star throbs in the gloom .

		And night draws near , the sadly sweet -- A nun whose face is calm and fair -- And kneeling at the dead day 's feet Her soul goes up in silent prayer . ''

		In prayer , we feel through dewy gleam And flowery fragrance , and -- above All Earth -- the ecstasy and dream That haunt the mystic heart of love . ''

		Such poetry as this is not to be discredited merely because the author has given us much work of the same quality before .

		And we can not fail to notice in Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's latest volume the slow but sure ripening of his art .

		Father
Tabb	PERSON	's '' Later Lyrics '' are delicate verse - cameos of the sort to which he has accustomed us .

		Rarely exceeding a dozen lines each , these little poems embody simple thoughts and sentiments , sometimes merely commonplace , and at others touched with such imagination as we find in the following example : `` The world , they tell us , dwindles , When matched with other spheres ; And yet in all their amplitudes No place for human tears . ''

		How sterile is the sunshine , How masculine the blue , That breeds no shadow , nor betrays A memory of dew ! ''

		Mr.
Robert Loveman	PERSON	is like Father
Tabb	PERSON	in the choice of a form for his poetical expression , and the following bit might as readily have been found in the one poet as in the other . ''

		Old and yet young , the jocund Earth Doth speed among the spheres , Her children of imperial birth Are all the golden years . ''

		The happy orb sweeps on Led by some vague unrest , Some mystic hint of joys unborn Springing within her breast . ''

		Mr.
Loveman	PERSON	's little book is called `` The Gates of Silence , with Interludes of Song . ''

		It is made up of such pieces as that above quoted , all voicing the eternal enigma of being , but relieved every now and then by a joyous lyric that forgets problems and simply sings . ''

		The Morning Road '' is a collection of verses by Messrs.
Thomas Wood Stevens	PERSON	and
Alden Charles Noble	PERSON	.

		We understand that the authors are also the designers and manufacturers of the book , which is produced in a simple but singularly attractive form , and in a limited edition .

		There is much thoughtfulness about their metrical work , and a delight in the themes that appeal to the cul - tivated mind .

		The imagery is often striking , and the diction at times has a touch of distinction .

		Yet the total effect is one of hollowness , of high - sounding phrase that a close analysis does not justify , of an endeavor to be impressive at the cost of clear thinking and verbal restraint .

		Our mean - ing may be illustrated by an excerpt from the characteristic poem called '' The Sphinx , '' which also illustrates a stanzaic form much affected by the authors .

		`` The womb of all the world is parched beneath the tropic breeze , The earth 's a flameless furnace that taints the outer air , -- Beneath that sand no man may say what cities lie at peace , Within that breast no man can guess what brand of soul is there ; '' Hidden behind that stolid brow were spun ; the vast in - trigues

		THE DIAL 39 That swayed the arms of Empire to conquest -- and to death ; The silent voice that calls and calls across the barren leagues Doth hover in that throat that lacks the benison of breath ; '' Trusting the lips that never ope , the tongue that murmurs not , Within that heart the phantoms lie of countless empty biers , Around those feet the wrecks of wills are foundered and forgot , Across that face the winds have hurled the dust of pow - dered years . ''

		We confess that a feeling of bewilderment is the chief impression which we receive from this pre - tentious piece , and the others of similar character which go with it ; but bewilderment , far from being the proper purpose of poetry , is something that should be shunned as absolutely fatal to the success of the poetic art .

		Mr.
Trumbull Stickney	PERSON	's `` Dramatic Verses '' make up another volume which is exceptionally praiseworthy from the mechanical point of view , and whose contents must be described in terms nearly similar to those which we applied to the volume just before considered .

		Yet we will add that there are in this work more frequent touches of distinction , and that the straining for original effects is more fully justified .

		The opening piece , '' Kalypso , '' yields an extract which is illustrative of both the author 's strength and his weakness . ''

		Over his head she stooped .

		Her odorous hair Fell thickly o'er his face .

		She kissed him With all the sleepy honeys of her soul .

		Her arms did slip along his neck , his breast ; She kissed him lazily upon the lids And languorously on the brow , she kissed him Trembling and fiery on the opened mouth .

		And slowly -- Wind rose .

		Rustles crept to 's ear ,
Thro	PERSON	' meshes of her hair he saw gray-blown The thick tumultuous cloud blotted and streaked With witchery of dead moon .

		The midnight whirred .

		Sparsely the windy stars and feebly hung .

		A little withered leaf blew by ; it scratched Him with its frittered edge .

		For it was autumn .

		Autumn it was .

		Then did he know .

		No more That year would he return , that year no more ; Rather , locked by the vastly circular Walls o ' the sea , the quashing roof of heaven , Still suffocated in the changeless air , Still vexed by incessant memory and recall , Would stand in pain desirous of that dear Fireside and her more dear and beautiful . ''

		This is about as un-Homeric as anything could well be ; yet despite its unpleasant staccato , its surfeit of kissings , and its far-fetched epithets , the passage has a certain power to grip the imagination and ex - cite the nobler emotions .

		The title of the book is not so clearly justified by this poem as by some others , notably the story of ''
Ludovico Martelli	PERSON	, '' which gives us excellent
Browning	PERSON	with a differ - ence .

		The volume contains one piece , u Prometheus Pyrphoros , '' which is dramatic in form , and also a number of striking sonnets and lyrics .

		Almost any gathering of current verse nowadays is sure to include one or more contributions from the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , and the present review must find space for mention of two volumes of far Western poetry .

		Dr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	is already known to many readers , both by his original work and by his striking translation of the Bonnets of
M. de Heredia	ORGANIZATION	.

		His new volume is original , and is called '' Visions and Other Verse . ''

		The chief de - fect of Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	's work is found in the intrusion of an occasional jarring note , such an epithet as '' immatchle88 , '' or a hopelessly unpoetical phrase like '' the lightning bug , '' or a forced license such as '' He crushed his heart for wine of song The sordid souls of men to glad . ''

		Such things as these are unfortunate , and occur with too great frequency .

		Since the author 's favorite form is the sonnet , our illustration shall take that shape .

		The sonnet is entitled M Adversity . '' ''

		When glad Fortuna , as a friend to thee , Her more than liberal spoils before thee brings , Beware the serpent , slyly hid , which stings The soul with poison of Prosperity .

		Thou never mayest revealing visions see , Nor mount with seraphs on immortal wings , Unless within thy deepest being springs Some tear-fed fountain of Adversity .

		The steel that
Florence	LOCATION	drove in
Dante	LOCATION	's heart He fashioned to a lyre , whereon with ease He deathless rose above the hells of hate ; And when life-wearied
Milton	PERSON	sat apart , Lonely and blind , he swept those organ keys Whose tones from age to age reverberate . ''

		Such verse as this is of course derivative -- in the present instance clearly from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son -- but it is dignified and sincere .

		In Mr.
Louis Alexander Robertson	PERSON	's volume , which also comes to us from
California	LOCATION	, '' Beyond the Re - quiems '' is the most ambitious piece , and gives a title to the collection .

		This is also Tennysonian in its inspiration , and goes in for cosmic emotion after the following fashion : '' All our knowledge is as nothing ; Reason reels and Science sneers , Faith below her falling altars lifts her fearless face and hears `` Every cherished creed derided , but still mumbles to her beads , Dreaming that beyond the requiems deathless life to death succeeds . ''

		Hope 's pale star still smiles above us , distant , indistinct , and cold ; As the primal moth beheld it do we now its beams behold . '

		Lyrics , sonnets , and occasional verses fill out the volume , which is a thin one both as to content and to thought .

		The verses outnumber the poems in Mr.
Edward Sandf	PERSON	ord
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's volume of M Poems and Verses , '' a disparity which does not prove greatly distressing when the verses are as pleasant as those which this cheery humorist knows how to write .

		Here is an example , snatched midway from a piece which con - trasts the old education with the new : '' The shade austere of Puritan restraint Showed sharper outlines , may be , then and now , But not to hurt .

		For now the old complaint Of joys curtailed gives place to wonder how 40 THE DIAL .

		stress of sports and pleasant things to do , And waxing claims of growing knowledge , too , The modern lad gets time to feel the joy It was , and still must be , to be a boy . ''

		A good many of Mr.
Martin	PERSON	's pieces are of the occasional sort , and display a deftness of touch that would not have discredited Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Even in the few instances in which he writes poetry , he preserves simplicity of diction , and his bumor is lurking somewhere in the near background . ''

		To our dim sense God 's plan seems often harsh .

		Big fish eats small ; earthquakes and storms destroy . '

		Tennyson phrased it somewhat differently , but the matter is the same .

		Mr.
Martin	PERSON	puts his best foot -LRB- or feet -RRB- forward in his titular poem , '' The Sea Is His , '' from which we choose these stanzas : '' Urgent and masterful as here , Man dreams and plans , and more and more , As ages slip away ,
Earth	LOCATION	shows How need by satisfaction grows , And more and more its patient face Mirrors the driving human race . ''

		But he who ploughs the abiding deep No furrow leaves , nor stays to reap .

		Unmarred and unadorned , the sea Rolls on as irresistibly As when , at first , the shaping thought Of God its separation wrought . ''

		Great nurse of freedom , breeding men Who dare , and , baffled , strive again !

		A rampart round them in their youth , A refuge in their straits and ruth , And in their seasoned strength , a road To carry liberty abroad I '' Lighter than Mr.
Martin	PERSON	's lightest is the vein of '' Cupid Is King , '' a volume of rather commonplace trifling in verse by Mr.
Roy Farrell Greene	PERSON	.

		The following piece has about as much point as any : `` The second time that
Jack	PERSON	proposed , 'T was really a surprise , Though I still -- gossips so supposed -- Found favor in his eyes .

		His first avowal , months before , I 'd treated with disdain , And laughed at him the while he swore He 'd try again , again ! ''

		The second time that
Jack	PERSON	proposed I never said a word , Though to assent I 'd grown disposed -- I simply overheard By accident his earnest plea While in the waltz 's whirl -- The second time 't was not to me , But to another girl ! ''

		The following piece is fairly representative of the volume written by Miss
Mary Olcott	PERSON	, and called '' Poems '' without further ceremony .

		The title is `` The Unceasing Fight . '' ''

		From the cold North rode out my foe .

		I fought him to the death .

		And still I see him in his mortal throe .

		Urged by his strong , unconquered will To fight on with one death-sent blow . ''

		Above his grim , white face I made The brave sign of the cross .

		I broke His sword , and the two parts I laid Upon his neck , like to the yoke His soul should feel when sins are weighed . ''

		Would God that all mine enemies Were stark in death as that one was !

		But till this life shall fail and cease I must fight on .

		For no man has Peace , till the end of life says , Peace ! ''

		Miss
Olcott	PERSON	's work is earnest and at times finely imaginative .

		We like particularly '' Stonehenge '' and the cycle called '' By the Waters of Babylon . ''

		A quotation from the latter may be given . ''

		The light begins to creep , the river flows Like a pale streak , while all the rushes lean Upon the current , which moves on and on Soon shall we march engirdled with our woes , Soon reach their God-spurned city all unclean .

		The hour breaks on us , and a trumpeter Sounds the known signal for our start and stir : How the red dawn strikes fire at Babylon ! ''

		In not a few of her pieces the author has caught something of the manner of
Browning	PERSON	, especially the jerky dramatic manner which is a pronounced characteristic of the older poet .

		There are many suggestions of
Browning	PERSON	in the `` Poems '' of Miss
Marie Van Vorst	ORGANIZATION	.

		The dramatic
Browning	PERSON	is recalled by the group of longer pieces with which the volume opens , and
Browning	PERSON	the love-ly rist by many of the songs that come later on .

		The closing lines of `` Three Days More '' may be quoted in evidence of our statement .

		`` Sudden , the spell snaps short to Fate !

		Till that day -- when I see your face -- There are still three dark days to climb , To-day , to-morrow , and its mate . ''

		A beautiful sonnet , the last of the group of four en - titled '' Viva !

		Anima Carissima , '' may be taken to stand for
Miss Van Vorst	ORGANIZATION	's achievement at its highest reach . ''

		When they together saw the Calendar Slip by in months that wore
Spring	DATE	all days long , He made his lover 's verse and roundel song The burthen of the rhyme his love of her !

		... What though the storm swept by with rainy stir , And winds , like ghosts , would ` round the windows throng , They sat heart-linked , hand-linked ; and bright and strong Riot ran through their veins like Mid-summer .

		For palm to palm is exquisite as
May	DATE	; And lip on lip is mad
July	DATE	at best !

		Where is the fire for this pale
Winter	DATE	's day ?

		For one who sits alone at
Death	ORGANIZATION	's behest ?

		Ghosts of the storm peer in with charnel mirth At ghosts of ashes on the gusty hearth . ''

		There is a sonnet-ending that has the melancholy cadence with whicb
Rossetti	PERSON	brought many a similar song to its period .

		The author does not often rise to this height of expression , but her work as a whole is out of the common , and may be commended to all to whom sincere and passionate emotion makes an appeal .

		Miss
Willa Sibert Cather	PERSON	is a new writer , and ''
April	DATE	Twilights '' is the title of her first book .

		The title has no particular significance , unless it suggests the subdued tone of her tranquil musings . ''

		Prairie Dawn '' is pretty enough to quote . ''

		A crimson fire that vanquishes the stars ; A pungent odor from the dusty sage ; A sudden stirring of the huddled herds ; A breaking of the distant table-lands
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 Through purple mists ascending , and the flare Of water-ditches silver in the light ; A swift , bright lance hurled low across the world ; A sudden sickness for the hills of home . ''

		Of such exquisite description there is much in
Miss Cather	LOCATION	's collection ; there are also engaging reflec - tions from the world of books , the history and the legend of the ages .

		Last upon our list comes '' The Solitary Path , '' by Miss
Helen Huntington	PERSON	.

		Here is a pleasing quatrain called '' After Nightfall . '' ''

		The sunset sky , with whirl of
night	TIME	and flame , Sang Passion 's fleeting hour !

		came night at length , And , black against a cold and moonlit sky , The lonely mountains told their tale of Strength . ''

		A longer and more human example is the poem entitled ''
Barbara	PERSON	. '' ''

		You , for an hour , have been dear .

		And till the end shall be dearest , Come mistress or wife to divide your life , 'T is I will have crept the nearest . '' '

		Farewell ! '

		you may cry , as you go .

		You are keen for the world 's great track .

		The shout of the crowd , and the love that 's allowed ; But your thoughts shall turn back , turn back . ''

		And the hour which you swear to forget , And the love that was idle breath , Shall return in their wrath , and arise in your path , And follow you on , to Death . ''

		Miss
Huntington	LOCATION	works within very narrow limits , but her touch is delicate and effective .

		TU New When the first three volumes of '' The international New International Encyclopaedia '' Eneyciopadxa .

		we re sent us by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, we took occasion to congratulate both publishers and editors upon the execution of the work , and upon its special adaptation to the needs of those who wish information upon specific subjects and do not wish to search for the informa - tion through elaborate essays or to be bothered by too complicated a system of cross-references .

		Since that first notice , additional instalments of the Encyclopaedia have come to us from time to time , until at the present writing seven new vol - umes are at hand .

		These volumes , numbering from IV .

		to X. inclusive , carry on the alphabetical series of topics from
Canada Balsam	LOCATION	to
Larramendi	LOCATION	.

		This last-mentioned entry , by the way , is the name of a Spanish Jesuit of the eighteenth century who was an authority on the language of the Basques .

		Run - ning through the volumes we note the following among the more elaborate articles .

		Chemistry ,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	,
Costume	ORGANIZATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Elec	ORGANIZATION	- tricity and allied topics ,
England	LOCATION	and English Lit - erature ,
Europe	LOCATION	, Fortification ,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Heraldry	ORGANIZATION	, Horse ,
India	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and Jews .

		The illustrations are very nu - merous , including many full-page plates , all inter - esting and some of marked beauty .

		We note particularly the many brief articles upon living men and other timely topics , giving just the infor mation we want and often find it very hard to get .

		Our previous opinion of the usefulness , as well as the readableness , of this work is more than eon - firmed by our examination of the new volumes .

		In its own field , this
Encyclopaedia	LOCATION	hardly has a rival among existing publications .

		-- We note at the same time the receipt , from the same publishers , of '' The International Year-Book '' for
1903	DATE	.

		This work is under the same editorial management -LRB- ex - cept for Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	's collaboration -RRB- as the other , and is an indispensable adjunct to the labors of the editor , the teacher , the clergyman , and the publicist .

		There are half a dozen maps and many plates .

		A cumulative index to the volumes of the five preced - ing years is a useful feature of this work .

		f. 5 < # r r ' * In his latest book , `` The Kaiser 's cfMMtn Speeches '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- Mr.
Wolf	PERSON	von hutpeeche * .

		Schierbrand furnishes an admirable supplement to his recent volume on
Germany	LOCATION	.

		That work devoted several chapters to the Em - peror 's personality , and discussed the potent in - fluence of his leadership upon the development of the new Empire .

		The present one not only con - tains the sources upon which those chapters were based , but gives a large amount of related matter .

		The material for the greater part of this work is found in
Elausmann	LOCATION	's recent authorized compi - lation of the Emperor 's speeches -- a fact that the author fully acknowledges .

		He has , however , added several speeches from other sources , -- some , possibly , that His Majesty might have preferred to have forgotten .

		When needed , explanatory notes are given , and the various addresses or extracts on related topics are connected by comment or narra - tive , into separate chapters .

		The chapters are in turn grouped under three general divisions , dealing respectively with the
Emperor	ORGANIZATION	's efforts to preserve both the domestic and the foreign peace of
Germany	LOCATION	; with his activity in promoting the welfare of his peo - ple ; and , lastly , with his private character and per - sonal relations .

		The translation is Mr.
von Schier	PERSON	- brand 's own .

		The book is readable and interesting , and gives an admirable notion of that many-sided activity that distinguishes
William II	PERSON	.

		among modern sovereigns .

		Of particular interest are the chapters dealing with his tactful efforts to preserve peace and to promote educational reform .

		The whole gives the impression of a character dominated by a well-formed and consistently developed pur - pose -- a view quite at variance with the popular estimate of the
Kaiser	PERSON	.

		There are occasional in - accuracies in statement , such as the reference to Frederick the Great as the Emperor 's '' great sire . ''

		More striking is the fact that while the author 's English is ordinarily excellent , the German idiom has often been too strong for him to overcome in the passages in which he appears as translator .

		But such criticism is , in a work of this sort , pedantic ; 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, the book merits cordial commendation .

		It is wel - come to every student of German affairs , and Mr.
von Schierbrand	PERSON	deserves cordial recognition for the judgment and fairness shown in his selections and for his success in presenting a genuine portrait of the
Kaiser	PERSON	.

		The essential * A volume which , though unpedantic , of musical contains the result of long and labori - educaiion .

		0U8 gtudy ^ an -LRB- j seems sufficiently learned to flatter those who read it in the belief that they are masters of the subject , is '' Musical Education '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by
M. Albert Lavignac	PERSON	.

		The work , translated from the French by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	, is divided into six parts , the first of which , touching in a general way upon musical education , is devoted to music as a language , an art , and a science ; hereditary talent and natural apti - tudes ; indications of musical talent in young chil - dren , and the proper age to begin the study of music ; the proper length of time for daily study , and the importance of conducting studies methodically and logically .

		The second part refers in particular to the study of instruments -- the piano , organ , harp , string instruments , wind instruments , etc. ; the dif - ficulties of the different instruments , and the quali - fications of a teacher for advanced pupils .

		The study of singing , dwelt upon in the third part , is very interesting , and gives lucid hints on the exami - nation of the natural voice , hygiene of the voice , methods of vocalization and period of daily studies , the accompaniment , studies necessary for the stage , and physical requirements for an opera singer .

		In part four we are told of various studies necessary for composers -- the study of harmony and counter - point , orchestration and instrumentation . ''

		Of the means of rectifying a musical education that has been ill-directed at the beginning , and how to remedy it , '' is the general title of the fifth part ; and , sub - servient to this , the closing chapter dwells upon private teaching , class instruction and conservatory instruction , with a few remarks on American and European conservatories .

		Those portions of the essays devoted to the early education of embryonic artists contain opinions which we all might well en - tertain .

		There is not only room , but an actual de - mand , for a work which , like the present , aims at giving not alone an account of each particular branch of musical art , but a condensed summary of modern criticism upon it -- a summary which is not obscured or disfigured by a vicious redundancy of words .

		In short ,
M. Lavignac	PERSON	's volume is a sort of musical vade - mecum , sober in tone and replete with information .

		A sumptuous volume on the `` Por - juViZaZZr ' traitures of J Qli ™ C '' sar , '' by Mr.
Frank Jesup Scott	PERSON	, is issued by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thirty-seven full - page plates and forty-nine inset engravings repre - sent to the reader very fairly the alleged likenesses of Cesar to be found in the various public museums of the present day .

		We regard it as unfortunate for Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's discussion of these likenesses that his un - bounded admiration for
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	will allow him to ac - cept no representation as adequate which does not fill his ideal of the man in every important feature .

		Some will not do because '' the suave gentleman , the sweet-mannered friend , the philosopher , are not visi - ble '' in them .

		The '' calm and stately orator , '' the '' far-seeing statesman , '' must always be suggested .

		There can be no good portraiture which does not show his '' kindly placidity of temper , '' under which must be revealed '' a vein of fearless audacity , '' curbed by '' calm powers of reasoning . ''

		An '' im - perturbable consciousness of power '' is also a sine qua non , as well as the evidence of '' electric en - ergy . ''

		Now artists who can understand a really great character , and reproduce it , soul , external feat - ures , and all , are rare in any age , we are told , and there is no evidence that there were any such in the age of
Julius Csesar	PERSON	.

		We are thus left free to re - ject all portraitures of the Dictator 's own time as necessarily defective , and to demand as the only adequate likeness something which shall display all the fine qualities to be detected in any detail of the material which has come down to us , plus all the noble and heroic traits to be culled out of ancient literature , -- or , we are tempted to add , to be read into it under the influence of a super-heated admira - tion .

		It is to be said , in general , that men do not always wear all their good qualities within reach of even an artist 's eye , and in particular that there is good ground for question whether
Julius Caesar	PERSON	really possessed the almost divine character here attributed to him .

		We may thank Mr.
Scott	PERSON	heartily , how - ever , for getting this material together , and present - ing it in such effective shape . ''

		My Kalendar of Country Delights '' Garden-love m `` .

		• c .1 , and garden-lore .

		ls a compilation , -- one of the class of books once called Commonplace Books , wherein the writer gathered during his reading any memorable sentences or chapters or thoughts and transcribed them in a book , some - times with slight comment or classification .

		In derivative form , and on garden topics , an early and charming volume of this class was '' The Day-book of Bethia Hardacre , '' published about ten years ago .

		Somewhat varied is Mrs.
Milne-Home	PERSON	's more recent and more fascinating '' Stray Leaves from a Border Garden . ''

		No volume of which fully half the pages are transcribed from the old herbals of Gerarde and Parkinson could be dull to any flower-lover ; and such is the make-up of this
Kalendar	PERSON	.

		The author states that she has culled '' from rare books '' only .

		In
America	LOCATION	, these herbals are certainly rare , though copies are constantly offered for sale ; but it is a large stretch of the signification of a word to term
Bacon	PERSON	's essay '' Of Gardens '' rare .

		We think every word of it is quoted somewhere in this '' Kalendar , '' sprinkled about on two-score pages .

		The reader of garden-books sighs as he turns the pages of each new volume of this class , and encounters therein the familiar italics and capitals of
Bacon	LOCATION	's words ,
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 '' God Almighty first Created a Garden , and In - deed , '' and so on ; pages which he has memorized unconsciously from their constant thrusting before him .

		Nor is
Forbes Watson	PERSON	's '' Flowers and
Gar	PERSON	- dens '' rare ; for it has been reprinted recently .

		Much of it is in this '' Kalendar . ''

		bat its exquisite words never stale .

		It may be added that for the author of five books on gardens to write that she '' does not know the author of the following poem '' is surprising indeed , when we find that the verse she refers to is Mr.
T. E. Brown	PERSON	's gem of poesy , '' A Garden is a lovesome thing , God wot . ''

		This she gives as a lonesome thing , -- a sad error .

		Her quo - tations from the herbals also have some changes , as we compare them with original copies of Gerarde 's '' Great Herbal '' -LRB- 1633 -RRB- and Parkinson 's '' Paradisi in Sole '' -LRB- 1635 -RRB- .

		But these need not be errors ; for there were three editions of each of these great volumes , and Mrs.
Milman	PERSON	may have copied from other editions than ours .

		A charming feature of the book is the list of old English plant-names .

		These are given as original , but like lists may be found in Britten 's '' English Plant Names '' and in Prior 's '' Popular Names of British Plants . ''

		The author states that she herself has learned much that is new in preparing this book .

		This is doubtless true ; but we can not think she teaches her reader much that is unfamiliar .

		Some of the quotations and transcripts may seem new to one of narrow garden-craft and scant garden-lore ; but to any true garden student , the pages in general are familiar .

		They are none the worse , however , for that ; and we can enjoy them even if we do not find the quaint and pretty novelties of imaginative thought and original experience that sparkle alongside the like quotations in Mrs.
Milne-Home	PERSON	's pages .

		One looks rather askance at a new eompanLfu7 hook on '' The Solar System , '' won - dering what of novelty or special in - terest can be written on a theme so well worn and presumably so adequately treated -- from a popular standpoint -- in many recent works on astronomy .

		But Mr.
Percival Lowell	PERSON	has presented us with a small treatise quite unlike any other on the subject .

		The fact that it has no preface indicates perchance the author 's opinion that it can speak for itself ; while the absence of an index suggests the erroneous idea that the book belongs to the domain of sum - mer fiction .

		But the title-page rights these specu - lations by advising the reader that six lectures to the young men of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	have been bound up together for the benefit of a larger audience .

		However , they are apparently intended for the comparatively small number of those who are students of matters astro - nomical , and who can dig the hidden beauties out of the mathematical formulae which start out of the pages now and then and interrupt the easy flow of description .

		The planet
Mercury	ORGANIZATION	is treated in a novel manner , from the standpoint of the author 's own observations , which have revealed to him markings best explained as '' cracks , '' whose slowly changing positions point to the conclusion that the planet always keeps the same face to the sun .

		Saturn and his system are discussed with a fresh - ness and suggestiveness which will hold the atten - tion of even a blase professional astronomer .

		The interesting chapter on ''
Jupiter	PERSON	and his Comets '' is mainly devoted to expounding in popular fashion the mathematical principles in accordance with which
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	snares his prey .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	indi - cates that the orbits of certain meteoric showers and comets point to the probable existence of a goodly planet in those far-away spaces which lie beyond the path of slow-footed
Neptune	LOCATION	.

		The final chapter , upon Cosmogony , is a fresh discus - sion along lines little exploited in text-books , and serves to stimulate rather than to satisfy ; for the questions involved are too recondite for our present knowledge .

		The publishers -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have given an attractive dress of red and gold to this little book .

		Dr.
R. A. Middeldyk	PERSON	's `` History of in < a `` Wut indie * .

		Paerto Rico , '' the third volume of `` The Expansion of the Republic Series '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is the first complete history of the island of
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	ever written either in Spanish or English .

		The fact that
Friar Inigo Abbad	PERSON	's '' Historia de la
Isla San Juan Bautista	PERSON	, '' written in
1782	DATE	, published in
1788	DATE	, and revised in
1830	DATE	to bring it down to the
eighteenth century	DATE	, has been for years the accepted work on the subject , shows the need of an authentic up-to-date history of the island .

		In the first half of the present book , the author gives a sketch of the Spanish occupation .

		With the beginning of this story , --
Columbus	LOCATION	's experiences in
America	LOCATION	, the wild hunt which the Spanish explorers made for gold , the extinction of the native Indians , -- general readers are more or less familiar ; but the rest will be new to most of them .

		Giving only the salient points , the author pictures the social and institutional life of the island during a period of four hundred years , describes the acts of the reigning government , and points out the evils of colonial rule .

		In the second half of the work he gives the status of
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	under American control , aiming to present the matter in such a way that the reader can form an accurate judgment of past and present conditions .

		The writer , who is the Librarian of the
Free Public Library of San Juan	ORGANIZATION	, tells his interesting story in an easy , graphic style .

		Appended to the work is a valuable bibliography of Spanish writings on the sub - ject of the island .

		The book has twelve illustrations .

		In `` The Real Benedict Arnold '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles Burr Todd	PERSON	, not unfavorably known through previous works -- notably '' The True
Aaron Burr	PERSON	'' -- as a writer on Revolutionary history , has given us an unbiased account of the causes leading up to
Arnold	LOCATION	's desertion of his country .

		While the author does not in any sense attempt to lessen the enormity of
Arnold	LOCATION	's crime , he emphasizes his sub - The character and motives of
Benedict Arnold	LOCATION	.

July 16	DATE	, ject 's invaluable services to
America	LOCATION	, and points out that he four times saved the cause of the Colonies : first , at the battle of
Valcour	ORGANIZATION	's Island on
Lake Cham	LOCATION	- plain -LRB- the first naval battle in which our arms were engaged -RRB- ; second , by raising the siege of
Fort Stan	LOCATION	- wix in the
Mohawk Valley	LOCATION	and putting to flight St.
Leger	PERSON	's invading army marching to aid
Burgoyne	PERSON	; and , third and fourth , by winning the two battles at
Saratoga	LOCATION	, which , conjoined ,
Cressy	PERSON	included as one of the fifteen decisive battles of the world .

		Arnold 's wife was the beautiful ''
Peggy '' Shippen	PERSON	, of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , a member of one of the most influential families of the
Quaker City	ORGANIZATION	, who had been a general favorite with the British officers before she met Arnold , and particularly with the fascinating
John Andre	PERSON	.

		In deciding her choice for a husband , she saw in the military governor of the city and the major-general of the army great opportunities for social advancement and leadership .

		Correspondence with
Andre	PERSON	and other British officers was carried on after her marriage ; and Mr.
Todd	PERSON	maintains that it was the influence of
Arnold	LOCATION	's wife , with whom he was madly infatuated , and his fear of losing her should her treasonable correspondence with his coun - try 's enemies be discovered , that induced Arnold to betray his country , and not the gross injustice of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	nor the calumnies of paper generals -- the motives generally ascribed .

		An especially note - worthy illustration of the book is the reproduction of an old print representing the burning of Arnold in effigy .

		To the growing list of books describ - ing the steps by which our national territory has increased since colonial times , is added a volume entitled '' The American Advance , '' by Mr.
Edmund J. Carpenter	PERSON	.

		The book f ollow8 the conventional plan for such works , a sepa - rate chapter of from fifteen to sixty pages being given to each of the nine large additions to our do - main .

		Each chapter contains a careful chronological account of the negotiations and other steps that led to the acquisition of the territory under considera - tion , without partisan bias or undue national glori - fication .

		The book is devoted for the most part to the older territorial expansion , --
Cuba	LOCATION	,
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	,
Guam	LOCATION	, and the
Philippines	LOCATION	together having but a brief chapter of fifteen pages .

		There are no foot - notes , and the book is intended for the general reader .

		The Turk ^ r #
William Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	has given and hi * us an interesting book about the lost province * .

		Eastern Question , in a series of pen pictures , which are really a record of personal ob - servations concerning conditions in
Constantinople	LOCATION	and the
Balkan States	LOCATION	on the occasion of a trip which Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	made to the
East	LOCATION	, in
1901	DATE	, as a news - paper correspondent .

Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	an open one .

		Each nation , fearing that some other one will get more than its share of influence or political privileges , stands idly by and disregards human suffering oc - casioned by Turkish atrocities committed with im - punity in '' the Buffer States . ''

		War is pending , and must come ; the Turk must go .

		The day is not far distant when the Czar of
Russia	LOCATION	will occupy the Sultan 's throne .

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's work , done in light , easy , sketchy style , with not much of an attempt at literary finish , deals quite fully and interestingly with these and other phases of a very important subject .

		A treatise on Trust * and Combinations . ''

		Trust Finance : A Study of the Genesis , Organization , and Manage - ment of Industrial Combinations '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Dr.
Edward Sherwood Meade	PERSON	, of the
Wharton School of Finance and Economy	ORGANIZATION	, is an exceedingly sane and luminous discussion of a timely topic by one who is familiar with his subject .

		There are so many crude and erroneous notions extant with reference to trusts and combinations , that it is de - cidedly refreshing to examine a volume which treats of these matters in a dispassionate , intelligent and scholarly manner .

		The author says that the trust movement began in
1893	DATE	, following the industrial depression of that year .

		The industrial revival gathered strength in
1898	DATE	, and caused a general de - mand for the stocks of good paying corporations .

		Prof essor
Meade	PERSON	's work is divided into twenty chap - ters , which discuss competition , the function and office of the promoter in modern industry , the dis - posal of the stock of the trust , accumulation of sur - plus , provision of new capital , bond issue , funding policy , capitalization of corporations , decline of in - dustrial shares , investment possibilities , and sugges - tions for national legislation on corporation finance .

		This book supplies a demand not heretofore filled , and will command the interest of the practical man of affairs .

William Clarence Webster	PERSON	, is a recent educational publication of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and will do useful work in sup - plying the growing demand for modern text-books in the commercial courses that our high-schools are set - ting up so generally .

		A '' Guide to
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' is added to the series of travellers ' manuals published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The maps are numerous and particularly good , while the text is both compact and up-to-date .

		No other guide - book can be quite as good as a

		Ephemeral Bibelots '' appears on the title-page , and '' Modern Chap - Books and their Imitators '' upon the cover , of a pamphlet by Mr.
Frederick Winthrop Faxon	PERSON	, sent us by the
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In substance , this little work is a bibliography of the freakish toy periodicals that have sprung up in such numbers during the past ten years .

		But how does an ex-Secretary of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	reconcile with his conscience this provision of alternative titles ?

		Volume Till , of the '' Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature , '' published for
Harvard University by Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is given up to two extensive mono - graphs in the Arthurian field .

		Mr.
Arthur C. L. Brown	PERSON	is the author of '' Iwain : A Study in the Origins of Arthurian Romance , '' which comes first in the volume , and this work is followed by ''
Arthur	PERSON	and Gorlagon , '' a new text , edited with mucb apparatus chiefly relating to werewolves by Professor

United States	LOCATION	, federal control of commerce and corporations , Anglo-Saxon interests , the negro question , cabinets of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and a second edition of the bibliography of mercantile marine subsidies .

		Mr.
A. P. C. Griffin	PERSON	is the division chief under whose direc - tion these lists are prepared . ''

		The
Espurgatoire Saint Patriz	PERSON	of Marie de
France	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
T. Atkinson Jenkins	PERSON	, is a decennial publi - cation of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly ten years ago we mentioned an edition of the same work by the same editor , but since that publication the author has had access to important material which he did not then use .

		The present edition gives us in parallel columns both the French text and the Latin of the '' Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii '' of
Henricus Salteriensis	PERSON	, which was the original from which
Marie de France	ORGANIZATION	worked .

		This edition is thus made much more com - plete and valuable than its predecessor , and constitutes a highly creditable addition to the series of learned publications in which it is included .

		`` On the Literary Theories of
Taine	PERSON	and
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	'' is the title of a pamphlet published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	, and containing two lectures by Professor
A. T. W. Borsdorf	PERSON	.

		The tendency of the author 's crit - icism is destructive , as he aims only to help clear the way for the constructive work of the future .

		An unusually attractive guide-book to the city of
Boston	LOCATION	, prepared by Mr.
Edwin M. Bacon	PERSON	, is issued by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Original and authentic material , numerous maps in color and in diagram , handy indexes and running-titles , and good mechanical execution , help to make this one of the best city guides we know .

		A committee of the
Franklin	PERSON	and
Marshall College	ORGANIZATION	, of
Lancaster	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, has prepared a '' Catalogue of Officers and Students '' of that institution from the date of its founding in
1787	DATE	to the present time .

		An '' Obituary Record '' for recent years is also published .

		These two works are pamphlets , but they are accom - panied by a substantial bound volume of four hundred pages , giving a ■ History of Franklin and
Marshall College	ORGANIZATION	'' in ample detail .

		This is the work of Professor
Joseph Henry Dubbs	PERSON	, and is handsomely illustrated .

		The earlier chapters of this book , as may easily be under - stood , throw many interesting sidelights upon the be - ginning of the national period of American history .

		The latest batch of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	decen - nial publications includes a noteworthy examination , by Professor
Oliver Joseph Thatcher	PERSON	, of the questions con - nected with the papal grant of
Ireland	LOCATION	to
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Studies Concerning Adrian IT . ''

		is the title of this monograph , and the author accepts the view that the Bull Latidabiliter is a rhetorical exercise of no historical value .

		Other publications in this series are '' Scientific Method in Education , '' by Mrs.
Ella Flagg Young	PERSON	; `` Practical Theology , '' by Mr.
Gerald Birney Smith	PERSON	; '' The Elements of
Chrysostom	PERSON	's Power as a Preacher , '' by Professor

William Ernest Henley	PERSON	, who died on the
12th of this month	DATE	, at the age of fifty-four , was distinguished as poet , critic , and editor , while his strongly-marked and aggressive personality gave him an inspiring influence upon many of the younger men with whom he was associated .

		While editor of `` The Scots Observer , '' he almost founded a school of writers , so strongly did he impose himself upon the aspiring talents that found expression in that brilliant journal .

		He also edited , at different times , ''
London	LOCATION	, '' '' The Magazine of Art , '' and '' The New Review . ''

		He was one of
Stevenson	PERSON	's most intimate friends , and the two men wrote several plays in collaboration .

		His editions of
Burns	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	were enriched with much vigorous and characteristic com - mentary of the sort that often arouses violent antag - onisms .

		His place as a poet is high among the minor singers of the
last half-century	DATE	, and there are few lovers of poetry who do not have associations with his `` Hospital Rhymes , '' his `` London Toluntaries , '' and his ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	and Lavender . ''

		His verse is hot and full-blooded , caring little for nicety of expression , and in general exhibitive of far more energy than art .

		At any rate , there is little that is imitative about his work , and his originality is as unquestionable as his strength .

		BOOKS OF INTEREST AND UTILITY Edited by SHERWIN CODY A Selection from THE BEST ENGLISH ESSAYS Illustrative of the
History of English Prose Style	ORGANIZATION	.

		With Historical and
Critical Introduction	ORGANIZATION	by the Editor .

		The student of English prose style , whether he wishes to write prose himself , or to learn its elements , that he may judge the style of current writers , will find this a most suggestive and enlightening book .

		The general introduction defines and analyzes the essential elements of artistic prose , and the introductions to the different essayists point out the really important characteristic of each style .

		The selection , too , is fortunate in giving examples of ten great styles , all different and individual , which the student of English is invited to study and imitate . ''

		By reading such a book , with its intelligent historical and critical comments , it is possible for the average reader to get an idea of the English essay that can not be secured elsewhere . ''

		Since its publication Mr.
Cody	PERSON	's book has been adopted by twelve large universities , and a score of smaller institutions , which is a demonstration of its practical worth .

		Nothing just like it has ever been available , and students of literature have been quick to recognize this fact .

		This volume is far more than a collection of short tales that may as conveniently be read elsewhere , as the series of fourteen introductions to the various stories constitute the only comprehensive history of short story writing as an art ever published .

		In form and shape these books are especially convenient , being printed on thin Bible paper , so that in spite of their extensive contents they are scarcely three-quarters of an inch thick .

		Even old students of

Poe	ORGANIZATION	's criticism a detailed analysis of the general principles of novel-writing , and short-story writing , as well as the better known essays on poetry and examples of criticism of poetry , with his many pithy remarks on life and literature gathered from his journalistic book reviews .

		NOTES 70 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 70 A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE .

		L Following our custom of many years , we pub - lish , in this and another issue of The Dial , a summary of the reports contributed to `` The Athenaeum '' by various writers , upon the liter - ary production of the last twelvemonth in the principal European countries .

		The reports sum - marized in the present article are from
Belgium	LOCATION	, by Professor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	, from
Bohemia	LOCATION	, by Dr.
V. Tille	PERSON	, from
Denmark	LOCATION	by Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, from
France	LOCATION	, by
M. Jules Pravieux	PERSON	, and from
Germany	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Ernst Heilborn	PERSON	.

		Professor Fredericq gives us little more than a catalogue of the year 's production in
Belgium	LOCATION	.


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	comes first , but his new dram - atic piece , ''
Joyzelle	PERSON	, '' has not been as success - ful as the `` Monna Vanna '' of last year .

		Other plays are `` Jericho '' and '' Fatigue de Vivre , '' by
M. Edmond Picard	PERSON	, `` L'Imposteur Mag - nanime ,
Perkin Warbeck	PERSON	, '' by
M. Eekhoud	PERSON	; and '' Les Orties , '' by
M. Sander Pierron	PERSON	.

		The poets are represented by
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's '' Les Forces Tumultueuses , '' and
M. Gille	PERSON	's `` La Corbeille d'Octobre . ''

		The best novels are `` Le Petit Homme de Dieu , '' by
M. Camille Lemonnier	PERSON	; and `` Les Noces d'Or de Monsieur et de
Madame Van Poppel	ORGANIZATION	, '' which latter book completes the series devoted to the
Kakebroek	PERSON	family , a
Brussels	LOCATION	counterpart of
Herr Stinde	PERSON	's
Buchholz	PERSON	family of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Being himself a distinguished historian , Professor
Fredericq	PERSON	has much to say about writings in his own de - partment .

		Two books are singled out as par - ticularly important : Professor
Vanderkindere	PERSON	's `` La Formation Territoriale des Principautes Beiges an Moyen Age , '' and
M. Leo Errera	PERSON	's '' Les Juifs Busses , '' which declares the alter - natives to be emancipation and extermination .

		Flemish writers are also briefly discussed .

		Professor
Logeman	PERSON	's reexamination of the connection between '' Elckerlijk '' and '' Every - man '' is of timely interest .

		Mile .


Marie Belpaire	PERSON	studies the village novelists , from Conscience to
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	, in `` Het Land - 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, leven in de Letterkunde . '' ''

		The strongest dramatic work of the year has been the social - istic play by the well-known novelist
M. Buysse	PERSON	, *
Het Gezin Van Paemel	ORGANIZATION	, ' which shows small Flemish farmers at warfare with their village lord , their clergyman , the gamekeepers , and gendarmes , all conspiring to grind them down and reduce them to despair . ''

		Since Dr.
Tille	PERSON	wrote his last Bohemian ar - ticle , the foremost Bohemian poet , Mr.
Jaroslav Vrchlicky	PERSON	, has celebrated his fiftieth birthday , and added three books to his list : '' Votive Tablets , '' `` The Soul a Mimosa , '' and `` My Country . ''

		Mr.
Svatopluk Cech	PERSON	's poem , `` The Reapers , '' is also new , and affords '' a welcome proof that his creative powers have in no way abated . ''

		The Hus celebration has led to a pub - lication of all the works of the martyr , many of them from manuscripts only recently discov - ered .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	would have been glad to welcome the following piece of news : `` Amongst other prominent events in our literary world is the realization of a project which was men - tioned in last year 's report .

		A number of Bohemian writers have formed an independent publishing society called Maj , the chief object of which is to improve the material situation of literary men and women in this country , and it must be acknowledged that the endeav - ours of this new society have in a great measure suc - ceeded in promoting the interests of authors .

		They have helped to raise the fees for literary work , to ensure a greater share in the profits of books for the writers of them , and to protect rights in literary property . ''

		In belles-lettres , the following books are note - worthy : `` Passion and Strength , '' a social novel by Mr.
Hladik	PERSON	; `` From the Native Nest , '' by Mr.
Vaclav Vlcek	PERSON	; '' Books of
Remi	PERSON	- niscences , '' by Mr.
Ladislav Quis	PERSON	; '' A Ballad of a Man and His Joys , '' by the satirist , Mr.
Victor Dyk	PERSON	; and two plays based upon early Bohemian history , the work , respectively , of Mr.
Hilbert	PERSON	and Mr.
Alois Jirasek	PERSON	.

		`` The History of Bohemian Literature in the Nine - teenth Century '' is a joint work by several writers , and Dr.
Tille	PERSON	himself has published a book on '' The Philosophy of Literature Under
H. Taine	PERSON	and His Predecessors . '' ''

		The first point to notice about Danish lit - erature , '' writes Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	, '' is the rapid in - crease of its mass . ''

		The novels of the year have increased to one hundred and eighty , a jump of just fifty per cent , from the year before .

		But the quality of this writing seems to grow worse . ''

		It is a ruminating sort of literature ; the second generation of naturalism seems no longer able to produce vital art , but it has developed a rage for writing and a technical dexterity in the use of the pen which are aston - ishing . ''

		Historical fiction is coming back into favor , but it is now written by naturalists in - stead of romanticists .

		The chief work of this class is `` The King of All Sinners , '' by Mr.
Laurids Bruun	PERSON	, which '' deals with the heredi - tary sin which is handed down from father to son in unbroken line , and shows how the fate of a physically and mentally degenerate indi - vidual , in collision with the demands of a merci - less and impersonal society , must be tragic . ''

		The number of women writers is constantly increasing , and , as Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	puts it , '' every year they produce new , heavy books . ''

		Many of them also '' affect a rather vulgar taste , and luxuriate in pictures of indelicate and ambigu - ous love affairs , with details calculated to arouse sensation rather than satisfy the demands of the psychologist and the poet . ''

		At the head of this `` feministic school '' stands Mrs.
Agnes Henningsen	PERSON	, whose '' Spedalske '' treats of '' love as a sort of contagious , leprous condition '' -- truly a charming conception !

		A very differ - ent sort of book is '' The Mountain Priest , '' by Miss
Ingeborg Maria Sick	PERSON	, a tale of an orthodox clergyman with whom a modern young woman falls in love . ''

		She wins him but leaves him , seeing that he , through his vehement love for her , is being led away from his higher calling and becoming an inferior man . ''


Herr Valdemar Rordam	PERSON	's ''
Gudrun Dyre	PERSON	'' is '' a hymn to sensual love in praise of the flesh , an epic in verse with scarcely any - thing but love in it , and a theory of the free - dom thereof . ''

		Peasant literature is represented by
Herr Johan Skjoldborg	PERSON	's '' Gyldholm , '' which '' has some brilliant pages on the inter - course between the small cottagers and servants on a noble estate , but afterwards degenerates into a socialistic pamphlet . '' ''

		The edition of the collected works of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	in twelve volumes has been finished , and is now followed by a reprint of his polemical pamph - lets , which it would have been better certainly to leave uncollected on account of their bitter - ness and injustice . ''

		Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	's criti - cal study of this author will soon be completed .

		Dr.
Vedel	PERSON	has published '' Heroic Life , '' which '' pictures the primitive life of the ancient world in many countries and phases , as it developed under the strong and brilliant rule of war and the worship of all the warlike virtues . ''

		A book somewhat similar in subject , but very different in treatment , is
Herr Axel Olrik	PERSON	's '' Ancient Heroic Poems of
Denmark	LOCATION	. ''

		It is only a first part , and the author tries to settle solid principles for dealing with the old lays ,

		55 which often , under the influence of the great migration , were changed and remodelled .

		In opposition to the common tendency in the treat - ment of the sagas and lays , he tries to carry out a poetic and literary principle in his deal - ing with them An English edition of the book will soon appear . ''

		In his report upon French literature ,
M. Pravieux	PERSON	begins with the drama .

		The dram - atized novel exists in
France	LOCATION	also , and is illus - trated this year by
M. Emile Fabre	PERSON	's stage version of Balzac 's '' Menage de Ganjon , '' and If .


Henri Bataille	PERSON	's dramatization of Count Tolstoy 's '' Resurrection . ''

		The other note - worthy plays of the year are '' Theroigne de Mericourt , '' by
M. Paul Hervieu	PERSON	; '' Les Affaires Sont les Affaires , '' by
M. Octave Mirbeau	PERSON	; '' La Chatelaine , '' by
M. Alfred Capus	PERSON	: and '' L' Autre Danger , '' by
M. Maurice Donnay	PERSON	. ''

		Novelists , who become more and more numerous in
France	LOCATION	, may be arranged under two heads .

		Some remain faithful to the ancient traditional conception of the novel , and confine their studies to one subject only -- love .

		But , unfortunately , the public has for a long time become blase , and as it is difficult to rejuvenate so old a subject as the novel , itself as old as the hills , these writers too often think themselves bound to stim - ulate the idle curiosity of readers by applying them - selves solely to the passions and giving us unwholesome pictures in which art has no part .

		The others , without altogether refraining from the portrayal of love either in its tragic or its attractive phases , write novels with ideas concerning philosophic , social , and religious ques - tions .

		In such cases the novel becomes a pretext , or , to be more exact , a process by means of which some theme is brought before the general public , which , stripped of its fictional covering , would , by its mere appearance , scare away the reader .

		These books are , in fact , treatises disguised as novels .

		This kind of lit - erature is now much in vogue in
France	LOCATION	.

		Scarcely any didactic books are written , or , at least , scarcely any that are written are read . ''

		Among novels of the didactic category we have '' L'Etape , '' by
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	; ''
Les Deux Vies	PERSON	, '' by MM .

		Paul and
Victor Margueritte	PERSON	; `` La Maison du Peche , '' by Mme.
Marcelle Tinayre	PERSON	; '' Le Paradis de V Homme , '' by
M. Marc Andiol	PERSON	; '' Lettres a Francoise , '' by
M. Marcel Prevost	PERSON	; and `` L'Inutile Effort , '' by
M. Edouard Rod	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the other category come such books as `` La Peur de Vivre , '' by
M. Henry Bordeaux	PERSON	; '' Le Roman d'un Agrege , '' by
M. Leo Claretie	PERSON	; '' Dos d'Ane , '' by
M. Louis Boule	PERSON	; '' L'Inconstante , '' by Mme.
Marie de Regnier	PERSON	; and '' La Nouvelle Esperance , '' by the
Comtesse de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the present state of French fiction
M. Pravieux	PERSON	says : `` The critic with sufficient courage to attempt the perusal of the innumerable novels published yearly in
France	LOCATION	would doubtless acknowledge that talent is not wanting , though genius is not apparent , and master - pieces are rare .

		He would admire the gift of accurate and minute observation , the subtle psychology , the force , colour , and picturesque quality of the language -- ail these attributes of our writers ' talents ; bnt that would be the sole profit that our unhappy critic would derive from a gigantic task . ''

		In poetry , factions flourish , and the old order is giving place to the new .

		The Academy now crowns verse that violates most of the tradi - tional rules , as in the case of volumes by
M. Fernand Gregh	PERSON	and the
Comtesse de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principal quarrel now is between the Parnassians of day before yesterday and the Symbolists of yesterday .

		The latter include
M. Gustave Kahn	PERSON	, M. Jean More as , and
M. Henri Regnier	PERSON	.

		The last-named poet , we are informed , '' chisels out verse which for sculp - tural beauty , clearness of contour , and wisdom , is equal to the best work of his master ,
M. Maria de Heredia	PERSON	. ''

		Of the method and the art of history
France	LOCATION	is daily approaching a cleaner conception . ''

		History has learned the lesson of accuracy , and has been initiated into the methods of the neighboring sciences -- natural history , physiology , psychology , and social science .

		At a time when history is get - ting more mastery over its methods , and finds an increasing popularity among the cultured , it also enters into the possession of all sorts of hitherto unexploited resources . ''

		Noteworthy historical works of the year are M. Albert Van - dal 's '' L'Avenement de
Bonaparte	PERSON	, ''
M. Paul Gautier	PERSON	's ''
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	et
Napoleon	PERSON	, ''
M. Gabriel Hanotaux	PERSON	's '' Histoire de la
France Contemporaine	PERSON	, '' and , of particular interest to American readers , the work of the
Vicomte de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	, entitled '' Marins et Soldats Francois en Amerique pendant la Guerre de l'lnde - pendance des Etats-Unis . ''

		Among works of criticism and literary history ,
M. Gaston Bois	PERSON	- sier 's '' Tacite '' is given the first rank . ''

		He admires
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	without idolizing him .

		He not only praises his merits , but also throws light on his weaknesses , taking care to point out , however , that they belong more to the age in which he lived than to the man himself .

		This volume arrives in the nick of time to correct the false ideas of the illustrious author of the 1 Agricola ' held by so many .

		During the
second half of hist century	DATE	no one would recognize in him anything more than a just judge , a contemner of imperial cor - ruption .

		The next step , to disguise him as a demagogue , was one which was quickly taken .

		I gather from
M. Boissier	PERSON	's book that
Tacitus	PERSON	was not a republican in the sense in which we understand the term now . ''

		Other works in this field are ``
Andre Chenier	PERSON	, '' by
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	; '' Les Dernieres Annees de Chateaubriand , '' by
M. Edmond Bire	PERSON	; 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, `` L'ltalie des Romantiques , '' by
M. Urbain Mengin	PERSON	; '' Hommes et Idees du XIX e Siecle , '' by
M. Rene Doumic	PERSON	; '' Vus du Dehers , '' by Dr.
Max Nordau	PERSON	; and '' Les Ecrivains et les Mceurs , '' by
M. Henry Bordeaux	ORGANIZATION	.

		Philosophy and social science have been enriched by
M. Eugene de Roberty	PERSON	's study of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
M. Bougie	PERSON	's '' Les Idees Egalitaires , '' M. de Lanessan 's '' La Lutte pour l'Existence et l'Evolution des Societes , '' and
M. Vander	PERSON	- velde 's '' L'Exode Rural et le Retour aux Champs . ''

		Three noteworthy books of travel are mentioned : '' Au Pays d'Homere , '' by the Baron de Mandat-Grancey ; '' Siberie et
Cali	LOCATION	- fornie , '' by
M. Albert Bordeaux	PERSON	; and '' Chez les Cannibales , '' by the
Comte Testetich de Tolna	ORGANIZATION	.

		M. Pravieux concludes his com - mentary by saying that
France	LOCATION	still worships science , although no longer with the blind zeal of past years . ''

		Fiction , history , criticism , philosophy , and the drama can no longer be independent of science -- in fact , they are not .

		Even the poet , while allowing greater licence to his imagination , recognizes the idea of the world which modern physics supply . ''

		Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	, writing from
Germany	LOCATION	, takes literature in the restricted sense which recog - nizes only three classes of productions -- plays poems , and novels .

		Since he writes at length of the works selected for comment , his report is the most interesting of the entire series .

		He begins with some remarks on the sub - ject of
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's essays upon '' Die Verrohung in der Theaterkritik , '' which he takes to be the wail of a disappointed play - wright , who has failed to fulfil his early promise , and who thus scolds the public for its failure to appreciate his work .

		These essays , he says , `` were characteristic of their author , for they showed with terrible clearness that for
Suder	PERSON	- mann the artist 's manifestation of his powers means nothing more than the pursuit of out - ward success .

		They showed a man who has been overtaken in the race by more fortunate competitors , who has grown nervous and irri - table , and who looks for some external cause to explain his failure . ''

		Of the past year as a whole , Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	says that '' it has not pro- duced a single great and conspicuous work , but it has brought forth fruits of quiet and honest labour . ''

		Some would find an exception to this sweeping statement in `` Der Arme Heinrich '' of
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	, which even in the present discussion , is placed first and given the most extended analysis . ''

		Even in his earlier productions
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	showed a leaning toward mysticism , by which he sought to subdue , or at least give depth to , realism .

		He believed in death as the great power that transfigures life ; he cast round the secrets of the dying hour a web of hopeful surmise .

		In his new play , ' Der arme
Heinrich	PERSON	, ' this mysticism of death has , one may say , become a mysticism of life .

		Therein and therefrom must life find its regeneration ; in mystic self-absorption the sick man must be made whole .

		At the same time mysticism claims a place in the action of the play as well ; it makes a link in the close - wrought psychological chain .

		The unfortunate
Heinrich	PERSON	, smitten by leprosy , sets out to seek the physician at
Salerno	LOCATION	, accompanied by the maiden who is ready to sacrifice her heart 's blood for his sake .

		He is cured through her unques - tioning faith and cheerful self-sacrifice .

		Not in the sense in which the miracle takes place in
Hartman	PERSON	von
Aue	ORGANIZATION	's poem : there the knight repents at the critical moment , overcome with pity for the fair child whose naked body he sees threatened by the surgeon 's kuife , and so he starts with her apon his homeward journey as ill as when he came , till finally his deed of mercy awakens God 's mercy likewise , and he is freed from his disease . ''

		Next in interest to this work is
Herr Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	's '' Der
Schleier der Beatrice	PERSON	, '' a drama of
Bologna	LOCATION	and the Renaissance period .

		But this work is a little more than a year old , and we can not spare the space for an account of it . ''


Konig Laurin	PERSON	'' is the title of
Herr	PERSON	von
Wildenbruch	ORGANIZATION	's new play , which is concerned with the Goths after the death of Theodoric .

		Its power is all concentrated in a single scene , which is thus described : '' The Goths , assembled for a carousal , are celebrat - ing the memory of their king , Theodoric the Great , who has recently died ; a young Gothic noble , carried away by his enthusiasm , lifts the king 's drinking-cup on high and speaks -- not , however , of Theodoric the Great , but of
Dietrich	PERSON	of
Bern	LOCATION	.

		He has seen
Dietrich	PERSON	riding in the
morning twilight	TIME	over the sea , his fist clenched wrathfully against his foe , and behind him
Hildebrand	PERSON	, his ancient comrade-in-arms , mounted on a gallant steed .

		He has seen him wrestling with
Laurin	PERSON	, King of the Dwarfs , in the midst of the downtrodden rosegarden , when he robbed him of the cloak of darkness .

		For
Dietrich	PERSON	of
Bern	LOCATION	is not dead any more than his old an - tagonist
Laurin	PERSON	, the destroyer of all fair men --
Laurin	PERSON	, who always reappears upon the earth under a new name , and who reigns even now as -- the Emperor Justinian ! ''

		Of
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's ''
Maria von Magdala	PERSON	, '' we read that '' The conflict he raises in his heroine 's breast reminds one of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's '
Marion Delorme	PERSON	. '

		The courtesan , who has now expiated the sins of her former life , might save Jesus from being crucified , if only she would grant an influential Roman access to her chamber ; but she refuses to do so in the consciousness that unrighteous means must needs be abhorrent to Him who is righteous - ness itself .

		But the conflict , as such , seems an impos - sible one .

		It is a degradation of history to combine it with motives of such a kind . ''

		Of plays less weighty in their matter , the fol - lowing may be mentioned : '' Das Thai des
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 Lebens , '' by
Herr Dreyer	PERSON	; '' Die Lokalbahn , '' by
Herr Ludwig Thoma	PERSON	; '' Der Heerohme , '' by
Herr Josef Lauff	PERSON	; ''
Ledige Leute	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Dbrmann	PERSON	; '' Gerechtigkeit , '' by
Herr Otto Ernst	PERSON	; '' Kaltwasser , '' by
Herr Ludwig Fulda	PERSON	; and `` Das Dunkle Thor , '' by
Hen	ORGANIZATION	-
Felix Philippi	PERSON	.

		These pieces are farces or melodramas , and have little literary merit .

		The drama of popular life seems to be reviv - ing , especially in
Austria	LOCATION	, and is illustrated by
Herr Josef Werkmann	PERSON	's '' Der
Kreuzweg	PERSON	- stiirmer ' '' and
Herr Karl Schbnherr	PERSON	's ''
Sonn	PERSON	- wendtag . ''

		In lyric production , the new poems of
Frau M. E. delle Grazie	PERSON	, of
Herr Hugo Salus	PERSON	, of Frl .


Agnes Miegel	PERSON	, and
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's '' Ein Wintertagebuch '' are men - tioned .

		Turning to prose fiction , we begin with
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's new `` Novellen vom
Gar	PERSON	- dasee , '' but the author 's `` capacity for produc - ing direct effects is gone ; his craftsman 's hand no longer obeys him with absolute certainty .

		He has declined grievously in power of com - position , but he still retains his psychological cunning , he still finds the intrinsically right and necessary solution of his problems . ''

		Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach , on the other hand , although well past seventy , has remained young in comparison with the author of '' Im Para - diese , '' and '' Agave , '' her new novel , is a fine production . ''

		His story centres round a pupil of
Masaccio	ORGANIZATION	, whose life is a perpetual struggle to conquer art and win the woman he loves .

		But the youth who has shown rare skill as a potter , and in whose designs
Masaccio	PERSON	has recognized talent of an unusual order , is denied the gift of art in its higher form , and the im - petuous , madly jealous wooer is denied his love . ''

		Other fiction of the year comprises ''
Ein Ungliiekliches Volk	PERSON	'' -LRB- the Armenians -RRB- , by
Herr Rudolf Lindau	PERSON	; `` Vita Somnium Breve , '' by
Frau Ricarda Huch	PERSON	; '' Die

Herr Georg Hirschfeld	PERSON	; '' Der Uebergang , '' by
Herr J. J. David	PERSON	; and '' Arbeit , '' by
Frau Use Frapan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Concluding his article , Dr.
Heilborn	PERSON	says : '' A comparison taken from Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's * Master - builder ' might be applied to the literature of this year .

		No church spires have been erected , nor yet have fancy and desire reared any daring castles in the air ; but none the less have we built homesteads where men can dwell -- homesteads with nurseries in them . ''

		Half a
Century of Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		* No one is better qualified to give an account of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	during the last half-century than Ex - President
Dwight	PERSON	.

		As the descendant of a former president , as student , tutor , professor and president , as acting treasurer for two years and occupant of the college pulpit for six and a half , he has had every opportunity to become thoroughly imbued with the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	spirit , and to make himself master of her traditions and his - tory .

		His intimate personal acquaintance with the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	faculty and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men of his time en - ables him to present a series of portraits of extraordinary interest and fidelity .

		Even the general reader , to whom the university at
New Haven	ORGANIZATION	makes no special appeal , will find these pen-portraits well worth examining .

		The amia - ble idiosyncrasies of the old-time college pro- fessor are most pleasantly touched upon by a sympathetic hand ; and , to him who chooses to read between the lines , the artist gives many features of his own portrait by showing so in - evitably what qualities he most admires in others .

		Yale 's remarkable growth in the period under review , a growth to which Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	contri - buted so notably , forms an instructive and en - couraging chapter in the history of higher education .

		When Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	entered college the whole student body was smaller than a single class of the present day , and the total endowment far less than the annual income now enjoyed by the university .

		The standard of scholarship has undergone an equal change for the better since the days when the elder
Silliman	PERSON	, examining candidates in geography , made grievous complaint of their defective preparation , and cited in illustration the sub - freshman 's answer to the question , '' Who founded St.
Petersburg	PERSON	? '' ''

		St.
Peter	PERSON	, '' was the ingenious answer .

		-LRB- But it parenthetically observed , as the author points out , that the question had about as little to do with geog - raphy as the answer . -RRB-

		Those were the days when the Latin professor 's task was largely to bring

		58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, author ventures to question the necessary con - nection between the two .

		As appropriate to this season , and as illustrating the author 's genial style , let us cite what he has to say on the subject of vacation , then and now . ''

		The
summer	DATE	vacation , at that period , continued for only six weeks -- Commencement Day being the
third Thursday	DATE	of
August	DATE	, and the autumn term beginning about the twenty-eighth of
September	DATE	.

		It was not then regarded as necessary for the health of young peo - ple that they should finish their yearly studies before the hot weather arrived , or to that of older persons , that they should spend the warm season among the hills or by the seaside .

		Indeed , for the ordinary citizen , vacations were not looked upon as an essential part of life .

		They were , in a certain measure , the privilege of boys and their teachers -- the teachers having the en - joyment granted them because it was deemed needful that the boys should have it .

		Why it was universally considered so necessary for the boys , we young fellows never put ourselves to the task of finding out .

		Possi - bly the task might have been fruitless , if it had been undertaken .

		We accepted the fact , and , raising no troublesome inquiries , we felicitated ourselves on the good fortune which the world had consented to give us .

		It is half a century since then -- and I may say , in passing , that I have in all the years followed the wise course of my boyhood and have ever avoided the ques - tion which I then put aside -- adopting in this regard the comforting theory that ' what is , is right , and what is right is best . '

		... ' Much study is a weariness to the flesh ' ; and so the resting-time was made to follow the working-time ... The scholar fancies , in his boyhood years , that he knows to the utmost the blessing of vaca - tion time .

		But we may pity his ignorance .

		It is the teacher who has the full understanding . ''

		Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	refers more than once , disap - provingly , to the Spartan discipline that pre - vailed at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	for many years after his entrance .

		The weeding-out process was carried to an ex - cess .

		In meeting the freshman class for the purpose of administering a word of wholesome counsel at the outset of the college course , President Day was accustomed to remind these young hopefuls , as the simplest and most na - tural and perhaps most desirable thing in the world , -- '' Doubtless not more than one-half your number will graduate . ''

		This cheerful prophecy was literally fulfilled in the case of Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	's class .

		One hundred and ten en - tered ; fifty-five achieved the bachelor 's degree .

		Not a little of the reform that subsequent years have brought in this matter of discipline is due to Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	himself .

		As the chief charm of this volume lies in its life-like portrayal of illustrious men now de - ceased , it will not be amiss to quote somewhat largely from these character-sketches .

		Eefer - ring to the elder
Silliman	PERSON	's kindly attitude toward the students , the author relates the following : '' I had presented myself before him , on a certain occasion near the end of my academic course , for an examination on studies in his department .

		He asked me to take a chair near him in his room , and then , in a way peculiar to himself -- a way which was very help - ful , rather than embarrassing to the student -- he ques - tioned me on various points for half an hour .

		Then , rising and going to the table , he looked at some papers , and , selecting one , said : ' I suppose you would like to have me give you a certificate that your examination has been satisfactory , which you may hand to the Presi - dent . '

		I gave him , of course , an affirmative answer .

		He then handed me the paper , saying , `` Not doubting that you would pass , I wrote the certificate before you came in . '

		These last words that he spoke were better , if possible , than my assured success .

		They have re - mained in my memory as a part of my mental picture of the man . ''

		But there was nothing weak or childish in this mildness of manner .

		In all cases of grave im - portance the old professor was a wise disci - plinarian , '' a tower of strength , '' as President
Woolsey	PERSON	used to call him .

		When his son ,
Benjamin Silliman	PERSON	, junior , became an in - structor in the college , the two were popularly , but not disrespectfully , known as Old
Ben	PERSON	and
Young Ben	PERSON	.

		As the author observes , such student appellations are oftener affectionate than disrespectful , and the professor who chooses to make a grievance of the matter may well be advised to seek some other sphere of usefulness .

		Those who knew the late Prof.
Othniel C. Marsh	PERSON	, and who also know Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	, will appreciate the humor of the following .

		Refer - ring to Professor
Marsh	PERSON	and to his own pres - idency , the writer says : `` In his attitude and in his manner of expressing himself , a certain formality was characteristic of him .

		Especially was this manifest in cases where he sought an interview with others on matters of business , or on subjects of interest with respect to his own particular work .

		The slight and somewhat peculiar hesitation in his utterance rendered this formality more conspicuous .

		I was always struck with this singularity of manner when he called upon me , as he occasionally did , for the purpose of securing some minor appropriation of money for his department of the museum ... Whatever the object might be , the manner of the man was the same .

		It was as if we had been two ministers of state having little acquaintance with each other , who had met for the settlement of some great question of public concern .

		All was serious , with a dignified solemnity , and measured with a diplomatic deliberateness .

		My own bearing was , as of necessity , determined by his .

		One could not talk after the ordi - nary method , and with the freedom of a common con - versation , when the other party in the interview seemed to place the subject and the discussion on a plan * so much higher .

		I was not able fully to equal him , but my approaches to his standard were , for the time and by reason of effort , so near to it that I think he was satisfied .

		I could , indeed , be as immovably serious in my look , as he could himself be .

		This is a gift for

		THE DIAL .

		59 which I have sometimes felt that I ought to be grateful .

		My look , also , in a measure , solemnized my speech ; and so , with the friendly spirit which we always had , we moved on with a reasonable success , fiat I used often to think , just after such an interview had closed , of the possibilities of the thoughts on the two sides re - specting it .

		Did either of the two parties quite under - stand tbe impression produced on the mind of the other ?

		Was the look of either quite the same that it had been a few moments before ?

		It is enough , no doubt , to know that all is well that ends well . ''

		President
Woolsey	PERSON	's personal force is strik - ingly illustrated by an anecdote .

		A certain class , dating about forty years ago , had planned an entertainment of some sort , accompanied with dancing , and much interest was felt in the success of the occasion .

		But , as is not unusual in such college events , considerable partisan excitement had been aroused , and this excite - ment increased as the appointed day drew near , until the final issue became a matter of some anxiety . ''

		Without the knowledge of the class , the President , at a late stage of the controversy , was made aware of the condition of things .

		He met the emergency at once in his own mind , and on the morning of the day before the entertainment was intended to be given -- when all thoughts were eager with expectation and doubtful as to a peaceful result -- he rose in presence of the as - sembled company of students , and said : ' I understand that a plan has been formed by the Senior Class for a ball to-morrow evening , and that much contention has arisen in the class respecting certain matters connected with it .

		There will be no ball . '

		The question was im - mediately settled for every member of the class , and the excitement died away because its cause was removed . ''

		The author 's views on various matters of col - lege education and administration are set forth impressively , not to say convincingly .

		Speak - ing of the measure of power to be granted to the executive head of a college or university , he refers to the extreme view of those who would clothe the president with an authority similar to that of the head of a great com - mercial establishment ; and he also cites the suggestion of President
Woolsey	PERSON	that the pres - ident 's office be superseded by something like the rectorship prevailing in German univer - sities .

		The
Yale	ORGANIZATION	system has ever been , and is now , a sort of compromise between these two .

		Although the president has the right of veto on all faculty action , he governs with the advice and consent of his faculty ; and this plan Dr. D wight regards as the best , and as adapted , in all essential points , to the spirit of the times .

		On the question of shortening the college course , now furnishing matter for considerable dis - cussion both wise and foolish , Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	pronounces emphatically for continuing the old order of things , and advises the shortening of the preparatory curriculum , so that the boy may enter college at sixteen or seventeen , instead of eighteen or nineteen .

		He holds that if a young man finishes his academic and his profes - sional education , and enters on the serious busi - ness of life , at twenty-six , that is early enough .

		To all in any way interested in education , as well as to those who take a special interest in
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Dwight	PERSON	's book is most heartily to be commended .

		The only regret is that its five hundred pages of varied and entertaining mat - ter are followed by no index .

		Portraits , as well as views of buildings , are lavishly supplied .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The only Presidential , Impeachment Trial .

		* No gift of prophecy is required to see that , as time gives the proper perspective , the period of Reconstruction following the Civil War will command a paramount interest in the history of our country .

		As a crisis when the scales of life or death for representative government trembled at the equipoise , it surpasses any moment of the great war which produced it .

		During the time of the appeal to arms , there could be little question of the outcome after the policy of coercion had been determined upon and the people had rallied to the call .

		The overwhelming odds in favor of Northern numbers , equipment , and resources , made the conquest of the protestants a matter of human endurance .

		Free government was never for an instant in real danger in the North .

		The aim was simply the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, with all its forms intact .

		But Reconstruction changed Northern feel - ings and aims completely .

		Flushed with victory , the conquerors , in their attempt to `` reconstruct '' the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, struck at the vital principles of self-government .

		The building was threatened with destruction in the effort to restore it .

		One portion of the people was to be held subject to the other .

		The policy decided on required the erection of an auto - cratic empire on free soil .

		No rights were to be accorded a conquered minority .

		But suddenly the action checked itself .

		A unanimity of opinion in this sudden perversion was not to be hoped for ; and this very dif - ference brought on a conflict between two branches of the victorious national govern - * The Impeachment and Trial of

		If the attention of the radicals , whose exist - ence was due to the necessary force - measures of the war , had not thus been drawn away from the objects of their wrath to centre upon President
Johnson	PERSON	, one hesitates to predict the permanent injury which might have been wrought to the principles of free government .

		In this sense ,
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	was a vicarious sacrifice .

		And as such he is pictured in an excellent history of his impeachment and trial by Mr.
David Miller Dewitt	PERSON	.

		In this , the author has not been blind to
Johnson	PERSON	's faults , although frequently inclined to gloss them over .

		The President by chance faced a prob - lem which would have tried the powers of the president chosen by the people ; yet ''
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	was not
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' as the author says . ''

		His personal self-sufficiency , his unbounded confidence in the rectitude of his public acts , and the steady fire of his com - bativeness , '' are phrases which indicate the final estimate of him .

		One must not expect this volume to be free from partisanship in behalf of
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Sometimes this is shown by writing down his enemies , especially
Stanton	PERSON	. ''

		The Genius of Duplicity '' is summoned to guard the shade of the ex-Secretary of War , as the testimony of Sumner is recalled showing
Stanton	PERSON	's private opinion of Grant while soliciting an office at his hands .


John Sherman	PERSON	is accused of jug - gling the order of charges in the final vote , '' to avoid an utter loss of self-respect . ''

		The cry of Sumner for a verdict of '' guilty '' is compared with the tirades of
Robespierre	LOCATION	in the Convention .


Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, the most implacable of
Johnson	PERSON	's enemies , is treated with greater leniency , perhaps because he was al - ways a fair fighter .

		The accusation is made that '' the two
Nebraska	LOCATION	senators fulfilled the con - tract of their admission '' by voting '' guilty . ''

		In no part of the book is the author more interesting than in his description of the dra - gooning to which the doubtful senators were subjected just before the vote in the
Impeach	LOCATION	- ment trial . ''

		He shows the risk a statesman runs who pares oppose his personal convictions against party policy .

		This was especially true of Sena - tor
Ross	PERSON	of
Kansas	LOCATION	, whose political career was cut short by his negative vote .


Ross	PERSON	wrote a vindication of his action , which was printed at
Albuquerque	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	, in
1896	DATE	, his place of residence at the time , but which the present author evidently did not use .

		Senators
Trum	PERSON	- bull of
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Doolittle	PERSON	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	were also conspicuous victims to the vengeance of party rule .

		The conclusions from this concise study of the trial may be found in these words : '' Had this first impeachment eventuated in the re - moval of the Chief Magistrate , a precedent would have been established of the most fatal character -- consti - tuting a perpetual menace to the stability of our execu - tive , a spreading blight upon our character and credit as a nation , a standing reproach to the republican form of government , and gradually leading to a national habit of capricious political convulsions to put one president in place of another such as have disgraced some of the republics of Central and
South America	LOCATION	... Never will the practice of deposing presidents by political impeach - ment become domiciliated in this republic .

		Centuries will pass by before another President of the
United States	LOCATION	can be impeached , unless the offense of which he is accused is clearly non-political and amounts unmis - takably to a high crime or misdemeanor . ''

Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, in his `` History of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	, '' Vol .

		I. pp. 1-253 .

		In clearness and directness of statement it does not equal
Rogers	PERSON	, but in the multiplicity of facts that are presented it surpasses that earlier work .

		The most elaborate section of the volume , very naturally , is that devoted to the American excavations at Nuffar -LRB- pp. 289-568 -RRB- .

		It discusses with minute detail the history and pi-ogress of that series of campaigns from
1888	DATE	to the present time .

		It is evident to the im - partial reader , before he gets far into the nar - rative , that this section of the book is taking on a controversial character .

		The editor soon pits himself against Dr.
John P. Peters	PERSON	, the director of the first two campaigns -LRB- compare pp. 321-2 , 327-8-9 , 339 note 1 , 408 , 415 -RRB- .

		Throughout the whole of the treatment , the reader is now and then so forcibly reminded of an unpleasant controversy that his ardor over the recital of brilliant discoveries is chilled .

		Disputes and disagreements as to the proper method of conducting excavations may always arise between leaders of campaigns , but it hurts public confidence and public respect to witness such wranglings .

		Professor
Hilprecht	PERSON	has done valuable service in publishing the texts issued some years ago , and in populariz - ing information on discoveries in the
Orient	LOCATION	, and in determining some of the technique of ancient Nippur .

		These are certainly eminent services to knowledge .

		Therefore we are the more chagrined to find so much valuable space and time , in a work for popular circulation , given to the discussion of matters that gratu - itously disturb the peace of mind of the reader .

		This whole section reveals to us Nippur as one of the great cities of a great past .

		The revelations made through the campaigns of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	must re-cast our conceptions of the civilization of
Babylonia	LOCATION	in the fourth and third millenniums
B.C.	LOCATION	, and con - sequently greatly modify all former views of the beginnings and growth of the most ancient civilization of the world .

		The section -LRB- pp. 623-690 -RRB- on ''
Excava	PERSON	- tions in
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Steindorff	PERSON	, is well written , and gives the reader a very fair conception of many of the best results of ex - ploration on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	within a century .

		- Of course , the space at his disposal is manifestly cramped , but it has been wisely employed for the benefit of the lay reader .

		Professor
Hommel	PERSON	has presented -LRB- pp. 691 -- 752 -RRB- a good bird 's - eye view of '' Explorations in Arabia . ''

		The hazardous work of
Glazer	PERSON	within recent years has made this dangerous field more fascinating and valuable than ever before .

		With the exception of some technical philological matters , the reader will get much of value in this story .

		`` The So-called Hittites and their Inscrip - tions '' is the theme discussed by Professor
Jensen	PERSON	of Marburg .

		His article is an exposi - tion of his own method of deciphering the Hittite inscriptions , -- a method that finds in them kinship with the language of modern
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		This article will be of least interest to the popular reader , because of its technical matter .

		The entire volume is profusely illustrated ; the reproductions from photographs are gen - erally admirable , while those made from draw - ings are quite uneven in value .

		The four maps accompanying the book are excellent , and aid the reader in localizing the travels of explor - ers and points of explorations .

		The volume is issued in sumptuous form , printed on calen - dered paper , with beautiful clear type , with a smaller size in the foot-notes .

		These foot - notes are full of valuable bibliographical mat - ter , such as the scholar or investigator may wish to examine in further research .

		The vol - ume occupies a position quite unique in the his - tory of exploration in
Bible	LOCATION	lands , and gives to the public the editor 's large service in this great work , -- a service whose character and scope as here represented have unfortunately stirred up a warm contention among scholars .

		The Conspirac y of
Aaron Burr	PERSON	.

		* One of the most interesting chapters of American history is that which relates the conspiracy of
Aaron Burr	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the inter - est arises from the fact that this episode seems to be so wholly out of keeping with the gen - eral character of American events .

		That a man of political influence and ability , a former leader in republican councils , engaged in the prosy profession of law and living in the rather unromantie century just past , should suddenly take to knight-errantry and set out to win him - self an empire , is a matter that we should hardly expect to find recorded in our own matter-of - fact annals .

		And the mystery that pervades the whole undertaking serves to heighten the romance .

New York	LOCATION	:

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, to what
Burr	PERSON	's real purposes were .

		Did the conspirators plan to wrest
Mexico	LOCATION	from
Spain	LOCATION	, or the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	from the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Or did their purpose embrace both these ends ?

		For nearly a century the problem waited for a satisfactory solution ; but when Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	, in his masterly history of the Jeffersonian period , declared
Burr	PERSON	a traitor , it was thought that the matter had been finally disposed of .

		The evidence seemed conclusive , and scholars settled down to the belief that in the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	a vast conspiracy existed in the West looking toward the establishment of a mighty empire extending from
Pittsburg	LOCATION	to
Panama	LOCATION	.

		But the present year has produced a work on this subject which students of history will read with great interest .

		Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	's work is the result of several years ' research ; it makes a book of about 350 pages , and impresses the reader as a remarkably thorough effort .

		In addition to the older , fairly well-known , material , the author has made use of sources hitherto unknown .

		His exploitation of Texan , Mexican , and British archives , has added much to our knowledge , not only of
Burr	PERSON	's conspiracy , but also of kindred subjects .

		Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	takes the position that
Burr	PERSON	's plans were directed against
Mexico	LOCATION	only .

		The evidence formerly relied on to prove
Burr	PERSON	's traitorous intentions exists in the form of a few letters .

		There is also the testimony of Gen - erals
Wilkinson	PERSON	and
Eaton	PERSON	; but no historian who values his reputation would dare depend on their statements .

		The former is infamous as the most successful traitor , and one of the most consummate prevaricators , that our his - tory knows .

		The latter is also a suspicious character .

		Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	is certainly safe in arguing that a man who could urge the Presi - dent to send as our minister to
Spain	LOCATION	or En - gland one whom he knew to be intriguing with the representatives of those very nations , and to have threatened to assassinate the President and to loot the capital , can hardly be accepted as a trustworthy witness .

		Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	lays great stress on
Burr	PERSON	's own statements to the English and Spanish ministers .

		But Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	contends that these were but '' a consummate piece of impos - ture . ''

		Burr needed funds , and
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	were thought willing to assist any ven - ture that looked toward the dismemberment of our
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hence they were asked to finance a fictitious revolt or to pay for mythical secrets .

		This interpretation is at least plausible .


Burr	PERSON	's famous letter of
July 29 , 1806	DATE	, in which he unfolds his plans to General
Wilkin	PERSON	- son , has long been looked on as furnishing the key to the whole conspiracy .

		But Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	shows that this letter is capable of at least two interpretations , of which the older seems the least probable .

		The author also makes good use of
Clark	PERSON	's letter to
Wilkinson	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	construes as a warning against one Mr.
Minor	PERSON	, of
Natchez	LOCATION	, who was supposed to have revealed the secrets of the conspirators .

		But the letter , when cited in full , appears to be more than this : it is a warning against ' a man who invents and circulates absurd tales .

		The author is not satisfied with weakening the evidence of the prosecution .

		He proceeds with a positive argument along three principal lines : The West hated
Spain	LOCATION	, and longed for an opportunity to help liberate
Mexico	LOCATION	; the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	was loyal to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, not even the Creoles at
New Orleans	LOCATION	plotted sedi - tion ; the panic that struck the country when
Burr	PERSON	's expedition finally started south was largely the result of
Wilkinson	ORGANIZATION	's activity in circulating false and alarming reports .

		The parts of Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	's work that deal with the state of public sentiment in the West are particularly strong and enlightening .

		The older view is manifestly shaken .

		Burr himself may have had traitorous designs , but that can not be known .

		The author rarely tries to apologize for
Burr	PERSON	, and succeeds rather poorly when he does try .

		But the
New York	LOCATION	lawyer was not alone in the conspiracy .

		With him were associated such men as
Blenner	PERSON	- hassett ,
Dayton	LOCATION	,
Senator Smith	PERSON	, and perhaps
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	.

		It is hard to believe that these and others , knowing the opinions of their neighbors , would join in a venture that public sentiment would not support for a moment .

		In some respects , Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	's book is not wholly satisfactory .

		The author at times al - most ceases to be a historian and becomes something of an advocate .

		And in this con - nection it should be said that his treatment of
Jefferson	PERSON	is rather unfair .

		Burr , on the other hand , is permitted to display his better side almost continuously ; it is to be feared that the picture of the conspirator which would develop in the mind of the general reader would be decidedly unlike the original .

		Perhaps the literary critic will tell us that the unity of style is largely impaired by the introduction of documentary material into almost every page of the text .

		But after all these things have been said , the fact remains that Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 has presented his thesis in a clear , scholarly and convincing manner .

		That he has made a nota - ble contribution to American history , can not be doubted .

		Whether the world of scholarship will accept his conclusions , remains to be seen .

		This starts Felix to reading the ''
Comedie Humaine	PERSON	, '' which he devours from first to last .

		Thus equipped , he believes that he knows the human heart in all its manifestations , and goes home to apply his knowledge .

		He falls an easy victim to the morphinomane , and when he learns the truth , his faith in books -- even in the books of M. de
Balzac	LOCATION	, -- is considerably shaken .

		The story is thoroughly unpleasant ; it can profit no one to read , and may not even be described as enter - taining .

		Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	, who gave us `` The Traitors '' a few weeks ago , now gives us '' A Prince of Sinners . ''

		On the whole , we prefer the weaver of adventurous romance in an imaginary Balkan kingdom to the topical novelist of modern
London	LOCATION	. '

		• A Prince of Sinners '' gives us dubious philan - throphy of the social settlement type and bad economics in a defence of the miserable sophistries of protectionism .

		The hero is a young man who es - pouses both these causes , and who at the same time carries on two love affairs so skilfully that we are kept guessing until the very end .

		The piince of sinners is the father of the youth , who had deserted wife and child many years before , and caused a fictitious report of his death to be spread abroad When he reappears in
England	LOCATION	, it is as the wealthy
Earl	PERSON	of Arranmore -LRB- he having succeeded unexpect - edly to the title and estates -RRB- , and in his endeavor to be helpful to the career of his son -LRB- who does not recognize him for a time -RRB- the relationship is discovered .

		Even then the son will not accept his newly-found father , but persists in the attempt to carve out his own career under his assumed name .

		It is a case of pride against pride , but in the end the older man makes a great concession , and the younger man gives in .

		The lesser social types depicted are presented with an easy skill that be - tokens familiarity with several phases of modern English life .

		Barring the inherent improbability of its scheme , the story is a readable one .

		Mr.
F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	has gone back to Crom - well 's ravaging of
Ireland	LOCATION	for the subject of his latest novel , '' Castle Omeragh . ''

		The action covers the period from
Drogheda	LOCATION	to
Clonmel	LOCATION	, and we are given a vivid picture of the horrors which have made '' the curse of Cromwell '' a potent and sinister watchword to this day .

		These dreadful happenings are kept mostly in the background , but we are made to realize them none the less , and to under - stand how they have kept Irish passion inflamed ever since .

		The actual theme of the romance is the attempt of a small detachment of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's forces to capture an outlying stronghold , and the eventual triumph of its defenders .

		A double love - story figures conspicuously in the plot , which is interesting and well-developed , and open to crit - icism only on account of its serious use of the supernatural motive of crystal-gazing .

		Cromwell himself appears briefly upon the seene in the closing chapters .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	is always a welcome visitor 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, to our reading-table , for his mastery of ingenious and humorous romance insures us a session of enjoy - ment whenever a new book comes to hand from his pen .

		The number of his books is now sixteen -- a fact which we hardly realized until we counted them in the list which accompanies the new volume -- and nearly every one of the sixteen evokes some memory of delight . ''

		The Adventures of Harry Revel '' is a story of the surprising adventures of a foundling , who leaves the institution that has sheltered his child - hood to become an apprenticed chimney-sweep .

		His experiences in this capacity soon launch him upon a surprising series of adventures , which end by his taking ship for
Portugal	LOCATION	as a bugle-boy in the En - glish army .

		The time is that of the Peninsular War , and the capture of
Ciudad Rodrigo	ORGANIZATION	occupies the closing chapters .

		The story is told in the first person , and the hero is only fifteen years of age when we take leave of him , but it must not be in - ferred from this fact that the book is one of merely juvenile interest .

		Far from this , it deals with such matters as the murder of a Jewish miser , a smug - gling episode on the Cornish coast , the mock marriage of a beautiful girl , and the Virgilian translations of her venerable father .

		With all these things the boy becomes mixed up as a witness , and occupies the centre of the stage most of the time .

		Nor must we forget the quaint and delightful figure of the old maid whose special charge he is at the foundling 's home , and whose addiction to verse - writing provides the author with an opportunity for the display of his most genial humor .

		With every new novel by Mrs.
Henry Dudeney	PERSON	, we feel more and more impressed with the idea that a mantle of similar cut to the one worn by Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	rests upon her shoulders .

		This vari - ation of the usual metaphor is necessary because Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is fortunately still living .

		Mrs.
Dadeney	PERSON	's rustics are of the same race as Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's , and her account of their environment gives us a similar sense of the earthiness that clings to unsophisticated humanity everywhere .

		She gives us with marvel - ous fidelity the raciness , the dry humor , the super - stitious notions , and the peculiarities of dialect that survive in rural
England	LOCATION	to this day , and that con - tact with culture seems powerless to modify .

		This persistence of rude primeval types of life and thought in the vicinage of civilized conditions is impressed upon us with singular force by the two novelists whose names are thus naturally linked to - gether , and remains dominant in our recollection of their work .

		Yet ''
Robin Brilliant	PERSON	, '' Mrs.
Dadeney	PERSON	's new novel , is by no means chiefly concerned with rustics ; on the contrary , its '' interest is centred al - most wholly about a man and a woman who stand for generations of aristocratic culture , and the back - ground of village and rural life serves only as artistic relief .

		But somehow the background strikes us as being the most genuine part of the book .

		The char - acters of both hero and heroine are wrought with exceeding subtlety of analysis -- the woman even more so than the man , as is inevitable in a woman 's novel -- but the pale cast of thought that comes with over-civilization makes it impossible for either of them to act with conviction and determination .

		The right path , the path of contentment , if not happiness , lies plainly before them both , but the man wavers , and the woman balks at decision , and the outcome is satisfaction with a lower ideal for the one , and a future of proud but dreary isolation for the other .

		Modern life affords such types and such situations , no doubt , but they are not creditable to modern civilization . ''

		Frank Danby '' is the pen-name of a woman who writes novels under the tutelage of Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		At least , this was formerly the case , but since a recent acrimonious exchange of discourtesies between the two in the columns of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' we presume that the relation of master and disciple has been dissolved .

		We are not ac - quainted with the earlier books of this writer , but her new novel `` Pigs in Clover , '' is calculated to attract attention .

		The influence of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's literary methods is evident in the realism of this social study and in its unabashed handling of dis - agreeable types and situations .

		In the interest of the story she has to tell , we should say that the pupil had outdone the teacher .

		We do not alto - gether approve of the artistic methods which she employs , but are all the time impressed by the fact that the work is a product of an intensely conscious art , in which every effect is carefully planned , and nothing left to chance on the impulse of the moment . ''

		Pigs in Clover '' is not an engaging title , and will probably keep many readers from the book thus unfortunately christened .

		It is the contemptuous phrase which one of the characters -- a blue-blooded lady -- uses to describe the nouveaux riches of English society .

		The particular application of this phrase is to the South African millionaire , for the time covered by the novel includes just the years in which the mining-fields of the
Rand	ORGANIZATION	reached their highest development , the years preceding and in - cluding the raid of Dr.
Jamieson	PERSON	and its striking consequences .

		Rhodes and other actual characters figure in the novel under their own names ; still others appear in easily penetrated disguises .

		The political point of view maintained by the writer is that of imperialism , and she justifies the English attitude during the years that preceded the out - break of the war by pleading the paramount interest of a superior over an inferior civilization .

		The brutality of the individual Boer and the corruption of the Boer government are painted in colors so dark that any measures , whether of defence or aggression , seem warranted .

		The book is not , how - ever , in its essence , a novel of Boer and English - man in
South Africa	LOCATION	; it is a novel of Jew and
Gentile	PERSON	, of parvenu and aristocrat , in
London	LOCATION	.

		Still more essentially is it a novel of individual passion , of the incredible lengths to which a woman 's de - votion may lead her , even when the object of her attachment is a man of the most despicable mean - ness and selfishness .

		For with all its variety of
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 other interests , this is the leading motive of the novel , and this is the relation which brings it to a tragic close .

		It is hard for as to accept as possible a woman so enslaved as
Joan	PERSON	, or the power to charm of so miserable a wretch as
Louis Althaus	PERSON	.

		That the author holds in deadly earnest her belief in the reality of the relation she so remorselessly depicts is made evident by the striking statement made of her thesis in advance of its application : `` There is a mystery known to all who know men and women , to all who have insight into , sympathy with , or understanding of , their fellow-travellers , bnt it is blank and incomprehensible to the Pharisees , and to all who would read and ran at the same time .

		This is a mystery that fills the divorce courts , mocks the incredulous , and sets at naught all creeds and convictions .

		It is that a certain something , subtle , sweet , and rare , not a perfume , not a touch , but an echo of both , light , elusive , all-pervading , is the special property of some loose-living men , a property that is beyond the reach of analysis , but recognisable in the freemasonry of the passions by all who have realised its existence .

		It is as the candle to the moth , as the rose to the butterfly , as the magnet to the steel .

		It is a surface lure of sex , it is an all-compelling whisper , almost it seems that to hear it is to obey . ''

		This passage , which can not fail to attract the attention of the most casual reader , will doubtless be singled out , and rightly so , by every serious reviewer as the most noticeable thing in the book .

		And yet , convinced as we may be of its truth , the application in the present instance strains our cred - ulity to the breaking-point .

		`` We may account for the second of the two women whom the man of fatal fascination gets into his toils , for she is intel - lectually undeveloped , and of the type that falls an easy prey to such seductions .

		But with
Joan	PERSON	the case is widely different .

		She is a woman of char - acter , will-power , and intellectual ability -- to put it bluntly , she is Miss Olive
Schreiner	PERSON	externally modified for the specific purposes of the novel -- and we are unwilling to admit that a woman of this type could be brought permanently under the obsession which the author of `` Pigs in Clover '' would have us accept .

		The situation seems to us radically untrue , and for this reason , for this reason only , profoundly immoral .

		We commonly think of
Wolfe	ORGANIZATION	's victory at
Quebec	LOCATION	as ending the struggle between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	for the possession of
North America	LOCATION	.

		But it must be remembered that for four years after that mem - orable engagement on the Plains of Abraham the two nations were still at war , and were technically enemies in the New World no less than in the Old .

		Their ambitions forever thwarted in
Canada	LOCATION	, the French still had hopes in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, and were intriguing with the Indian tribes of
Mississippi	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	for the furtherance of their designs .

		Their idea seems to have been to organize a con - federacy of Choctaws ,
Chickasawg	LOCATION	, and Cherokees , which , in alliance with the French , should oppose a formidable barrier to the English advance over the mountains , and which should occupy in the South a position not unlike that occupied in the North by the
Long House	ORGANIZATION	of the Iroquois nations .

		These plans and this situation form the historical setting of Miss Murfree 's latest novel , '' A Spectre of Power . ''

		The time is the last year of the Seven Years ' War , and the scene is placed in those
Great Smoky Mountains	LOCATION	which the author has so often described in the glowing language of enthusiasm .

		An exceedingly interesting story is built up about these historical and geographical accessories , a story of military operations and diplomatic intrigue , of romantic love and picturesque Indian adventure .

		Miss Murfree has made a careful study of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	Indians of the eighteenth century , and she possibly makes this fact a little too evident , for not only are there notes at the back of the volume , but there are also interspersed through the text many matters of Indian dialect , folk-lore , and cere - monial that are not altogether to be justified by the exigencies of the plot .

		A better reason for their being may be found in taking them as necessary contributions to the study of Indian character which is brought into the plot with great ingenuity and sympathetic understanding .

		The author is not con - tent with the externals that satisfy most writers of this sort of fiction , but must give us the psychology of her Cherokees .

		It is certainly a subtle psychol - ogy , fairly supported by the historical evidences adduced here and there , and is artistically convinc - ing .

		Of its absolute truthfulness we have no au - thority to speak , nor do we greatly care about the matter .

		Considered simply as a story , '' A Spectre of Power '' is extraordinarily interesting and its literary workmanship is very fine indeed .

		We rather resent the way in which the affections of the captivating Miss Lilias are shifted from the French - man to the Highlander , but the latter turns out a tolerably acceptable hero after all , although at first he appears to be a peculiarly graceless cub .

		The phrases in which the author describes the mountain scenery of the country she knows so well have all the old charm for us ; they constitute an impassioned form of prose that appeals powerfully to the poeti - cal sensibilities , while remaining prose in the strictest sense , and never degenerating into merely rhapsodical utterance .

		It is many years since Miss Murfree has given us as extensive a performance as the present one , and her book is very welcome indeed .

		English , French , and Indians are again brought into romantic relations for us in '' Love Thrives in War , '' a story by Miss
Mary Catherine Crowley	PERSON	.

		The opening year of the War of
1812	DATE	provides the historical setting for this romance of Northwestern history , which begins with
Hull	PERSON	's disgraceful sur - render of
Detroit	LOCATION	, and ends with the reoccupation of the city by the American forces .

		Tecumseh , the Prophet , and Tippecanoe are among the many his - torical characters who appear .

		The story as a whole is rather lifeless , and suffers severely in com - parison with the distinguished work of Miss Mur - free .

		The characters are of the hackneyed conven - tional sort , and every incident of the action is of a type that has been used hundreds of times before .

		Miss
Pauline Bradford Mackie	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Hopkins	PERSON	-RRB- 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, is making marked advances in the pursuit of her art .

		Her new novel , `` A Voice in the Desert , '' has both delicacy and charm ; it can hardly be said to possess strength .

		The story is of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, pre - sumably
Arizona	LOCATION	, and concerns a few transplanted
Easterners	ORGANIZATION	, noting the fascination of desert life for each and all of them , and depicting its subtly modify - ing influence upon their characters .

		Life under these conditions seems to grow tranquil if not apathetic , and the natural human passions assert themselves but languidly .

		One of the characters -- the clergy - man 's wife -- indeed revolts , and makes her escape ; but even she returns after a season , impelled by the desert fascination .

		A sand-storm adventure , graph - ically depicted , lends a certain degree of excitement to the closing chapters , and helps to bring about the final sentimental adjustment .

		Mrs.
Alice Prescott Smith	PERSON	's `` The Legatee , '' is not unlike the book just mentioned in its general characteristics .

		It has a charm that almost amounts to distinction but is somewhat lacking in the elements of strength .

		The scene is a
Wisconsin	LOCATION	lumber town , with its mixed population of Belgians , Swedes , and native Americans , and the time is about thirty years ago .

		The characteristics of village life , with its petty preoccupations , its dull round of toil , and its narrow religious bigotry , are given us from intimate knowlege with an unsparing pen .

		In one respect we think that the writer errs .

		A labor agitation occupies an important part in the story , and the type of thought and activity portrayed is one fa - miliar enough to us nowadays , but one which had hardly appeared in this country as early as
1870	DATE	.

		A wayward and altogether charming heroine is found in the daughter of the village physician , and the not unsatisfactory hero is the Southerner who , as his uncle 's legatee in the ownership of the lum - ber mills , finds his coming heralded by prejudice , and his every act met with suspicion .

		How he eventually conquers respect and sympathy is inter - estingly described .

		The disastrous forest fires of the autumn of
1871	DATE	are made use of in the final chapters , and bring the narrative to a picturesque and dramatic close .

		The author of this novel is a young woman , and `` The Legatee '' is her first book .

		We are bound to say that she has made a more than creditable beginning of what we trust may prove a successful literary career .

		`` Under the Rose , '' by Mr.
Frederic S. Isham	PERSON	, is a historical romance of the time of Francis I .

		The
Duke of Friedwald	ORGANIZATION	, seeking the hand of a princess of the royal family , makes all the necessary negotiations , and then repairs to the court disguised as a jester , in order to make the acquaintance of his future consort in an unconventional way .

		Mean - while , a notorious robber baron , learning of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's matrimonial ambitions , plots to cut off his journey to the court , and himself , impersonating the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, endeavors to consummate a marriage before the imposture shall be discovered .

		A pretty situation is thus developed , but it ends somewhat unexpectedly , for the jester-duke , after thwarting the schemes of his rival , becomes enamoured of another woman , and the princess is tricked of both pros - pective husbands .

		The matter of the romance is too thin to keep up a sustained interest , and the trap - pings of the various scenes are too artificial to make any impression of verisimilitude .

		In a word , the story drags all the way through , and displays little of the true quality of romance .

		This quality is provided , on the other hand , in superabundant measure by Mr.
Harold MacGrath	PERSON	in his romance of '' The Grey Cloak . ''

		This book is preeminently an example of '' how to do it , '' as contrasted with the `` how not to do it '' example of Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's story .

		It is historical enough to ' satisfy the conscience of those readers who would balk at a work of fiction which was pure invention , yet it has invention enough to gratify the most ardent passion for exciting adventure .

		It has , moreover , a literary quality that is at least respect - able , and that does not suffer overmuch from pad - ding and cheap rhetorical devices .

		The character - izations are excellent after the stagy fashion that is inevitable in such a story , and the sequence of in - cident is surprisingly well-knit .

		Historically , the book is a romance of the time of
Mazarin	LOCATION	, the scene being about equally divided between Old and
New France	LOCATION	.

		Thus we get court intrigue and roystering in the first half , and in the second half garrison life and Indian adventure .

		Taken altogether , this romance is one of the best of its kind ; its interest is unflagging , and it affords an abundant measure of not unprofitable entertainment .

		For the second time , Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page presents us with a novel of large dimensions .

		The new work is entitled ''
Gordon Keith	PERSON	, '' and suffers somewhat in the comparison with '' Red Rock '' for the reason that its interest is more scattered , and its plan does not have so definite a historical back - ground .

		It is essentially a novel of the personal fortunes of the hero , who is the son of a Virginian gentleman of the old school .

		The war has ruined the family fortunes , the plantation has fallen into the hands of an alien , and the boy is thrown upon his own resources .

		How he achieves success from humble beginnings , struggling for an education , teaching a country school , getting work as a mining engineer , and eventually acquiring large interests in the enterprise which his energy has developed -- this is the outline of his career .

		The setting is greatly diversified , including the life of the planta - tion , experiences in the lawless mining community of the
Virginia	LOCATION	mountains , seenes in the homes and marts of
New York	LOCATION	, and episodes of foreign travel .

		There are also characters in almost bewildering va - riety , and we barely become acquainted with one set when we are hurried away into another company .

		All of these scenes and characters , together with the author 's many dramatic and sentimental inventions , are united in a structure of reasonable coherency , yet one that is not easy to keep in view as a whole .

		Ethically , the story always rings true ; its ideals are of the sincere and manly type , and the hero in
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 whom they are chiefly embodied is one whom it is a pleasure to follow on his toilsome path to success .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	is too practised a hand at novel-writing to allow the interest to flag , to hold the reader too long in suspense at critical moments , or to make any of the false moves that so frequently lessen the effectiveness of otherwise excellent works of fiction .

		The late
Colonel Stanton Elmore	PERSON	, of the Confed - erate army , who died in
London	LOCATION	a few years ago , left certain manuscripts , among which was a novel called `` A Gentleman of the South . ''

		This is now edited and published by Mr. ``
William Garrott Brown	PERSON	.

		These facts are gravely stated in the preface to the novel , and we record them with equal gravity , but we have a dark suspicion that the Colonel and his story alike are creations of the editor 's invention .

		The story is a simple one , related in admirable English , and deals with the after consequences of an old family feud originated by the father of the leading character .

		Of this character , and the age in which he lived , the puta - tive writer says that they belong '' to a world so completely vanished that I sometimes feel as if I never lived in it save in dreams .

		It was a world so different from the present , and governed by such different laws that I am not at all confident of get - ting any reader 's credence for the story I wish to tell .

		Many will doubtless think it impossible that men should within this century have lived such lives , obeyed such codes , set themselves such standards . ''

		Although the story is a simple one , it is a little difficult in exposition , and inference must be kept busy in the opening chapters before we come to a clear understanding of the relations existing between the small group of persons con - cerned .

		The atmosphere clears after awhile , and the narrative then goes straight forward to its tragic ending .

		There is a delicate distinction about the author 's style that is grateful to the literary sense , but Mr.
Brown	PERSON	may hardly be said to have the gift of the novelist , and his peculiar powers appear to better advantage in the essay and the his - torical study .

		Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's novel ealled `` The Substitute '' is the sort of book that exists chiefly for the opportu - nity which it offers for the author to work off a collection of long-winded yarns about nothing in particular and other examples of homely rustic humor .

		The material thus offered seems genuine , and is doubtless for the most part observed rather than imagined .

		The scene is
Northern Georgia	LOCATION	, and most of the characters are plain country folk who speak the vernacular .

		An old man , who has committed a crime in his youth , is so filled with remorse in remembrance thereof , that he seeks in some way to atone for it .

		He hits upon the original plan of picking out a promising youth , educating and giving him a start in life , and making a man of him generally .

		This young fellow is to be the substitute which he presents to society in place of himself .

		The hero thus brought into being proves an interesting personality , and his love affairs come out happily .

		But the thread of the narrative is a slender one , and the book must stand or fall by its character sketches .

		Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's particular field is one that was long ago preempted by
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	, but we think that the genial old Colonel , could he have lived to read this book by his successor , would have bestowed upon it his smiling approval .

		Messrs.
Boone	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	, who collaborated in the writing of ''
Eastover Court House	ORGANIZATION	, '' have again joined forces in the production of a
Virginia	LOCATION	novel . ''

		The Redfields Succession '' is the title of this book , which tells how an impecunious newspaper reporter comes unexpectedly into possession of a Virginian estate , enjoys it for awhile , learns that he has no moral right to it after all , sacrifices it by resorting to what verges upon a criminal device , and in the end is suitably rewarded for what he has done .

		The scene of the story is laid in Vir - ginia , for the most part , and has a good deal to do with fox-hunting and other less strenuous social festivities .

		The book has no style worth speaking of , and its plot is of the most elementary sort , but it is the product of intimate first-hand observation , and has an easy-going quality that makes it pleasant reading .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Having written an international novelette in which a bright but penniless American girl weds a stupid En - glishman of family and little else ,
Lilian Bell	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Arthur Hoyt Bogue	PERSON	-RRB- follows it with a sequel , `` The Dowager Countess and the American Girl '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is the sort of story that does not make for interna - tional amenity .

		From it one gleans that all the En - glishmen of the better class are debauchees , and none of their women chaste .

		The heroine is an undesirable ideal of an American woman ; generally speaking , she acts like a snob , dresses like a cocotte , and speaks a various language , partly ungrammatical and partly slang , -- and that without being in the least aware of it .

		That the book is interesting is , however , unde - niable -- much in the way in which an en/ant terrible is interesting to its parents .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's new novelette , '' The
Unwel	PERSON	- come Mrs.
Hatch	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a story of a woman with a past who can not live it down , although her sin was without premeditation , and her career thereafter exemplary .

		The author 's motive seems to have been divided between her sympathy for the woman and her knowledge that she can not be upheld in the face of our literary and social conventions .

		The result is disastrous to the unity of the work , and leaves its conclusion ab - solutely impotent .

		If such a theme is not to be treated with the frankness of the French , it had best be left alone , -- a conclusion reflecting rather upon the author 's art than her good will .

		There is no compromise , evi - dently , with the
Sunday	DATE	School story . ''

		The Tu-Tze 's Tower '' is the unusual name of an unusual book by Miss
Louise Betts Edwards	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. H. T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The heroine , a woman of birth , refinement , and station , is nevertheless possessed 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, of a wanderlust .

		This has led her to wed an explorer , and the book opens with his death in the interior of
China	LOCATION	, stricken down before he could attain his goal in the country of the Man-Tze , an independent and preda - tory folk on the Chinese frontier .

		He bequeathes to his widow the task of searching out this people and making them known to the anthropological world .

		It will be seen that the promise for unusual complications is great when it is said that the Tu-Tze , the ruler of this people , falls in love with the pretty widow and refuses to take '' no '' for an answer .

		And , indeed , few fresher and more readable stories have been set before the people recently .

		There is abundant humor and considerable character study , mingled with the most thrilling events .

		The one drawback to the book will be found in its rather desultory beginnings ; these past , it will be diffi - cult to lay down .

		Mr.
Morgan Robertson	PERSON	has succeeded in writing `` Sinful Peck '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- with never a feminine char - acter in it from cover to cover .

		The result is rather refreshing in these days of insistent `` heart interest . ''

		The book continues the story of the crew of lake sailors who once manned the good ship '' Almena '' and brought its voyage to an untimely conclusion , as told in an earlier tale by Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	.

		In the present narrative the author brings into notice the recent statutes for the better protection of seamen , in the enactment of which he can assert no small share .

		The book is eminently readable by those who like sea stories -- and what man does not ?

		Having given a weaver and poacher of northern En - gland certain heroic qualities , Mr.
C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne	PERSON	has little difficulty in keeping him heroic in several ways , in his new book , ''
Thompson	PERSON	's Progress '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		`` Thompson '' attains great commercial suc - cess , and at the same time is able to marry successfully and to keep up his out-of-door habits .

		Like so many recent stories , this is told in episodes , each complete in itself , though forming a continuous whole .

		The book is really interesting , its one defect being found in its author 's failure to eliminate the repetitions that its serial publication demanded , wholly needless in the printed volume .

		The person who conceals his identity behind the initials ''
J. P. M.	PERSON	, '' or its partial expansion into ''
J. P. Mowbray	PERSON	, '' has written a story of the South of to-day under the title of '' The Conquering of Kate '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- .

		It deals , as did its predecessor , with life in that part of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	which is rather of the old South than of the North .

		There is a selection of types from the folk of the locality , some of them of the `` poor white '' class , and all of them unusual and interesting .

		The book has a tendency to melodrama foreign to this writer 's earlier work , all of the characters unnecessary for the fall of the curtain meeting with sudden death , -- by no means the most artful of devices .

		A quaint little story of early
New England	LOCATION	is told by Mrs.
C. Emma Cheney	PERSON	in '' Mistress
Alice Jocelyn	PERSON	, her Letters : In Which be set Forth an English Maydes Voyage to the Province of
Maine	LOCATION	, and what did Befall her Thereafter '' -LRB- The Blue Sky Press -RRB- .

		Told , as the title indicates , in epistolary form , the first of the little letters is dated at
Black Point	ORGANIZATION	in the province of
Maine	LOCATION	,
August 20 , 1642	DATE	, while the last brings the story down to Christmas Day in
1655	DATE	.

		They are addressed to
Philippa	LOCATION	, sister of
Alice	PERSON	, and are only nine in number .

		It is their peculiar merit that within so small a space the full story of a woman 's passion coming to its ma - turity should find expression , while giving incidentally a vivid account of life as it was lived in what was then a remote wilderness .

		Mrs.
Cheney	PERSON	has done well with her archaisms in idiom and spelling , such exaggerations as they exhibit being essential to the atmosphere of the work .

		Among books of real delight , Mr.
C. Hanford Henderson	PERSON	's `` John Percyfield '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- deserves high place .

		It is one of the most charming of love - stories , and it is a great deal more .

		The hero stands as a type of the American gentleman , in all the dignity and grace of that fine old term , his ancestry being of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	stock ; while the hero - ine represents a similar status of cultivation in
Louisi	LOCATION	- ana .

		They meet in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, at a , pension filled with the spirit of romance .

		But the pretty story of the love of
Margaret	PERSON	and
John	PERSON	forms but a small part of the book .

		In it may be found the reflections of the hero on all sorts of subjects , politics and economics most of all .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, like many another modern Amer - ican writer , has not hesitated in using the virile and pregnant phrases in our spoken language which have not yet found full literary acceptance .

		Miss
Una L. Silberrad	PERSON	has given her readers a man of complete engrossment in chemistry as the hero of `` The Success of Mark Wyngate '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		So complete is this engrossment that there will be a ten - dency throughout the book to quarrel with him for his density in affairs of the heart .

		By way of conclu - sion ,
Mark Wyngate	PERSON	attains commercial prosperity , but at a fearful and tragic cost .

		The book as a whole is original -- '' novel '' seems to be taking on its older meaning in recent writing , -- and it presents a series of strange pictures of modern life .

		The sombre under - current of the work is relieved by many touches of humor , leaving the impression of an art well controlled .

		Since the removal of various disabling acts , the Roman Catholics of
England	LOCATION	are playing a larger and larger part in British fiction , as in the national life .

		In `` The Light Behind '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , Mrs.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	has drawn a strong picture of social and political life , her protagonist being a woman most unhappily wedded to a dissolute nobleman , but strong enough to live a life of active good in spite of her lord 's wicked - ness .

		Unloved as she is , she centres her interests in the advancement of a young Catholic writer , to whom her charm as a woman of the world makes an appeal too strong for his powers of resistance .

		He stands ready to give up faith , his brilliantly promising future , and life itself ; but a fate merciful to them both takes her away at the psychological moment .

		The book abounds in well-drawn characterizations of the govern - ing class in many ramifications , and is enlightening in more respects than one .

		Detective stories are usually favorites for
summer	DATE	reading , but the number of them that have been based on murder mysteries make a story of counterfeiting , such as Mr.
Will M. Clemens	PERSON	has written in '' The Gilded Lady '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- , rather tame by comparison .

		The story is of the
United States Secret Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		It begins with an attempt on the part of the narrator , a member of the force , to ascertain the facts about a privately-owned steam yacht .

		After a little it is dis - covered that the owners are engaged in the criminal occupation of making silver dollars of real silver and somewhat more valuable intrinsically than the author - ized coin .

		At one point in the story it is argued that the advocates of the ratio of 16 to 1 are really placing
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 the country in the hands of such counterfeiters , though the conspirators are making millions out of the existing system .

		The book concludes with a tirade against the modern metropolitan newspaper , rather too fierce to be convincing , and rather out of keeping in a book appa - rently intended to amuse .

		Mrs.
Nancy Huston Banks	PERSON	has written a second novel , '' Round Anvil Rock '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , more of an historical romance than her previous story , but with a surer and more varied art .

		This , too , is a story of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, but of a
Kentucky	LOCATION	at the beginning of
the fourth decade of the last century	DATE	, when there was but one house of two stories in the commonwealth , and that built of cedar logs .

		It is rather authentic history turned into romance than romance pure and simple , and many historical characters , -- General
Jackson	PERSON	,
Jo Daviess	PERSON	,
Peter Cartwright	PERSON	, and others , among them -- will be found described and characterized .

		The effect of the book will be to heighten Mrs. Banks 's literary reputation .


Dane Kempton	PERSON	, a poet and man of letters happily married and living in
London	LOCATION	, and
Herbert Wace	ORGANIZATION	, a sociologist studying for his doctor 's degree at the Uni - versity of
California	LOCATION	and affianced to a young woman graduate , discuss the question of love in an anonymous book bearing the title of '' The
Kempton	PERSON	-
Wace	ORGANIZATION	Letters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is apparent , of course , that it would be difficult to find points of view more completely antip - odal than those occupied by men of such pursuits and training .

		To the poet , love has in it `` the awfulness and splendour of God , '' to the other it is something susceptible of analysis in all its bearings , a companion - ship for purposes of work , its roots founded on the cry of the race for perpetuation .

		How right
Kempton	PERSON	is , and bow wrong
Wace	ORGANIZATION	, the last two letters in the vol - ume , from
Hester	PERSON	,
Wace	ORGANIZATION	's affianced wife , to her over - intellectualized lover , abundantly indicate ; and there will be few readers of the book to dispute her verdict .

		The debate is an unusual and profitable one , interesting from beginning to end , and full of sound philosophy and right reasoning .

		In Miss
Frances Charles	PERSON	, now that a second novel from her hand permits comparison ,
America	LOCATION	has found a writer still in the flush of youth , with marked powers of discrimination and characterization and a downright genius for analysis . ''

		The Siege of Youth '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story of three men and three women in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and of the working out of three sev - eral romances , each along lines quite distinctive .

		In the six protagonists of the narrative there is a mixture of races such as this country alone can show , and the interplay of temperament has its place in their develop - ment .

		There is a knowledge of life truly profound , and , above everything else , a close portrayal of the true
Bohemia	LOCATION	-- that land worshipped so by those who can never hope to touch its shores because the bark of re - spectability that bears them is of too heavy a draught .

		A little method Miss
Charles	PERSON	has adopted , of sketching her story before giving it in detail , is in her hands a means of grace and strength .

		International romances are being written quite as much on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as on this , in convincing proof of the Anglo-Saxon entente cordiale .


Katherine Tynan	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Hinkson	PERSON	-RRB- , with '' A Red , Red Rose '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is the last to add to their number .

		A brother and sister , orphaned children of a wealthy American manufacturer , buy an estate from an old En - glish family , of which the sole survivors are a fathe ^ impoverished by youthful excesses at the gambling - table , and his sadly disappointed son .

		An Irish rector in the neighborhood has a lovely daughter ; two dukes near-by have , respectively , a brother and a daughter ; there is a young and wealthy widow close at hand ; and after twenty-five chapters of getting them all adjusted the story closes in one more , appropriately called '' Marrying and Giving in Marriage . ''

		A collection of short stories by Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	can hardly fail to be interesting , though the component members of '' The Untitled Field '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- are , with hardly an exception , written for a definite purpose , rather than as proofs of their author 's undoubted art .

		The stories are , emphatically , stories of the Irish people .

		One doubts neither the author 's means of information nor his entire good faith , and his readers will be forced into an agreement with him much against their will in many instances .

		The Roman Church , throughout the stories , takes the puritanical attitude which was observ - able in Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's '' Helbeck of
Bannis	PERSON	- dale , '' and the result is widely at variance with the aspect the
Church	ORGANIZATION	presents in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		So far as the Celtic attitude toward art is concerned , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is the bearer of bad tidings , for there appears to be no real national response whatever to the revival in which he has been so forward .

		The book will be certain to provoke discussion , -- it would hardly be Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's if it did not .

		A collection of short stories , remarkably various in their themes and interests , have been collected from the magazines by Mr.
Arthur Colton	PERSON	under the name of `` Tioba , and Other Tales '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Some of them deal with city life , and these are the best ; others find place in central
New York	LOCATION	; one is of the Civil War .

		The length of these tales is as varied as their contents , ranging from a mere conte to a novelette .

		Collectively , they leave a pleasant impression , but one which seems not to be fixed in any way , as if they were all tentative efforts rather than fully matured work .

		The stories are , in fact , too scattered over the literary possibilities to argue more than an undeveloped sense of power .

		Mr.
Guy Wetmore Carryl	PERSON	, heretofore known only as a purveyor of merry tales in rhyme , grows desperately serious in '' The Lieutenant-Governor '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and exhibits a knowledge of the labor movement and labor contentions in no way an advance upon the views in
Charles Reade	PERSON	's '' Put Yourself in His Place , '' the work of an aristocratically inclined Englishman a long thirty-three years ago .

		Reactionary sentiment of this sort is the more curiously belated because of the real intelligence shown in the premises by a score of other novelists recently .

		Here , everyone in sympathy with labor is a man devoid of principle , respect for law , and common-sense ; all the sympathizers with capital , on the other hand , are not merely rich and well placed , but have a monopoly of the virtues as well , whether these be individual , social , or civic .

		The story is short , well written , and well put together .

		But it is woefully be - hind the times , and entirely unconvincing to those who do not think with their prejudices . ''


Josiah Flynt	PERSON	'' reveals anew his wonderful grasp of the life led by actual -- as distinguished from fictional -- criminals , in '' The Rise of Ruderick Clowd '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The thief , burglar , and all-around crim - inal whose deeds the work recounts , is real , and as un - like the customary criminal of literary commerce as can well be imagined .

		Much of the consummate vulgarity of his life is necessarily concealed in its detail , though 70 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, it is suggested to those who know , and must color the story in the direction of the verities to those who do not .

		Indeed , the most daring parts of it are those deal - ing with
Roderick	PERSON	's relations with womankind .

		Not many of the man 's innumerable crimes are set forth with any particularity , Mr.
Flynt	PERSON	wisely selecting a few typical cases and permitting these to stand for the rest .

		The intention is to describe a career of crime in its en - tirety , beginning with the nameless boy who steals first to help his mother , and carrying him through the re - form school and penitentiary to an old age of sufficient respectability , but still untouched by regret or remorse .

		Teaching children is by no means the most difficult part of the educational processes of to - day .

		Traditional home and public sentiment pushes them toward docility .

		To educate the men who elect the teachers , who pass upon what shall be taught , who decide how much one may have to teach with , who are , fre - quently in practice and always in law , the head of the whole school system , and who not uncommonly regard any suggestion of their need of instruction as an impertinence , -- all this is no child 's play .

		One of our most successful trainers of school boards , Mr.
A. P. Blodgett	PERSON	of
Syracuse	LOCATION	, says it takes practically about two years properly to educate an average board member .

		This will seem to others who have had experience a compliment to the class of men who serve the schools of
Syracuse	LOCATION	, and to Mr.
Blodgett	PERSON	him - self , more than a sober statement of fact .

		It has taken over a hundred years to bring Amer - ican school boards to their present state of culture , and few have graduated summa cum laude .

		The fact is that this part of the educational system has been woefully neglected .

		Among our colleges for every kind of training , there is yet no institution for the education of school - boards ; there are no examinations for this position , no certificates of fitness , no course of study .

		It is time that some up-to-date pub - lisher put upon the market a text-book on '' How to be a School Trustee . ''

		Were I able to carry out such movements as produced '' The Committee of Ten , '' '' The
Committee of Fif	ORGANIZATION	- teen , '' and other working organizations of ex - perts , I would secure such a report from the united efforts of Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	, Mr.
Harper	PERSON	, Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	, Mr.
Blodgett	PERSON	, Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	, Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	, Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	, Mr.
Bright	PERSON	, Mr.
Lane	PERSON	, and Mr.
Jones	PERSON	.

		Everyone recognizes the need of such instruction .

		It should be given in ac - cordance with the best methods of teaching .

		Some of the subjects of the various chapters are obviously suggested .

		For instance : The schools are for the children .

		Any board that does not recognize as the chief root and centre of its every act the eternal welfare of the chil -
82	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, dren of the community has no right to exist - ence .

		Any member who does not stand upon such a platform should be removed at once from a position which he may unworthily oc - cupy but can never fill .

		Membership on a school board is not given to start a man in a political career .

		It is not for the purpose of caring for any particular ward or district .

		The schools are for the whole people .

		The children will take the effects of their good or poor schooling into all districts .

		The obvious purpose of the schools requires a board mem - ber to serve children and not men .

		It certainly is remarkable that , from our national
Senate	ORGANIZATION	down , the tendency of repre - sentative bodies to discuss so seriously their own dignity is irresistible even to the delay and exclusion of the service for which they are elected .

		When I was in the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools , the most commonly expressed fear of speakers on the floor of the school-board was that they might '' stultify '' themselves .

		In the case of several resolutions which experiment proved were unworkable , the members agreed that the resolutions should not have been passed , but that they could not repeal them without `` stultifying '' the board .

		When a man first becomes a member , he is usually frank in avowing that he knows nothing about the schools or education ; but very soon he joins with the others in the belief that united board action transmutes ignorance into sagacity , and that the whole board is greater than the sum of its parts .

		You can get for a good measure the individual indorsement of each member , but you may fail to secure action by the board .

		Thus the whole is less than the sum of its parts .

		Good judges can predict how individuals will act .

		No one knows what a board of trustees will do .

		The supreme need is a policy of work - ing only for the welfare of the school children .

		With this there must come a system by which the board will have in its membership those who can test every proposition in this light .

		Good teaching depends chiefly upon the teacher .

		It is a curious commentary on edu - cational progress that most of the advancement in the raising of the standards of teaching has been made in the teeth of the opposition of boards of education .

		In my school-days , in a town distinguished throughout the West for its educational facilities , the girls who taught us were not required to know how to teach .

		They could work most of the examples in the arithmetic , but none of them could develop arithmetical skill , or any kind of skill , in their pupils .

		These girls were daughters or nieces of men who elected the board of education .

		To bring into those schools especially pre - pared teachers cost more than one superintend - ent his position .

		One of the chief features in a course of instruction to school boards should be the demonstration that everyone whose friends ask her appointment is not a teacher , and that a board of education selected as is now the custom is not a trustworthy judge of a good teacher .

		To insure the welfare of school children is a business requiring business-like methods .

		School boards are to judge and to legislate , not to make speeches before an audience , or be reported to an admiring constituency through the morning papers .

		There is no more reason why a trustee should make speeches at a meet - ing than there is call on a bank director to deliver an oration to his business asssociates .

		The better systems are gradually working to - ward the entire exclusion of speeches .

		The work is being done by small committees ; the school boards are being reduced to seven or nine members .

		In realizing the business nature of the work of trustees , we are coming back to the view of
John Colet	PERSON	, who founded
St. Paul 's School	ORGANIZATION	in
1509	DATE	.

		After he had built his school , says
Erasmus	PERSON	, he entrusted the care of the property , not to priests , not to the bishop , not to the chapter , not to the great ministers of the court , but to the married laymen of the silk mercers ' guild , men of uprightness and repute .

		And when he was asked why he made this dis - position of his property , he answered that there is no absolute certainty in human affairs , but that as far as his experience went he believed there was less corruption in such a body of merchants than in any other condition or order of men .

		The real work of school management must be done by experts .

		School boards , ever since I have known them , have claimed that there are no educational experts ; they have also done their share to prevent the development of such .

		No one knows of a school board that experi - ments in a class-room , or that studies instruc - tion in neighboring cities ; yet everyone knows of many school boards that pass upon the most vital questions of educational procedure .

		Some one comes before them and presents the reasons for a certain reform ; it is referred to the ap - propriate sub-committee .

		After some time , when the arguments have pretty well faded away , the thing is discussed in committee from the standpoint of the members ' own school
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 experience , thirty or forty years ago .

		That set - tles it .

		The text-books and materials desired for aid to instruction are not uncommonly judged with utter disregard for the end in view .

		It is still rare for a board to say to a superintendent : devise the best course pos - sible , tell what you need in the way of space , apparatus , and books , to carry it out , and we will do the best we can for it .

		The more com - mon injunction is : here is a building , books and apparatus ; do the best you can with them .

		And yet here is the most complicated process in the world to carry out ; the development of the minds of children .

		Here are colleges all over the world , holding men year after year to study and compare and perfect methods of most effectively and economically equipping children with mental power .

		Too often the man skilled in these processes finds his main obstacle to their employment the very body that one would expect to be his chief assistant .

		The experts in engineering , in accounting , in law , in medicine , have won their positions .

		No one will win an educational expert 's position for him but himself .

		He ca n't do it by talk .

		He must become more expert in the art of proof .

		The meetings of the school board is his natural field .

		You can not get results if you keep chang - ing your teachers .

		School changes , except in the larger cities , are notoriously frequent all through the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The annual re - ports of State superintendents , when they come to record the placing of teachers from term to term , remind you of a rapid game of chess .

		The interests of our children are everywhere made subservient to the fun of a political contest .

		It amounts to nothing more .

		No ■ one cares much what the school policy of the - county superintendent is .

		He is nominated along with the regular ticket , and he is up or down with it .

		Rotation in office for a
State	ORGANIZATION	superintendent for mere rotation 's sake , is the rule in most of the
States	LOCATION	.

		Teachers are ■ elected by the year .

		They are birds of pas - sage .

		They can not buy a home and cast their lot with the community , or make long plans for its welfare .

		This is one of the most ab - surd aspects of school board administration .

		In their fear of putting one or two lazy teachers where punishment would be a little more diffi - cult to administer , they deprive all the schools of that superb increase of efficiency which every worker gives when conscious of steady em - ployment .

		I wonder what
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	and
Chicago Universities	ORGANIZATION	would be , were Presi - dents Eliot and
Angell	PERSON	and
Harper	PERSON	, and all the members of the faculties , suspended in the same uncertain attitudes in which school boards hold teachers .

		The superintendent of schools must have enough power to secure good teaching .

		The board must keep hands off what has been dele - gated to him .

		To give the head man authority seems such an obvious requirement of every organization , that the wonder is why board members so constantly violate it .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	leads in this policy of reducing the supervising and teaching force to proper humility .

		The most curious feature of it all is the strictness with which these men in their mercantile con - cerns will avoid hampering their superintend - ent in his selection of assistants , or in his dis - cipline of them .

		These are some of the lessons the school boards of
America	LOCATION	need learning .

		It is a very practical query as to who is going to teach them .

		One of the plainest duties of a super - intendent is to educate his trustees .

		If he does n't speak freely and fully to his board on all phases of school administration , if he does not fearlessly tell things as they are with the design to improve them , he is himself an ob - stacle .

		But it is not necessary for him to go around with a chip on his shoulder , or to blow his trumpet in the tone of this essay of mine .

		A school fight is usually an act of folly .

		Di - plomacy is not so picturesque , but it goes far - ther .

		To convince the judgments of men , one must clear the way by winning their hearts .

		Malcontents who criticize their superiors , even though they speak undoubted truth , run the risk of a habit of carping which destroys effi - ciency .

		I have worked for school boards so long , and have known so many fine men in them , that to suggest even in an abstract man - ner , as here , some defects in the management of schools due to the American school-board system , seems something like swearing at one 's grandmother .

		The pleasantest way to educate trustees is to entice them into the schools and to have them speak to children .

		There is a very subtle truth iuvolved in this .

		It is an actual return to first principles .

		Some writers have advo - cated the education of school boards by means of the school-board journal .

		There are also school-board associations for mutual advance - ment ; but the most powerful agent of all is the daily press .

		How the teachers have awak - ened to its use within the past ten years !

		When the college men who have gone into 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, teaching keep in touch with their classmates who have gone into journalism , the cause of education gains a great ally .

		It is by this means , together with constantly improving work in the class-room , that the general public will be educated to demand the best schooling attainable .

		As school boards are usually in advance of the general public , there seems to be every reason to believe that the whole edu - cational system will continue by various jerks and starts to keep moving onward .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		SOME CHANGES IN GRADUATE STUDIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A quarter of a century ago , when
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	opened its doors , a new sort of scholastic work was introduced in
America	LOCATION	.

		Up to that time there had been no place in this country where graduate studies had been recognized as of primary importance .

		The colleges and universities had been concerned al - most exclusively with the undergraduate student , and while the old fashioned college course had been very materially liberalized it was still designed to meet the wants of the immature , to furnish a certain mental dis - cipline and a modicum of general culture .

		The new university had other and different ideals .

		It proposed to concern itself with those who had already received the training of a college course and attained to the dig - nity of a college degree .

		The hope of the directors of the new foundation was that the university would be - come a centre of research ; that through the opportu - nities which it afforded , material additions should be made to the sum total of human knowledge ; that it might become a school of research , as distinguished from a school of instruction .

		To this end , somewhat novel plans were followed in the organization of the new institution ; unusual sums were spent on equipment as distinguished from buildings ; eminent men were called to the professorships at liberal salaries ; and , most unusual of all , a system of fellowships was organ - ized , the incumbents being elected , not because of pecuniary need , but because of ability to carry on the actual work of investigation .

		Provision was made for the conferring of the degree of Ph.D. upon resident students upon their completion of a thesis embodying the results of some worthy piece of research work .

		The new school proved popular , and , almost from the first , as many students as could be properly ac - comodated were in attendance .

		Other and older uni - versities began to alter their courses and emphasize graduate work .

		Harvard ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, among others in the
East	LOCATION	, took it up .

		In the
Middle West	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and other State universities , in particular , followed .

		New schools were organized either with a view to encouragement of graduate work only , as in the case of
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	, or proposing to make it very prominent , as in the case of
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		To-day the opportunities for graduate work are widespread , and in any portion of the country the student who wishes more advanced work than even the modern college course offers finds the opportunity at his door .

		In the period since the opening of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, very considerable changes have taken place not only in the amount of graduate work done but in its character and in the attitude of the students and the schools toward it .

		But few years ' experience was needed to demonstrate that the men who had taken graduate courses were better qualified for teaching and certain other professional positions than those who had not done so .

		As a result , it has quickly come about that the Ph.D. degree is almost a sine qua non for a college professorship anywhere in the country .

		For many posi - tions in the government service it is almost equally essential ; and so , from being courses primarily designed to stimulate investigation , the graduate courses have become professional courses designed to fit men for particular positions , and quite comparable to medical and law courses .

		From being centres of research , our graduate schools are becoming schools for professional training .

		The American mind loves order and system , and above all it loves definite accomplishment .

		The Ph.D. .

		degree , intended to be incidental to the accomplishment of research work , has become the end for which research work is in very many cases at least , undertaken .

		There have been many factors which have operated to bring this about .

		One was , undoubtedly , the need of better trained men , better informed men , in the po - sitions into which the new doctors of philosophy have gone .

		Another , and possibly the most important factor , lay in the circumstance that most graduate work was taken up at schools where undergraduate work was already important .

		Harvard ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and all the older schools , were primarily colleges .

		Their traditions were all founded on this fact .

		The teachers were primarily concerned with the immature , uninformed under - graduates .

		The courses were designed to meet the wants of such students .

		Where professional schools existed , the relations of the new courses were , for various reasons , closer with the undergraduate work than with the professional .

		Where the instructor has developed his methods to meet the wants of under - graduates , he is apt to use essentially the same methods when teaching graduates .

		This is especially true when he has in his graduate courses one year the same men who were in his undergraduate courses the year before .

		In this manner it has come about that in a broad way the undergraduate courses have merely been lengthened , and an additional degree is granted .

		The graduate schools , instead of being places where men of maturity come together for wider reading and for research work , are becoming schools with increas - ingly fixed courses of study leading definitely to a degree , and , in turn , to a definite class of openings in life .

		Research is a means to an end , and is not the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake .

		An increasing number of young men and women upon attaining to the bachelor 's degree , remain in residence and take up graduate work .

		Often they do so largely because nothing else appeals to them as a definite course of action , and college graduates are proverbially at a loss for an opening upon graduation .

		All this is a matter of fact .

		Whether or not it is also a matter of protest , is another question .

		Evidently the change brings with it both advantages and disad - vantages , -- the former in the better filling of many important positions , the latter in a diminishing emphasis

		THE DIAL 85 on the desirability of knowledge for its own sake .

		Where the balance lies , it will probably require the future to determine .

		TOO MUCH LITERARY `` STUDY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		`` The teaching of literature has planted a terrible fixed foot in our schools , '' wrote Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	recently , in his volume on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	can afford to indulge in the luxury of convictions , and is given to emphatic affirmation , so that one wonders in what terms he would have chosen to express his opinion had the following item , in the course of study of one of our most progressive Eastern universities , chanced to meet his eye .

		English Literature .

		-- English Letter - Writers .

		-- Among the writers studied in Course 34 will be
Howel	PERSON	,
Cromwell	PERSON	, the Verneys , Swift .

		Pope .

		Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	,
Walpole	LOCATION	,
Chesterfield	LOCATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Fitz	PERSON	- gerald and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		But , after all , one does not need to be a recognized authority , and therefore a chartered idol-breaker , to question the value of such study for undergraduates , -- perhaps even the right of the university to offer it .

		And this suggests the whole matter of the propriety of taking up for classroom work , in secondary school or college , literature which has much of the personal element in it .

		A study of letter writing in itself is not likely to be objectionable when the letters are literature or history pure and simple , and are intended by the writers for such , or at least for something not very different .

		Many of the earlier writers mentioned in the foregoing list corresponded with a perfect knowledge -- some of them in the hope -- that their letters might become public property , and so are fair game for the professor .

		And in the days when '' epistolary corre - spondence '' was a serious matter , any letter was a dif - ferent thing from the careless unreserved talk between intimates we listen to when we read the letters of at least two of the authors whose names appear at the end of the list . ''

		On n'est trahi que par les siens , '' and
Stevenson	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	are no doubt sincerely ad - mired by the earnest instructor who is analyzing their `` methods '' from his platform .

		A text-book on rhetoric , printed a few years since , was most enthusiastic over
Thackeray	PERSON	's epistolary style , and recommended all students who were desirous of becoming graceful letter - writers to take the ''
Brookfield	LOCATION	Letters '' for their models . ''

		Great honor to the fireflies , but ... ! ''

		Of course it is the inclusion of Thackeray among the letter-writers to be studied which causes us to wince most sharply .

		It is hard to think that to the most sensitive of men , -- who did his best to escape biography , and who wrote to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, '' If I thought you showed my letters to anyone , I would never write you another , '' -- should come the fate of having the most intimate of the letters he wrote to the friend who helped him through his broken life studied , perhaps yawned over , perhaps worse , by successive groups of undergraduates .

		A score of passages will occur to Thackerayans -- pages full of their author 's dear non - sense , or brave melancholy , -- which to think of as assigned for '' required reading '' is to shudder .

		In the case of
Stevenson	PERSON	, to be sure , the sin is less indefensible , for the public was always more or less in his confidence after he had aroused its interest .

		Still we can not but think that even he , philosopher as he was , would have shrunk from having the details of the '' discontent and rapture and despair '' of his youth thrust upon a set of lads , the sympathetic and the stolid alike .

		To all this it may be objected that such a course of study as this is never prescribed in any college , and so need be taken up by no student who is wholly out of touch with the writers discussed .

		But no one who has to do with undergraduates will need to be reminded how often they '' elect '' a course because it comes at a con - venient hour , or because there is a chance of its proving easier than an alternative .

		In a popular volume of Harvard stories we have a pleasing picture of a student in a fiction-course removing his troublesome uncertainty as to whether
Jane Austen	PERSON	was a man or
George Eliot	PERSON	a woman by memorizing the verses beginning , '' Good heavens , good heavens !

		Miss
Mary Ann Evans	PERSON	, What made you change your name ? ''

		and so on .

		Perhaps that is only amusing , and not too discouraging .

		There are some literary waters of which all may well be made to take at least a single draught .

		But when not merely the work , but the personality , of writers who at worst have done nothing to forfeit our respect is subjected to possibilities of much that the living men would have resented , it seems as if he were driving something of a hard bargain for the fame we grant our authors .

		The last decade or so has seen as provided with countless numbers of what Professor
Dowden	PERSON	has lately characterized as '' funicular railways to the summit of Parnassus '' ; and the incommunicable has been communicated , in more or less satisfactory fash - ion , by the simple process of applying the methods of chemistry or the physical sciences to the study of literature .

		But before we congratulate ourselves too unreservedly upon our progress , might it not be well to consider whether some few divisions of the field of literature ought not , from their very nature , to be regarded as exempt from the incursions of at least the reluctant among the '' personally conducted '' ?

		THE LITERARY METHOD OF TEACHING ENGLISH .

		-LRB- To the
Editor of Tint Dial	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every profession has its jargon .

		For example , with what pride does the business man often produce the crabbed , ungrammatical , unintelligible paragraph which he calls a '' professional business letter '' !

		And teachers have their professional jargon , too .

		It is the jargon of the classroom , and has such a hold on the average teacher that it is seldom that any teacher can write a readable paragraph for a newspaper or magazine .

		Now nothing special is gained , either by the business man or the teacber , in using his or her professional jargon , when we have a simple , universal language , capable of the most varied expression , and intelligible to everybody .

		In the case of the jargon of the classroom , much actual harm is done , for the simple reason that the average pupil is not going to be a pedagogue and has no use for pedagogical phrases .

		He really needs sim - ple , plain , natural English , such as the skilled literary artist uses in writing for common readers .

		One most disastrous outgrowth of the pedagogical THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, jargon is the method of trying to teach language by meaningless groups of words .

		Spelling is taught by dead lists of words in spellers ; grammar by dead sen - tences ; composition by dead illustrative paragraphs .

		A really interesting connected story can seldom be found in any book on English .

		Yet words mean nothing ex - cept as they are used to express ideas -LRB- real ideas , not fragments -RRB- .

		The only object in studying language is to become able to express ideas ; and apart from ideas language is the merest machinery .

		The literary method of teaching English requires , first of all , that the teacher shall possess some skill in literary expression .

		We need a school of English in which the professors shall be real men of letters , the whole atmosphere of which shall be literary , and which shall afford the professional teacher of English a pro- fessional literary training preparatory to his work .

		Our teachers of English should be trained side by side with those who are preparing to become writers of English .

		A person without literary skill should not be accepted by any school as a teacher of English .

		Then , when the teacher comes to the classroom , he will discard all the rubbishy spelling-books with life - less lists of words , all the grammars with lifeless col - lections of illustrative sentences , all the rhetorics filled with rules and directions in lumbering language -LRB- for very few rhetorics are decently written -RRB- .

		Then he will teach spelling by drilling the pupil upon some of the fundamental principles of the language , which abso - lutely determine the spelling of ninety-nine per cent of the 300,000 words of which English boasts ; those most troublesome words called homonyms will be studied only in connection with their meaning -LRB- that is , their actual use for the expression of ideas -RRB- ; while the three or four thousand common irregular words remaining will be memorized by a rational memory system , which classi - fies and gives all the mnemonic aid possible .

		Grammar will be simplified into a practicable little machine which the student may master as a carpenter masters the use of his hammer or his saw or his square , so that it may be used to test the correctness of the arrangement of words in sentences .

		It will be found that English grammar is almost wholly a matter of word-logic , and that the successful teaching of gram - mar consists in cultivating the habit of following the logical relationships of words in sentences .

		This logic can not possibly become apparent except in a complete and perfectly logical composition .

		Composition will be taught according to the method used by
Franklin	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Maupassant	PERSON	, and all the greatest producers of finished literature , -- that is , by setting the pupil to imitate simple masterpieces till he catches the knack of producing something of the same sort .

		All the rules of rhetoric should be offered as concrete essays by real masters , which the student will be asked to study and re-write until he learns the art of doing it , regardless of whether he can name the thing or not .

		This , in brief , is the '' method of the masters '' -- the sort of school in which real masters of English have learned their art .

		The first step toward realizing it will be to banish all the meaningless lists of words , the collections of meaningless detached sentences and para - graphs , and substitute the simple , beautiful , interesting , and perfectly logical compositions of the great masters of English prose .

		Some Ideals of Saintly Life .

		* Did it ever occur to the Reverend
John Bampton	PERSON	, Prebend of Minor Pars Altaris in the
Cathedral Church of Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	from
1718	DATE	to his death in
1751	DATE	, that the series of annual lectures which he founded might not all be of inestimable worth ?

		Did it ever cross his mind that though the Heads of Colleges in the Uni - versity of
Oxford	LOCATION	, `` and no others , '' should duly assemble on the first
Tuesday	DATE	of Easter term `` in the room adjoining the
Printing House	ORGANIZATION	between the hours of ten in the morning and two in the
afternoon	TIME	, '' their choice of a
Bampton Lecturer	ORGANIZATION	might not always rest upon the right head ?

		Did any uneasy suspicion tease his imagination that even a fellow , tutor , and precentor of his college , and a bishop 's examining chaplain to boot , might test candi - dates , and lead choirs , and instruct under - graduates , and be an active member of a col - lege corporation , yet still lack the divine `` art of putting things , '' without which in the pulpit of
S. Mary	ORGANIZATION	's his acquirements in music , in letters , in theology , and in administration , would be all in vain ?

		If such forebodings ever haunted him he doubtless brushed them aside as idle ; for he made no provision against them .

		The
Bampton Lectures	ORGANIZATION	have a just fame .

		Yet the student of all the volumes which , by the founder 's will , must be printed within two months of the delivery of the '' eight Sermon - Lectures , '' discovers with a sad surprise that for the publication of some of them the world could have endured to wait for two decades or two centuries without serious impoverishment .

		Certainly the volume for the year
1903	DATE	makes no epoch .

		It is not precisely of the fibre of Hampden or
Hatch	PERSON	, of
Mosely	ORGANIZATION	or Liddon .

		It is some years since any lecturer in the long succes - sion has deeply impressed the English Church or the Christian public .

		Can it be that the heads of colleges exercise less discrimination in their choice , or that the English Church pro- duces strong divines less frequently , than of old ?

		In the instance of the volume before us , the author seeks to disarm criticism by the pleas of haste , over-occupation , and illness .

		THE DIAL 87 or inspiring influence .


John Bainpton	PERSON	failed to foresee its prevalence , or his insistence upon printing within two months had been made less stringent .

		The author may be forgiven ; the book remains for impartial criticism to deal with .

		It must be said , then , that this is not a bril - liant or incisive piece of work .

		If one is look - ing for clearly conceived or closely reasoned notions of what Christianity has done or can do for national life , of how the lives of good men and the legends that drape them affect the general conscience and conduct of their contemporaries or their successors , he will do well to look elsewhere .

		There is an awkward - ness about the very title-page which suggests that the author had no strong grasp of his sub - ject , that he had taken it at haphazard , had never grappled with any central or dominating idea , but had thrown out tentative lines in sundry directions , hoping that stray thoughts might take the hook and be drawn in .

		The discussion goes on in a rambling , desultory fashion , as if the theme had casually occurred to the writer in the process of writing , and the materials had arranged themselves as they drifted past .

		As we lay the book down , we are not sure that we can put a finger on any pal - pable results of the more or less heroic ven - tures of
S. Adalbert	PERSON	,
S. Elizabeth	LOCATION	, or
S. Louis	LOCATION	.

		That they were effective in their own day , need not be doubted .

		But who can be sure that what they did , or what the chroniclers say they did , has vitally affected the fortunes and char - acter of
Prussia	LOCATION	, of
Hungary	LOCATION	, of
France	LOCATION	?

		It is fatally possible to recognize and do homage to saints , and to build chapels and churches in their memory , while in no way sharing their spirit or following where they lead .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	opens his course by saying that the Kingdom of God in each successive period depends upon how that period interprets for itself the Christian ideal , and how it embodies its ideal in human living .

		Each age freshly translates the Gospel into its own vernacular , and illuminates the translation with saintly lives .

		As the original colors grow dim , mellow legends take their place .

		What was at first a blot blooms out into a halo .

		The legend , false to the facts , transfigures the spirit of the life .

		The miracle of a Christly personality sweeps along with it a train of lesser marvels invented or magnified by the popular imagination .

		In the first fervor of the New Testament period , all believers are assumed to be saints .

		As time goes on , the term seems better reserved for those of rare and peculiar eminence in holiness . ''

		The Deacon is a good man , '' we say , '' but no saint . ''

		The saints , then , in com - mon usage , are those heroes of faith in whom the mood and energy of Christian character have been most splendidly revealed .

		They are '' single thoughts of God manifested in endless variety . ''

		Of course there have been many such `` sin - gle thoughts '' which have passed unrecognized , saints uncanonized who in the truest Apostolical Succession have transmitted from age to age their pattern of godlikeness .

		The earliest saints were canonized by popular acclaim .

		The multitude felt the touch and thrill , dis - cerned the virtue that went forth from certain of their kind and spontaneously declared them to be of the holy fellowship .

		Perhaps they stoned them living , but they enshrined them dead .

		Later , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	authorities , bishops or councils , set their seal of approval upon such instinctive tribute , as in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	church to-day .

		Not until after the twelfth century did the Popes in the Western church succeed in reserving this power to themselves .

		Even so late as the fifteenth century , in the case of
S. Osmund of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, all that remained for
Nicholas V.	PERSON	to do was to affix his official sanction to the anticipative act of the people .

		There were '' ears to the ground '' in those days as well as in ours , and very sensitive ears .

		It is interesting to be reminded that in the matter of national saints , those recognized and accepted by a whole race or people , the legends sometimes depict as their typical characteristics excellences in which the best and wisest spirits of the time hold their fellows to be conspicu - ously deficient , thus spurring them to strain after ideals at present far above them ; while , on the other hand , in other times and places , the legends but discern and disclose in their full beauty and glory virtues already inherent in the national character , thus producing , as it were , a composite photograph of the nobler qualities of the people .

		Thus , the
Slavic Saints Vladimir the Great	ORGANIZATION	and
Alexander Nevski	PERSON	dis - play the purity , the placidity , the generosity , the self-sacrifice of Russian character .

		Thus ,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , a being unique in
Christendom	LOCATION	, at once simple child and soldierly genius , em - bodies the chivalry and religion , '' the military and Catholic and racial aspirations of mediaeval
France	LOCATION	. ''

		So , '' out of the mass of local Ger - man saints emerge the two great names , simple and heroic '' of
S. Boniface	PERSON	in the eighth cen - tury and
S. Elizabeth	PERSON	in the thirteenth .

		So 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	,
Spain	LOCATION	has S. Fernando the Christian knight , the Crusader , and
S. John	PERSON	of the Cross , ex - treme ascetic yet genuine reformer , men austere and even harsh , absorbed in a world beyond mor - tal sight , and
S. Teresa	PERSON	, gay , witty , natural , her religion a romance , delighting in sacrifice , and serving her God with a gladsome heart .

		So
Portugal	LOCATION	enshrines
S. John	PERSON	of God , '' shepherd , soldier , servant , chained slave , a peddler of pious books , tortured as a lunatic , a beggar that he might support and nurse the poor , a preacher of conversion , a skilled physician of the soul , his life a life of active beneficence , '' and also
S. Francis Xavier	PERSON	, the great mission - ary , embodying his people 's M splendid spirit of adventure , their determination and reckless - ness , their subordination of immediate to far - distant fame . ''

		The exception proves the rule , when we are told that the endless divisions of
Italy	LOCATION	in me - diaeval and modern -- all but recent -- times have forbidden her any distinctively national saints ,
S. Catharine	PERSON	of
Siena	LOCATION	and her name - sake of
Genoa	LOCATION	and
S. Francis	PERSON	being treasures rather of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	at large .

		Of the three , the last-named comes nearest to the position of patron-saint of the whole peninsula , the
Fioretti	PERSON	being familiar and dear to the children , the most popular of literature throughout the land , fit indeed to be styled '' the Breviary of the Italian people . ''

		It is happy to know that in the instance of
S. Francis	PERSON	the reality sus - tains or surpasses the legend . ''

		The main out - lines are quite clear , quite historic .

		About the character itself there is no doubt .

		It is the details here and there that have been touched , the strange visions that have been amplified . ''

		These are all historic persons , however legend may have used her gold thread to embroider and stiffen the choice stuff of reality .

		But what of
St. George of England ?	ORGANIZATION

		Must we part with him ?

		No , we may be satisfied that though
Gibbon	PERSON	managed to confuse him with an infamous contractor of
Cappadocia	LOCATION	, later students have established the existence of a George , also of
Cappadocia	LOCATION	, in the fourth cen - tury , whose stout battling with the serried evils of his time was typified after the
Apoca	LOCATION	- lyptic precedent by a fight with a dragon , until through the loving touches of poet and sculptor and painter arose the bright ideal of dragon - slayer , deliverer of a royal princess , earlier
Bayard	PERSON	, fearless and stainless , who eight cen - turies afterwards was to be taken into the
Anglican Kalendar	PERSON	and become the patron saint of
England	LOCATION	.

		Better such a legend , if only legend it were , than the sand-heaps of much bald and barren history .

		So much has Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	to say of Saints in general and national saints in particular .

		In the other lectures , the saints of the English Conversion , the royal saints , the monks and hermits , the statesmen saints , and the saintly women and children , are somewhat loosely classed and dealt with .

		It is a Scotch haggis with '' a deal of fine confused feeding , '' excel - lent material not very well handled .

		There is a valuable appendix , in which for the first time , from a manuscript in King 's College ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, is printed the Passio et
Miracula Sancti Eadwardi Regis et Martiris	ORGANIZATION	.

		In another appendix , upon English mediaeval miracles , the writer of the twentieth century is some - what at odds with the traditional churchmen ; nor is it easy to predict the issue .

		The author sees that the question is partly one of evidence and partly one of a general attitude of mind towards the miraculous at large .

		He agrees with Dr.
Sanday	PERSON	that '' of the results of ' the contact of personalities filled with the Spirit of God with the conditions of the outer world ' we have still very much , one is tempted to say almost everything , to learn . ''

		That safe con - clusion does not , however , carry us very far .

		It is to be said that the book is well printed and well bound , and that there is a sufficient index .

		Of the remarkable tribute to Charles the First , pp. 337-353 , perhaps the less said the better .

		Not the goldenest of legends can rehabilitate that '' Saint '' forevermore .

		They were to extend the bounds of human knowledge by original research , and the results of their studies and experiments were to be published from time to time in books and pamphlets .

		THE DIAL 89 tions to the literature of the subject that they undertook to investigate .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has had as a definite purpose or policy the development of an aptitude for investigative work .

		The uni - versity man of to-day is expected to find new truth , and to re-state old truth from the point of view of the present .

		He is to explore thoroughly some corner of a subject , and , if possible , throw fresh light on it .

		He must also cultivate the critical spirit .

		A part of his mission is to correct errors .

		In the library and the laboratory , instructors and students - are to seek and find new knowledge .

		As Pres - ident
Harper	PERSON	has said , the province of a univer - sity is to be '' the centre of thought on every problem connected with human life and work , and the first obligation resting upon the indi - vidual members which compose it is that of research and investigation . ''

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has been , and is to-day , a place of investigative work and literary activity on the part of teachers and students .

		The professor has only two hours a day of class-work ; the rest of the time he is free to study and write .

		He is also given occasional leave of absence -LRB- six months or a year -RRB- , for travel and study abroad .

		By the system of fellowships and scholarships , a large body of picked students are permitted to spend laborious days in the interests of learning .

		Upon instructors and fellows rests the obli - gation to be productive .

		For the purpose of giving to the world the results of their studies and researches ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	has embarked in the publishing business .

		The
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	issues reg - ularly some ten periodicals , edited by the head professors and their assistants in the various departments -- '' The American Journal of Sociology , '' `` The Journal of Political Econ - omy , '' `` The Journal of Theology , '' `` The Astrophysical Journal , '' etc. .

		The
University Press	ORGANIZATION	has also published many pamphlets and books .

		For the most part these publications have not been popular in character , although interesting to a limited class of readers .

		By their technical treatment of abstruse topics , they appeal only to students and specialists .

		They are none the less valuable contributions to the literature of science , and deservedly rank high in the estimation of scholars the world over .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	opened its doors in
October , 1892	DATE	.

		In commemoration of the completion of ten years of its history , last
October	DATE	, the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities planned a series called the '' Decennial Publications / ' in ten volumes , covering the different fields of instruction in which its faculties are engaged .

		Volumes I. and II .

		consist chiefly of President
Harper	PERSON	's Reports .

		The remaining eight vol - umes are '' Investigations , '' each volume con - taining from 300 to 500 pages , royal octavo .

		Each volume has from eight to seventeen articles of varying length , dealing with a group of allied subjects .

		The articles also appear separately as monographs .

		There are ninety-two articles in all , of which more than seventy are in print .

		Eighty-five writers , in - cluding President
Harper	PERSON	, have contributed to the series .

		When completed , it will constitute a monument of scholarship and scientific re - search .

		Already a considerable number of articles have been issued in separate form as preprints , each sold at
25 cents	MONEY	and upward .

		It is expected that all of the ten volumes will be published during the present year , and most of them will be ready in
September	DATE	.

		The character of their contents may be indicated to some extent by selecting titles of papers in each volume , as announced in the descriptive catalogue of the
Decennial Publications	ORGANIZATION	,
First Series	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume III .

		-LRB- ready -RRB- has two parts .

		Part I. , -- comprising Systematic Theology ,
Church History	ORGANIZATION	, and Practical Theology , -- contains three articles : '' Have we the Likeness of Christ ? ''

		by Prof.
Franklin Johnson	PERSON	; `` Prac - tical Sociology in the Service of Social Ethics , '' by Prof.
C. R. Henderson	PERSON	; and `` The Ele - ments of
Chrysostom	PERSON	's Power as a Preacher , '' by Dr.
Galusha Anderson	PERSON	.

		Part II. , -- com - prising Philosophy and Education , -- contains two papers by Dr.
J. H. Tufts	PERSON	, '' On the Gen - esis of the ^ Esthetic Categories '' and '' The Individual and his Relation to Society as Re - flected in the British Ethics of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' ; also two by Prof.
J. R. Angell	PERSON	, '' A Preliminary Study of the Significance of Par - tial Tones in the Localization of Sound '' and '' The Relations of Structural and Functional Psychology to Philosophy . ''

		Dr.
G. H. Mead	PERSON	contributes an article on '' Psychological An - alysis , '' and Dr.
A. W. Moore	PERSON	one on '' Exist - ence , Meaning , and Reality in
Locke	LOCATION	and in Present Epistemology . ''

		In Volume IV .

		-LRB- ready -RRB- are nine monographs by members of the depaitments of Political Economy ,
Political Science	ORGANIZATION	, History , and Sociology .

		Volume V. is made up of eight articles by men in the departments of Semitics ,
Biblical Philology	ORGANIZATION	, Egyptology , etc. .

		These are chiefly translations of ancient documents and lin - guistic discussions that can be understood and appreciated only by specialists .

		.

		President
Harper	PERSON	contributes to this volume a paper on '' The Structure of the Text of the Book of
Micah	PERSON	. ''

		Volume VI .

		contains fifteen papers , short and long , relating to various matters of signifi - cance chiefly to archaeologists and linguists .

		There is , however , one exception .

		Dr.
Carl D. Buck	PERSON	, professor of Sanskrit and Indo -
European Comparative Philology	ORGANIZATION	, has written an interesting monograph entitled '' A Sketch of the Linguistic Conditions of
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		According to Professor Buck ,
Chicago	LOCATION	is the most cosmopolitan city in the world .

		It is '' an unparalleled babel of foreign tongues , '' having colonies of more than thirty nationalities speak - ing some language other than English .

		He says : ``
Chicago	LOCATION	is the second largest Bohemian city in the world , the third Norwegian , the fourth Polish , the fifth German -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	being the fourth -RRB- .

		In all , there are some forty foreign languages spoken by numbers ranging from half a dozen to half a million , and aggre - gating over 1,000,000 . ''

		Volume VII .

		-LRB- ready -RRB- , -- The Romance Lan - guages and Literatures , the Germanic Lan - guages and Literatures , English , Literature in English , -- has several papers that are distinctly literary : '' The
Treatment of Nature	ORGANIZATION	in the Works of
Nikolaus Lenau	PERSON	, '' by Prof.
Camillo von Klenze	PERSON	; '' Studies in Popular Poetry , '' by Prof.
P. S. Allen	PERSON	; '' What has become of

Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Prof.
W. D. MacClintock	PERSON	; '' Omissions and Insertions in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Plays , '' by Prof.
J. M. Manly	PERSON	.

		Volume
VIII	PERSON	.

		is devoted to the subjects of Astronomy and Astro-Physics .

		The papers give the results of studies and observations by Professors Burnbam ,
Barnard	LOCATION	,
Hale	PERSON	, and other workers at the
Yerkes Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the titles in Volume IX .

		take one 's breath away .

		The papers dealing with the problems of Mathematics ,
Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	, and Physics abound in technicalities that are beyond the average reader .

		They are characterized by the exactness of physical science .

		The eminent geologist , Prof.
Thomas C. Chamberlin	PERSON	, pre - sents a theory of glacier motion based -LRB- 1 -RRB- on the growth of ice crystals or glacier granules , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- on the rotation and sliding of these granules on one another .

		It is opposed to the current theory of viscosity .

		Volume X. contains seventeen papers by men in the different departments of natural science -- Zoology , Anatomy , Physiology ,
Neu	PERSON	- rology , Botany , Pathology , and Bacteriology .

		At the head of the list is Dr.
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	's pamphlet '' On the Production and Suppression of Muscular Twitchings and Hypersensitive - ness of the Skin by Electrolytes , '' which has called forth considerable discussion .

		The in - vestigations of Professor
Loeb	PERSON	and other biolo - gists have a practical bearing .

		In this paper he gives an account of his experiments with calcium salts as a cure for paralysis , locomotor ataxia , and other nervous diseases .

		In addition to the
First Series of Decennial Publications	ORGANIZATION	, the
University	ORGANIZATION	announces a
Second Series	ORGANIZATION	in seventeen volumes .

		These are to be , for the most part , extended treatises on such subjects as '' The
Second Bank	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Ralph C. H. Catterall	PERSON	; `` Light Waves and their Uses , '' by Prof.
Albert A. Michelson	PERSON	; '' Glacial Studies in
Greenland	LOCATION	, '' by Prof.
Thomas C. Chamberlin	PERSON	; `` The Finality of the Christian Religion , '' by Dr.
George B. Foster	PERSON	, etc. .

		Volumes I. to IX .

		in - clusive are ready .

		Other volumes will be issued in the
fall	DATE	and winter .

		It can be truly said that the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is carrying out the will of its founder .

		It is training specialists who are productive , and its instructors are making valuable contri - butions to literature and science , as the De - cennial Publications abundantly prove .

		THE DIAL 91 More Greek Glamour .

		* Mr.
Howard Crosby Butler	PERSON	, who is Lecturer on Architecture at
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, has written '' The Story of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' and in a state - ment which serves as a sort of sub-title an - nounces that the volume is , in intention , `` A record of the life and art of the City of the Violet Crown , read in the ruins and the lives of great Athenians . ''

		Ruins presume architecture ; and as archi - tecture they are not only the survival for us of the rich and vivid background of bygone work and days , but something well able , when interpreted , to instill a subtler understanding of their bygone builders and of the life which streamed before them .

		Translated thus , we have architecture in terms of life .

		The lives of great Athenians , in terms of architecture , have the serious disadvantage of being merely the pin - nacles , or aeroteria , so to speak , of their social fabric ; and it is rather a clearer understanding of the substructure that we are after , these days .

		Pinnacles , however , must be more or less an integral part of the supporting mass ; therefore one passes the great men , and al - lows that in both the ruins and the lives Mr.
Butler	PERSON	has legitimate material in which to read the record of the life and art of the City of the Violet Crown .

		But reading -- to read , -- even a dictionary insists that it is to interpret ; and of this quality , when one looks for a sounder understanding and a more vivid consciousness of all that is pent up for us in the word
Athens	LOCATION	, one looks in vain . ''

		The Story of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' as Mr.
Butler	PERSON	reads it in its ruins and in its lives , but makes one intensely aware that the Athenian accumulation of both since ' `` Omer struck his bloomin ' lyre '' has been enormous ; and over this mass of record a gentle erudite mind plays in a manner somewhat prolix .

		To anyone quite determined to write a sketch dealing with some phase of Greek art and life , it must be somewhat discouraging that
Pater	PERSON	and
Mahaffy	PERSON	and
Taine	PERSON	already have done so .

		This in no way represents a demand that any - one , -- Mr.
Butler	PERSON	, for instance , -- shall com - bine in his writing Pater 's sympathetic and illuminating qualities with
Mahaffy	PERSON	's keen and stimulating suggestiveness ; but it does indi - cate that we have been educated by the ' - Greek * The Story of
Athens	LOCATION	: A Record of the Life and Art of the City of the Violet Crown Read in its Rnins and in the Lives of great Athenians .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Studies '' and the `` Social Life , '' and that the standards they have created of historic feeling and literary method are the present-day criteria .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	, as Lecturer on Architecture at
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, can hardly be indifferent to this condition ; but all the more from his position must he be aware of it , and since in his volume the Athenian lives do anything but live , and there is no exercise of critical faculty nor any attempt at interpretative value , one must conclude he meant it to be so .

		On this assumption , the book becomes a sort of special report , with a good index containing much in - formation hitherto dispersed , and if life means politics , and art a recital of building operations , library - room may be accorded to this '' record of the life and art of the City of the Violet Crown . ''

		And yet , as one houses it under this classi - fication , one knows that many will take the book with no such modification , but will accept it on the authority of the author 's position and publisher , and read it as being really the story of
Athens	LOCATION	.

		So once again is Greek life ex - hibited , but not as a whole ; in its refinement * but not in its rudeness and cruelty ; in its knowledge , but not in its ignorance .

		Again we read of Greek architecture as mines of mathematical proportions , but we neither feel the breeze that blows between the columns nor realize the people passing up and down the steps .

		Homer is incomplete without
Hesiod	LOCATION	; and the lives of the Athenian great need at any rate a mention of the Athenian slave , if the reader is to achieve any complete compre - hension of the Athenian life .

		Also , ruins are incomplete without some knowledge of the ritual which inspired them .

		But of this there is here no hint , nor of any rapport between the art and the lives around it , between the city and the lives within it .

		Some day the book will be written which will not continually refer to the
Parthenon	LOCATION	as being built on the Acropolis , but will show how it grew out of it , and will enable us to achieve the broad glance which gives as a whole that of which we already know too many details .

		This has not yet been done ; and , as already stated , the present vol - ume has evidently no such intention .

		For the benefit of the general reader , however , -- not that I care particularly about him , but suppos - ing that Mr.
Butler	PERSON	does , -- it would seem kinder to select a more exact title , or perhaps to re-write the story .

Timely Problems in Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A number of recent English converts to co - education have contributed their testimony to form a small volume edited by Miss
Alice Woods	PERSON	.

		Until very recently , co-education has been merely tol - erated in
England	LOCATION	, among the lowest elementary schools in the rural districts , from considerations of economy .

		In the last few years , however , a small group of high-class private and grammar schools have cautiously begun the experiment .

		If the pa - pers in tbe present volume are in any sense repre - sentative , the experiments must have been unusually successful ; for the authors write with the ardor and enthusiasm of discoverers .

		From an intellectual standpoint , it has been found that the boys and girls supplement each other ; the interest increases with the introduction of the new system , and dis - cipline is easier than under the old plan .

		The writers spend much of their space in meeting & priori moral objections to co-education , which seems to be the doubtful point with English parents .

		These teachers all testify that although the in - structors maintain strict watch , in an unobtrusive manner , the relations between the sexes are in a vast majority of cases so healthful that no in - terference or additional regulations are needed .

		Indeed , one writer goes so far as to advocate co - education on moral grounds , holding the view that boys ' schools must always be subject to epidemics of immorality as long as the boys are maintained in separate institutions .

		These teachers found that co-education in no way interfered with the athletic efficiency of the boys , or with the cultivation of good manners among the girls .

		This view of co-education is , of course , an old story to American teachers ; it is also supported by the experience of
Scotland	LOCATION	and the English colonies .

		Hence we can tentatively conclude that among English-speaking peoples , at least , expe - rience proves the expediency of co-education for boys and girls below the age of twelve or thirteen .

		As Dr.
Michael E. Sadler	PERSON	, of the
English Education Department	ORGANIZATION	, points out in his introduction to this volume , the expediency of co education through ad - olescence -LRB- from twelve to eighteen -RRB- is an entirely different problem .

		He is in accord with the writers * Co-Education .

		in this volume in regard to the advisability of co - education during the period of childhood , but for the later period he has this to say : `` No one who is at all aware of the complexity of the facts involved or sensitive to the differences in the social ideals which consciously or unconsciously , affect people 's wishes for tbe training of the young , would think of laying down a hard and fast line about coeducation .

		But I for one believe that in the greater number of cases to be edu - cated in common with boys throughout the latter part of her secondary school career would not be the best kind of training for a girl .

		Many of the studies most suitable or nec - essary for boys of fourteen and upwards would be a good deal out of gear with her future practical needs , at any rate if she is to be a a home maker and still more if she is to be a mother of children .

		Again , at the age in question a girl ought not as a rule to work at the same pace as a boy , nor ought she to play most games as hard as it is good for a robust boy to play them . ''

		One at all alive to the silent drift of opinion must have noticed the growth of a public sentiment similar to that here expressed by Mr.
Sadler	PERSON	, among tbe more intelligent classes in our larger towns and cities .

		There is a feeling that the old frontier conditions of life which made co-education so neces - sary and salutary in high-schools are making way for a much more complex environment .

		The in - timate associations of the class-room during the emotional period of youth means one thing in a small country town , where every pupil knows by reputation every other pupil 's family and stand - ing ; but in a large city it means something far different .

		There is a chapter in the life of many co-educational high-schools which is never told , be - cause it is to everyone 's interest to forget it .

		The success achieved by many ambitious girls in reach - ing , and often surpassing , the standard originally designed for the greater strength of their brothers , is triumphantly used by the co-educationists , re - gardless of the well-known fact that many such girls enfeeble their health for life by such achiev - ments .

		Until lately , the real issue has remained in the background , while coeducation in colleges has been the bone of contention .

		On this question , then , it may be said by way of summary , that English and American teachers are slowly coming to agree - ment , -- the advantages of co-education for the ele - mentary period , and its disadvantages for the pupils of the secondary age , being seen by both .

		Mr.
Richard Rogers Bowker	PERSON	has added an edu - cational volume to his series of critical essays which treat of the different fundamental interests of mod - ern life .

		The first and most important paper in the present collection , which discusses education in gen - eral , follows in its main outlines the well-known treatise of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		The style is ex - cellent , and the author has a genius for catching and phrasing the more subtle tendencies of the age .

		The two remaining essays in the volume , on '' The Scholar , the Making and Use of Him , '' and '' The College of To-day , '' were written twenty years pre - vious to publication , and form an excellent state - ment of the old ideal of eollege training .

		Mr.
Bowker	PERSON	is a firm believer in the theory that the
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 college should equip its graduates with the impor - tant results and methods of thought in the entire circles of scientific disciplines .

		This ideal is some - times defended to-day , but its realization is seldom attempted .

		The merits of Mr.
Bowker	PERSON	's book are largely literary ; its appeal is to the general read - ing public , and its value is largely that of an in - troduction . ''

		The
Place of Industries	ORGANIZATION	in
Elementary Educa	LOCATION	- tion , '' by Miss
Katharine Elizabeth Dopp	PERSON	, contains a careful elaboration of the social basis of early education as set forth by Dr.
Dewey	PERSON	of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The introductory chapter is a clear statement of the main outlines of the Dewey theory .

		In the second chapter on ' • The Significance of In - dustrial Epochs , '' we find a careful and suggestive study of the reaction of the different industrial periods on race intelligence .

		The third chapter is psychological , treating of the origins of Attitudes that underlie Industry ; and the fourth is peda - gogical , showing how the essential values of early industry are to be obtained in the modern city school-room .

		The author directs the attention of teachers to anthropological material which can be utilized in the schools .

		The conclusions are briefly put in the fifth chapter .

		The book is provided with an excellent index .

		The author has evidently lav - ished time and attention on the logical development of a single vein of ideas , and in consequence her work is conspicuous among educational books for good workmanship .

		Her thesis is so intertwined with Dr.
Dewey	PERSON	's ideas , that it must necessarily stand or fall with them .

		In three addresses now published in book form , President Eliot of Harvard has '' taken account of stock '' as far as the American public-school system is concerned .

		The first chapter might be charac - terized as treating of • • What the public-school has failed to do . ''

		An enumeration of the weak points in American life gives us this indictment : as a na - tion , we are characterized by excessive alcoholism , a vast amount of gambling , municipal misgovern - ment .

		numerous crimes of violence , yellow journals and theatres , strikes , faith in patent medicines , and the spoils system of appointments .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	in his second address shows us the golden side of the shield .

		In the field of education proper , there has been much progress in the last generation .

		Among the most important improvements have been the introduction of kindergarten methods , the expansion of the elementary curriculum , the organ - ization of improved systems of secondary education , a higher standard of admission to normal schools , larger employment of educational experts , and in - creased attention to the education of the body .

		As the title states , the book is a plea for more money ; and in the last address President Eliot tells us what he would do with more money if he had it .

		Med - ical supervision and more sanitary school-houses would be secured ; while more male teachers , and a smaller number of pupils per teacher , would be provided for .

		Music , drawing , and modern lan - guages would be introduced into the curriculum ; vacation schools and mechanic arts high-schools would be established .

		The recent criticism of a distinguished psycho - logist aimed at certain pedagogical thinkers has provoked in reaction a large number of protests , two of which are now before us .

		Professor
Sinclair	PERSON	, vice - principal of the normal school at
Ottawa	LOCATION	, Can - ada , bases his argument on '' the possibility of a science of education '' on the returns to a question - naire syllabus which he issued to a number of uni - versity professors and presidents .

		A large majority of those responding -- forty-five out of fifty-seven -- favor the professional training of teachers .

		These replies , which Professor
Sinclair	PERSON	publishes in an appendix , show the drift of opinion among one class of professional men , and are interesting reading .

		As professor
Sinclair	PERSON	tells us nothing concerning the opportunities which these scientists have had for observing educational problems and conditions , we must assume that in this respect they were simply average men ; in which case their opinions , except those of the presidents , are about as much to the point as would be the judgment of a number of expert engineers on the '' case method '' of study - ing law .

		Professor
Sinclair	PERSON	's thesis is developed with great care and an abundance of scientific no - menclature .

		He first refutes certain popular fal - lacies , then explains what he means by the `` dynamic conception of educational science , '' and finally indi - cates the value of such a science to school-teachers .

		His conclusions are safe and cautious , and would probably be accepted without difficulty by all per - sons qualified to express an opinion .

		As a rule , Professor
Sinclair	PERSON	's results are too obvious and general to be of much service to instructors in ped - agogy , and too technically phrased to reach the public .

		The real problems in the professional train - ing of teachers are those of concrete methods and results , which Professor Sinclair leaves untouched .

		Miss Young 's paper on '' Scientific Method in Education '' is an able but brief description of the need for a science which shall treat education at first hand .

		It is published as one of the decennial publications of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

India	LOCATION	wore The history of
India	LOCATION	during the the Britith mediaeval period is a story of f or - tubjugation .

		e jg n domination .

		After many futile attempts on the part of Western peoples to obtain a foothold in the land of the Hindu , finally , at the beginning of the eleventh century , the Muslim Turks established themselves in
Northwestern India	LOCATION	, and gradually , during the eight hundred years which followed , brought under their sway all the country from the
Himalayas	LOCATION	to the
Krishna River	LOCATION	.

		The story of this foreign occupation is now told by
Stanley Lane-Poole	ORGANIZATION	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Litt.D. , 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, M.B.I.A. , Professor of Arabic at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, in '' Mediaeval
India	LOCATION	Under Mohammedan Rule '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The work is a chronicle of kings , courts , and conquests , -- the story of the lives and deeds of a few great men and great wom - en .

		In the history of Western races , we find our greatest interest in the people themselves , in the development of constitutions , of civic rights , of individual liberties , or in the evolution of self-gov - ernment .

		But in
Oriental	LOCATION	history there is nothing of this sort .

		The masses of
India	LOCATION	know nothing of these things .

		They have had kings with despotic power since time immemorial .

		They believe that '' power is a divine gift , to be exercised absolutely by God 's anointed , and obeyed unquestioned by everybody else ; '' and , seemingly with no vain longings , no murmurings , no dissatisfaction , they submit to domination , saying : '' Whatever king may rule , there will still be plague and famine , and constant but not energetic labor ; and so long as the rice and millet grow , and salt is not too dear , life is much the same , and the gods may be pro- pitiated .

		The difference caused in the rayat 's life by a good or a bad king is too slight to be worth discussing .

		The good and the ill are alike things of a day ; they pass away as the life passes when the king decrees a death or massacres a village ; but others follow , and the world goes on , and the will of God is eternal . ''

		Aryan ,
Hun	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	,
Persian	LOCATION	,
Rajput	ORGANIZATION	,
Turk	LOCATION	, Afghan , and Mongol rulers , with their followers , in turn have settled in
India	LOCATION	, and remained there for years ; yet they have scarcely touched the soul of the people .

		There has been no assimilation of either foreigners or their ideas .

		The subject-matter of Professor
Lane-Poole	PERSON	's book is intensely interesting , and , presented in easy , fluent style , is delightful reading .

		It is history with all the charm of romance .

		There is an ample number of illustrations , -- in all , fifty-eight , -- prints of portraits of Moghul Emperors , and of their palaces , mosques , and tombs .

		The appendix gives chrono - logical and genealogical tables which supply details omitted in the narrative .

		A list of the best works of European travellers during the seventeenth cen - tury is of especial value to those who wish to go more deeply into the subject than does the author in a work which aims to be only the outline of a long , long story .

		\ of the wth century .

		of
Bussian Literature	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- has now been completed by the publication of the second volume , dealing with the writers of the nineteenth century .

		More strictly ppeaking , the scope of the work is the first three - quarters of the nineteenth century , for the last decades and the younger writers of to-day find scant representation .

		Of men born since
1850	DATE	, only seven find a place , the last two being Mr.
Pyeshkov	PERSON	-LRB-
Gorki	PERSON	-RRB- , and Professor
Merezhkovski	PERSON	, neither of whom could well be omitted .

		From
Karamzin	PERSON	and
Krylov	PERSON	, who open the volume , to these two who close it , fifty-three writers are recognized , each being represented by a brief biography , and a selec - tion , or group of selections , from his work .

		An important feature of this volume is offered by the selections that represent Russian criticism , since these provide us with a commentary upon the very nineteenth-century Russian literature to which the volume is devoted .

		Professor
Wiener	PERSON	's introduc - tory essay is thoughtful and suggestive .

		Perhaps its most significant passage is the following : '' Lit - erature has been in
Russia	LOCATION	the field in which all the battles of progress have been fought .

		As there does not exist a representative government , where political opinions may struggle for recognition , and as there can not exist a public opinion based on traditions and class interests , literature alone ap - pears as the medium for advancing social and political ideas ; and since scientific treatises reach but a vanishing proportion of the nation , belles - lettres proper have in
Russia	LOCATION	become the means for inculcating and propagating truths .

		In the begin - ning of the nineteenth century this was not yet so apparent , and literature for arts ' sake could hold its own .

		But with the advancing democratisation of society , literature gathered ever more around camps with definite ideas , and literary art receded more and more and lived out its day in oblivion . ''

		This Russian anthology that Professor
Wiener	PERSON	has edited is a very valuable addition to the library of the student of literary history , who should be extremely grateful for this means of making an acquaintance , almost at first hand , with all that is most important in the literature of the great and little-known Russian people .

		A minor but very genuine cause for gratitude will be found in the fact that the pronunciation of proper names is indicated throughout the work , a matter of no little importance when we take into account the capricious distribution of accents in Russian names . ''

Carlyle	PERSON	's fa - mous saying , '' From a small window one may view the infinite . ''

		While the book contains much exact information about English pottery and its makers , it also possesses literary charm and interest for the general reader .

		The author 's treatment of the sub - ject is much broader than that of a mere collector , and the book gains greatly thereby .

		He studies plates and jugs as `` valuable historical documents '' and his pages are full of interesting details con - cerning notable persons and places .

		Of especial interest are extracts from letters of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	, showing that in the midst of grave affairs they knew the charm of '' old blue . ''

		THE DIAL 95 something larger and better , '' says Mr.
Moore	PERSON	; and he finds in the love of old china a remedy for the hurry and unrest of modern life .

		The history of English pottery is traced from the earliest examples , made about
1560	DATE	, through the '' golden age '' ' of
Wedgwood	ORGANIZATION	, down to the present time .

		China made for the American market during the early part of last century is especially described , particularly the wares made in
Staffordshire	LOCATION	by Wood , the
Clews	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and others less well known .

		The ac - count of
Josiah Wedgwood	PERSON	and his work is very full ; while porcelain made at
Derby	LOCATION	,
Worcester	LOCATION	, and
Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	receives due attention .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	discusses at some length processes of manufacture , marks of identification , and the present value of treasures once stored away in dusty corners of the attic .

		The many fine illustrations and the com - plete index add to the usefulness of the book .

		The author frankly acknowledges that he wrote for the '' happy possessors of a hobby , '' and surely the charm of his book will go far to increase the num - ber of those fortunate people .

		The problem Since the time of
Darwin	LOCATION	, great ad - o / Variation in vances have been made in the study plant * and animal * .

		Q f tne phenomenon of variation in plants and animals .

		Statistics and higher mathe - matics have been called upon to define and delimit the process as it occurs in nature , and the experi - mental method has been utilized to unlock the secret causes at its foundation .

		Dr.
H. M. Vernon	PERSON	, of
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, has been one of the foremost investigators and experimenters in this field , and he has summarized his own work and that of others upon this problem in his recent book , '' Variation in Animals and Plants '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , in a critical way , and relates his conclusions to the prob - lems of evolution and heredity .

		While thoroughly scientific , this book is not over-technical either in biological terminology or mathematical methods .

		The intimate relation which variation bears to evolution and heredity , and the timeliness and thoroughness of Dr.
Vernon	PERSON	's treatment of his sub - ject , make his book a desideratum to all investiga - tors and thinkers on these vital subjects .

		After a discussion of the measurement of variation , the au - thor takes up dimorphism and discontinuous vari - ation , including De
Vrie	PERSON	's theory of Mutation .

		Correlated variations , especially in man .

		and the action of genetic selection in human evolution , com - plete his discussion of the facts of variation .

		The causes of variation are treated very fully , including amphimixis , reversion , prepotency , sports , monsters , bad variation , hybrids , and the recently rediscovered Mendelian laws of hybridization .

		The diminish - ing effect of the environment , with age and with growth , is formulated into a law .

		and the effects of migration in increasing variability are noted .

		The author is inclined to think that
Darwin	PERSON	overesti - mated the effect of domestication in causing variations , since the study of wild animals has re - vealed equal divergences in nature .

		He also A notable biography o /
Eratmtu	ORGANIZATION	.

		inclines to a belief in the direct action of the en - vironment upon the germ-cells , which differs but little from inheritance of acquired characters .

		This is a stimulating book for biologists , sociologists , and philosophers Certain books are of such a char - acter that the reader 's first impres - sion is not one of details at all , but rather of the work as a whole .

		Such a book is Mr.
Ernest F. H. Capey	PERSON	's `` Life of Erasmus '' -LRB-
Dut	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , and on laying it aside the first thought is , `` a charming bit of biography . ''

		Considering the separate chapters , one finds the earlier ones are not quite up to the level of the rest .

		One misses in them an adequate statement of those facts of heredity and environment that were so potent in developing the career of the great humanist .

		But no such criticism of inadequacy can be made of those portions of the book dealing with the period of his real activity .

		The emphasis is properly laid upon his immense , and now well-nigh forgotten , importance as a man of letters , -- it is hard to re - alize that with the passing of Latin as a universal language no modern writer , not even
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, has enjoyed the general European repution of
Erasmus	LOCATION	, -- but his relation to the
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	is also well and clearly discussed .

		In the pages of this little book the man becomes a definite personality .

		His weaknesses are by no means passed over , his sane and enlightened views -- often so far in advance of his age , so strikingly modern -- are duly and fairly presented .

		There is no attempt , however , to ex - ploit the hero .

		A wise reticence is also observed in dealing with some questions when the evidence is not conclusive ; while the mass of legend , both creditable and otherwise , is altogether ignored .

		An excellent bibliography , with special mention of En - glish translations of the works of
Erasmus	PERSON	and a selected list of biographical studies and magazine articles , is appended ; while an admirable index completes the book and makes it an available tool for the special student of literature or history , as well as a work that will attract the general reader .

		All special students of the subject '' ha ^ a ` Brtjy are '' g r eed that to every mental state there somehow '' corresponds '' a state of the brain .

		But in the interpretation of the how , authorities differ to-day almost as widely as they did a generation ago .

		The fact is that the problem , despite its paramount importance , has not been studied with the circumspection and care it deserves .

		Those who are in any degree interested in the subject will accordingly welcome Professor
C. A. Strong	PERSON	's '' Why the Mind has a Body '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , for here will be found a comprehensive and detailed survey of the field by one who is thoroughly equipped for his work .

		Professor Strong first ex - amines , at some length , the more important current hypotheses as to the relation of mind and brain .

		Their conflicting claims , he concludes , can not be adjudicated without an inquiry into the real nature 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, of both terms of the relation .

		To this topic , with its ramifications , he accordingly devotes the second part of the book .

		From the vantage-ground thus gained he proceeds , in Part Three , to subject the reigning theories to a re-examination and to state his own solution .

		The work of the first two parts is very well done .

		The treatment is clear , objective , fairly thorough , and in the main convincing .

		But in the last part the author too often shows undue haste to arrive at the conclusion of his journey .

		His criticism becomes , at important points , super - ficial ; while the formulation of his own position is left too abstract , and , apparently , exposed to obvious objections .

		Professor Strong , however , promises to develop the positive side of his thesis at length in a second volume .

		There we may expect his theory to appear in the needed clearness and concreteness .

		There too the objections that can be urged against it will doubtless be considered with the care to which they are entitled .

Rawnsley	PERSON	has just published oftheEngiith his fifth book on the subject of the
Lake	LOCATION	country .

		La k e Country and the literary lights that have added so much to its interest .

		This latest volume , which is charmingly bound and illustrated , is called '' Lake Country Sketches '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The opening essay gives some rem - iniscences of
Wordsworth	PERSON	that are yet lingering in the minds of various humble folk who in their youth served in one capacity or another at
Rydal Mount	ORGANIZATION	.

		All agree that the great poet was wont '' to say nowt to noabody , '' and '' to bum and boo about , '' -- that is , to mumble to himself ; not one of them seems to have cared much for him , all found genial
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	more to their liking , and all were of the opinion that
Coleridge	PERSON	and the poet 's sister ,
Miss Wordsworth	PERSON	, wrote his poetry for him .

		It is a curious fact that to-day few of the country folk round about where
Wordsworth	PERSON	lived have read his verse or even possess copies of it .

		One peasant , when questioned about the poems , answered : `` Well , you see , blessed barn , there 's pomes and pomes , and
Wudsworth	PERSON	's was not for sec as us . ''

		With the ex - ception of a sketch called ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	at
Cocker	PERSON	- mouth , '' the book concerns itself with descriptions of the country side , its quaint characters , and bits of folk-lore .

		Character sketches , like `` A
Skiddaw Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	, '' gives one a good idea of the material which
Wordsworth	PERSON	had at his command when he wished to picture men of fine character in the hum - bler walks of life .

		In style ,
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	's work is delightful .

		In simple English he tells of his loved Lake Country in its varying moods , revealing in all that he writes his own charming personality , his intense love of and sympathy with nature , and with his own human kind .

		Psychology Jot teachers .

		Dr.
Charles H. Judd	PERSON	, of
Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , has put forth a very help - ful book , '' Genetic Psychology for Teachers '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , that is likely to find , as it deserves , a wide circle of readers among those en - gaged in the profession that we often laud in theory and disdain in fact .

		It is not easy to offer to that large company of workers in the field of letters something that will furnish inspiration for the con - siderable drudgery of the work , and a guiding light through maze-like and unilluminated paths .

		Dr.
Judd	PERSON	believes this can best be done by presenting concrete illustrations of the growth of mental ac - quisition and attainment in the history of the indi - vidual and of the race .

		His success goes far to demonstrate the correctness of his aim .

		His scope of topics is wide and # advisedly selective rather that systematic .

		The teacher 's world , like that of every - one else , is full of a number of things , and its va - riety is the antidote to the prescribed monotony of the earlier and conventional experience .

		The story of the growth of writing among men , the change of educational ideals with the march of the centuries , the encounters with fact by which knowledge grows , and the analysis of the interpretation of experience , furnish a suggestive background for the setting of tasks and the training of the young idea .

		Dr.
Judd	PERSON	's book , while not achieving an unusual or epoch-making importance , is distinctly successful in the well-defined field that it covers .

		What he offers in the way of biography is all that is really known of the great genius , yet the book leaves one with a feeling of disappointment .

		One wishes to know so much more of Leonardo the man , and regrets that this versatile master left comparatively so little , and that , of what he did leave , so much has been lost , or is in a poor state of preservation -- as , for example , the paint - ing of ■ The Last

Paul Cams	PERSON	.

		It is an inquiry into the question of the Ding an

		While we are hardly willing to admit that this discussion really eliminates the ■ thing-in-itself '' from philosophy , we are glad to pay tribute to the stimulating and suggestive character of the arguments advanced by Dr.
Carus	PERSON	, and to the interest of his summary of post-Kantian opinion upon this subject . ''

Arthur Schopenhauer	PERSON	, is the most important of the philosopher 's minor works hitherto untranslated into English .

		This is the famous essay that was not crowned by the

Schopenhauer	PERSON	afterwards com - mented in his most caustic vein of irony .

		It is a pity that the translator should not have given us these comments , which form the introduction to the German edition , as well as the text of the essay itself .

		As for the main work , it is one of the soundest and most stim - ulating of ethical treatises , and we can not urge its read - ing too strongly upon those who have not yet made its acquaintance .

		We have frequently had occasion to commend the books prepared for this series , and this latest addition to their number is a work of exceptional importance .

		Its distinctive features are found in the selection of illustrations , in the fact that more than half of the volume is devoted to the nine - teenth century , and in the source-material offered with the several chapters .

		These source extracts are neces - sarily brief , bat they are chosen with singular judicious - ness , and often illuminate in a quite unexpected way the narrative text .

		A synopsis of '' leading events '' affords a useful method of summary and review .

		A quarter of a century ago , plant physiology was a subject that hardly existed for teaching purposes , or otherwise than as an abstract division of botanicnl science theoretically posited , but not worked out in any systematic way .

		Now , every department of botanical a sizable college gives courses in it , and text-books , both German and English , exist in numbers .

		The latest addition to them is '' A Text-Book of Plant Physiology , '' by Dr.
George James Pierce	PERSON	, which has just been published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a work of considerable dimensions , for advanced college use , and is based upon a teaching experience of several years with the subject .

		The author states his aim to have been '' to express safe views rather than to echo the most recent , '' which is a very wise plan in dealing with so rapidly-developing a subject .

		It is the work of Mr.

		Amidst the endless succession of new novels , it is pleasant to note the continued vogue of that excellent work of the late
Paul L. Ford	PERSON	, '' The Honorable
Peter Sterling	PERSON	. ''

		First Lessons in
United States History	LOCATION	, '' by
Edward Channing	PERSON	, is attractively gotten up by the

		The courts , it may be added , decided that the assassin of President
McKinley	PERSON	was not `` an insane person , '' which is the author 's state - ment .

		Four small volumes on `` The Art of Writing and Speaking the English Language , '' prepared by Mr.

L. H. Jones	PERSON	is the compiler of '' The Jones Readers , '' in five volumes , published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These five graded books contain a total of
1568	DATE	pages , and are praiseworthy as to their typography , their illustrations , and the literary character of the selections offered .

		Ethical ideals have been especially kept in view by the editor , and a progressive develop - ment of the child 's vocabulary is the underlying educa - tional aim of the volumes .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	's '' The Alchemist , '' edited , with intro - duction , notes , and a glossary , by Dr.
Charles Mont	PERSON	- gomery
Hathaway	PERSON	, is the latest addition to the ''
Yale Studies	ORGANIZATION	in English , '' published for
Yale University by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work was prepared as a doctoral thesis , and is of the most elaborate character , including a lengthy sketch of the history of alchemy , a bibliography , a discussion of
Jonson	PERSON	's sources , over a hundred pages of notes , an extensive glossary , and an index .

		The
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	has just published a sup - plement to its list of serial publications contained in the public libraries of
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Evanston	LOCATION	, making many additions to the contents of the earlier publication , and providing complete information up to the date of
last April	DATE	.

		These two lists are of the greatest useful - ness to students in the vicinity of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and their preparation by the authorities of the
John Crerar Li	PERSON	- brary is a public-spirited undertaking that deserves warm recognition .

		We wrote not long ago in praise of Mr.
Percival Chubb	PERSON	's volume on the teaching of English , and we now have occasion to commend a second work upon this important subject . ''

		The Teaching of English in the Elementary and the Secondary School , '' just pub - lished by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the '' American Teachers ' Series , '' is the joint production of Professors
George Rice Carpenter	PERSON	,
Franklin T. Baker	PERSON	, and
Fred N. Scott	PERSON	.

		These are the best of names for the purpose , and the volume which has thus been prepared is a manual of absolutely indispensable importance to every teacher of the subject in this country .

		This we say not merely because of the sound doctrine which the book preaches , but also because of the extreme helpfulness of its practical suggestions , its valuable outlines , references , and special bibliographies .

		In these latter respects , the work is more elaborate than Mr.
Chubb	PERSON	's otherwise similar treatment of the subject .

$ ® ont $ lv	MONEY	Journal of Eiterarp Crittcigm , 2Dtecu00ion , and information IN the flood of books pouring daily from the press there is so much to choose from that no person can , unaided , judge what is to be read and what left unread .

		Hence a journal that may be steadily trusted as a safe and agreeable guide to the character , the contents , the merits and demerits , of the important new books is obviously of the greatest value to everyone of literary inclinations or pursuits .

		Such a journal The Dial has long been known to be .

		Established for nearly a quarter of a century , it is generally recognized by the highest critical authorities as `` the leading literary journal of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In its pages the new books are described and discussed upon their merits , without fear or favor , by the ablest scholars and critics in the country .

		To all who need a trustworthy and independent guide and aid in the complex field of current literature The Dial is altogether indispensable .

		SOME BRIEF OPINIONS The Dial has no superior among the literary journals of the country in intelligence , dignity , and weight .

		It has always treated literature with the ut - most seriousness and with the fullest knowledge .

		It has never sought by any lightness of tone or by the introduction of the personal element to secure a large constituency , but has addressed itself to thinkers , scholars , and students of literature .

		The Outlook ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The Dial is sober , conscientious , and scholarly ; from every point of view unsurpassed by any other literary journal in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		The Dial is easily our most valuable literary review .

		It has been faithful to the best literary tra - ditions from the first , and will no doubt continue to be so .


John Burroughs	PERSON	.

		The Dial I think is by far the best of our American literary journals .

		It stands up against provinciality , yet is not servile to foreign critics .

		It holds to the old , while not turning its back on the new .

		It is sane and honest , and while sympathetic has nothing of the gush that we sometimes find .


William P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The Dial 's look and bearing are refinement itself .

		Seriousness , fearless care , and a right instinct in letters , help to make it the best review we have .

		The Independent ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The Dial has always stood for character .

		It has the old Puritan conscience on which everything that is lasting in our country is built .

		It is sane , wise , truthful ; it is honest , hopeful , and kindly ; and with all this it is the best journal of literary criticism which we have , and we ask no better .


David Starr Jordan	PERSON	.

		The Dial seems at present the most unbiased , good humored , and sensible organ of American crit - icism .

		The central situation on which the plot turns is one of the most original in modern fiction .

MESSRS. D. APPLETON	PERSON	AND COMPANY take pleasure in announcing for early publication a number of rare and famous illustrated books of fiction and general literature , faithfully reprinted , in small form , from the first or best editions with introduction or notes .

		The particular and attractive feature of these books is the reproduction of all the illustrations , in colors or otherwise , which appeared in the original issues ; illustrations which are part and parcel of the books , and which , from their beauty , or skill , or humor , had often as great a share in their success as the text itself .

		Most of these books had colored illustrations , and they are here similarly given .

		This will be the first time that these famous books with their illustrations faithfully reproduced have been placed within easy reach of the public , and much interest in them is confidently anticipated .

		n. Concluding our summary of the '' Athe - naeum 's '' annual review of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	litera - ture , we reproduce the leading features of the following reports :
Holland	LOCATION	, by Mr.
H. S. M	PERSON	.

		van
Wickevoort Crommelin	PERSON	;
Hungary	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Leopold Katscher	PERSON	;
Italy	LOCATION	by Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	;
Poland	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	;
Russia	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Yalerii Briusov	PERSON	; and
Spain	LOCATION	, by
Don Rafael Altamira	ORGANIZATION	.

		We note with regret that both
Norway	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	are missing from this year 's review , as well as
Greece	LOCATION	, which also is usually included .

		Mr.
van Wickevoort Crommelin	PERSON	, writing of Dutch literature , says : '' The year has been most prolific both in promise and performance .

		Such healthy and vigorous books have not appeared for a long time .

		So varied are the divided army , obeying no sovereign command .

		They are indeed ; there has never been more diversity , and ways of expression current among the writers of
today	DATE	that the complaint has been heard that theyjare a even an - tagonism of groups and personalities .

		But this only shows the strong individualism which everywhere abounds . ''

		The strength of the Dutch genius is in its ap - preciation of the beauty of common things , a fact which is illustrated by Dutch art and liter - ature alike .

		Mr.
J. van Looy	PERSON	, who is both a painter and a man of letters , is the author of `` Feesten , '' which `` dwells on such humble topics as a party in a workman 's cottage , fire - works , and popular amusements in the slums . ''

		Mr.
Streuvels	PERSON	, in `` Langs de Wegen , '' his last great work , tells `` the story of a simple and lonely labourer who is everywhere elbowed out by a harsh world . ''

		Mr.
Frans Coenen	PERSON	's '' Zondagsrust '' is '' little more than the ac - count of a rainy
Sunday	DATE	passed by a family of three members . '' ''

		The only novel in which a comprehensive plan is elaborated by a firm hand is Mr.
Louis Couperus	PERSON	's '
Boeken	PERSON	der
Kleine Zielen	PERSON	. '

		Last year I just men - tioned the vast scheme of this book , two new volumes of which , ' Zielenschemering ' and ■ Het Heilige Weten , ' have appeared .

		Here we meet with a woman who grows wearied of `` society . '

		When
Constance	PERSON	implores her influential brother-in-law , the minister
Yan Naghel	PERSON	, to invite her to one of his official dinner parties in order to rehabilitate her in the eyes of the world , and to give her son a start in life , she suddenly becomes aware of 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the utter futility of her aspirations .

		She does not re - sort to suicide , as a French heroine might , but reforms her life and finds worthier ideals . ''

		A noteworthy play is ''
Gunlaug en Helga	PERSON	, '' by the Flemish poet , Mr.
Victor de Meyere	PERSON	, which work , '' although it has many good qualities , turned out to be rather an obsolete remnant of the romantic period . '' ''

		Nieuwe Geboort , '' by Mrs.
Roland Hoist	PERSON	, is '' a political glorification of socialism . ''

		Dr.
Katscher	PERSON	's Hungarian article opens with the following paragraph : `` Fiction , already last year at a low ebb , has con - tinued so during the past twelvemonth .

		There are scarcely any really firstrate productions to be noticed , although some good ones have seen the light .

		Mr.
M6r J6kai	PERSON	, our oldest man of letters , has brought out , after a few years ' silence , an interesting novel entitled * Our Pole , ' by which title he means a Polish Jew who is a half-legendary conqueror of hearts from the time of the Hungarian struggle for liberty .

		After a thrill - ing love affair with a proud and beautiful noblewoman , this man comes to a sad end .

		He sacrifices love and life to his faith .

		The background of the story is ro - mantic , humorous , and well constructed . '' ''

		Ideals '' is a political novel by Mr.
Lajos Beck	PERSON	, a new man .

		It is a plea for socialism . ''

		The King of Beasts at Large , '' by Mr.
Istvan Barsony	PERSON	, is an animal story which has some points of resemblance to '' The Jungle Books '' of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ferencz Herczeg	PERSON	is the most widely read of Hungarian writers at the present day . ''

		His latest novel , '
Andrew	PERSON	and
Andor	ORGANIZATION	, ' is an ex - tremely ironical and satirical picture of contemporary
Budapest	LOCATION	society , an elegant and charming description of certain aspects of Hungarian journalism .

		In com - position it may not be regular , but the dialogue is highly spirited and the characterization excellent .

		Mr.
Herczeg	PERSON	's newest play , too , is of a satirical turn .

		It is entitled '
Manus Manum Lavat	PERSON	, ' and attacks nepotism , an evil terribly prominent in this country .

		This suc - cessful comedy exhibits many new sides of a brilliant , but somewhat frequently treated , subject . ''

		`` Nero 's Mother , '' by Mr.
Victor Tardos	PERSON	, is a '' grand tragedy '' which '' ranks higher than any Hungarian play performed for many years . ''

		In poetry , the year 's output has been above the average ; noteworthy books are Mr.
Sandor Feleki	PERSON	's '' Shadows and
Kays	PERSON	, '' and the `` Verses '' of Miss
Renee Erdos	PERSON	, '' full of true love , true psychology , and true poetry . ''

		Serious publi - cations include Professor
Heinrich	PERSON	's '' History of the World 's Literature , '' to be the work of a number of specialists ; Professor
Marczali	PERSON	's '' Great Illustrated Universal History '' ; Mr.
Ignacz Acsady	PERSON	's '' History of the Magyar Em - pire '' ; Mr.
Jozsef Fekete	PERSON	's '' The Philosophy of Life '' ; and Mr.
Mor Gelleri	PERSON	's `` Social Questions of the Day . ''

		According to Dr.
Biagi	PERSON	's account , the chief subjects of interest to Italians during the past year have been the
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	telegraph and the fall of the Campanile -- neither of them having any particular relation to literature .

		He says : '' I heartily commiserate those who may have to write the history of Italian literature during the open - ing years of this century .

		They will find themselves con - fronted by an output so abundant , but at the same time so uniform , that few works will stand out , owing either to their form or to their contents , whilst of tbe mass the output itself , as much from the form as from the substance , is worthy of observation .

		It is a fact that during this last period great progress has been made .

		Whilst at first , by the side of works of excellence , due to a few writers of taste and of refinement , there sprang up laughable or pitiable literary abortions , now , if , in - deed , notable works are lacking , those also are scarce that excite contempt and disgust . ''

		The recent development of secondary teaching and the activity of the universities are influ - ences that are having very salutary results in the field of literature .

		The scientific impulse is giving way in large measure to the critical and artistic impulse .

		`` Each of our faculties of letters is a workshop of studies where the history of literature and culture plays the predominant part ... Luckily a famous master ,
Giosue Carducci	PERSON	, showed by example that art and criti - cism were not two things in opposition ; that on the contrary , one dwelt within the other ; that if the taste was not educated one judged badly even of ancient works .

		So began with him and his disciples -- to-day professors in many high schools -- a salutary reaction against the analytical school and the purely corrosive criticism .

		Now the two tendencies balance each other and are intermingled , and the new generation has felt and understand that if history has its rights , art has too , and that serious criticism can not take away from one or the other . ''

		The great writers are for the most part rest - ing on their laurels . ''


Signor Carducci	PERSON	has now bidden a final adieu to his muse ;
Signor Fogazzaro	PERSON	is satisfied with his political in - fluence in his native
Vicenza	LOCATION	, where also he fills with great zeal the office of President of the
Board of Charity ; Signor de Amicis	ORGANIZATION	has been silent for some time ;
Signor Giacosa	PERSON	is directing a monthly magazine , the ` Lettura ' ; and
Signor Guerrini	PERSON	is reprinting the ' Rime ' of Lorenzo Stecchetti . ''


Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	has a new trilogy in verse , ''
Laudi	PERSON	del Cielo , della
Terra	ORGANIZATION	, del Mare , e degli Eroe , '' of which the first volume has appeared .


Signor Pascoli	PERSON	has published the first volume of his '' Canti di Castelvecchio . ''

		`` These songs of his , exqui - site , perfect in form , express delicate thoughts drawn from pure wells of poetic inspiration . ''

		Other volumes of verse are `` Verso l'Oriente , '' by
Signor Orvieto	PERSON	; `` Patria Terra , '' by Signor
1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 113 Pitteri ; and ''
Poemi Lirici	PERSON	, '' by
Signor	PERSON	Tu - miati . ''

		The Italian capital is now being formed and con - stituted in
Rome	LOCATION	, but all the elements that certainly are there have not yet been able to amalgamate and fuse into a single whole .

		The ^ romance-writers who describe
Rome	LOCATION	of to-day speak of the black world and the white world , and someone has found there the yellow world --
Signor Giustino Ferri	PERSON	, for example , who en - titled his romance '
Roma Gialla	PERSON	. '

		There are too many strident and discordant colours , too many currents of life in perpetual contrast .

		It is difficult to collect and represent in its true aspect a life so multiform .

		How - ever , whilst a really Italian romance and theatre have still to be looked for , there are first-rate representations of local life and customs . ''

		A Sardinian writer ,
Signora Grazia Deledda	PERSON	, has ** quickly sprung into great fame '' with her romances , ''
Elias Portolu	PERSON	'' and '' Dopo il Divorzio . ''

		Other fiction includes '' II
Maleficio Occulto	PERSON	, '' by
Signor Zuccoli	PERSON	; ''
Oasi	PERSON	, '' by Sig - nor d'Ambra ; and `` Dopo la
Vittoria	LOCATION	, '' by a new and promising writer who takes '' Sfinge '' for a pen-name .

		The theatrical successes of the year have been
Signor Rovetto	PERSON	's '' Roman - ticism '' and
Signor Martoglio	PERSON	's `` Nica . ''

		Lit - erary productions of a more sober character include
Signor Chiarini	PERSON	's `` Memorie della Vita di
Giosue Carducci	PERSON	, ''
Signor Zumbini	PERSON	's ``
Studi	PERSON	sul Leopardi , ''
Signor Turri	PERSON	's ''
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, '' and
Signor Bertano	PERSON	's ''
Vittorio Alfieri Stu	PERSON	- diato nella
Vita	PERSON	, nel Pensiero , e nell ' Arte . ''

		Dante has been , as usual , the subject of many publications , which run all the gamut from a magnificent illustrated edition of the M Com - media '' to a series of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	postal cards -- one for each canto !

		The meeting at
Rome	LOCATION

International Historical Con	ORGANIZATION	- gress has given a marked stimulus to historical studies , and the history of art particularly has taken a renewed lease of life , as is attested by a long list of new works .

		Dr.
Belcikowski	PERSON	's report from
Poland	LOCATION	may be very briefly summarized .

		The jubilee of Mr.
T. T. Jez	PERSON	has led to the first publication in book form of his '' Memoirs of a Suitor , '' one of his earliest and best romances .

		Other novels are '' The Festival of Life , '' by the late
A. Dygasinski	PERSON	; '' Rottenness , '' by Mr.
W. Berent	PERSON	; `` On the Silver Sphere , '' the story of a journey to the moon , by Mr.
J. Zulawski	PERSON	; '' In the Land of Rocks , '' by Mr.
K. Przerwa	PERSON	- Tetmajer ; `` Chinese Tales , '' by Mr.
W. Sieroszewski	PERSON	; `` Sword and Ell , '' by Mr.
W	PERSON	,
Gormolucki	PERSON	; and three Napoleonic novels by Mr.
W. Gonsiorowski	PERSON	.

		In lyric production , the '' Poems '' of Mr.
G. Danilowski	PERSON	, '' In the Twilight of the Stars , '' by Mr.
T. Micinski	PERSON	; '' A Soul 's Day , '' by Mr.
L. Staff	PERSON	; '' To the Unknown , '' by Mr.
W. Wolski	PERSON	; and a volume of lyrics by Mr.
A. Mironowski	PERSON	, are the most important books .

		The best plays of the year have been Mr.
S. Wyspianski	PERSON	's M The Libera - tion '' and `` King Boleslaw the Bold , '' Mr.
L. Rydel	PERSON	's '' For Ever , '' and Mr.
Gorczynski	PERSON	's '' In a
July Night	DATE	, '' in which '' a wealthy land - owner 's fatal amour with a peasant girl is de - picted in vivid and brilliant colors . ''

		Mr.
P. Chmielowski	PERSON	has written a '' History of Liter - ary Criticism in
Poland	LOCATION	, '' and new editions have been published of the histories of Polish liter - ature by Professor
A. Bruckner	PERSON	and
Count S. Tarnowski	PERSON	.

		A sixth and concluding volume is soon to be added to the latter work . ''

		The religious and philosophical movement which increases in
Russia	LOCATION	with every year has caused the appearance of a new monthly maga - zine '' says Mr.
Briusov	PERSON	, who furnishes the report from that country .

		It is called `` The New Path , '' and its object '' is to give opportunity for the expression , in whatever literary form it may be , of those new tendencies which have arisen in our society with the awakening of religious and philosophical thought .

		The new magazine aims at uniting the spirit of religious inquiry with sharply defined progress . ''

		Professor
Merezhkovski	PERSON	, who represents this philosoph - ical tendency as distinctly as any writer , has an important article , giving his '' views of a new , truly universal apocalyptic church , which will unite all Christian beliefs at present in ex - istence . ''

		The censorship has taken a hand in the matter , and the editors find their '' new path '' anything but an easy one .

		The pro- ductions of two young poets , Mr.
Alexander Blok	PERSON	and ''
Andrei Bieli	PERSON	'' also express these ideas , and `` are strongly penetrated by a pas - sionate mysticism . ''

		The critic , Mr.
A. Zalinski	PERSON	, -- '' Quite independently of these writers , has now for more than ten years been preaching idealism in Russian literature ... Three of his public lectures have been published under the title ' A Struggle for Idealism , ' and have gone through two editions during the year with which we are dealing .

		... In belles-lettres , '
Maxim Gorki	PERSON	' and Mr.
L. Andrdev	PERSON	have continued to attract the most attention .

		Each of their new pro- ductions has evoked long and noisy discussions , both in the press and in society .

		The number of copies of their books which have been sold exceeds what has previously been known in
Russia	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Gorki '' has put upon the stage a new play called `` In the Depths , '' and Mr.
Andreev	PERSON	has published a number of striking tales in the mag - azines .

		One of them , '' In the Mist , '' evoked a severe criticism from the
Countess Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, who published a letter in which she found fault with the tale , and considered it likely to cor - rupt youth .

		She found some supporters in the press , but a great number of people defended Mr.
Andreev	PERSON	, and reminded her that literature does not exist for the education of schoolboys .

		A vigorous polemic was carried on in the news - papers for about two months .

		Among writers of an earlier generation may be mentioned Mr.
P. Boborykin	PERSON	, whose story `` The Law of Life , '' devoted to the marriage question , is noticeable .

		We also mention `` The Secret of Glaphira , '' by Mr.
M. Aldov	PERSON	, and '' Quite Gentle , '' by Mr.
V. Korolenko	PERSON	, both important novels . ''

		The supporters of the ' new poetry , ' the ' modern - ists , ' in the
spring of the year	DATE	of which we are treating , undertook a regular campaign in
Moscow	LOCATION	for the diffu - sion of their ideas .

		They have advocated them in public lectures and readings -LRB- of these the five lectures of Mr.
K. Balmont	PERSON	, delivered in different places , were among the most conspicuous -RRB- , and in public meetings on literary questions convened on
Tuesdays	DATE	by the
Moscow	LOCATION	Liter - ary and Artistic Circle .

		These Tuesdays attracted such a number of hearers that frequently the premises of the club could not contain them .

		The disputes became lively , and even violent .

		There were sharp conflicts between the representatives of opposite opinions . ''

		`` Northern Flowers '' is the title of an annual volume which represents the work of these '' modernists . ''

		Mr.
Ivanov	PERSON	's '' Pilot Stars '' is the work of a poet who has '' an independent and original vocabulary . ''

		He '' loves a word as some love precious stones .

		He polishes it carefully , chooses the suitable setting , and frequently makes it glitter with unexpected splendour . ''

		Professor
Balmont	PERSON	is engaged upon a complete translation of
Shelley	LOCATION	, and many other important foreign works are being turned into Russian by various hands . ''

		In the history of literature there has been much activity in what concerned
Pushkin	LOCATION	.

		Although more than sixty-five years have elapsed since his death , and during that period two such giants in Russian literature as Count Tolstoy and
Dostoievski	PERSON	have been active ,
Pushkin	PERSON	maintains his vitality and influence upon his contemporaries .

		He is still the foundation upon which Russian literature stands .

		During the year under re - view two new editions of his works have been begun , and are being vigorously carried on . ''

		Important historical writings are a `` History of
Moscow	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
T. Zabielin	PERSON	; an '' Intro - duction to the History of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
V. Buzeskul	PERSON	; and a volume of '' Essays on Russian History , '' by Professor
S. Platonov	PERSON	.

		During the year , '' the jubilee was celebrated of the literary activity of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		With - out a dissenting voice all the press and all society unanimously saluted the great veteran .

		Such a jubilee also Mr.
A. Pypin	PERSON	celebrated , the author of the most circumstantial ' History of Russian Literature . '

		On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of
Nekrasov	LOCATION	, and the tenth of that of
A. Fet	PERSON	, festivals were held in honour of these poets . ''

		Among the deaths of the year have been those of
K. Staniukovich	PERSON	, who wrote stories of sailors , of Professor
Kirpichnikov	PERSON	, the literary histo - rian , of
E. Markov	PERSON	, the writer of travels , and of
A. Aksakov	PERSON	, the spiritualist .

		Last in our list we come to Spanish litera - ture , of which
Don Rafael Altamiro	PERSON	discourses at much length . ''

		The twelve months that have elapsed since my last chronicle was writtten have been characterized by a decidedly interesting revival of literary activity , thus offering a curious contrast to the preceding twelve .

		In that period , coincidentally with what was taking place throughout the rest of the Continent , more especially in the Latin countries , there was remarked a certain indisposition on the part of authors to cultivate fiction and poetry , while the public evinced a decided weari - ness of , and distaste to , both those branches of liter - ature .

		Now there has ensued a rapid resumption of interest in both , and the production of tales and poems may be said , at least as far as numbers go , to be the most important that I have had occasion to speak of . ''

		The '' Episodios Nacionales '' of
Senor Galdos	PERSON	have entered upon their fourth series , begin - ning with the year
1848	DATE	.

		There are three new volumes , `` Las Tormentas del
1848	DATE	, '' `` Nar - vaez , '' and `` Los Duendes de la Carmarilla . ''

		Senor
Valdes	PERSON	has written `` Le Aldea Perdido , '' a tale addressed to his native Asturia .


Senora Bazan	PERSON	has published '' Misterio , '' following in the track of our Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	in choosing for a subject the fate of the son of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new `` Biblioteca de Novelistas del Siglo XX . ''

		represents the younger novelists of to - day . ''

		The most striking characteristic of the collection is the variety of styles , tastes , and tendencies expressed by the authors , which accentuate the individuality of each ; and the intellectual bearing of the problem that forms the predominant feature in most of them . ''

		The drama has been marked by a Catalonian revival , with several new pieces accompanied by much discussion .

		Plays of the year in
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tilian include '' Pepita Reyes '' and '' La Dicha Ajena , '' by the brothers
Quintero	PERSON	; '' Alma Triumpante '' and '' La Noche del
Sabado	PERSON	, '' by Senor Benavente ; and ''
El Loco	PERSON	Dios '' and '' La Escalinata de un Trono , '' in which Senor Echegaray '' repeats once more the splendours of his style and is again guilty of his customary defects . ''

		The first place among volumes of verse '' belongs to a book called 1 Musgo , ' which is written by
Senor Peres	ORGANIZATION	.


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 Apart from his merit as a metricist and the intensity of his poetical inspiration ,
Senor Peres	PERSON	contributes to the Spanish Parnassus an original note -- that of the feeling for nature -- in a form which may be deemed novel among us , and which makes a profound impression on the reader . ''

		Two new volumes by the late Castalan poet Verdaguer have been published .

		A new author ,
Senor Galan	PERSON	, '' has sung with deep feeling in 4
Extremenas	PERSON	' the customs and the home of his native district . '' '

		Literary his - tory has been enriched by many writers , chief among them being
Senor Menendez	PERSON	y Pelayo 's '' Tratado de los Romances Viejos , ''
Don Juan Valera	PERSON	's critical essays entitled `` El Superhom - bre , '' and Professor Farinelli 's lecture on the influence of Spanish literature upon the rest of the world .

		Concerning books of erudition , the writer says : '' The group of works refer - ring to social , philosophical , and political ques - tions , although limited , is of much interest .

		Three topics dominate it : the character of the Spanish people -LRB- both treated generally , and limited to one line of subjects -RRB- ,
Spain	LOCATION	's inter - national relations , and the regional agitation . ''

		The enumeration that follows gives us many titles , but they are mostly of exclusively Span - ish interest , and it is hardly worth while for us to reproduce them here , even in a selection , which , du reste , would be difficult to make .


FREDERICK W. ROBERTSON	PERSON	.

		To no one do we so readily yield our confidence as to him who shows himself deeply read in the mysteries within as , who has penetrated where we believed Omniscience alone had access , and who reveals to as weaknesses that we had hardly dared to confess even in thought .

		Such a person , weep - ing our very tears , breathing our most secret hopes and aspirations , possesses the quality that above all others gives one mind power over another .

		When the living voice speaks to us in tones that betoken this initiation into the inmost recesses of our com - mon human nature , we hold our breath and listen as to a voice from heaven .

		When the printed page addresses the inner ear in the same accents , the marvel is greater still , -- that one perhaps never seen and long sinee dead should lay open to our wondering gaze the hidden depths of our being , and show himself acquainted with thoughts and feelings we ourselves had never dared to pass in review .

		In such a person we recognize genius , and we exclaim , '' Surely , never man spake like this man ! ''

		Such was the secret of
Frederick W. Robertson	PERSON	's power as a speaker , and it will also explain the en - during value and charm of his printed utterances .

		Warm-hearted and craving human sympathy , he exhibited that most perfect type of character which , as
Martineau	ORGANIZATION	puts it , begins in beauty and ends in power ; which leans on the love of fellow-beings while it may , and , when it may not , stands upright in the love of God .

		Battling for the troth as he saw it , irrespective of sects and parties , and dying what may be called a .

		martyr 's death , at the age of thirty-seven ,
Robertson	PERSON	of
Brighton	LOCATION	paid the full price , in loneliness and suffering , for the fair re - nown that is now his beyond the possibility of dis - pute .

		Fifty years have passed since he dropped his task , and , the victim of misunderstanding and abuse from all sections of the church , lay down to die in an agony of mental and physical torture that , even in the reading , and at this distance of time , wrings the very soul .

		The message he delivered to his generation is a message no less fitting for ours .

		From the torpor of material prosperity we can not be too sharply aroused to a renewed sense of the things of the spirit .

		From an increasing tendency toward caste we need to be recalled to a feeling of the oneness of humanity .

		But it is more appropriate , in these pages , to dwell on the value of
Robertson	ORGANIZATION	's published works as literature , -- literature that sets the reader to thinking from its own depth of thought , and compels admiration from its beauty of style and conciseness of expression .

		While
Robertson	PERSON	was called by Dean Stanley the greatest of modern English preachers , he has also been likened , as a letter-writer , to
Cowper	PERSON	and to
Eugenie de Gue	ORGANIZATION	* rin .

		His eight volumes of sermons and addresses , some of them many times republished , are still the delight of numerous readers in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, while he is known through translations to a smaller body of admirers on the Continent .

		In his earnest - ness , his ardor , his power of mental analysis , and his apt , logical , and striking expression , lies the secret of his undying literary charm .

		The soldier blood that ran in his veins and all but determined his own career , often gave his utterances a martial ring that is indeed quickening .

		Wherever wrong seeks redress , his chivalrous and combative nature speak ?

		out with impetuosity and vigor .

		But better than all else , his warm humanity and his marvellous insight into the mysteries of the human heart and soul infuse with life and meaning all that he has to say .

		When it is remembered that most of his addresses were published from imperfect notes either taken by others or jotted down afterward by himself , the wonder increases that they should still speak to us with so much of the eloquence of the living voice .

		Other personal qualities that add charm to his published works -- we avoid the word writings -- are a purity that administers words of withering rebuke to the unchaste , a passionate desire for perfection , an eagerness to sacrifice self for the good of his fellows , and , in general , an ardent de - votion to all high ideals .

		Although he began his 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, fight against wrong by adopting the destructive method , by assailing iniquity and wrestling with sin , he soon pursued the wiser course of upbuilding , -- of overcoming evil with good .

		This is expressed in the first of his `` principles '' of teaching , `` the establishment of positive truth instead of the neg - ative destruction of error . ''

		The remaining five principles , though not bearing directly on his style , may be given in this connection , slightly abridged : '' That truth is made up of two opposite propo - sitions , and not found in a via media between the two .

		That spiritual truth is discerned by the spirit , instead of intellectually in propositions , and there - fore should be taught suggestively , not dogmatic - ally .

		That belief in the human character of Christ 's humanity must be antecedent to belief in his divine origin .

		That Christianity , as its teachers should , works from the inward to the outward , and not vice versa .

		The soul of goodness in things evil . ''

		Still more admirable does
Robertson	PERSON	's style appear when the reader bears in mind that almost everything published from his spoken words was delivered extempore as to all but the main thoughts involved .

		His extraordinary facility in apt ex - pression and logical arrangement is traceable to his fine sense of rhythm and of order .

		Like many who have no ear for music , he was keenly sensitive to the melody of words harmoniously arranged .

		Yet he gave no conscious attention to style , but was thoroughly possessed by , as well as in possession of , his subject alone .

		Self-consciousness vanished , and when the sermon or lecture was over and the re - action came , he had forgotten , like a dream , words , illustrations , telling phrases , almost everything .

		It is curious to hear this born orator declare , in con - tempt of oratory , '' I believe I could have become an orator , had I chosen to take the pains .

		I see what rhetoric does , and what it seems to do , and 1 thoroughly despise it .

		I think it makes people worse instead of better ; exposes the feelings to tension , like the pulling constantly of a spring back , until the
spring	DATE	loses its elasticity , becomes weak , or breaks ; and yet perhaps I do it injustice : with an unwordly noble love to give it reality , what might it not do ? ''

		For an answer to this question we need only look to the example of the speaker himself .

		In modest disparagement of his own power in the pulpit and on the platform , he uses a striking image when he says of his hearers , '' They watch by hundreds for my halting , and the mass of beings over whom I wield a temporary influence for a brief half-hour , are only chained by fluency , -- held together as a column of sand is supported by the breath of desert wind .

		When that wind • ceases it resolves into its atoms again . ''

		In pictu - resque and forcible , almost too forcible , terms he expresses his admiration for Channing , and at the same time shows his own freedom from religious bigotry .

		A lady had betrayed her horror at find - ing on
Robertson	PERSON	's table the recently published life of the famous Unitarian . ''

		I told her , '' writes the English churchman to a friend , '' that if she and I ever got to heaven , we should find Dr.
Channing	PERSON	revolving round the central Light in an orbit im - measurably nearer than ours , almost invisible to us , and lost in a blaze of light ; which she has , no doubt , duly reported to the
Brighton	LOCATION	inquisition for heretics . ''

		Another and longer citation may be given , both for its substance and its form .

		Writing to a friend who was reading
Alfieri	PERSON	's life , he says : `` The misfortunes of genius , its false direction , its misery , I suppose rise partly from the fact of the life of genius heing that which is chiefly given to the world .

		Many a soldier died as bravely and with as much suffering as Sir
John Moore	PERSON	at
Corunna	LOCATION	; but every soldier had not a
Wolfe	PERSON	to write his death-song .

		Many an innocent victim perished , -- yes , by hundreds of thousands , -- on the scaffolds of
France	LOCATION	, and in the dungeons of the robber barons , but they died silently .

		A few aristocrats whose shriek was loud have filled the world with pity at the tale of their sufferings .

		Many a mediocre boy have I seen spoilt at school , -- many a commonplace des - tiny has been marred in life : only these things are not mat - ters of history .

		Peasants grow savage with domestic troubles , and washerwomen pine under brutal treatment : but the for - mer are locked up for burying their misery in drunkenness , -- the latter die of a broken heart , with plenty of unwritten poetry lost among the soapsuds .

		I fancy the inarticulate sorrows are far more pitiable than those of an
Alfieri	PERSON	, who has a tongue to utter them .

		Carlyle in this respect seems to me to hold a tone utterly diverse from that of the Gospel .

		The worship of the hero , that is his religion : condescension to the small and unknown , that is His ! ''

		Hear him still once more , in his address to the
Brighton	LOCATION	working classes on '' The Influence of Poetry . ''

		He is dissuading from the use of alcoholic stimulants .

		What he says has an autobiographic interest . ''

		I know something myself of hard work ; I know what it is to have had to toil when the brain was throbbing , the mind incapable of originating a thought , and the body worn and sore with exhaustion ; and I know what it is in such an hour , instead of having recourse to those gross stimulants to which all worn men , both of the higher and lower classes , are tempted , to take down my Sophocles or my Plato -LRB- for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	was a poet -RRB- , my Goethe or my
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakspere	LOCATION	,
Shelley	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	; and I know what it is to feel the jar of nerve gradually cease , and the darkness in which all life had robed itself to the imagination become light , discord pass into harmony , and physical exhaustion rise by degrees into a consciousness of power .

		I can not , and I will not , believe that this is a luxury , or rather a blessed privilege , reserved for me , or my class or caste , alone . ''

		One is tempted to give further quotations , espe - cially from the delightful letters , as they are re - produced in Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's excellent life of
Robertson	PERSON	.

		Pathetic indeed is it to read of the '' azure demons '' to which the writer is in constant danger of falling a prey ; amusing , as well as touch - ing , to find him exclaiming , '' I wish I did not hate preaching so much , but the degradation of being a
Brighton	LOCATION	preacher is almost intolerable . '

		I can not dig , to beg I am ashamed . ' ''

		Of course it was not the being a preacher , but figuring as a popular preacher at a fashionable watering place , that he felt to be degrading .

		It may be well , in closing , to temper praise with candid criticism , and to caution the reader not to look for certain excellences in
Robertson	PERSON	that are not to be found in him .

		Humor we search his pages for in vain ; he was too tremendously in
1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAJL 117 earnest .

		Bat in what leader of religion who is some - thing more than a popular preacher shall we find this quality ?

		Not in
Calvin	LOCATION	or
Edwards	PERSON	or Chan - ning or Savonarola or Wesley or
Fox	ORGANIZATION	.

		Robertson distinctly says that he rates
Wordsworth	PERSON	none the lower for his lack of humor , a sense which he counted it folly to cultivate in himself when so many nobler qualities of mind and heart demanded nurture and training .

		He was by temperament irritable , im - petuous , given to exaggeration when deeply moved , and in his earlier years not free from intolerance .

		These defects he strove manfully to overcome , and at the last we find him singularly open to the truth from whatever source , and holding temporarily many of his own opinions in a state of suspension .

		The pity is that such capacity for endless growth and development should have come to so untimely an end , mortally speaking .

		But we may well be thankful for the volumes of his spoken and written words that still remain to us , and , together with his '' Life and Letters , '' invite reperusal on this fiftieth anniversary -LRB-
Aug. 15	DATE	-RRB- of his lamented death .

Letters of Sir George Grove	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Of Sir
George Grove	PERSON	's noble labors in the service of Biblical research , and of the rich fruits which his labors have also borne in the annals of English music , no one can write ex - cept in terms of respect and admiration .

		The results of his studies proved more than a suffi - cient reward for years of earnest work .

		If Mr.
Charles L. Graves	PERSON	's present biographical me - moir contains of necessity many more facts that are true than are new , let no one suppose the work is wanting in freshness or interest .

		Grove , though often urged to write his life , never did more than dictate , in
1897	DATE	, a number of dis - cursive anecdotal reminiscences , filling a half - dozen copy-books .

		In addition to these , he left a quantity of autobiographical material in his letters , in the diaries kept during his tours in the Holy Land , in his speeches and addresses , and , above all , in the numerous little pocket note-books that he invariably carried about with him .

		Sir
George Grove	PERSON	was born
August 13 , 1820	DATE	, at
London	LOCATION	.

		He received but an ordinary school education , and at sixteen years of age was ap - prenticed to
Alexander Gordon	PERSON	, a civil engi - neer , in which position his duties took him to * Life aito
Letters of Sib George Grove	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles L. Graves	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the continent ,
Jamaica	LOCATION	, and
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		In
1851	DATE	he was married to
Harriet Bradley	PERSON	, sister of
George Granville Bradley	PERSON	, subsequently Dean of Westminster .

		Out of office hours music was his chief hobby .

		It was in
1854	DATE	that Grove made the acquaint - ance of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	.

		His admira - tion for the former was both deep and lasting ; later , he published some admirable studies of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's lyrics in ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' -- where under his editorship `` Lucre - tius '' first saw the light .

		But the introduction to
Dean Stanley	ORGANIZATION	was far more momentous in its consequences .

		It not only brought
Grove	LOCATION	into contact with the man whom of all he ever knew he reverenced most highly , but it practi - cally determined the main course of his life for the next dozen years .

		The story of this is best told in an interesting autobiographical speech delivered by
Grove	ORGANIZATION	in
1880	DATE	.

		After giving various instances of the manner in which the turning-points in his career had been deter - mined by friends , he continued : `` What was it that started me to the study of the Bible ?

		I had been brought op to know the
Bible	LOCATION	well , bat the study of it was quite distasteful to me .

		What was it that altered my feeling ?

		Why , the bitter com - plaint of
James Fergusson	PERSON	-LRB- distinguished antiquarian and historian -RRB- that there was no index of the proper names of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		He was engaged then in an inter - necine warfare with everybody who doubted his splen - did theory that the round church in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	-- the Mosque of Omar -- was the church which
Constantine	PERSON	built over the tomb of our Lord -- or what Constantine believed to be the tomb of our Lord .


Fergusson	PERSON	and I used to meet at the
Assyrian Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	and talk about many things , and this among them ; and it was in one of these talks that he lamented that he could find no such list to support his argument .

		We set to work , ray wife and I , and made a complete index of every occurence of every proper name in the Old Testament ,
New Testament	LOCATION	, and Apocrypha , with their equivalents in
Hebrew	LOCATION	, Septuagint Greek , and Latin .

		Soon after this came a great event in my life -- I saw the Dean of Westminster -LRB- Dean Stanley -RRB- for the first time .

		It was while he was
Canon of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, and he was just finishing ' Sinai and Palestine . '

		He showed me what he was then engaged on -- the appendix .

		He showed me that in Hebrew there were distinct words for all the different kinds of natural objects -- for moun - tains and hills , and rocks and plains -- and that while in Hebrew these terms were never interchanged , in the English Bible they were used indiscriminately , and that a great deal of light might be thrown on the narratives if they were set right in our Bibles , and other things of the same sort rectified .

		He set me alight in a mo - ment , and I fairly blazed up .

		I rubbed up my Hebrew , of which I had learned the alphabet at
Elwell 's School	ORGANIZATION	.

		I got up German enough to plough through
Ewald	PERSON	and
Ritter	PERSON	, and plunged with delight into a sea of Biblical research . ''

		It was to
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	that
Grove	PERSON	owed his con - 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, nection with the great '' Dictionary of the Bible . ''

		Dr.
William Smith	PERSON	, lexicographer , had already conceived the scheme of his greatest work .

		Stanley pointed out Grove as the best Old Testament theologian he knew ; and the zeal with which
Grove	ORGANIZATION	threw himself into the work may be judged from a letter to
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, dated
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
January 16 , 1857	DATE	, in which he submitted a list of upwards of two hundred words and names in A and B alone .

		He visited Palestine twice -- in
1858	DATE	and
1861	DATE	-- so that his topographical and geographical articles might rest on the solid basis of close personal survey ; and , according to his own account , he wrote no fewer than
1100	DATE	pages out of the
3154	DATE	contained in the Dictionary .

		Grove was engaged on this work for seven years ; but during this period he contrived not only to prosecute his musical studies with great zeal , but to play a part in the organization of the musical performances of
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	far larger and more important than was demanded of him by the ordinary discharge of his duties as secretary .

		The origin of the analytical programmes which made
Grove	ORGANIZATION	's name a household word amongst all friends of music , and endeared the familiar abbreviation of `` G '' to two genera - tions of concert-goers , dated from a Crystal Palace concert given to celebrate the birthday of Mozart in
1856	DATE	.

		He says : * `` I wrote about the symphonies and concertos because I wished to make them clear to myself , and to discover the secret of the things which charmed me so ; and then from that sprang a wish to make others see them in the same way . ''

		For upwards of forty years , Grove contrib - uted the lion 's share of the analyses of these programmes , -- those of the works of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	, and
Brahms	PERSON	being with hardly an exception from his pen ; the analyses of the nine sym - phonies of Beethoven were eventually expanded into an important volume published in
1896	DATE	.

		His work in this line was characterized by an enthusiasm , a charm of exposition , and a wealth of illustrative detail , that were all his own ; there may have been better analysts , anatomists and dissectors of the organism and structure of the classical masterpieces than '' G , '' but there has never been so suggestive and stimulating a commentor upon their beauties .

		In
1865	DATE
Grove	ORGANIZATION	suggested a society for the systematic exploration of Palestine ; and in this way began the famous Palestine Exploration Fund , of which he was made secretary .

		In
May , 1868	DATE	, after having acted as assistant editor to Professor
David Masson	PERSON	for several months , Grove undertook the sole editorship of '' Mac - millan 's Magazine , '' to which he had been a contributor for fifteen years .

		With his wide range of interests , and his extensive acquaint - ance among the leading men of letters , science , and art , he was admirably fitted for the post ; and , while securing the cooperation of many writers of established repute , he was no fetish - worshipper of names , but was always on the alert to recognize unknown writers .

		In
1871	DATE	Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	made her debut in ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's , '' with a paper on '' The Poem of the Cid . ''

		It was about this time that
Grove	ORGANIZATION	's
Saturday	DATE
evening	TIME	gatherings of intimates and notables became a weekly occurence of consider - able interest .

		The present Bishop of
Lichfield	ORGANIZATION	gives a charming picture of these gatherings .

		`` No one who has enjoyed the hospitality of Sir
George	PERSON	and
Lady Grove	LOCATION	in their picturesque old wooden house in
Lower Syndeuham	LOCATION	can forget the delightful
Saturday	DATE	evenings when friends , and men of letters , and musicians would meet at the table of the Editor of '
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's Magazine . '

		But however interesting and eminent the guests might be , it was the host who was the soul of the company .

		He literally bubbled over with anecdote , enjoying his stories as much as any member of the party .

		He was always ready at repartee .

		His humor was abundant , his versatility remarkable .

		There were few subjects upon which he could not dis - course ; and he was able to produce his knowledge , not only without effort , but with a certain enthusiasm which enlisted the keen interest of all who heard him .

		There were quiet
Sunday	DATE	evenings as well , when he welcomed his more intimate friends , and held sweet converse with them on the highest and deepest subjects . ''

		In
January , 1874	DATE	, the prospectus of the '' Dictionary of Music and Musicians '' -- per - haps the most notable of musical works , -- the editorship of which was entrusted to
Grove	LOCATION	, was issued by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Need - less to say , no editor ever entered on his task with greater enthusiasm or carried it through with more laborious industry .

		In speaking of his association with the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	firm , Mr.
George A. Macmillan	PERSON	says : '' After all the ' Dictionary of Music ' remains as a splendid monument of his work with us , and , apart from actual product , it was no small advantage to a publisher to have at hand a man of his keen literary sense and varied knowledge . ''

		Grove 's visit to
America	LOCATION	, in
1878	DATE	, was due to the realization of a long-deferred scheme on the part of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Grove was a keen observer , and Mr.
Graves	PERSON	has given us many anecdotes of his trip in this country .

		He visited most of the great Eastern cities , was interested in all he saw , and met many of the leaders of thought

		THE DIAL 119 in the various States .

		A propos of his visit to
Concord	LOCATION	, he said : ■ I am writing to you from
Emerson	LOCATION	's home at the end of a delightful day which I shall not easily forget .

		What is left of him is quite charming , and there is much left , though very much has gone .

		His memory has almost entirely fled , and he has to speak very slowly , and appeal to his daughter , not only for names of peo - ple and places , but for very ordinary words ; but , on the other hand , his face is one of the most expressive and lovable I ever saw .

		He has been reading to us , for more than an hour , his own poems and things of Words - worth 's and others .

		He says nothing worth remember - ing , but it is impossible not to carry away the image of the greatest goodness and sweetness .

		I have got a photograph of him , but it really gives no idea of the beauty of his face . ''

		A tangible recognition of
Grove	ORGANIZATION	's services was shown in a testimonial , contributed by three hundred literary and musical friends , in the shape of a gold chronometer and a purse of a thousand guineas , presented to him in the ban - quet room of St.
James Hall	PERSON	,
July 19 , 1880	DATE	.

		Two years later he was offered the directorship of the
Royal College of Music	ORGANIZATION	, at the urgent request of the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	; and during the years that he occupied this chair he labored industriously in the interest of music in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		In
January , 1899	DATE	, his strength began to fail , while his memory grew progressively worse ; he died
May 28 , 1900	DATE	.

		In forming the present biography , the author has endeavored as far as possible to confine himself to autobiographical material placed at his disposal -- to let '' G '' reveal himself with as little comment as possible .

		The pocket note - books kept by his subject , always full of inter - esting obiter dicta , are fully utilized .

		His habits , as was natural in a man who filled so many different posts in a long life , varied in accordance with the work on which he was en - gaged .

		One can not but marvel at the amount of work he achieved in the domain of Biblical research , belles lettres , musical biography , and criticism , considering that he was not a scholar or a linguist or a technical musician .

		When a friend congratulated him on the high stan - dard attained by ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' he replied : '' To me the magazine is nothing but a monthly failure , '' explaining that he never succeeded in achieving his aim , which was not to please the initiated but to touch outsiders .

		As a traveller he confessed that he belonged to '' that class which looks about in all directions , fascinated not only with the grand sights above , but also with some humble aspect of nature at their feet . ''

		We may add that the present biographer has , in a fascinating manner , achieved his aim , which was to give some notion of the man , his work and character , to those who never met him , as well as to refresh the affectionate memories of those who came within his sphere of influence .

		A number of photographs , showing Grove at different stages of his life , are reproduced in the memoir .


Ingram A. Pyle	PERSON	.

		The
Physiological Effects of Alcohol	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The two substantial volumes containing a study of the '' Physiological Aspects of the Liquor Problem '' are the fourth of a series of reports on the Liquor Problem , by the Com - mittee of Fifty charged with the scientific in - vestigation of that perplexed and perplexing subject .

		`` Like its predecessors , '' we are told , '' this report is preliminary in its nature . ''

		It has been prepared by the sub-committee on the physiological and pathological aspects of the drink problem , and is edited by Dr.
J. S. Billings	PERSON	.

		The book contains altogether ten reports , or essays , dealing with different mat - ters investigated by the sub-committee .

		All of these are full of valuable and interesting in - formation , and must be carefully studied to be appreciated .

		There are numerous summaries of the conclusions reached , but the perusal of these leaves an impression upon the mind which is colorless compared with that produced by reading the full details .

		In some cases the re - ports seem unduly lengthened by the narration of experiments which have to be dismissed as misleading or worthless ; but the sub-committee has thought it necessary to go into all these de - tails , because there is a whole forest of current errors to fell before daylight can be let in upon the subject .

		The first report in the book -LRB- after the gen - eral report of the sub-committee -RRB- is , rather to our surprise , pedagogical rather than physio - logical .

		It deals with the present instruction on the physiological action of alcohol , and is by Doctors
H. P. Bowditch	PERSON	and
C. F. Hodge	PERSON	.

		It mainly consists of a vigorous attack on what may be called the
Black Bogie	ORGANIZATION	system of in - struction , as promoted by the
W. C. T. U	ORGANIZATION	.

		After detailing the history of the movement , • Physiological Aspkcts of this Liquor Problem .

		Investigations made by and under the direction of
W. O. Atwater	PERSON	,
John S. Billings	PERSON	,
H. P. Bowditch	PERSON	,
R. H. Chittenden	PERSON	, and
W. H. Welch	PERSON	, Snb-committee of the
Committee of Fifty to Investigate the Liquor Problem	ORGANIZATION	.

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and describing the character of the '' author - ized '' text - books on physiology , the writers say : '' It is thus apparent that under the name of ' Scien - tific
Temperance Instruction	ORGANIZATION	' there has been grafted upon the public school system of nearly all our states an educational scheme , relative to alcohol , which is neither scientific , nor temperate , nor instructive '' -LRB- p. 44 -RRB- .

		There are appended many letters from Amer - ican and European physiologists , most of them supporting the views of Messrs.
Bowditch	PERSON	and
Hodge	PERSON	in general , though the diversity of opin - ion and the general uncertainty as to many details are conspicuous .

		The following state - ments may be selected as illustrative . ''

		In my opinion , alcohol is not a food , nor even a con - diment . ''

		-- Dr.
H. G. Beyer	PERSON	. ''

		I believe that we have abundant evidence that al - cohol has a certain food value . ''

		-- Prof.
R. H. Chit	PERSON	- tenden . ''

		I have also experienced the honor of an overdose -LSB- of alcohol -RSB- , particularly when experimenting with whiskey in association with the late Dr.
Anstie	PERSON	.

		I can think of nothing more disagreeable than the effort to make observations on one 's self when half poisoned .

		But I quite agree with you that , notwithstanding , al - cohol is not a poison , as well as with your definition of a poison as a thing which can only do harm and never good . ''

		-- Sir .

		J.
Burdon Sanderson	PERSON	. ''

		Physiology as an experimental science not only has not , but I think never will decide whether the moderate use of alcohol is good or bad . ''

		-- Prof.
P. H. Pye-Smith	PERSON	. ''

		Alcohol is a poison and not a food . ''

		-- Prof.
A. Forel	PERSON	.

		After perusing these and many other like state - ments , the reader may be excused for feeling a little bewildered .

		The fact is , that , as in so many heated discussions , the chief things needed are common-sense and an agreement as to terms .

		In the second volume , Professor
Atwater	PERSON	, after describing his numerous and elaborate investigations , concludes thus : '' If we define food as that which , taken into the body , either builds tissue or yields energy , alcohol is food , but it is a very one-sided food .

		If we confine the word food to materials which , like bread and meat , contain protein and build nitrogenous tissue , alcohol is not a food ; neither is starch , which is the chief constituent of such food materials as wheat , corn , rice , and potatoes '' -LRB- p. 314 -RRB- .

		Practically , alcohol is not useful as a food-stuff under ordinary conditions ; though in certain forms of disease it may so serve .

		As to whether alcohol is a poison , the con - tradictory statements of Sir
J. Burdon Sander	PERSON	- son illustrate the futility of the definition which he approves .

		Elsewhere in the book it is clearly pointed out that the most poisonous substances may be harmless or beneficial in certain small quantities .

		Hydrochloric acid is a normal con - stituent of the gastric juice ; and yet if some - one swallows a quantity of that substance , and dies in consequence , are we forbidden to say that he is poisoned ?

		That alcohol in any other than very moderate quantities has a genuinely poisonous action is apparent from the numer - ous experiments detailed by Dr.
J. J. Abel	PERSON	in the second volume .

		The last mentioned writer , in his long report on the Pharmacological Action of
Ethyl Alcohol	ORGANIZATION	, raises some very interesting questions .

		It appears that the supposed stimu - lating effect of alcohol may have been quite misunderstood .

		Dr.
Abel	PERSON	quotes
James	PERSON	as saying : '' We should all be cataleptics , and never stop a con - traction once begun , were it not that other processes simultaneously going on inhibit the contraction .

		Inhi - bition is , therefore , not an occasional accident ; it is an essential and unremitting element of our cerebral life '' -LRB- p. 131 -RRB- .

		Now alcohol , by deadening down inhibitory in - fluences , may give certain positive reactions a free field , and the result is an apparent stimu - lation .

		Thus : '' In speaking of a certain type of individual
James	PERSON	says , ' It is the absence of scruples , of consequences , of considerations , the extraordinary simplification of each moment 's outlook , that gives to the explosive individual such motor energy and ease . '

		This description aptly applies to the individual who is under the influence of a ' moderate ' quantity of alcohol .

		It tends to turn the inhibitive type of mind into the ' hair-trigger ' type '' -LRB- p. 141 -RRB- .

		Suppose a horse to be pulling a heavy load .

		It moves forward slowly and painfully ; but all at once the tugs break , and the animal runs off , kicking up its heels .

		Superficially , it might seem that there had been a sudden stimulus , and that the active gyrations indicated an in - crease in the amount of work done .

		So often in the case of persons affected by alcohol .

		The experiments on dogs and rabbits , illus - trated by photographs , can not be properly described here .

		The influence of alcohol in producing fear is most significant , as also are the effects upon the vitality of the young born to alcoholized dogs , and the increased suscepti - bility to disease induced by chronic alcoholism .

		Dr. Billings has compiled data relating to the use of alcoholic drinks among brain-workers in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It appears that of 892 cases ,
18.7 %	PERCENT	were total abstainers ,
64.9 %	PERCENT	oc - casional drinkers , and
16.3 %	PERCENT	regular moderate drinkers .

		The number of regular drinkers is thus quite small ; the '' occasional drinkers '' ought , no doubt , mostly to be classed with the abstainers , as the majority of those who do not ordinarily use alcohol will drink a little on special occasions , and thus could not put them - selves down as total abstainers .

		A little chapter by Dr.
Bowditch	PERSON	, on '' The
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		121 Use of ` Temperance Drinks , ' '' is sandwiched in between discussions of the nutritive and pathological effects of alcohol , and is likely to be overlooked .

		It appears that practically all the tonics and bitters sold in drug-stores con - tain alcohol , and many of them very , large quantities .

		So '' it is clear that very large quantities of drinks containing a greater per - centage of alcohol than the ordinary wines and beers are consumed among the most rigorous of total abstinence circles , and one of the fore - most advocates of total abstinence has permitted her picture to be used as an advertisement of one of the most alcoholic of these drinks '' -LRB- p. 345 , vol .

		* By the timely action of the
American Bar	ORGANIZATION	, immediately after the death of Chief Justice
John Marshall	PERSON	in
1835	DATE	, a fund was provided which , with its accretions , was in
1882	DATE	so sup - plemented by the favorable action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as to suffice to present to the country , in
1884	DATE	, a noble monumental portraiture of '' the great Chief Justice , '' for the embellishment of the grounds fronting the Capitol at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Visitors to these classic grounds have thus be - fore them an outward reminder of the lofty career of this devoted public servant .

		On
February 4 , 1901	DATE	, occurred the centen - nial of the advancement of this profound jurist to be the head of the federal judiciary ; and this was made the occasion for erecting another monumental tribute to his personal worth and his distinguished services .

		The day having been , by pre-arrangement , set apart as ''
John Mar	PERSON	- shall Day , '' public exercises were held in nearly all the States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, in commemoration of the event which opened up a great career a hundred years previously .

		Able and eloquent speakers , as with one voice , sought to place
Marshall	PERSON	on the pedestal of his just fame .

		was a happy thought to gather together in type these manifold tributes of esteem and rever - ence , and preserve them permanently in com - pendious volumes , for the information and delectation of millions of American citizens .

		The monument at
Washington	LOCATION	points every visitor to the Capitol to the inestimable work of
Marshall	PERSON	as an artificer of the national common - wealth .

		The devoted efforts of the American Bar have now erected , in every library in the land , a monument equally worthy and equally enduring , bringing a like appreciation of the great Chief Justice to the mind of every reader of our history , the home-dweller and the trav - eller alike .

		Much of the significance of this testimonial to the character and the virtues of
Marshall	PERSON	lies in the unanimity of sentiment disclosed by the speakers who voiced his praise on this an - niversary .

		When he was appointed
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, a century ago , partisan politics were at a white heat .

		In their bitterness they sought to invade the judicial bench , and the new ap - pointment wore in part the guise of a partisan move .

		But such partisanship as was involved in it has been justified ; for , irrespective of the President 's motive , the fitness of the appoint - ment he made has long been unquestioned , and has won the praise of many whose party affili - ations made them reluctant to commend .

		The man whom the opening of the nineteenth cen - tury saw maligned and stigmatized is now , at the opening of the twentieth century , apotheo - sized .

		From all sections of the
Union	LOCATION	alike , from all the learned professions and from all political parties , arise eloquent speakers who vie with each other in wreathing garlands for the name and fame of
Marshall	PERSON	.

		These orations and addresses are monumen - tal in their extent and their quality , as well as in their unanimity .

		They emanate from thirty - eight different states and territories , in some of which there were gatherings in several places ; they are the voices of the leaders of the bar and the community , including the present Chief Justice and two of his associates on the
Supreme Bench	ORGANIZATION	, and of clergymen , professors , and statesmen ; and they fill three noble vol - umes , aggregating upwards of fifteen hundred pages .

		Though the central feature in all of these various sketches of
Marshall	PERSON	is the jurist , yet this feature is not developed out of due proportion ;
Marshall	PERSON	the man , the patriot , the citizen , and the statesman , are held in view ; and the result is a well-rounded and sympa - thetic portrait of a most engaging character .

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, So it will not be the legal student alone , nor yet the professional lawyer , but the American citizen in every walk of life , and the general reader as well , who may at convenience dip into these volumes , sure of finding therein congenial and entertaining reading .

		It would be impracticable to give in this re - view either fair samples of the matter of these discourses or any adequate description of their substance or merits .

		That there is , through - out their entire course , generous panegyric of
Marshall	PERSON	, may go without saying .

		Let it suf - fice here to note that the burden of all this wealth of encomium is the inestimable work of
Marshall	PERSON	in giving life and force , by judicial action from time to time , to the provisions of the American Constitution .

		The process of vivification of that once feeble document was not only necessary to its survival , but was an absolutely essential condition of its develop - ment and expansion .

		All that the
United States	LOCATION	has become , in vigor , activity , and beneficence , has been due to its Constitution .

		That this Constitution has been vital and en - ergetic , and not formal and lifeless , must be ascribed to the wise and comprehensive work of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	; and it was
Marshall	PERSON	who opened up the career of that
Court	ORGANIZATION	in its great usefulness .

		The fathers had drawn with fine skill the provisions of the Constitution , assigning a leading and important part of the work of government to the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	judiciary .

		A strong and
fearless Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	was needed to put into operation that judiciary as the balance-wheel of the intricate system .

		It was fortunate that the Hour and the Man met , when
Marshall	PERSON	was assigned to preside over this Court ; for it is he whom all now concur in describing as '' born to be the Chief Justice of any country in which
Providence	LOCATION	should cast his lot . ''

		The details of the character of his constructive work , and its relation to the la - bors of the early fathers , are perspicuously and instructively recounted by his enthusiastic en - comiasts of `` Marshall Day . ''

		Here speaks in dulcet tones the gratitude of one republic , giv - ing specific reasons for its appreciation of faith - ful public service .

		This collection of orations and addresses has been issued under the able editorship of Judge
John F. Dillon	PERSON	, who was himself one of the `` Marshall Day '' speakers , and has furnished an appropriate and scholarly introduction to the compilation .

		The volumes are well illus - trated , a view of the tasteful
Marshall	PERSON	monu - ment at
Washington	LOCATION	being presented , together with copies of three fine portraits of the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Appended to the collection are repub - lications of the eulogies pronounced by
Horace Binney	PERSON	and Judge
Joseph Story	PERSON	on the occa - sion of the death of
Marshall	PERSON	in
1835	DATE	, the inspiring address of
Edward J. Phelps	PERSON	given in
1879	DATE	as a tribute to
Marshall	PERSON	's memory , and the oration delivered by
William Henry Rawle	PERSON	at the unveiling of the monument at
Washing	LOCATION	- ton in
1884	DATE	.

		Thus has been woven together a ''
Marshall	PERSON	Anthology . ''

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	summed up the value of Mar - shall 's life-work by saying , with entire truth , that '' it is upon the entrusting to the judicial department of the whole subject of the con - stitutional law , for all purposes , that our government rests '' ; and he added that the wonderful success of the system which em - bodies that principle `` is more largely due to Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	than to any other man , or perhaps to all other men , who ever had anything to do with it , ''
Herein	PERSON	lay the occa - sion and the justification of a
Marshall	ORGANIZATION	centen - nial anniversary ; and Judge
Dillon	PERSON	, in his Introduction to these volumes , felicitously says that '' among the chief lessons of '
Marshall Day	PERSON	' is the revelation of the public as well as the professional consciousness that
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	is , verily , the living voice of the Con - stitution ; and that it is such is due preemi - nently to Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	. ''

		It is a pleasure to welcome this
Marshall Memorial	ORGANIZATION	as a substantial contribution to the historical collections of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is an additional pleasure to note the announce - ment in these volumes , that the publishers '' have arranged to issue , uniform with the present work , an edition of
Marshall	PERSON	's con - stitutional decisions and writings , annotated , with the assistance of the present editor , by
George S. Clay	PERSON	and
John M. Dillon	PERSON	of the
New York	LOCATION	Bar . ''

		THE DIAL 123 Recext Poetry .

		* When a man whose chosen vehicle is prose under - takes to write verse , we are apt to look askance at the effort and to regret its misdirection .

		Bat a strong writer is worth listening to , even when he expresses himself through an unwonted medium ; and the occasional verse of a prosateur often has qualities of strength and sincerity that are not always found in the writings of the poets by pro- fession .

		From such a source we hardly expect lyr - ical treasure-trove , but we may have vigorous and suggestive imagery , and other of the elements of poetic art .

		The verses of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, for example , with all their limitations and defects , proved a genuine and pleasurable surprise ; and something similar may be said of the volume into which Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	collected his scattered verses sev - eral years ago .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	, as his readers know , has occasionally mingled verses with the contents of his prose books , and hence we are not surprised to find that his activities in this sort have been sufficient to furnish forth a volume of respectable dimensions .

		He calls his poems '' Blind Children , '' for '' Are they not verily Blind Children , one and all ; Wistfnlly haunted by That unattainable Glamorous sea of light True poems float within ? ''

		The opening piece is a new version of the old theme beautifully dealt with by
Schiller	PERSON	in `` Die .

		Gotter Griechenlands . ''

		It ends with this stanza : '' The nymphs are gone , the fairies flown , The olden Presences unknown , The ancient gods forever fled , The stars are silent overhead , The music of the spheres is still , The night is dark , the wind is chill , The later gods have followed Pan , And Man is left alone with Man . ''

		The succeeding piece takes this last verse for a text , and sermonizes upon the theme '' At the Worst , '' reaching this conclusion : • Bund Children .

		Evil is here ?

		That 's work for ua to do .

		The Old is dying f Let 's beget the New .

		And Death awaits us ?

		Rest is but our due . ''

		This seems to be the only gospel left us after the passing of the mythologies , but it is not without its inspiration .

		`` Love 's Bubble '' is an exercise in one of the artificial forms so favored of late by rhymsters of every degree , and it comes near to having the charm of a true lyric . ''

		If Love be but a bubble , Blown from the pipe of Life , That bursts and leaves but trouble And weariness and strife , Then who would cares redouble And leave his years as stubble And Sorrow take to wife ?

		If Love be but a bubble Blown from the pipe of Life . ''

		If Love be but a bubble Blown from the pipe of years , Its beauty is but double That it is built of tears , And for its tender trouble I 'd leave my life as stubble And pluck my ripest ears , Thongh Love be but a bubble Blown from the pipe of years . ''

		A touch of sardonic humor now and then finds its way into Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's verses , as in his description of '' The .

		.

		Esthete 's Damnation . ''

		The aesthete finds Hell a very satisfactory place . ''

		Such subtle sinuous flare , Such restful red unrest .

		Half shadow and half glare , Like Rembrandt at his best . ''

		And while the light is ruddy , And while my zeal is hot , Oh what a chance to study My Dante on the spot ! ''

		But these reflections are rudely interrupted , for '' Then Satan grimly swore : I damn you np to heaven .

		Where you HI find life a bore , And a day as long as seven . ''

		Where the souls sit round and purr O'er each soporific blessing , Where the music 's amateur .

		And the art is life-depressing . ''

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	comes nearest to being a poet when he is inspired by his own racial instincts .

		From the group of poems upon Jewish motives we select this striking sonnet on ''
Moses	PERSON	and Jesus '' : '' Methought on two Jews meeting I did chance -- One old , stern-eyed , deep-browed , yet garlanded With living light of love around his head ; The other young , with sweet , seraphic glance .

		Round them went on the Town 's Satanic dance , Hunger a-piping while at heart he bled .

		Salom Aleikhem mournfully each said , Nor eyed the other straight , but looked askance .

		`` Sudden from Church outrolled an organ hymn , From Synagogue a loudly chanted air , Each with its Prophet 's high acclaim instinct .

		Then for the first time met their eyes swift-linked In one strange , silent , piteous gaze , and dim With bitter tears of agonized despair . ''

		We should like to quote also from '' The
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	's 124 THE DIAL -LSB-

Night	TIME	, '' and from '' Yom Kippur , '' but our space forbids .

		It was about twenty years ago that we first saw a volume of verse by Mr.

Oscar Wilde	PERSON	was enjoying his brief vogue as a poet , and our chief impression of the new writer was that he had taken
Wilde	PERSON	for a model and pro- duced a rather poor imitation .

		But Mr.
Rodd	PERSON	had staying qualities , for he has kept on producing verse of winning mien , and has grown in grace as a poet during the period that has also witnessed his rise as a diplomatist .

		He is now Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	, with numerous volumes to his credit , besides a distin - guished record in the foreign service . ''

		Myrtle and Oak '' is the title of a volume of poems which Sir Rennell has selected for special publication in Amer - ica ; a few of the pieces are new , but most of them may be found in his earlier volumes .

		The collection is charmingly introduced by an '' Envoi '' which bids the poet 's song '' Go through that greater England The years have reconciled , And touch the kindred blood that flows Through mother as through child ! ''

		And say to that new England For you , too , were we sung .

		And in your heart the note must be To which our strain is strung !

		`` And greet me that great
England	LOCATION	My feet have never trod .

		Whose heroes are our heroes And whose God must be our God . ''

		The influence of both
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is strongly marked in this volume , the author having been inspired by the passion of the one and the felicity of the other .

		It is felicity rather than passion that he himself achieves , as may be illus - trated by the very lines in which he pays tribute to the poet supreme among his contemporaries : '' Singer of
England	LOCATION	's saga , back to the misty prime , Rolling a morning glamour over the night of time ; '' Singer of English gardens , poet of English springs , Lover of earth 's dear beauty , and all elemental things . ''

		Never a girl in
England	LOCATION	, or in
England	LOCATION	over the sea , But wakes to her life 's first love-dream sweetlier-sonled for thee . ''

		Never a boy 's young life-blood thirsts for the dawn of deeds , But it throbs to a nobler impulse as he turns thy roll and reads . ''

		If Sir
Rennell	PERSON	does not achieve the expression of passionate emotion , he is a master of tender senti - ment setto flowing and graceful melody .

		What could be more exquisite in its way than this simple stanza : '' Where did you learn that music ?

		For it drew My dreaming back down autumn paths of years , Touched chords long silent and forgotten tears , Recalled dim valleys where dead violets grew , Soothed me with twilight , as it were it knew The very secret of my heart and sighed For sympathy , and when at last it died It seemed as if my soul were singing too . ''

		Almost every poem in the volume tempts us to quotation , as we linger fondly over the lovely im - agery and noble idealism of the pages .

		What space yet remains to us shall be given to extracts from Sir
Rennell	PERSON	's `` Credo , '' at once the longest and the loftiest of his poems .

		It is a work almost worthy to be spoken of in the same breath with Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's '' Hymn of Man '' and with the prophetic utterances of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's last years .

		`` Turn , turn from the cave 's dark hollow !

		look up to the light and see , Though thine eyes be dazed in the glory , the man that is yet to be ! ''

		Time 's wings are at pause beside him , and calm is his heart 's strong beat , And the dust of these old dominions is flowerful round his feet .

		`` Exult , we have won the midway , and the light has scared the gloom , And we smile at the old sad sentence , we are freed from the endless doom . ''

		The arms of the dawn are reaching to gather the mist away , And your star that the hill-peaks harbored grows dim in the rose of day . ''

		I can see as it were in a vision the fullness of day unroll , And the light of the sunrise cresting the hills with its aureole . ''

		First red in the sky at dawning , wild cloud and the bode of storm , But the winds are hushed and the clouds dispart for the feet of a queenly form .

		`` On her brows is a crown of olive , her arms are outstretched afar , She is robed in a rainbow 's glory , and each of her eyes is a star . ''

		The sword that she bears is broken , the arc of her wings is furled , She is throned on the ancient mountains , and her smile goes over the world . ''

		There is no lack of virile energy in the poems of Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, whose stirring ballads of En - glish fighting by sea and land have thrilled many patriotic hearts , making them stouter in their love of country and prouder in the emprise of its heroes .

		From Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's new volume , '' The Sailing of the Long-Ships , and Other Poems , '' we take this song of Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	: ''
Drake	PERSON	in the North Sea grimly prowling , Treading his dear Revenge 's deck , Watched , with the sea-dogs round him growling , Galleons drifting wreck by wreck . '

		Fetter and Faith for
England	ORGANIZATION	's neck , Fagot and Father , saint and chain , -- Yonder the Devil and all go howling ,
Devon	LOCATION	, O
Devon	LOCATION	, in wind and rain ! ' ''

		Drake at the last off Nombre lying , Knowing the night that toward him crept , Gave to the sea-dogs round him crying This for a sign before he slept : -- ' Pride of the West !

		What
Devon	PERSON	hath kept
Devon	PERSON	shall keep on tide or main ; Call to the storm and drive them flying ,
Devon	LOCATION	, O
Devon	LOCATION	, in wind and rain . '

		`` Valor of
England	LOCATION	, gaunt and whitening , Far in a South land brought to bay , Locked in a death-grip all day tightening , Waited the end in twilight gray .

		Battle and storm and the sea-dog 's way !

		Drake from his long rest turned again , Victory lit thy steel with lightning ,
Devon	LOCATION	,
Devon	PERSON	in wind and rain ! ''

		THE
DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, 125 Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	has advanced in his art since '' Ad - mirals All '' took the public by storm .

		A grave elegiac note has found its way into his song , and becomes it exceedingly .

		To `` The Silence of Love '' succeeds -- some - times -- u The Triumph of Love '' ; and Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	, having voiced the one in an earlier volume , now sings the other in a new cycle of sixty-four Shakespearian sonnets .

		The song is worthy of the theme , grave and tender , richly emotional , and not ostentatiously exultant .

		We select for quotation the twentieth of the series .

		M I love thee less that I may love thee more : The refluent wave rolls in with larger sweep , And surging up the half-abandoned shore Wins a new margin for love 's restless deep .

		I love thee less that love may rest his wing In drooping circles ere he soar anew , Ere be ascend in spiral airy ring .

		To pass from sight into the pathless blue .

		I love thee less that love may be re-born .

		That I may feel the breeze blow fresh and cold .

		May breathe once more the fragrance of the morn .

		May see once more the streaks of green and gold : -- I love thee less that out of love 's dark night
May	DATE	break the dawn efa ^ divhier light . '' ''

		The Oceanides '' is a volume of poems and translations by Mr.
Percy W. Shedd	PERSON	that offer much food for reflection .

		The titular poem is a trifling lyric that suddenly breaks into German , and represents the Oceanides as scorning the race of mortals . ''

		Du Sterblicher .

		was machst Du hier ?

		Get heim !

		zur tick !

		Fur Dich zu salzig ist das ' Meeral '
Bier	PERSON	, Der Wallfischschnitt zu dick . ''

		On a later page we find a bit of translation that begins as follows : '' Twilight o'er forest is fallende : Over the lakes softly sleepende , Over the reeds ... wild birds callende ... Over the copse it comes creepende . ''

		The mystery of these participles is explained when we say that the translation is from the Danish , and that the translator has thus sought to naturalize in English the Danish orthography .

		The same sort of freakishness is illustrated many times in the author 's original verse ; it is not offensive , but it is certainly odd .

		That Mr.
Shedd	PERSON	can give us serious poetry , in spite of his whims , is a fact dis - covered early in the volume , and enforced by many examples .

		One of the finest of them is suggested by the last words of the late
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, and this we quote in full , despite its length .

		* ' So much to do , so little done : The old myopic rune doth run ; As though the stars , the sea .

		the sun .

		Were much concerned at what was done . ''

		Life 's day is brief , and Art is long : Another slumber-banning song ; ... But Nature smiles , and builds a flow ` r. Whose life is one long sentient hour , Whose root winds through the hollow eyes Of some brave mortal past surprise ; And yet the flow ' r is passing fair , Though Art had no dominion there . ''

		The gods are good !

		They drift the sand Across the proud Assyrian land ; The gods are good !

		Their floods are sent , And great Atlantis ' head is bent ; The gods are good !

		Their ice-streams creep , And where was life , is death and sleep .

		Ye mighty gods , oh grow not pale If some vain mortal groan and wail : So much to do !

		So much to do !

		The hour hath come !

		I 'm not half through ... Oh wait , ye gods ... '' Nay , let him mark the calm deep glance , The sternly gentle countenance That sayeth : Live thy little day , A part for work , a part for play .

		The cell hath birth , the cell doth live .

		And then to death the cell I give ; Thereof new forms and strange I build , The crystal rock with gold I gild , The flow ' r with honey have I filled , Unto the glow-worm light I lend ... I gave thee life that thou mightst wend Thy little way ; ... be not afraid .

		Of thee yet something shall be made .

		But whether zoon or pearl or worm My great decree doth not confirm .

		Thou nor thy work shall go to waste ; Naught in my realm is e'er displaced .

		Be calm , and to thy life be true ; Thus only payest thou thy due . ''

		Mr.
Shedd	PERSON	's poems include other pieces that will reward the attention almost as richly as the one just quoted , and some sort of striking quality , be - tokening a genuine individuality on the part of the writer , may be found upon nearly every page .

		But we must now turn to his translations , which are also remarkable , and which make up a full half of his collection .

		These translations are from many lan - guages , Russian , Danish , Swedish , Norwegian , Dutch , German .

		French , Italian , Spanish -- even Finnish and Persian .

		They are mostly of unfa - miliar matter , although now and then the transla - tor tries his hand at the old problems .

		Here , for example , is the song of Raphael in ''
Faust	PERSON	' '' : '' The sun sings joyous as of eld ; The spheres antiphonal reply ; In circling course forever held .

		He rolls in thund ` ring majesty .

		Archangels gaze and gather strength , Though fathomless the great design ; God 's works throughout creation 's length In pristine splendor rise divine . ''

		This is almost as good as
Shelley	PERSON	, and it is at the same time rather closer to the original text .

		Mr.
Shedd	PERSON	's gifts as a translator are indeed remarkable , and we are grateful for the many lyric jewels from foreign tongues that he has put into musical En - glish .

		Most of all are we grateful for his transla - tions of the poems of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		These versions are scattered all along through the volume , and not until we approach the close do we realize that Mr.
Shedd	PERSON	has translated practically the whole of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's slender volume of poems .

		All the great pieces are here -- ''
Terje Vigen	PERSON	, '' ''
Abraham Lin	PERSON	- coln 's Mord , '' ' •
Paa Vidderne	PERSON	, '' and the others -- and nearly all of the minor ones as well .

		And they are better done , for the most part , than we could 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, have thought possible .

		The version of ''
Terje Vigen	PERSON	'' is a masterpiece of translation , and for the first time that extraordinary poem is put in such a form as really to convey to the English reader an adequate notion of its fire , its pathos , and its poetic beauty .

		If Mr.
Shedd	PERSON	had done nothing more than this , he would deserve our heartfelt thanks .

		Magazine verse is a fair description of Mr.
H. Arthur Powell	PERSON	's `` Young Ivy on Old `` Walls . ''

		It exhibits the peculiar type of mediocrity that seems to be in favor with all but two or three of the popular monthlies , being conventional and without salient characteristics . ''

		Death and Derision '' is a good example . ''

		Love have I tasted , and its daring bliss Hath bid me chant defiance to the storm .

		Once , cast ashore before the foiled wave 's hiss , Beneath cold flesh my heart was bold and warm . ''

		Wine have I drunk , with perfect throat of youth ; The grape 's blood flowed with mine the veiny maze ; With quickened sense my body glowed , in truth , Like startled
Dian	PERSON	's ` neath Action 's gaze . ''

		Joys fugitive , joys fugitive replace -- All that to youth 's fair heritage belong ; Perhaps the purest , after fight or chase , To swoon in Music 's arms , or live with Song . ''

		At last , at close of some fierce , bloody strife , Powers above !

		-- when painful comes the breath , Grant me this last , this crowning joy of life -- To laugh at Death ! ''

		Mr.
John Hale Ingham	PERSON	writes verse that is ob - vious and respectable .

		He can take any kind of a theme , and construct upon it a poem in any form , and the product becomes tolerable , except to the sense that finds all mediocrity intolerable .

		Mr.
Ingham	PERSON	is inspired to sing by art , religion , foreign travel , and the memory of the great .

		Music also inspires him , and modern science .

		He is capable of writing sonnets on the trolley , the ROntgen ray , and liquid air .

		This is his poetic description of '' The Trolley '' : '' Not with such steeds as on the Olympic day To scorned defeat or sacred victory led , Nor by the powers of vapor piloted Whose shrieks fill night with discord and dismay , We journey here .

		This monster doth essay To clasp with claw of iron overhead The chained , invisible lightning and be sped By heavenly currents on its earthly way . ''

		Mr.
Ingham	PERSON	's collection is entitled ''
Pompeii	LOCATION	of the West and Other Poems . ''

		The title piece is a comparison of the buried city of
Magna Gra?cia	ORGANIZATION	with the
White City of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, built for
1893	DATE	, and now razed to the earth , while '' Over lake and plain The wild birds circle till the night sweeps on , '' a not altogether accurate account of present-day conditions .

		It is not every poet who can get a queen to stand sponsor for his musings , but Mr.
Arthur Upson	PERSON	has been thus fortunate with his '' Westwind Song ?

		, '' and no less a personage than ``
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	'' has introduced them .

		The introduction is in a fine vein of rhapsody . ''

		The
Westwind	PERSON	said : Come , sing with me , for thou ha6t wept !

		Come , sing with me , and touch my harp ; for here I bring a Brother - soul to thee , with all the Song in it as
Chidder	ORGANIZATION	's song returning when Centuries revolved and
Centu	PERSON	- ries came back to sing the same unwavering Song in
India	LOCATION	as in
Hiawatha	LOCATION	's Home -- the Song of hu - man Tears . ''

		We are not acquainted with Chidder , but doubt if he could have sung of '' Wheat Eleva - tors '' in such strains as these : '' Castles , or Titans ' houses , or huge fanes Of ancient gods that yet compel men 's fear -- What powers , what pomps do these betoken here Looming aloft upon the plough-seamed plains ? ''

		Perhaps this selection is not quite fair to Mr.
Upson	PERSON	, and we hasten to supplement it by another , this time chosen without satirical intent . ''

		In Holyrood , up yellow stair I sought the turret chamber where On
summer	DATE	evenings long ago The mandolin of
Rizzio Made Mary music	ORGANIZATION	, rich and rare . ''

		And , pausing in the shadows there , Methought some echo of his air Along the hall came ringing low In Holyrood . ''

		Ah , 't was a sighing wind that bare The burthen of old heart-despair , And trembled at the casement so , Like dying hope or love in woe , Remembering days when life was fair In Holyrood ! ''

		This is pretty , but we confess that the '' bare '' puzzles us .

		Mr.
Ernest Crosby	PERSON	puts much indignation , and fervor , and moral earnestness into his '' Swords and Plowshares , '' preaching the Tolstoyan gospel with fanatical conviction .

		Most of the work in this vol - ume is in the sort of irregular prose which we asso - ciate with
Whitman	PERSON	, although without
Whitman	PERSON	's verbal felicity and inspired phrasing .

		With these pieces we have no concern , for they are not poetry in any sense .

		When Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	essays the regular forms , he can write such a simple and direct appeal to the conscience as the following verses on '' Life and Death '' : '' So he died for his faith .

		That is fine -- More than most of us do .

		But stay , can you add to that line That he lived for it , too ? ''

		In his death he bore witness at last As a martyr to truth .

		Did his life do the same in the past From the days of his youth ? ''

		It is easy to die .

		Men have died For a wish or a whim -- From bravado or passion or pride .

		Was it harder for him ? ''

		But to live : every day to live out All the truth that he dreamt , While his friends met his conduct with doubt , And the world with contempt , -- '' Was it thus that he plodded ahead , Never turning aside ?

		Then we 'll talk of the life that he led , -- Never mind how he died . ''

		THE DIAL 127 Several of Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	's poems are inspired by passionate indignation at the Philippine piracy which has disgraced our nation daring these late years .

		These pieces are not exactly poetry , but they have a bludgeon-like quality that makes them effective .

		The '' Unfrequented Paths '' of Mr.
George E. McNeill	PERSON	are verses filled , like those of Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	, with a burning sense of the sufferings of humanity , and voice the plea of the common people against their oppressors . ''

		Lift off the poor man 's burden , My country , grand and great ; The Orient has no treasures To buy a
Christian State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our souls brook not oppression , Our needs -- if read aright -- Call not for wide possession .

		But Freedom 's sacred light . ''

		This verse is mostly of the pedestrian sort , but it has the accent of sincerity , and its amiable philan - thropy will endear it to uncritical readers .

		It comes nearest to taking flight from earth when it celebrates the memory or the fame of such men as

Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Early steamboat While collecting material for his navigation on the ' • History of the Fur Trade , '' pub - Musouri river .

		j ^ ed a few years ago , Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	made the acquaintance of the late
Joseph	PERSON	La Barge , one of the pioneer steamboat men on the
Missouri River	LOCATION	, and wrote out from dictation his reminiscences , both for their bearing upon the his - tory of the fur trade and with a view of preparing a memoir of Captain La Barge .

		As the reminis - cences covered the whole period of steamboat ac - tivity upon the
Missouri	LOCATION	, the projected memoir has very naturally expanded into the '' History of Early Steamboat Navigation upon the
Missouri River	LOCATION	'' now published by Mr.
F. P. Harper	PERSON	.

		Beginning on the
Missouri	LOCATION	in
1832	DATE	.

		the steamboat business was almost exclusively confined to the fur trade until
1846	DATE	.

		After that , the Mormon migration , the Mexican war .

		the gold fever , Indian missions , and railroad surveys increased the traffic , until in
1859	DATE	more boats left
St. Louis	LOCATION	for the
Missouri	LOCATION	than for both the Upper and
Lower Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		During the Civil War the trade suffered somewhat , but the Mon - tana gold discoveries raised it to its highest point during the years immediately following .

		The rail - road reached the
Missouri	LOCATION	at
St. Joseph	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	, but it was not until
1867	DATE	, the year of greatest prosperity in the river trade , that the extension of the North - western Railroad to
Council Bluffs	ORGANIZATION	made the com - petition serious .

		The struggle between road and river lasted twenty years .

		The final blow fell in
1887	DATE	, when the
Great Northern	ORGANIZATION	reached
Helena	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	.

		After that time , the river trade prac - tically ceased .

		Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	says that the river , contrary to the usual opinion , is as navigable as ever , and that the trade failed solely because the need for it had passed .

		In the very year of its fail - ure ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	created the
Missouri River Commis	LOCATION	- sion , which carried on extensive river improvements until its termination last year .

		When the trade stopped the improvement began .

		Captain
Chitten	PERSON	- den thinks that , notwithstanding their failure to effect the object intended , the improvements have been worth much more than their cost in the saving of property , and that upon this ground they should be continued .

		In his opinion , a future use for the waters of the river will be found in the irrigation of the arid lands along its upper course .

		During the early period , the history of the navigation of the
Missouri	LOCATION	amounts almost to a history of the whole
Missouri	LOCATION	country , since the river furnished the only means of communication and everything done in the country depended upon it .

		• Viewed in this light , an apparently local topic covers a dis - tinct phase in the development of the West , and thus becomes an important part of the history of the whole country .

		Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	tells the story well .

		Large type and wide margins extend the work to two volumes ; but it is really a short narrative , which may be read with interest in a few hours .

		Qame/uhet , Two recent volumes of '' The Sports - bxg and little , man 's Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are devoted to the interests of the ang - ler .

		In '' Bass ,
Pike	PERSON	,
Perch	LOCATION	, and Others '' Dr.
James A. Henshall	PERSON	treats of all of the game-fishes east of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	except the salmons and trouts , and the tarpons , jewfisb , and other fishes of large size which are described in other volumes of the series .

		Dr.
Henshall	PERSON	writes from the full expe - rience of many years of successful angling in waters fresh and salt , and from the point of view of the trained naturalist as well as that of the skilful sportsman .

		The angler will find minute directions concerning the appropriate tackle and other para - phernalia of the sportsman , as well as valuable sug - gestions concerning methods of angling for each species , and a very intelligent discussion of the habits of the fish .

		In this latter feature the book is of considerable value as a work in natural history .

		It includes a brief technical diagnosis of each spe - cies , and is abundantly illustrated , so that the fish - erman may determine the affinities of his catch with scientific accuracy .

		-- The second of the two volumes is also from the pen of a well-known sportsman - naturalist , Mr.
Charles F. Holder	PERSON	, who writes of `` The Big Game Fishes of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Ang - ling for the great oceanic game-fishes -- the tarpon , the tuna , and the black sea-bass -- is essentially a modern pastime , and its pursuit has led to the estab - lishment of the highest standards of sportsmanship in such organizations as the
Tuna Club of Santa Catalina	ORGANIZATION	.

		These giants of the sea are pursued and taken -- though not without a long and vigorous 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, struggle -- with tackle so light that the layman who first sees it doubts the evidence of his eyes .

		The author does not give technical descriptions of the fishes he treats , but his word-pictures are so vivid that even the novice should be able to recog - nize his captures .

		There are also some very good plates in color , by Mr.
Charles F. A. Mielatz	PERSON	, of these large fishes in action , and other illustrations which add to the value of the book .

		This volume will be of much interest to those who do not pursue the big game of the deep .

		It is written by a most experienced angler , and from his rich store he en - livens his account with many an entertaining tale , all doubtless true , though nothing is lost in the tell - ing .

		The book affords excellent fishing by proxy for those who prefer or who must take their sport in this way .

		The high standard of scientific and literary excellence established in some of the earlier numbers of the series is well maintained in these latest volumes .

		The widespread study of living birds relation to m the field has so awakened interest mankind .

		in all their activities that a manual of economic ornithology is most opportune .

		Pro- fessor
C. M. Weed	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Dearborn	PERSON	, in their '' Birds in Relation to Man '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , have compiled from the numerous and widely scattered
Government and State	ORGANIZATION	reports , and from scientific journals and their own note-books , a very full ac - count of the feeding habits of our more important native birds , and of the relation which such habits bear to harmful and beneficial insects , to the fruit and grain industry , and to the foes and friends of the farmer in orchard , field , and meadow .

		The book abounds in statistical details of potato beetles slain by the thousand and caterpillars by the tens of thousands ; while the broader phases of the sub - ject are not overlooked .

		We find an account of the procedure employed in the study of the food of birds , and note with pleasure the substitution of more humane methods for that of the deadly shot - gun .

		There is an account of the history of economic ornithology , a discussion of the proportions of ani - mal and vegetable elements in the food of birds , and some astonishing statistics as to the amount con - sumed .

		Methods for the conservation of the birds , devices for preventing their depredations , and means of encouraging their presence in garden and or - chard , are discussed , and a full bibliography , prin - cipally of American sources , is given .

		The book will be a welcome and valuable addition to many school libraries , and to the book-shelf of every na - ture lover .

		The first volume of Professor
Julius Hann	PERSON	's Handbuch der Klimatologie , in its second German edition , has been translated by Professor
R. De C. Ward	PERSON	, and is now issued as a complete '' Handbook of Climat - ology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It deals with all of the gen - eral phases of the subject , and seeks to present as graphic a picture as possible of the way in which all The science cf Climate .

		the atmospheric phenomena work together at any place on the earth 's surface .

		Of necessity , separate treatment is given to the various climatic elements , or factors , -- such as temperature , humidity , rain and snow , velocity and direction of the wind , influ - ence of the ocean and of mountains , and of latitude .

		The main types of climate , -- solar , physical , con - tinental , marine , and mountain , -- are defined , and their various differentiating factors are discussed with illustrations from meteorological measure - ments .

		The translator has made a number of changes in the work .

		A few unimportant details of purely European interest have been omitted , a consider - able number of illustrations from American sources have been inserted , and such additions have been made as are needed to bring the work up to date .

		The American reader will still find the book largely foreign in its sources and illustrations ; but this is in part due to the greater perfection and duration of European meteorological records , and in part to the fact that the original author was a German .

		This is not a popular work , but a thoroughly modern high-grade scientific treatise on a somewhat techni - cal though familiar subject , -- the weather .

		a volume/or j n wr Jti n g of '' Municipal Public and `` students of Works , their Inception , Construction , municipal affairs , and Management , '' Mr.
S. Whinery	PERSON	, a civil engineer of
New York	LOCATION	, shows a broad out - look upon the problems involved , as well as a famil - iarity with the details of municipal engineering and contracting .

		The result is a volume of practical value , not only to the inexperienced city officials for whom it is primarily intended , but to students of municipal affairs generally .

		Mr.
Whinery	PERSON	expres - ses the unorthodox opinion that municipal contrac - tors are not necessarily corrupt , and even holds that public work may often be done by contract more economically and satisfactorily than by the direct employment of labor by the city .

		There are chapters on special assessments and uniform mu - nicipal accounting , a well-balanced discussion of municipal ownership , and a final chapter offering well-considered suggestions for the control of public - service corporations .

		The municipality and the quasi-public corporation are likened to the partners in an enterprise of common benefit , between whom there should be mutual cooperation rather than antagonism ; and principles are laid down by means of which the public might make sure of its share of the benefits resulting from future grants of fran - chises .

		They treat of the origin and nature of the reciprocity idea , consider the subject historically , show that not until the
last quarter-century	DATE	had it obtained any great hold upon the public mind as a determinate policy , trace clearly and impartially Congressional legislation on the subject beginning with
Canada	LOCATION	and
Hawaii	LOCATION	and following the work - ings under the
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	and
Dingley	PERSON	Acts and the effects of the
Wilson	PERSON	Bill repealing the reci - procity clause in the McKinley Act , show the inef - ficient and unsatisfactory results under the policy generally , and conclude that as the outcome of all the attempts '' the futility of reciprocity efforts has apparently been shown with great conclusiveness . ''

		They believe that a revulsion of opinion has set in , and that tariff-reform sentiment is in the atmos - phere and not far distant ; that at most reciprocity has been but a poor piece of legislation calculated to placate the demand for substantial relief from high tariff duties .

		The subject seems to have been handled in a fair and intelligent way .

		The bibliog - raphy is very full and valuable , and the appendix contains various treaties and agreements with dif - ferent countries growing out of the reciprocity idea .

		Music , '' says the au - thor , '' is the lingua franca of the universe , the only known language indigenous to heaven and heard in all inhabited worlds ... Music , as in - volved in Nature , is objective , elementary , me - chanical .

		Innate in man , and evolved by human intelligence and effort , it is subjective , intellectual , purposed .

		That its scientific marvels and aesthetic beauty are the chance products of purposeless evo - lution , let him believe who can . ''

		Dr.
Edwards	PERSON	inquires into the power of music , discusses musico - therapy , the law and correlations of music , etc. , and treats the subject from its scientific and aes - thetic points of view , as well as in its theological aspects .

		We are told that no special originality is claimed for the present work , except , perhaps , in the marshalling of known facts , and the converging upon the main point of more or less familiar lines of argument in an unfamiliar but legitimate way .

		Mr.
Alfred Hodder	PERSON	's volume entitled `` A Fight for the City '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a narrative of the political cam - paign in
New York City	LOCATION	in the
fall of 1901	DATE	, cen - tring around the interesting personality of Mr. A notable chapter of municipal hUtory .


William Travers Jerome	PERSON	, the successful candidate for the office of District Attorney on the Fusion ticket , and preceded by an account of the series of raids of gambling-houses which brought Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	into prominence as a reformer .

		It is interesting to note that these raids were not begun on Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	's initiative , but that his determination that they should not be farces , backed by the authority of his judicial position exercised in impromptu court-rooms , was what made all the difference be - tween these raids and the ineffectual ones that had been made from time to time before .

		Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	's fearless honesty and bluntness of speech are well illustrated by extracts from his public utterances during the campaign , which more than once were thought to have alienated more votes than they could win , but which proved to be as successful with the people as they were satisfactory to the con - science of the speaker .

		The narrative combines the fascination of fiction with the value of an inter - esting and important section of recent history , and may be read with profit by the friends of reform everywhere .

		Mr.
Hodder	PERSON	shares to the full Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	's dislike for `` the administrative lie '' and u the decorative phrase , '' and is , in short , something of a hero-worshipper .

		It is mainly to the half-dozen charm - ZJiZl . '' ''

		in g translations by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	that English readers owe their knowledge of
Pierre de Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	.

		foremost poet of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	and known throughout the
Europe	LOCATION	of his own day as '' Prince of Poets . ''

		But these and some other fugitive renderings from various hands have only served to whet our ap - petites for the feast which is now spread in the volume of '' Songs and Sonnets of Ronsard , '' as selected , translated , and edited by Mr.
Curtis Hidden Page	PERSON	, and issued from the '' limited edition department '' of
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	's work seems to us in all ways excellent .

		His translation is graceful and fluent to a marked degree , and almost uniformly successful in follow - ing the difficult verse-forms and rhythms of the French poet .

		His Introduction is a finished bit of critical writing , and the Notes are neither cumber - some nor superfluous .

		To the mechanical form of the volume praise may be accorded in equal mea - sure .

		It is in many respects the most pleasing piece of book-making yet accomplished by Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	in his work at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Typography , paper , and binding are so skilfully chosen as to produce an antique atmosphere at once delightful in itself and in perfect harmony with the delicate old-world flavor of
Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	's verse .

		For the col - lector of fine books , no less than the lover of beau - tiful poetry , this little pocket volume will prove a treasure .

		Ax interesting study of ''
George Sand	PERSON	and her French Style '' is contributed by Mr.
Prosser Hall Frye	PERSON	to the
July	DATE	number of the '' University Studies '' published by
the University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	.

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Sherwin Cody	PERSON	's '' Selections from the Best Eng - lish Essays '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is intended to illustrate the development of English prose style by a series of typi - cal examples .

		The authors represented are
Bacon	LOCATION	, Swift ,
Addison	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, DeQuincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and Arnold -- an unimpeachable se - lection .

		But Mr.
Cody	PERSON	's book is more than a mere reprint , for it includes an introductory chapter of some thirty pages on '' The English Essay and English Prose Style , '' while with each writer represented goes a brief special introduction .

		The selections given are typical of their authors , and all belong to English literature in the best sense .

		Mr.
Cody	PERSON	, in preparing this volume , has done a real service to the busy reader who does not hope to be a scholar but who is glad to learn something of the development of the chief literary forms .

		Three volumes of the '' Centenary '' edition of Em - erson have now been published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	`` Nature : Addresses and Lectures '' is the title of the first , which gives us a handsome portrait in photogravure , a preface and biographical sketch by Dr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, and an extensive collec - tion of notes , which are of the greatest value .

		The '' Essays , '' first and second series , are given in the two other volumes , which also are supplied with the notes which form the distinctive feature of this new edition .

		The total number of volumes can not yet be announced , for the pleasant reason that much hitherto unpublished material is to be added to
Emerson	LOCATION	's works , and the amount of this is not yet definitely determined .

		Typo - graphically the volumes are all that the most exacting taste could wish .

		We have previously spoken of Mr.
Roscoe Lewis Ashley	PERSON	's `` The Federal State '' as probably the best manual of the subject thus far prepared for secondary instruction .

		The book is somewhat bulky for such use , which to some minds constitutes a serious objection , and it is with such critics in mind that the author has now produced a briefer work on the same subject , entitled ''
American Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' and published , like its pre - decessor , by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work has illus - trations , which is something of a new departure for text-books of civil government .

		We can recommend it in much the same terms that were applied to the earlier and larger volume .

		Notes .

John Lane	PERSON	will publish shortly a new contribu - tion to the Froude-Carlyle controversy , entitled '' The Nemesis of Froude . '' ''

		SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT To be published in
October	DATE	Father
Louis Hennepin	PERSON	's `` A New Discovery '' Exact Reprint of Second Issue of i6q8 WITH INTRODUCTION , NOTES , AND AN ANALYTICAL INDEX By
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	In Two Volumes , with facsimiles of original title-pages , maps , and other illustrations TT is believed that A New Discovery -- especially the second issue of
1698	DATE	, which has * been chosen for reproduction -- is the most representative of
Hennepin	LOCATION	's works .

		It is a thoroughly readable volume , abounding in quaintly-phrased humor , satire , invective , and graphic description ; adventures are related in almost every chapter ; and through it all the man himself , a sorry braggart , yet never lacking courage , and possessing powers of keen observation , stands out in bold relief .

		As a human document , it has few rivals in our litera - ture .

		Moreover , it is the only one of the Hennepin books now upon the market ;
Shea	PERSON	's Louisiane has for twenty years been out of print , and all of the original editions are rare and costly luxuries .

		The work of editing this careful reprint has been undertaken by
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, who , in addition to supervising the publication in every detail , furnishes a bio - graphical and critical Introduction of some 9000 words , copious Notes , and an analytical Index .

		Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's eminence as an authority on all matters connected with the his - tory of the West , and his well known standing as an editor , will be sufficient assurance of the manner in which the enterprise will be carried out .


Victor Hugo Paltsits	PERSON	, of
Lenox Library	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	-- one of the most expert of American bibliographers -- contributes a new Bibliography of
Hennepin	LOCATION	.

		There seems no doubt , then , that this beautiful , well-appointed , and well-edited edition of A New Discovery will at once be accepted as an interesting and very valuable addition to American historical sources , and will meet with the large sale which its merits so richly deserve .

		The reprint will be issued in two square octavo volumes of nearly 500 pages each .

		The type used will be a large , clear face of pica old style , admirably adapted to the character of the work .

		Fac-similes of the title-pages of the original edition will be given , together with fac-similes of the seven full page illustrations and the two large folding maps .

		There will be two editions : one in regular library style , on an extra quality of soft laid paper , gilt top , with uncut edges ; and a special large-paper edition , limited to 150 numbered copies on the finest quality of
Brown	PERSON	's hand-made paper .

Spearman	PERSON	's new book -- the successor of his powerful and vivid `` Doctor Bryson . ''

		The atmosphere of `` railroading , '' and that on the largest and most impressive scale , permeates the story , which is not only extremely graphic , and illustrative of the perils and difficulties as well as the feats and accomplishments of railroad life , but also a love story of peculiar force and great beauty .

		The hero and heroine are typically American and attracted to each other by a natural attach - ment that is called upon to overcome the greatest of obstacles .

JOHN B. GORDON With	PERSON	three portraits , large 8vo .


$ 3.00	MONEY	net -LRB- postage additional -RRB- THESE reminiscences , which are destined to take the place on the Southern side held by
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's `` Memoirs '' on the Northern side , were written by General
Gordon	PERSON	from time to time throughout a great number of years .

		They are not , therefore , a made-to - order book , but the spontaneous recollections of a very full life .

		From Bull Run to
Appo	PERSON	- mattox General
Gordon	PERSON	was in most of the great fights of
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	's army .

		He knew the leaders of the Confederacy intimately , and his acquaintance was enlarged during his career as a United States Senator by intimate association with leaders of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause .

		He was the friend of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	to the end of his life .

		This is not a narrative history of the war , but records , with anecdote , incident , and with eloquence , the personal experiences of General
Gordon	PERSON	and the eminent leaders who were his friends .

		No other such intimately personal record has been produced by either side .

		Every chapter contains humorous incidents , and even pathetic ones , which will pass into the permanent history of the war .

		With six full-page illustrations in color by

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		For some time
Miss Potter	ORGANIZATION	has had in mind a book which would give , in some measure , an idea of the conditions under which women lived in the days of feudalism .

		It is difficult for a modern mind to realize the loneliness and monotony that were bravely faced by the chatelaines of isolated castles when their husbands and sons departed to battle or to the court .

		Just what this meant to them is brought out with notable art by
Miss Potter	ORGANIZATION	in her new romance .

		Her story of the life of three brave and beautiful women at the Breton castle will reach the sympathy of the reader in a way that can be equalled by few recent novels .

		The pictures in color by
Charlotte Weber	LOCATION	are equally notable for their sympathy with the text and their rare artistic quality .

		A consistent decor - ative treatment has been utilized in the type and binding , and altogether the book is one of remark - able distinction and most exceptional interest .

		This story , published in
Germany	LOCATION	under the title of '' Gelimer , '' is the third volume in the group of romances to which '' Felicitas '' and `` A Captive of the Roman Eagles '' belong , and , like them , deals with the long-continued conflict between the Germans and the Romans .

		But in the present novel the scene of the struggle is transferred from the forests of
Germania	LOCATION	to the arid sands of
Africa	LOCATION	, and , in wonderfully vivid pen-pictures , the author displays the marvellous magnificence surrounding the descendants of the
Vandal Genseric	PERSON	, the superb pageants of their festivals , and the luxury , whose enervating influence has gradually sapped the strength and courage of the rude , invincible warriors -- once the terror of all the neighboring coasts and islands -- till their enfeebled limbs can no longer support the weight of their ancestors ' armor , and they cast aside their helmets to crown themselves with the rose-garlands of Roman revellers .

		BOOKS OF
TBS COMING SEASON	ORGANIZATION	.

		Once more the publishers have sent oat their announcements for the Fall season , and once more we attempt to select from the enor - mous mass of material thus presented a few titles here and there that sharpen anticipation .

		In order to make it possible to choose at all from so bewildering an array of forthcoming books , we shall set entirely aside the majority of the categories represented -- science , educa - tion , religion , travel , holiday and juvenile pub - lications , -- and make a scanty selection from the groups belonging to biography , history , and literature in the narrower sense .

		We presume it will be admitted without much question that the book of the year , as far as one can determine such a matter in ad - vance , will be Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		No man living is better fitted by both knowl - edge and sympathy to set forth the life of the famous statesman , and Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has given the greater part of his time ever since Glad - stone 's death to this pious task .

		It certainly must have been an exacting labor , and we trust that it has proved inspiring as well .

		We may certainly depend upon a biography that will do justice to
Gladstone	PERSON	's great moral and intel - lectual force , and to his impressive personal qualities , while avoiding the undiscriminating eulogy that is not content with the real great - ness of the man , but seeks also to claim for him a scholarly eminence which can not pos - sibly be allowed by '' them that know . ''

		The figure of
Gladstone	LOCATION	was so imposing that one may dismiss with a smile his ingenious specu - lations in theology and archaeology , as well as his mistakes in statesmanship , without sensibly impairing his significance .

		The great American statesman whose posi - tion in public life and whose intellectual bent offer many points of comparison with Glad - stone may properly be named in the present connection , since for American readers the autobiography of Senator
Hoar	PERSON	can not fail to prove a work of the deepest interest .

		The American Senator , like the English Minister , has his marked vagaries , intellectual and po - litical , but his earnest stand for righteousness in the conduct of the nation 's affairs has ex - 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, alted him above the ordinary rules of criticism , and made of him a figure almost as command - ing as that of his English contemporary .

		The story of his life , as told by himself , must make the strongest kind of an appeal to all serious Americans .

		In literary biography , the forth - coming volume of Richard
Henry Stoddard	PERSON	's memoirs , edited by his lifelong friend Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, offers a certain store of entertain - ment , as does also the autobiography of Mr.
John T. Trowbridge	PERSON	, which some of us have already seen in the pages of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		The authorized life of
John Fiske	PERSON	can not fail to be a work of fascinating inter - est , for it is to be told largely from
Fiske	PERSON	's own letters and private papers .

		The author of this biography is not even named in the announce - ment , so completely has he sought to merge his own identity in that of his subject .

		Two other biographical works that deserve mention are the '' Reminiscences of an Astronomer , '' by Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	, and Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's account of the life , work , and influence of Zola .

		Turning from biography to history , we may mention first of all the publication of Lord Ac - ton 's lectures on the French Revolution and on modern history in general , delivered during the author 's incumbency of the Regius professor - ship at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The Reformation volume in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History '' will also appear in a few weeks .

		Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	is writing a five - volume history of modern Eng - land -- `` from the point of view of a young man '' -- and two of the volumes are now ready .

		A similar service is being done for the recent history of our own country by Mr.
William Gar	PERSON	- rott
Brown	PERSON	, and the first of the two volumes is about to be published .

		M. Hanotaux 's work , doing much the same thing for the history of contemporary
France	LOCATION	, will soon be complete in four volumes .

		A few other historical works announced are Dr.
A. H. Noll	PERSON	's account of the struggle for constitutional government in Mex - ico , editions of Hennepin 's '' New Discovery '' and of the journals of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, and several further volumes in the '' Expansion of the Republic '' and `` American Common - wealths '' series .

		Among works of literary history and criticism we shall soon have completed the new edition of
Chambers	ORGANIZATION	's '' Cyclopaedia of English Litera - ture , '' the illustrated '' English Literature '' of Messrs.
Garnett	PERSON	and
Gosse	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. J. Courthope	PERSON	's '' History of English Poetry . ''

		No less than fifteen new volumes of '' English Men of Letters `` are announced , three of the number by American writers upon American subjects .

		Two volumes of '' New Letters of Thomas Car - lyle '' will keep alive for another season the unfortunate controversy between his partisans and those of his biographer .

		`` America in Literature , '' by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, is a title that attracts us , as do such others as '' Studies in German Literature in the Nineteenth Cen - tury , '' by Professor
John F. Coar	PERSON	; ''
Dante	PERSON	's Influence on English Poetry '' and '' The Great Poets of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' both by Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	; '' A Literary History of
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
J. H. Millar	PERSON	; '' The Development of the Drama , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; and the titles of the five forthcoming volumes in the ``
Colum	PERSON	-
bia University Studies in Romance Literature	ORGANIZATION	and Philology . ''

		The two volumes of poetry that will attract most attention are Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's collection , `` The Five Nations , '' and the ``
David	PERSON	and Bathsheba '' drama by Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	.

		Among other announcements , the women seem to make the best showing , in witness whereof we mention `` After Sunset , '' by Mrs.
Rosamund Marriott Watson	PERSON	; '' The Siuging Leaves , '' by Miss Jo - sephine
Preston Peabody	PERSON	, `` The Passing Show , '' by Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	; `` Songs of Dreams , '' by Miss
Ethel Clifford	PERSON	; and '' Poems , '' by Miss
Josephine Daskam	PERSON	.

		We shall probably have some poetical surprises besides , for it has been our experience that the most interesting work in this kind is apt to come without observation , and unheralded by its sponsors .

		Novels , like the poor , we have always with us , and the comparison is far-reaching .

		Of the hundreds of titles already announced , we select a few for the closing paragraph of the present forecast , a task not without its diffi - culties .

		Among those that seem the most prom - ising the following may be named : '' The Crossing , '' by Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	; '' The Heart of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	; '' Helianthus , '' by `` Ouida '' ; `` Sanctuary , '' by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	; '' Cherry , '' by Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	; '' The Ambassadors , '' by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; '' The Maids of Paradise , '' by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	; '' Letters Home , '' by Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	; '' The Relent - less City , '' by Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	; '' The Long Night , '' by Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	; '' Barlasch of the Guard , '' by Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	; '' My Friend Prospero , '' by Mr.
Henry Har	PERSON	- land ; `` The Napoleon of Notting Hill , '' by Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	; `` Where Love Is , '' by Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	; `` The House on the Sands , '' by Mr.
Charles Marriott	PERSON	; '' The De

		THE DIAL 161 liverance , '' ' by Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	; '' The Castle of Twilight , '' by Miss
Margaret Horton Potter	PERSON	; '' Doctor Xavier , '' by Mr.
Max Pem	PERSON	- berton ; '' The Vineyard , '' by ''
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' ; and '' The Little Shepherd of King - dom Come , '' by Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	.

		Here are an even score of which we may be reasonably sure that they will not disappoint us , since each is the work of a practiced hand , skilled in its own peculiar craftsmanship .

		It is a far cry , no doubt , from a novel by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	to a novel by ''
Ouida	PERSON	, '' but whoever takes up either to read will do it with his eyes open , knowing about what to expect .

		POE 'S CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN LITERAR Y HIS TOR Y .

		If we may judge from the new editions of Poe that have recently been or are about to be put upon the market , we may reasonably conclude that
Poe	PERSON	's day has at last arrived , or at least is within sight .

		Let us , therefore , once more examine his literary history and see what ideas he has really contributed to the world 's stock .

		To the casual reader ,
Poe	PERSON	is a sort of Mephis - topheles .

		with human weaknesses , who created that weird poem `` The Raven '' and wrote the popular detective story `` The Gold-Bug . ''

		One is pure genius , unexplained and unexplainable ; the other , clever but somewhat cheap legerdemain .

		To the more careful and thoughtful student ,
Poe	PERSON	offers a bundle of fragments , which afford abundant evidence of genius , but are so slight and scattered , so imperfect -LRB- except in a few instances -RRB- , that it is impossible to accord their author a very high place or a very lasting reputation .

		Not only is his work fragmentary , but it is disfigured by extravagance and folly of the more pitiable kind .

		But now , more than fifty years after
Poe	PERSON	's death and nearly a hundred after his birth , we are called upon by the
Poe	ORGANIZATION	enthusiast to reexamine the rec - ords , and see if we have not been misled by a series of conditions , natural but hostile to appreciation of his true worth .

		None can deny that there is some truth in the statement that the Literary Powers have been hos - tile to
Poe	PERSON	.

		Poe attacked Longfellow violently , denied
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' originality , '' finally turned against
Lowell	PERSON	, and included all the
New England	LOCATION	writers in his sneers at '' Frogpondium . ''

		Irving and
Bryant	PERSON	, moreover , according to
Poe	PERSON	, were not as great as they ought to have been .

		In a word , he set himself against all that we have learned to value and consider great in American literature .

		It was hard for any friend of
Longfellow	LOCATION	to be an enthusiastic admirer of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Poe seems to force everyone to take sides , -- and when sides have been taken , we have
Poe	PERSON	on one side and every other literary man of eminence on the other .

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, whose biography of
Poe	PERSON	has contributed more to our knowledge of the man than anything else that has been written , manifestly dis - likes
Poe	PERSON	.

		And what critic but has accepted with a smile
Lowell	PERSON	's epigrammatic characterization , Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge '' ?

		All this has been like a wall of ice about any attempt to examine
Poe	PERSON	in the only way in which any great author can be fairly examined , namely , with the enthusiasm of a lover who is likewise a thoroughly intelligent and just critic .

		Poe has had his devoted friends , it is true ; but for the most part they have not been endowed with the highest crit - ical ability .

		But we have now a younger generation , owning no thralldom to the
New England	LOCATION	writers , and among them a number of keen critical minds .

		Here , then , is work for them .

		Let us outline , briefly , three lead - ing points of the inquiry upon which they must enter .

		1 .

		Poe was a most accomplished literary artist .

		He bad a skill that he had learned by patient study and practice .

		This is clearly shown by the improve - ment he made in revising his poems and tales .

		What a world of difference , for instance , do we find be - tween '' A Pean '' of
1831	DATE	and `` Lenore '' of
1843	DATE	, though one is but the developed form of the other !

		Poe never revised but to improve , and he was an habitual reviser of all his work .

		Have we not here , then , a conscious literary artist -LRB- whose genius none can deny -RRB- , with methods we might study , with the closest attention , for the critical principles they would reveal ?

		Poe 's literary history in this respect is interesting .

		He published his first volume of poems in
1827	DATE	, the same year and at the same age when
Tennyson	PERSON	pub - lished his contributions to `` Poems by Two Broth - ers '' ; and his volumes of
1829	DATE	and
1831	DATE	correspond closely with
Tennyson	PERSON	's early volumes of about the same dates .

		Clearly the first two volumes are alto - gether experimental ; but in the third -LRB-
1831	DATE	-RRB- we find such gems as '' To
Helen	PERSON	. ''

		From this time on ,
Poe	PERSON	never attempted a serious poem without making a pronounced artistic success , with the single excep - tion of the dramatic poem '' Politian , '' which was a further experiment such as ``
Tamerlane	LOCATION	'' and `` Al Aaraaf '' had been .

		What other great poet , after he had once learned his art , practised it so rigor - ously ?

		Tennyson may be regarded as almost the only other one .

		After the volume of poems of
1831	DATE	, which con - tains proof that
Poe	PERSON	had really mastered the poetic art , he turned his attention to short story writing .

		We hear nothing of him for two years .

		Then , in
1833	DATE	, he appears as the prize winner in the ''
Balti	LOCATION	- more Visiter '' contest , and he has on hand at least half a dozen stories of the first order .

		The French would doubtless accept
Poe	PERSON	as the father of the art of short story writing in its modern development .

		In his work we find a genus quite different from the narrative tales that had prevailed until his day .

		He begins a story with an essay on 162 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, some peculiarity of the human mind , and then he uses his dramatic plot to illustrate it .

		In his review of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, he explains the principle analytically : `` A skilful artist , has constructed a tale .

		He has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents , but having deliberately conceived a certain single tfftct to be wrought , he then invents such incidents , he then combines such events , and discusses them in such tone , as may best serve him in establishing this preconceived effect .

		If his very first sentence tend not to the out-bringing of this effect , then in his very first step he has committed a blunder .

		In the whole composition there should be no word written of which the tendency , direct or indirect , is not to the one pre - established design .

		And by such means , with such care and skill , a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a kindred art , a sense of the fullest satisfaction .

		The idea of the tale , its thesis , has been presented unblemished , because undisturbed -- an end abso - lutely demanded , yet , in the novel , altogether unattainable . ''

		Of course
Poe	PERSON	means '' in the novel '' of the great English writers , such as those of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	, each with its two or three hundred thousand words , rambling along a path the end of which not even the author himself could see .

		2 .

		A phrase in the paragraph quoted above sug - gests another point for our study of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He speaks of '' him who contemplates it with a kindred art . ''

		If this means anything , it means that the reading public must be educated in the principles of literary art if artistic creations are to have any value .

		There have been few hitherto to point out
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's devotion to and permanent interest in the American reading public .

		While English and French writers have lamented bitterly that
Poe	PERSON	was not born some - where , anywhere , not in
America	LOCATION	, we find in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's own writing not one word of complaint , not one expression of a wish that he had been , or might be , anything but an American .

		His magazine project , to which he devoted him - self so strenuously throughout his life , -- was not that much more than an ambitious desire to make money ?

		Poe 's real passion was to establish a periodical that would educate the American reading public criti - cally to appreciate the best in literature , since he believed that only with such an educated audience could the best works of literary art be produced .

		No other American writer ever devoted himself so unselfishly and passionately and persistently to so noble an artistic cause .

		Poe justly accuses Long - fellow of literary indolence in '' Hyperion , '' a novel totally at variance with the literary principle of unity enunciated by
Poe	PERSON	in the paragraph previously quoted .

		He says : '' Works like this ... are potent in unsettling the popular faith in Art -- a faith which , at no day more than the present , needed the support of men of letters .

		... A man of trne talent who would demur at the great labour requisite for the stern demands of high art -- at the unremitting toil and patient elaboration which , when soul-guided , result in the beauty of Unity , Totality , Truth , -- men , we say , who would demur at such labour , make no scruple of scattering at ran - dom a profusion of rich thought in the pages of such farragos as ' Hyperion . ' ''

		And he ends his review sadly , -- `` We are indig - nant that he -LSB- Li ngfellow -RSB- too has been recreant to the good cause . ''

		Poe was faithful unto death .

		3 .

		Poe was first poet , then story-writer and edu - cator of the reading public ; finally , toward the close of his life , he turned his attention toward a great scientific subject , -- rather , toward the substance of all science , -- a conception of the totality of the universe .

		Such scientific stories as ''
Hans Pfaal	PERSON	'' and '' The Conversation of Charmion and Eiros '' are light ; and while they serve their purpose , they are somewhat fanciful .

		In '' Eureka ''
Poe	PERSON	made a profoundly serious effort , which has never been properly studied , and indeed has usually been looked on as a curiosity in the literary garret , not unlike the flying machine of
Darius Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		In studying this side of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's literary history , we must bear in mind , first , that
Poe	PERSON	was not a scientist , but a literary man , and '' Eureka '' he specifically calls a '' prose poem . ''

		When he says it is `` Truth , '' he does not mean , as Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	supposes he does , that he believes him - self a great scientist and metaphysical thinker , but rather that he feels the sublimity of his subject and has studied it with the serious reverence which
Truth	ORGANIZATION	requires .

		There are various kinds of truth , and the truth
Poe	PERSON	aims at is of a literary , not a scientific , character , -- that is , it is touched with imagination and sentiment .

		Whether
Poe	PERSON	was suc - cessful or not in `` Eureka , '' he at any rate gives us an ideal of loftiness and immensity as the proper subject-matter of literature , and a hint as to how the plodding investigations of science may be utilized for the most ideal purposes .

		Science has made such immense strides since
Poe	PERSON	's day that we can not hold him responsible for any inaccuracies or shortcomings in statements of scientific truths ; but the present writer believes that the thoughtful student will find in ''
Eureka	LOCATION	'' the germs of that modern philosophy which has fully reconciled the material and the spiritual , dis - covering in mind , matter , God , and man , an unas - sailable Unity .

		In any case , the method of thought , the poetic conception , can never be affected by our changing knowledge , for they belong to the perma - nence , the immortality , of genius .

		We have not yet exhausted
Poe	PERSON	.

		There has been but little really sympathetic study of him as yet , and therefore no real or permanently valuable comprehension of him .

		Curious circumstances have retarded his vogue .

		Now that those circumstances have passed away , we may look forward with re - newed hope of his finding his true place in our lit - erary history .


Sherwin Cody	PERSON	.

		The
American Library Association Publishing Board	ORGANIZATION	has nearly ready for the press and expects to put into the printer 's hands early in
1904	DATE	, an '' Index of Por - traits , '' edited under the direction of
William Coolidge Lane	PERSON	, Librarian of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, by
Nina E. Browne	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		For several years the
Board	ORGANIZATION	has been gathering material for this work , with the assistance of many collaborators in all parts of the country .

		Over 100,000 references to portraits in pe - riodicals , published collections , and illustrated works have been brought together .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163
Cfe	ORGANIZATION	* 3M '' goohs .

		Napoleon at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		* When
Napoleon	PERSON	was a student at the Acad - emy of
Lyons	PERSON	he gained a prize for the best essay on '' The Truths and Principles that ought to be Inculcated on Men that they may Enjoy Happiness . ''

		The prize was a gold medal , which he afterward sold for fifty louis .

		Years later ,
Talleyrand	LOCATION	obtained this youthful composition from the
Lyons Academy	PERSON	and laid it before the Emperor .

		`` Have you read it ? ''

		asked the latter . ''

		No , Sire , I have just re - ceived it . ''

		Thereupon
Napoleon	PERSON	took the pa - per and threw it into the fire , pushing it down with the tongs .

		Talleyrand betrayed some sur - prise , but the other was determined that what he had written in the generous enthusiasm of youth should not be allowed to put him to shame as Emperor .

		This anecdote , recorded by General
Gour	PERSON	- gaud , in his volume of '' Talks of Napoleon at
St. Helena	LOCATION	, '' furnishes food for reflection , as do many other of the reminiscences contained in his journal .

		The gleams of light thrown on the great man 's character , the fresh revelations of his moral and intellectual peculiarities , are what most engages the interest in these new conversations at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of secondary importance are those purely historical recollec - tions of the illustrious captive , confirming or contradicting what has already been chronicled concerning his career .

		To the book as a pic - ture , however imperfect , of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's most intimate personality , the present reviewer ac - cordingly wishes to call attention in the brief space at his disposal .

		But first as to Gourgaud himself and his claims upon our confidence .


Gaspard Gourgaud	PERSON	was born of humble par - entage in
1783	DATE	.

		At nineteen he entered upon a military career , in which he distinguished himself for bravery , having the good fortune to save
Napoleon	PERSON	's life at
Brienne	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	.

		He had already advanced rapidly in the favor of the Emperor , who said of him in later life : '' He was my
First Orderly Officer	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is my work .

		He is my son . ''

		And there was a sin - cere attachment between the two .

		Hence it was natural that
Gourgaud	PERSON	, at his own earnest request , should be chosen by
Napoleon	PERSON	as • Talks of Napeolon at
St. Helena	LOCATION	with
General Baron Gourgaud	ORGANIZATION	.

		Together with the Journal kept hy Gourgaud on their Journey from
Waterloo	LOCATION	to
St. Helena	LOCATION	.

		Translated , and with Notes , by
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	.

		With eight portraits .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		one of the companions of his exile .

		But the irksomeness of inactivity told severely on the young soldier 's temper , and his own record shows him to have been of a petulant , moody , uneven disposition , which may perhaps some - what impair his authority as a chronicler of passing events .

		Yet the artless candor of his style insures us against wilful deception .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	calls his journal , which appears not to have been written for publication , '' the one capital and superior record of life at
St. Hel	ORGANIZATION	- ena , '' and , again , speaks of it as '' sometimes almost brutal in its realism . ''

		It was not until
1898	DATE	that the journal was published , by per - mission of
Gourgaud	ORGANIZATION	's son .

		Forming as it does , in the French , a work of twelve hundred pages , it is too prolix for unabridged reproduction in English .

		By judicious excision a book of one -
quarter	DATE	that bulk has now been produced .

		It is worth noting that the publication of these memoirs clears up some hitherto misun - derstood points relating to Gourgaud and his conduct toward Napoleon at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		A pretended quarrel with his imperial master was meant to throw dust in the eyes of the English and lead the way to the prisoner 's escape from the island .

		Let us now follow the fallen conqueror as he proceeds , on board the ''
Northumberland	LOCATION	, '' and in charge of Admiral
Cockburn	PERSON	, to his insular domain . ''

		Ah , if it were only to be done over again ! ''

		is his pathetic exclamation , referring to
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Choosing somewhat at random from his talks with Gourgaud , we find him looking back upon his First Consulship as a happy period in his life .

		He was also happy upon the birth of the King of
Rome	LOCATION	, though he did not then feel perfectly secure in his position .

		But he thinks perhaps he was hap - piest at Tilsit , when , after surmounting many difficulties , he found himself dictating laws and receiving the homage of emperors and kings .

		The remembrance of his Italian victories , too , gives him satisfaction .

		What cries of '' Long live the Liberator of
Italy	LOCATION	! ''

		and all that , when he was only twenty-five !

		Then first did he perceive what he might some day become , and he seemed to see the whole world passing be - neath him as if he had been borne aloft in the air .

		Looking into the future , he speaks of
Russia	LOCATION	as the power most to be dreaded by
England	LOCATION	, and even likely to march , safely and swiftly , to universal dominion , first making herself mistress of the Orient .

		This opinion he repeats again and again .

		He regards the part he played in history as one that would 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, have been played by someone else if he had not come .


Europe	LOCATION	was weary of anarchy , and an end of it was desired . ''

		A man is only a man , '' he says . ''

		His power is nothing if cir - cumstances and public sentiment do not favor him . ''

		And so he regards Luther and the Reformation merely as products of the times .

		Less sage are his reflections on the origin of man .

		In fact , they are so incredibly absurd that one is tempted to believe him falsely re - ported .

		After referring to the beginnings of civilization in
Egypt	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, he continues : '' All this leads me to think that the world is not so very old , at least as inhabited by man , and within one or two thousand years I am disposed to accept the chronology appended to the sacred writings .

		I think that man was formed by the heat of the sun acting upon mud .

		Herodotus tells us that in his time the slime of the Nile changed into rats , and that they could be seen in process of formation . ''

		Again and again
Napoleon	PERSON	refers to Jose - phine , betraying considerable feeling for her and much regret that she could not have borne him a son . ''

		She was full of grace -- a woman in every sense of the word .

		She always began by saying ' no ' to every - thing , merely that she might gain time to consider her final answer ; then she would say , ` ah !

		yes ,
Monsieur	PERSON	. '

		She - seldom told the truth , but there was something charming about her equivocations .

		I may say that she was the woman I have the most really loved .

		She knew me thoroughly .

		She never asked me to do anything for her children .

		She never begged me for money , but she made debts by the million .

		She had bad teeth , but was so careful of showing them that few people per - ceived them .

		She was the wife who would have gone with me to
Elba	PERSON	. ''

		Amid much gossip and tittle-tattle , indica - tive of anything but a noble mind , there are some interesting references to persons about whom one always likes to read .

		Of Queen
Louisa	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	, whom he calls '' a cultivated and superior woman , '' and of her husband ,
Frederick William III.	PERSON	, whom he styles a booby ,
Napoleon	PERSON	says : '' The Queen of
Prussia	LOCATION	was a much superior woman to the Queen of
Bavaria	LOCATION	; but she came to Tilsit too late .

		The king would not summon her until he saw he could get nothing from me ; but everything by the time she came had been settled .

		I went to call on her , but she received me in the tragic style , like
Chimene	PERSON	in The Cid : < Sire !

		Justice !

		Justice !

		Magdeburg ! '

		She went on in this way , and greatly embarrassed me .

		At last to make her stop I begged her to sit down , know - ing that nothing is so likely to cut short a tragic scene , for when one is seated its continuance turns it into a comedy ... '' The King of
Prussia	LOCATION	was a real booby .

		Every time he came to see me to talk over important affairs , he never managed to say anything on the subject .

		He went off about shakos , buttons , skin haversacks , and a lot of other nonsense , while I did not know a word about such trifling military details . ''

		Here the translator appends a footnote saying that '' it is a little remarkable that not one of the sovereigns who met to confer on the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	at Tilsit had a son and heir .

		Na - poleon and
Alexander	PERSON	had no legitimate chil - dren ; the Emperor of
Austria	LOCATION	and the
King of Prussia	LOCATION	had no sons . ''

		Where , pray , at this time -LRB-
1807	DATE	-RRB- was the boy afterward known to history as
Frederick William IV	PERSON	.

		?


October 15 , 1795	DATE	, is the commonly accepted date of his birth , and no breath of scandal has yet tarnished the fair name of his mother , Queen
Louisa	PERSON	.

		Amusingly frank are
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character - izations of some of his contemporaries .

		He does not spare even his own kith and kin .

		`` I made a great mistake , '' he says , '' in putting that fool of a
Joseph	PERSON	on the Spanish throne . ''

		`` He knows nothing .

		He likes to enjoy himself . ''

		His brother Louis he calls a booby , and says that in his essays in authorship he was inspired by the devil .

		Comparing his two empresses , he calls Marie -
Louise	PERSON	as sincere as
Josephine	PERSON	was diplomatic .

		The latter would never ac - knowledge her age .

		According to her chro - nology , her son
Eugene	PERSON	must have been twelve years old at birth !

		Marie-Louise was afraid of ghosts and insisted on having five or six lighted candles all night in her room .

		She was regarded by
Napoleon	PERSON	as having much more ability than the Emperor of
Austria	LOCATION	, her father .

		Still alluding to her ,
Napoleon	PERSON	declares , '' It was my having wedded a princess of
Austria	LOCATION	that ruined me .

		How could I have supposed that
Austria	LOCATION	would act as she has done ? ''

		It will be noticed that
Napoleon	PERSON	found a new rea - son every day to account for his downfall .

		Coming down to the last act in his military career , he says : '' I made a great mistake in employing
Ney	PERSON	.

		He lost his head .

		A sense of his past conduct impaired his energy .

		Carnot did not wish me even to make him a peer .

		Had I acted wisely I should have placed Soult on the left , but who would have thought that
Ney	PERSON	, who had spoken to me -LRB- you heard him , Gourgaud -RRB- of the importance of Quatre Bras , would have omitted to oc - cupy that position ?

		... I ought to have given
Suchet	PERSON	the command I gave to
Grouchy	LOCATION	.

		sage itself , and sometimes the leaf must be turned to find the desired comment .

		The large italic letter used in the general introduction is an exceptional combination of grace and legi - bility .

		The claim of the publishers that the book is `` perhaps the most beautiful volume ever made in the United States '' may well be justified if typographical charm be made the standard of beauty .

		Perhaps no other feature of this sumptuously printed book is so attractive to the special student as the attempt `` to give as accurately as possible the exact shade of meaning which
Shakspere	ORGANIZATION	's words had at the time they were written . ''

		Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	especially delights to point out that passages have often been treated as '' corrupt '' solely because of the ignorance of editors and commentators .

		Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	has made careful use of the earlv dictionaries of modern English , and es - pecially of the `` New English Dictionary , '' more than half of which has now appeared .

		It does not fall within the plan of the work to give much direct attention to aesthetic criti - cism ; but in the introductory notes to the sep - arate scenes , and in many brief comments , the editor shows admirable penetration , sugges - tiveness , and good taste .

		He thoroughly ap - preciates this tragedy , '' which in respect to unity and tenseness of interest is unequalled in the history of literature '' -LRB- p. xx -RRB- .

		A single sentence is here quoted from an admirable comment on
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's speech to Lady Mac - beth at the close of

		: `` With a few touches of association , -- and it is mar - vellous how few they are : the deepening light , the cawing rooks , plants and animals drooping and drow - sing to healthy rest while the mysterious forces of darkness stir themselves to their nightly activity , -- Shakspere tunes
Macbeth	PERSON	's soul into unison with the mysterious powers of evil that fly by night . ''

		Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	finds the scene between the wife and son of
Macduff	PERSON	-LRB- in IV .

		At some points objections and criticisms must be made .

		The price put upon the vol - ume is staggering .

		Such a method of publica - tion seems almost the ideal way to get the work into the wrong hands .

		The valuable matter here presented will be almost equally inacces - 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, sible to the scholars of moderate means who do not own the book and to many of the rich book-fanciers who do .

		The text is neither that of the First Folio , nor the same put into modern English .

		In the opening scene of eleven lines there are at least twenty-one departures from the text of the Folio ; two of them are '' th ' set of sunne '' and '' th ' fogge , '' where the Folio prints '' the '' .

		The suggestions of the various editors concern - ing the text are indicated occasionally , but not systematically .

		There is usually nothing to show what stage-directions are in the original , and what are modern .

		The passages in
Holinshed	LOCATION	which are the source of this play are printed only incident - ally and partially , in scattered bits .

		They should have been given in full .

		The passage concerning '' Macbeth '' in Forman 's diary is reprinted only in part .

		Forman 's statement that , when he saw the play acted ,
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	and
Banquo	PERSON	entered at I. iii .

		37 , '' Ridinge thorowe a wod '' -LRB- these words are not cited by Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	-RRB- , seems to show that they were on horse - back , i. e. , on hobby-horses .

		The use of these awkward representations of horses seems to be carefully avoided in the case of the struggle in which
Banquo	ORGANIZATION	meets his death -LRB- III .

		iii .

		11-14 -RRB- .

		Professor Manly 's excellent school edition of this play reprints all the desired material from
Holinshed	LOCATION	and Forman .

		An alphabetical bibliography is much needed .

		Since there is no entry in the index under `` Phipson , '' such a direction as `` see Phipson '' -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- may provoke some reader to language M not loud but deep . ''

		A number of comments will now be given which illustrate the great value of this new edition .

		Citations follow
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	text so far as the interpretations given permit . ''

		Thou ` ldst have , great Glamis , That which cries ' Thus thou must do ' if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone '' -LRB- I. v. 23-26 -RRB- .

		`` None of the emendations and explanations clears away the difficulty , which seems to lie in an
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan dirb koivov construction by which cries is first used in its sense of ' exclaiming ' and is then understood in its other Elizabethan sense of `` demanding ' with a direct object after it . ''

		The editor finds a similar zeugmatic construc - tion in the much-emended passage , -- '' I am young , but something You may discern of him through me , and wisdom To offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb To appease an angry god '' -LRB- IV .

		iii .

		14-17 -RRB- .

		This is taken to mean '' You may perceive -LSB- discern -RSB- what sort of a man
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	is from my experience , and learn from me -LSB- discern -RSB- the wisdom of offering up , '' etc. .

		A number of these strikiug zftugmatic constructions are pointed out in `` Macbeth '' ; the editor holds that they have led to a whole crop of uncalled for '' emendations and assumptions of cor - ruptness . '' ''

		To be thus is nothing But to be safely thus '' -LRB- III .

		i. 48-9 -RRB- .

		This is found to be only a normal Elizabethan idiom , the last words meaning `` if I can not be what I am in security and without fear . '' ''

		Rather than so , come fate into the list , And champion me to the utterance ! ''

		-LRB- III .

		i. 71-2 -RRB- .

		`` There can be little doubt that
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	means that fate is to be his champion to maintain his royal title against all comers , and not
Banquo	ORGANIZATION	's champion ... Fate in Elizabethan English is used of death , destruc - tion , ruin ... Here death and ruin are to be
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's champions and maintain his claim to the crown < e ` en till destruction sicken . '

		The words are not a challenge to destiny : Macbeth is not ready for that until the end of the play . '' ''

		Revenges burn in them ; for their dear causes Would to the bleeding , and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man '' -LRB- V. ii .

		3-5 -RRB- .

		The editor accepts none of the previous expla - nations , offering instead the following ingen - ious but venturesome interpretation : `` Revenges burn in them : I say burn , because they suffer from a fever which needs to be bled , and war 's stern alarm must furnish the furious incitement to rouse from its lethargy their lifeless manhood , so long crushed under the heel of the tyrant . ''

		The comments upon the following expres - sions show Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	at his best : '' in such bloody distance '' -LRB- = enmity -RRB- , III .

		i. 116 ; `` the perfect spy o ' the time , '' III .

		i. 130 -LRB-
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's view , that we have here a reference to the mysterious third murderer , is accepted -RRB- ; '' upon his aid , '' III .

		i. 12 ; '' the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel ! ''

		-LRB- IV .

		iii .

		136-7 -RRB- .

		-LRB- = `` May our chance of good success be as sure as our cause is just . '' -RRB-

		Apparently this editor is the first to note that the '' farmer that hanged himself on th ' expectation of plenty '' -LRB- II .

		iii .

		5-6 -RRB- is an allusion to the character of Sordido in
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's '' Every Man out of his Humour , ''
1699	DATE	, III .

		vii .

		The reasons which have con - vinced many that Scene V. of Act III .

		was not written by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are forcefully and adequately stated .

		Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	defends convincingly the suc - cessive accents of the line , ''
Toad	ORGANIZATION	, that under cold stone '' -LRB- IV .

		i. 6 -RRB- , against the emendations of normalizing editors .

		He also recognizes that the line
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 '' Beware the thane of Fife .

		Dismiss me : enough . ''

		-LRB- IV .

		i. 72 -RRB- , ends with a three-syllabled measure .

		But in general he is violently opposed to three-syllabled measures , and resorts to desperate surgical operations to cure them .

		Such pronunciations as '' harb ` ger '' -LRB- p. 33 -RRB- , '' pit ` ful '' -LRB- 110 , 181 -RRB- , `` laud ` ble '' -LRB- 167 -RRB- , and `` conf ` dent '' -LRB- 210 -RRB- , seem incredible .

		Macbeth is said to be `` essentially mad when his acts and words are viewed in the light of Elizabethan psychology '' -LRB- p. xxiv -RRB- .

		This opin - ion , though oft repeated , need not be taken too seriously , since the following passage shows that all of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's greatest tragic char - acters '' are as mad as he '' : ''
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's insanity , like Hamlet 's , is but suggested to the reader : Shakspere is too much of a poet to de - clare explicitly what insanity is , or to label
Lear	PERSON	, Ham - let , Othello , and
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	as mad .

		They have all ' a feaver of the madde ' in them that lifts them out of the common range of experience and makes them inter - esting '' -LRB- p. 200 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	holds that the knocking at the gate , in II .

		ii. , '' can not be that which is the subject of the
Porter	PERSON	's soliloquy in the scene that follows . ''

		But how does Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	know that it is not the same ?

		And how can the au - dience learn that it is not ?

		Professor Manly 's view of the passage con - cerning the touching for the king 's evil -LRB- IV .

		iii .

		140-159 -RRB- is that , while it may have been intended to please
James	PERSON	, '' it is quite as prob - able that it was intended to please the audience at
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	, by supporting the patriotic theory of the origin of the healing touch . ''

		This sug - gestion is not mentioned by Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	.

		Many other matters call for notice , bat space forbids .

		Schmidt 's ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	- Lexicon '' appeared in 1874-5 .

		The second edition ,
1885	DATE	, was properly `` a mere reimpression '' ; the editor confined his attention `` to the correction of mis - prints and to some small additions for which room could be got by expunging what seemed less important . ''

		The third edition , revised by Professor
Sarrazin	PERSON	, is now to be considered .

		The one striking new feature is a Supple - ment of thirty pages , containing `` a selection of new renderings and interpretations . ''

		These have been taken , for the most part , from En - glish scholars , '' the most legitimate commen - tators of the great English poet . ''

		In each case an asterisk has been inserted in the original article calling attention to the supplementary matter .

		Also , about twenty-six lines have been added to Part II .

		of the Appendix , `` Provin - cialisms '' ; and nearly twice as many have been inserted in brackets here and there in Part III. , '' Words and sentences taken from foreign lan - guages . ''

		These items seem to comprise all the additions to the second edition .

		Schmidt 's Lexicon was recognized from the beginning as a remarkable piece of work .

		One might sometimes differ from the editor in opin - ion , but the material was all gathered , and it was usually well explained .

		The present re - viewer once erroneously charged
Schmidt	PERSON	with having failed to cite under '' for to '' the line in '' The Taming of the Shrew '' : '' For to supply the places at the table . ''

		-LRB- III .

		ii. , 249 . -RRB-

		But the omission was noted in the '' additions and corrections . ''

		However , the same expres - sion in the grave-digger 's song in '' Hamlet '' -LRB- '' a pit of clay for to be made , '' V. i. 104 -RRB- is not yet cited .

		Richard Grant White made the use of '' for to '' an important consideration in forming his opinion as to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's prob - able relation to the two older plays on which Parts II .

		and III .

		of ''
King Henry VI	PERSON	. ''

		were based .

		Since White never acknowledged the value of
Schmidt	PERSON	's work , it is well to point out that if it had been in existence when he wrote his '' Essay on the Authorship of
Henry VI	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		it could have saved him from the mistake of saying that Shakespeare never uses '' this un - couth old idiom `` for to .

		White 's detailed criticism of the first edition of
Schmidt	PERSON	was reprinted in his `` Studies in Shakespeare , '' pp. 300-363 .

		It seems very strange that even this third edition pays no attention to many valuable corrections and im - provements there suggested , although Professor
Sarrazin	PERSON	mentions '' Grant White '' as one from whom help has been received .

		Omitting all cases where the American scholar may be thought hypercritical , his comments on the fol - lowing words should certainly have been taken to heart : buckle , lapsed , quill , bacon , beadle ,
Billingsgate	LOCATION	, boy -LRB- verb -RRB- , castle -LRB- in '' my old lad of the castle '' -RRB- , crestless , Hob , organ-pipe , pregnant -LRB- in '' crook the pregnant binges of the knee , '' '' Hamlet , '' III. , ii. , 66 -RRB- , shent , step - mother .

		The definition of clear-stories should be much improved now that we have the '' New English Dictionary . ''

		There are too many sub - divisions of meaning in treating such words as about , to be , to bear ; but this can hardly be remedied until an edition is made from new plates .

		It is to be hoped that the new matter in this third edition can be purchased in separate form .


Schmidt	PERSON	said , in the preface to the 168 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, second edition : `` It ought to be a law in the republic of letters that essential changes in books should be separately published in the form of supplements . ''

		`` The author did not revise these hastily written lectures , and they were penned under heavy stress of the illness that was closing in upon him , and with no idea of their inclusion in a book . ''

		This statement concerning
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's '' Shakspere and his Forerunners '' fairly disarms criticism , and at the same time suggests some inevitable shortcomings in the work .

		The reviewer will therefore turn at once to features which seem to him interesting and helpful .

		The work is not at all similar to
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	's standard book , ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Predecessors in the English Drama . ''

		The '' forerunners '' of Shakespeare here discussed include all those poets and poems , from `` Beo - wulf '' down to the death of the dramatist , that
Lanier	PERSON	chooses to bring into connection with Shakespeare by reason of any contrast or re - semblance .

		The sonnet-makers , from Surrey to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, receive four out of the entire twenty-four chapters .

		Many sonnets are an - alysed and interpreted with great delicacy and skill .

		Lanier 's declaration that `` every sonnet should be a little drama '' seems fanciful , but it is so expounded as to be very illuminating -LRB- I. 189-193 -RRB- .

		Chapters XIII .

		and
XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Vol .

		II . -RRB-

		discuss '' The Music of Shakspere 's Time '' very agreeably , and presumably with as much ac - curacy as is practicable in a popular presenta - tion .

		In chapters XX .

		and XXI .

		the gradual changes in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's versification are ex - plained , and their significance is well brought out .

		A few words on the omnipresence of lit - erature -LRB- p. xiv . -RRB-

		, a passage concerning Nature - communion -LRB- I. , 72-3 -RRB- , and one that depicts a bird building its nest -LRB- I. , 88 -RRB- , are commended to all lovers of
Lanier	PERSON	.

		These volumes are very fully illustrated , and their external appearance is beautiful in every way .

		The illustrations are interesting and valuable , and it must have cost much trouble and expense to secure them .

		The reviewer wishes to offer some suggestions concerning them that may be of service in a second edition .

		The value of the illustrations is often much les - sened by the fact that sufficient information about them is not given .

		At p. 40 of the first volume , what is called a facsimile from an '' Anglo-Saxon MS. '' shows a passage written in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		The illustration at p. 76 is a repro - duction of p. 50 of
Thorpe	ORGANIZATION	's edition -LRB- 1842 -RRB- of the `` Codex Exoniensis '' or `` Exeter Book '' ; that at p. 100 comes from p. 293 of the same book .

		At p. 162 there is '' a page from Lay - amon 's ' Brut , ' '' -- but from which MS. ?

		Con - cerning each portrait of an individual author , one wishes to know the source from which it was obtained .

		When undated title-pages are reproduced in facsimile , the date of publica - tion , exact or approximate , should be given -LRB- pp. 224 , 232 -RRB- .

		The so-called picture of `` Shakspere 's house at
Stratford	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 74 -RRB- is not the birthplace , which is commonly given this name .

		It seems to be a representation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's last home , '' New Place '' ; and since the best that Halliwell-Phillipps could do for us in the `` Outlines '' -LRB- II. , 132 -RRB- was to reproduce the building of
1702	DATE	, this picture is probably imaginary , having no authority what - ever .

		The facts about the illustration should have been clearly stated .

		The pictures of '' a poticary and a pardoner '' -LRB- p. 102 -RRB- are from the
Ellesmere MS.	LOCATION	of Chaucer 's '' Canterbury Tales . ''

		Between pp. 104 and 113 , five pic - tures are marked as `` from the ' Coventry Mys - teries . ' ''

		This phrase is decidedly unfortunate , since a cloud of misunderstanding has already gathered about the name ''
Coventry Mys	ORGANIZATION	- teries . ''

		These five illustrations are from
Thomas Sharp	PERSON	's '' Dissertation on the Pageants or Dramatic Mysteries anciently performed at Coventry '' -LRB- 1825 -RRB- , where some interesting in - formation about them may be found .

		The serio - comic picture of the mouth and the interior of hell -LRB- p. 108 -RRB- , for example , is taken from a fresco in '' the chancel of the Chapel of the Holy Cross at
Stratford-upon-Avon	LOCATION	, discovered in
1804	DATE	, during a reparation of it . ''

		The pic - ture called '' A Soul in Torment , '' at p. 112 , has been misunderstood .

		It is a '' representa - tion of
Israel Van Mechlin	ORGANIZATION	's curious and rare copy of the print of the
Temptation of St. Anthony	ORGANIZATION	, by
Martin Schoen	PERSON	'' -LRB- Sharp , p. 60 -RRB- .

		The illustration designated '' Morris-dancers '' -LRB- p. 120 -RRB- is exceptionally valuable .

		It is a pic - ture of '' Toilet 's painted window , '' assigned by Douce -LRB- Illustrations of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, II. , 445 -RRB- to about 1460-70 , and thought to be the oldest known representation of a May-game with the morris-dance .

		The early plan of the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	- side at p. 124 is omitted from the introductory '' list of illustrations . ''

		The picture of ''
Richard Tarleton	LOCATION	, Actor in Shakesperes Plays '' is thus endorsed on the original that is here
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 reproduced ; but since that famous comedian , who was able to make the people laugh exceed - ingly '' when he first peept out his head , '' died in
1588	DATE	, the claim can not be admitted .

		Mar - stons '' Tragedies and Comedies '' are called Pen Jonsoris at p. 148 , -- apparently because the name ''
Ben Jonson	PERSON	'' is written across the title-page there reproduced .

		Such a book as this should never be pub - lished without an index ; however , the table of contents is exceptionally full .

		The purpose of Mr.
W. Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	's `` Shakespear '' is to give '' the private and liter - ary history '' of the dramatist .

		The author thinks that Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	has '' dealt in - completely with some biographical points '' in his life of the poet , and M has left numerous others absolutely untouched . ''

		Later , we are told that the modern editions of Shakespeare , '' including the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	and Clarendon Press one - volume issues , are disgracefully executed in an editorial sense . ''

		These attacks upon works of thorough scholarship do not prejudice one in favor of the production before us ; and a fuller examination makes it clear that Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	's book is not likely to replace Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's in general favor .

		The present work is less systematic in arrangement than Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's life , and offers but six pages of index where that has thirty .

		Among the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, only '' Titus Andronicus '' and '' Macbeth '' -LRB- one reference -RRB- appear in Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	's index -- a really ab - surd state of things .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	constantly makes statements for which no authority is given .

		Thus , we learn of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's annoyance at the piracy of ''
Jaggard	PERSON	in the case of the Passionate Pilgrim '' -LRB- p. xxvii . -RRB-

		, but we are not given the detailed information that is properly desired .

		Farther statements are made on pp. 59-61 ; but a clear and scholarly presentation of the matter , such as that given on pp. 182-3 of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's '' Life , '' is nowhere found .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	offers conjectures about the life-history of the dramatist with striking free - dom .

		One of the more probable of these is the suggestion that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, while living in
Stratford	LOCATION	, was an occasional spectator at dra - matic entertainments -LRB- p. 6 -RRB- .

		But what shall we say of the following ? ''

		There is no precise account -LSB- of the poet 's life before his marriage -RSB- , no domestic clues even of the slenderest kind to assist us , save the warrantable inference that once , or possibly more than once , he visited
London	LOCATION	as a mere boy , and met with the Bur - bages and
Tarlton	PERSON	the actor '' -LRB- p. 12 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	is a literary student and anti- quary of wide reading and multifarious infor - mation .

		His book furnishes many suggestions and side-lights for scholars of some attainment ; it can not be called a good handbook for begin - ners or for ready reference .

		* For over thirty years , Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	has been recognized by European scholarship as one of the keenest thinkers at work in the field of literary criticism .

		The range of his studies , the acuteness of his observation , and the brilliancy of his style , offer a combination of qualities rarely met with in a critic , and in the case of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	these qualities are united with a judgment which , if not always entirely sound , is always sufficiently reasoned to com - mand respectful attention .

		It is not , however , until recent years that this strong and interest - ing writer has been properly brought before the English-reading public , and it is only within the last few months that he may be said to have secured an adequate presentation .

		The first of his works to be given us were his study of
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, and a selection , made by Pro- fessor
K. B. Anderson	PERSON	, of his miscellaneous crit - ical essays .

		When his great work on Shake - speare was published about five years ago , it could not be ignored by the translator , and was promptly put into English .

		His `` Main Cur - rents , '' the most extensive and important of his works , after waiting more than a quarter of a century for a translator , is at last being brought out in
English	LOCATION	, volume after volume .

		His studies of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Bjornson	PERSON	-LRB- partly included in Pro- fessor
Anderson	PERSON	's volume -RRB- have received com - plete translation within very recent years , and his long-promised history of modern
Scandina	PERSON	- vian literature , written for the series edited by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, can not now be long delayed .

		At the present writing , we have before us a trans - lation of his '' Indtryk fra Polen '' -LRB- Impres - sions from
Poland	LOCATION	-RRB- , which is one of the most deeply interesting of all his writings .

		This work is made up of five parts .

		Four of them are the records of as many visits to Po - land , made between

		Altogether , the vol - ume offers us a fascinating mixture of history , philosophy , literary criticism and personal ex - perience ; it is a volume almost as difficult to lay aside , when once started upon , as a novel of the more thrilling sort .

		The sympathetic standpoint of all this dis - cussion may be illustrated by the following extract : ''
Poland	LOCATION	, in the historical development of nations , has become synonymous with the right of mankind to civil and intellectual freedom and with the right of nations to independence .


Poland	LOCATION	is synonymous with our hope or our illusion as to the advance of our age in cult - ure .

		Its final destruction would be synonymous with the victory of modern military barbarism in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Along with this expression of fundamental sympathy with the aspirations of an oppressed nation there goes , however , a good deal of frank criticism of the weaknesses and defects of the Polish people .

		The author is by no means blind to their faults , and in those faults he sees clearly the historical explanation of the downfall of the ancient Kingdom , and the three partitions .

		Nor can he be hopeful for the future , for he sees that many of the old faults persist , and he marks also the deadly effectiveness of the brutal measures undertaken -LRB- especially in Russian
Poland	LOCATION	-RRB- , and persistently pursued , with the object of destroy - ing the Polish national spirit and all that is most distinctive in Polish civilization .

		A people less intensely proud of its national inheritance , and less passionately patriotic in its endeavor to keep glowing the embers of Polish sentiment , would have succumbed long ago to the
Russ	PERSON	- ianizing and Germanizing process .

		The indescribable meanness with which the Russian bureaucracy exercises its tyranny over its Polish subjects , the arbitrary and heartless character of its methods , is such as to put the Russian government outside the pale of ad - vanced civilization as it is understood in the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	tells us things about the censorship , and ad - ministrative process , and the official crusade against the Polish language , and the perversion of justice , that we should think simply incred - ible were it not for the trustworthiness of the writer , and the unimpeachable evidence upon which the charges are sustained .

		What can anyone think , for example , anyone living in a civilized country , of a government which fines a tram car conductor for answering a Polish question in the same language , or which expels a boy of sixteen from school because he throws I a wreath to an actress who is persona non grata to the authorities ?

		The latter incident occurred in a family which Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	visited , and the boy felt his punishment so keenly that he went home and killed himself .

		This actress , by the way , was
Madame Modrzejewska	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- to give her name its proper spelling -RRB- , and the author pays a splendid tribute to her art .

		We are often told that adversity brings out the finer qualities of the individual and the race .

		The author finds in the Polish people a striking illustration of this principle , with whatever consolation it may afford .

		He speaks of the drastic foreign rule as having created '' an intellectual condition which , however unhappy it may be , may in certain ways be called the finest and best possible to a nation , a condition which calls to mind that of primitive
Christendom	LOCATION	under the oppres - sion of
Rome	LOCATION	, a conception of the world , pessimistic in many points , but not on that account less true .

		Perhaps after all there is no condition more elevating for a race than one in which no distinguished man ever has any external distinction , title , or decoration , and where the official tinsel of honor is regarded as a disgrace , while on the other hand the official garb of disgrace , the political prison blouse , is regarded as honorable ... That which is the pith , the true pith of Christian teaching , a right estimate of the honors of this world , the igno - miny of this world , and the justice of this world , of real greatness and real baseness -- this estimate , every one here , even the least gifted , has accepted .

		What a school for life !


Poland	LOCATION	is the only country , I believe , where primitive Christianity still exists as a power in society -- and that equally for those who are Christians and for those who are not . ''

		These last words have special reference to the fact that the spirit of the Judenhetze , which has disgraced most of the surrounding countries , has been almost absent in
Poland	LOCATION	, especially in
Russian Poland	LOCATION	, '' where common misfortune has united the Polish Jews to their Christian fellow-countrymen . ''

		This is strikingly illus - trated by the following incident : '' When , in
February , 1861	DATE	, in the square before the castle , and in another larger square , shots were fired upon the kneeling crowd , who with the mouths of the Russian cannon before their eyes , gave utterance to a national hymn , and besought God to send to the Poles freedom and a
Fatherland	LOCATION	, the Jews felt impelled to manifest their national disposition by an unmistakable demonstration .

		In great numbers they accompanied their Rabbis into the Catholic churches , just as the Christians in great numbers went into the synagogues to sing the same hymn . ''

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	thinks that , aside from the power of invention or production , the women of
Poland	LOCATION	are superior to the men . ''

		The men in
Poland	LOCATION	are certainly not wanting in passion , in courage and in energy , in wit , in love of freedom , but it seems as if the women have more of these qualities .

		In
Poland	LOCATION	's great uprisings they have been known to enter into conspiracies , to do military
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 171 duty , and frequently euough of their own free will to accompany their loved ones to
Siberia	LOCATION	... During the rebellion of 1830-31 there was not a battalion nor a squadron of the Polish army in which there were not female combatants , -- after a battle or a march the soldiers always arranged a bivouac for the women , just as they took care that no word was spokeu whicb could offend their ears . ''

		The writer was evidently susceptible to the charm of Polish women , as many fragmentary observations attest .

		Speaking of the small feet of Polish ladies , he tells us how '' it is said in
Warsaw	LOCATION	that in the
Vienna	LOCATION	shoe-shops they have a separate ease of boots and shoes for these feet , and that its contents are widely different from that of the case designed for Euglish ladies . ''

		His standards of feminine conduct seem to be a little strained , if the fol - lowing passage may be taken to illustrate it : '' At the momeut when the room was thus described , I saw the most beautiful of the daughters of the house crossing it , and , as if quite justified in doing so , she kissed the lips of a young man who stood leaning against the mantelpiece , an incident whicb I note , partly because it is the only immoral action I witnessed during my stay here , partly because it proves that Polish women do not lose their presence of mind in alarming circumstances . ''

		It is a pity the distinguished guest should have witnessed so shocking a sight .

		Another per - sonal remark appeals to us by its naivete .

		** Here as everywhere on Polish ground one now and then meets a young woman so charm - ing , that one feels a kind of sadness at the thought of never seeing her again . ''

		True in - deed , but by other men , and elsewhere , the same feelings have been entertained .

		The author 's account of the censorship , and of his ov ^ n difficulties in obtaining from it the permission to give his lectures on Polish liter - ature , is highly amusing .

		It took several weeks of red-tape negotiations to obtain the official authorization , and then the composition of the lectures themselves taxed the author 's ingenuity to the utmost . ''

		There were days when in spite of all my diligence I wrote almost nothing , days when I strove in vain to find expressions with double meanings , images , in them - selves indistinct , which could be understood by the au - dience , circumlocutions which could be seen through and yet would be unassailable ... Gradually I ac - quired practice in the rebus style , and wrote so that by an accent or a pause I could give a sentence a new and more living character .

		• I became expert in hints and implications . ''

		How this method worked out in practice is shown by an instructive anecdote .

		At a cer - tain point , the lecturer absolutely required to use a famous line from
Mickiewicz	PERSON	, a line in - which the hero of the poem complains to God -- '' Thou art not the father of the world , but its -- Txar ! ''

		But to quote this line exactly , or even to use its idea in connection with its real context , was obviously out of the question .

		The author thus tells us how he got over the difficulty : '' I chose , therefore , to speak of the different attri - butes of Polish authors as to the problem of cognition , and insinuated this in connection therewith .

		■ And as the savages of antiquity , when they were angry with their gods , discharged an arrow into the vault of the heavens , so Conrad flings this taunt out into the uni - verse , which he says shall resound frum generation to generation : Thou God !

		Thou art not the Father of the world , but its ... ' Here I made a pause of some sec - onds , during which a shudder literally ran through the closely packed hall .

		Then came the word tyrant , and they drew breath and looked at one another .

		No one moved a hand .

		After such passages a deathly silence prevails in order not to compromise the speaker .

		They vigorously applaud some innocent comparison as others a few minutes later , or they reserve the most hearty applause to the close , when no one can determine what it is which has specially called forth the storm of approval . ''

		By such devices as this , the lecturer hood - winked the censorship more than once , and introduced matters of the most explosive char - acter into his discourse .

		The lectures themselves , but in a form re - stored from the censor 's mutilations , constitute the concluding section of the work before us .

		They give a history and philosophical analysis of nineteenth-century Polish literature more valuable than anything hitherto accessible in our language .

		The following passage , which appears in the discussion of the Byronic lean - ings of
Mickiewicz	PERSON	and his fellow-poets , seems to us a remarkable example of speculative criticism : '' Let us suppose , for the sake of argument , that
Shelley	PERSON	in his lifetime had received the recognition he only obtained half a century after his death ; then the Polish poets would have found in him the combination which nowhere met them -- Gothe 's lofty and sure con - ception of nature in combination with the practical en - thusiasm , the strong hope , and the belief in the miracles of activity , which they themselves required , and which to their sorrow they missed in the old man at
Weimar	LOCATION	; for
Shelley	PERSON	was eternally young , and , like them , ap - pealed to the youth of the mind .

		If they had come under his influence instead of
Byron	PERSON	's , the cause of in - tellectual freedom would have a less difficult battle to fight now .

		Without wouuding the religious feelings of their readers , they would have been able to transform them so far that the inevitable schism in the future between the ideas of this century and the emotional life of the nation would have been less deep . ''

		One more extract , and our citations must end .

		It is taken from the closing pages of the work , and is a word of reconciliation between the opposing factions of romanticism and real - ism .

		172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, '' As a form of art Romanticism is dead , a thing of the past .

		Its heroes and heroines , its spirits and witches , in part even its language and style , are antiquated .

		Nevertheless , there is a Romanticism which outlives forms of art and schools of art , and which still preserves its vitality and worth .

		It is the element of healthy en - thusiasm , which every strong human emotion can assume when it is refined and intensified beyond the average .

		Without any background whatever of superstition , our feelings for nature , for the woods and fields , the sea and the heavens , may assume this form of romantic ecstasy , and in even higher degrees emotions like love , friendship , love between parents and children , love of language and native land , and common memories may take a like form . ''

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	says this because he sees that Polish literature is peculiarly rich in the ex - pression of this '' abiding Romanticism . ''

		We have reproduced the passage because it seems to us one of the truest words ever spoken upon a vexed theme , and because it illustrates so clearly the insight and philosophical poise which place its author at the very head of liv - ing critics of literature .

		A Thousand Years of the English Parliament .

		* In the
Palace of Westminster	ORGANIZATION	there centre more things of interest , for those who are in - terested in history , politics , and the lives of great men , than in any other spot on the globe .

		In two large and lavishly illustrated volumes entitled '' Parliament , Past and Present , '' the authors , accomplished book-makers as well as thorough students , have gathered a vast num - ber of pictures illustrating in one way or an - other the events of the thousand years of En - glish parlimentary life , and showing the build - ings in which that life has developed in great detail .

		In these volumes there are no less than six hundred and forty-three of these illustra - tions , including about twenty colored plates .

		There is no one of the five hundred and seventy - eight pages that has not at least one picture , many of them filling a large part of the page , and there are many full-page illustrations .

		The page is very large , nearly eight and a half by eleven inches .

		The paper is heavy , and the printing is excellent .

		These details are given , for they are necessary to show the real value of the book , which lies largely in the pictures • Parliament , Past and Present .

		with which it is filled .

		These include portraits of those who have been at all prominent in parliamentary life , many views of the build - ings in and around the Palace Yard , some fa - mous pictures portraying stirring incidents in English history , many caricatures of notable men , and photographs illustrating the different sides of parliamentary life of this and earlier times .

		The work contains thirty - seven chapters .

		Of these , ten , covering a hundred and eighty pages , are entitled '' Memories of St.
Stephens	PERSON	, '' and give a running sketch of parliamentary history from the beginning , in the form of anecdotes of the leading actors in parliamentary life .

		As these anecdotes are largely taken from the stock found in every history , these chapters form the least valuable part of the work , though the portraits in connection with the anecdotes give them new life .

		The special value of the text of the work lies in the full descriptions of the old buildings and the present great structure , with the fine illustrations , showing masses and details , and in the inside view of parliamentary life and custom .

		As examples of the latter may be cited the chapters on '' The Speaker as Host , '' '' Parliamentary Costume , '' '' Social As - pects of Parliamentary Life , '' '' Wining and Dining , '' '' The Lobby , '' '' Ladies at the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' ; and another group in the second volume on '' The Parliament in Being , '' '' The Speaker , '' '' The
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	at Work , '' '' Called to the Bar , '' `` Parliamentary Privilege , '' `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	at Prayers , '' `` In Committee . ''

		One chapter gives an account of Coronation Cere - monies at the
Palace	ORGANIZATION	, from
William	LOCATION	the Con - queror to
Edward the Seventh	ORGANIZATION	.

		One is tempted to quote the account of the coronation banquet of
George IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		in Westminster Hall as an ex - ample of everything that should not be on such an occasion ; but lack of space forbids , and it is perhaps just as well not to show unnecessarily how near the savage instincts were to the surface even in court circles in the nineteenth century .

		And that was the last coronation banquet .

		An interesting chapter is that on
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster Hall , its history and traditions .

		One whose imagination was fired in boyhood by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's description of the scene in the great hall of
William Rufus	PERSON	will be attracted to that chapter , and the next on `` Memorable Trials . ''

		The illustrations of these chapters are of special interest .

		THE DIAJ ^ 173 incident which occurred in the Parliament of
1428	DATE	.

		On a certain day while Parliament was sitting , ' one Mis - tress
Stokes	PERSON	, with divers other stout women of
London	LOCATION	, of good account and well apparelled , went openly to the
Upper House of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and delivered letters to the
Duke of Gloucester	ORGANIZATION	, to the Archbishops , and the other lords , because he would not deliver his wife
Jaqueline	PERSON	of her grievous imprisonment -LRB- she being then detained as prisoner by the
Duke of Burgundy	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and suffering her there to remain unkindly whilst he kept another adultress , contrary to the law of God and the honorable estate of matrimony . ' ''

		These early advocates of women 's rights , the first of a long line of fair reformers who have invaded the legislative precincts to redress the wrongs of their sex , seem to have created no small sensation , and from the fact that the Commons ventured to espouse the cause of
Jaqueline	PERSON	, we may infer that their remonstrance had some effect .

		The course taken by the `` Nether House '' was cunningly to tack to a subsidy granted to the
Duke of Gloucester	ORGANIZATION	a petition in favor of the Duchess .

		The quaint document we can not give .

		Here is what one well-known lady had to say in a letter to a friend written in
1762	DATE	: '' In the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	everybody who can articulate is a speaker , to the great despatch of business and solidity of councils .

		They sit late every night , as every young gentleman who has a handsome person , a fine coat , a well-shaped leg , or a clear voice , is anxious to exhibit these advantages .

		To this kind of beau - oratory and tea-table talk the ladies , as is reasonable , resort very constantly .

		At first they attended in sueh numbers as to fill the the body of the
House	ORGANIZATION	on great political occasions ; but a ghost -LRB- the Cock Lane -RRB- started up in a dirty obscure alley in the
City	LOCATION	, and diverted the attention of the female politicians .

		From this it is pretty clear not merely that ladies had admission to the public galleries , but that they actually occupied seats by the side of members on the sacred floor of the
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The disgraceful scene that led to the abandon - ment of the system of uncontrolled freedom in favor of absolute exclusion , is described in a paragraph too long for quotation .

		■ Afterwards , so rigorous was the ban against the ladies , that Mrs.
Sheridan	PERSON	was driven to the expedient of donning male attire in order to secure the opportu - nity of hearing her husband 's eloquence .


Wraxall	PERSON	also mentions in his `` Memoirs ' having seen on one occasion the beautiful Duchess of Gordon in male attire in the Strangers ' Gallery . ''

		Other scenes are described , showing the lack of restraint of women in the Houses of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment .

		Some of the illustrations in the work are rather out of place , the colored plates are crude , the arrangement of the chapters is be - yond the writer 's understanding , and many of the incidents related are commonplace ; yet the book is full of interest for the reader of history , and will serve to make real much that is read about some of the most interesting men and places in
England	LOCATION	.

		Four Books on Art .

		* Four books on art , recently issued by dif - ferent publishers , have an unusual interest as representing four different points of view from which art may be regarded .

		One of the books is thoroughly technical , giving information as to the structure of a picture which is valuable both to the artist and to the critic .

		Another is theoretical , designed to prove a certain de - finite principle , and venturing into the realms of historical research .

		The third may perhaps be best described as philosophical , as it gives an estimate of the scope and value of nineteenth century art ; while the fourth , on '' The Enjoy - ment of Art , '' is , as the title signifies , entirely simple and untechnical , a book for the layman , and designed to open the eyes of the unin - itiated to the beauty of a picture .

		A person in any way interested in art will be likely to find at least one of these volumes helpful .

		The merest lover of pictures , with no pre - tensions to knowledge , will delight in Mr.
Carleton Noyes	PERSON	's volume on '' The Enjoyment of Art . ''

		The work is in the form of answers to questions which a young collegian asked himself when he first entered the art galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		`` Why are these pictures ? ''

		he said . ''

		What is the meaning of all this striv - ing after expression ? ''

		But only when he turned to himself , and asked what a picture meant to him , did he find his answer , which is the keynote to the book : '' This work of art is the revelation to me of a fuller beauty , a deeper harmony , than I have ever seen or felt .

		The artist is he who has experienced this new wonder in nature , and who wants to communi - cate his joy , in concrete forms , to his fellow men . ''

		At the beginning of his work , the au - thor notes the fact that nearly everyone likes pictures ; he then proceeds to analyze the * The E > - joymbnt of Art .

Sept. 16	DATE	, cause of their enjoyment .

		What the mere primitive beholders desire in a picture , as he takes it , is clever imitation , or illusion .

		Others , and a larger class , make their demands upon the subject ; it must be something pleasing , and something which appeals to their experience .

		But to a third class the subject does not mat - ter so much as what the artist wanted to say about it .

		It is the additional beauty which an artist sees and which the ordinary man does not , that , successfully revealed to others , con - stitutes the highest enjoyment in art .

		This is the principal thought of the essay , which is charmingly written , the only fault being a re - petition of idea and of phrase which weakens the value of the message .

		It is , on the whole , a book likely to diffuse a wider knowledge of the true function of art . ''

		Art in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' is the subject of a lecture delivered by Dr.
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	, at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in a series dealing with nineteenth century art , and now produced in book form .

		The work is a scholarly resume of the achievements of modern art , in which the author presents the conclusions of deep thought and of thorough study , without troubling the reader with tiresome detail .

		Art is treated in its broadest sense , as including '' all forms of aesthetic enjoyment , '' of which painting is only one phase .

		One part of the subject after an - other , -- literature , music , etc. , -- is taken up , and its progress in the last hundred years reviewed .

		The discussion is mainly with a view to proving one point , -- namely , that the art - tendency of the nineteenth century is toward expansion .

		The subjects , the methods , the in - struments of all kinds of art have been en - larged , until now there is no phase of life that is not considered worthy of the artist , and there are few means that he will scorn to use to ob - tain his effect .

		Although the danger of fitting facts to one idea is obvious , this principle is one that can hardly be denied ; and , as the author proves , the past century is as remarkable for its artistic achievement as it is for its ad - vance in science .

		An art work of a very different kind from those just discussed is Mr.
T. A. Cook	PERSON	's treatise on '' Spirals in Nature and Art . ''

		The book be - gins with a description of a beautiful staircase at
Blois	LOCATION	in
Touraine	LOCATION	, the architect of which has hitherto been unknown ; and a likeness is pointed out between this staircase , which is illustrated , and a certain sea-shell , scientifically known as
Voluta Vespertilio	ORGANIZATION	.

		The formation in the two cases is exactly similar , and the reader willingly follows the author through his explor - ations , which end in exploiting Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	as the designer of the stairway .

		Leon - ardo lived in the period in which the staircase referred to is supposed to have been built , and was the only architect of the time who was likely to have studied shells .

		A minute exami - nation of manuscripts and drawings left by the great artist confirms the impression in a hundred ways ; for instance ,
Leonardo	PERSON	was left-handed , and the spiral of the stair goes round from left to right , the opposite of the natural direction .

		The argument is close , exact , and convincing ; and it leaves small room for doubt that the creator of the lovely spiral at
Blois	LOCATION	has been discovered .

		A study of other spirals in art , which are based upon natural formations , is included , making the book an extremely inter - esting and suggestive one .

		Mr.
Henry R. Poore	PERSON	's comprehensive study of '' Pictorial Composition and the Critical Judgment of Pictures '' is said , in the preface , to have been written for students of painting , amateur photographers , and professional art - ists ; but no one who desires to judge pictures intelligently can afford to pass it by .

		The work is in no way popular , -- composition in pictures is hardly a popular subject ; but the style is so direct and the treatment so intelligent that the main points can not fail to become clear to the careful reader .

		Plentiful reproductions of masterpieces illustrate each step in the expo - sition .

		After dealing with main principles , the writer takes up `` The ^ Esthetics of Composi - tion , '' '' Suggestiveness , '' `` Mystery , '' etc. ; and finally leads to the still more interesting theme of the judgment of pictures .

		If every critic could be made to read this last chapter alone , how much flippant and misunderstanding com - ment on art we might be spared !

		A strong plea for a wider knowledge of art principles is found in the fifteenth chapter . ''

		Is it unreasonable , '' writes Mr.
Poore	PERSON	, '' to ask the many sharers in the passing picture pleasures of a great city to make themselves intelligent in some other and more practical way than by contact , gleaning only through a lifetime what should have been theirs without delay as a foundation ; and to exchange for the vague impression of pleasure defended in the simple comfort of knowing what one likes , the enjoyment of sure authority , and a reason for it ?

		The time is past when the intelligent reader is frightened by the word technical ; and many besides the class he writes for will welcome Mr.
Poore	PERSON	's well - classified principles of art criticism .

		THE DIAL , 175 Briefs on Xje \ v Books .

		tu late * history For several years it has been known of American that Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	was en - luerature .

		gaged in preparing for Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's series of '' The Literatures of the World '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- a volume on '' American Literature . ''

		The work has at last appeared , and does the highest credit to the taste and scholarship of its author .

		It seems to us , on the whole , to be the best of the three ex - tensive treatments that our literature has thus far received , although we are by no means insensible of the admirable qualities of the works written by Professor
C. F. Richardson	PERSON	and Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	.

		It is a book that bears upon every page the mark of patient first-hand investigation .

		It is evident that the author has read the books about which he writes , and that even when he does no more than set down in a biief paragraph the con - ventional estimate of an author , he has arrived at this conclusion by a process of independent judg - ment .

		His criticism , in its relation to its predeces - sors , seems to have for an aim the reduction of all overwrought or exaggerated views to a common basis of sober objective appraisal .

		If a writer has been overvalued in the past , Mr.
Trent	PERSON	is careful to show in what respects the excessive estimate needs qualification ; if a writer has not received his due , on the other hand , there is a reasoned attempt to correct the past injustice .

		This determination to be absolutely fair , to view a writer in every possible light , is a marked characteristic of Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's woik .

		It frequently involves a nice balanc - ing of conflicting opinions , and in the process of leveling up or down , as the case may be , so many qualifications are admitted that we do not get the sharp portraiture given us by other critics , and there are moments when we almost wish that the author would indulge in a little dogmatism at the expense of caution .

		One important feature of the book results from the fact that Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's scholar - ship in American history is almost on a par with his knowledge of our literature .

		He is thus enabled at every point to bring the book into its proper rela - tions with the period which produced it , and in this respect his treatment of the subject has a marked superiority over the best that we have had hereto - fore .

		Compared with the other volumes of the series to which it belongs , the present work is upon a much larger scale than any of its associated dis - cussions .

		It has nearly fifty per cent more matter than any of the others , although it deals with a literature which can boast of only one century of serious creative activity , and although it makes no attempt to deal with the
last third of that century	DATE	, but closes with the period of the Civil War .

		The volume is simply packed with names , titles , and historical facts , but all so deftly combined in run - ning text that every page proves readable .

		The frank and engaging style of the author is pieced out , though sparingly , with apt quotations and illus - trations , and the author 's wide literary allusiveness adds not a little to his charm .

		Nothing could well be happier , for example , than to call the `` Magnalia Christi '' '' a colossal boulder left behind by the re - treating glacier of Calvinism '' ; nothing could be more just than to say of • ' The Federalist '' that '' no praise can be too high that does not , like some American praise for it , lift it into comparison with compositions not in its class . ''

		The fertile valleys of
Egypt	LOCATION	and SjS ^ T 1 '
Babylonia	LOCATION	have produced many kinds of historical fruit during the last half-century .

		Out of their tumuli , tombs , and terraces , we have extracted centuries of history , scores of magical formulae , and volumes of religious beliefs .

		Professor
Sayce of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	has been a pioneer in this work .

		In
1887	DATE	he delivered the
Hibbert	PERSON	lectures , on the religion of
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		He has just now published the
Gilford Lectures	ORGANIZATION	, de - livered in
Aberdeen	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, on '' The Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian Conception of the Divine '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Fifteen years have wrought wonders in our conception of ancient civilization and beliefs .

		This volume is a long step in advance of that of
1887	DATE	.

		Here we find Professor Sayce at his best .

		Always a pioneer in archaeological research , he happily combines clearness of statement with breadth and depth of scholarship .

		This volume strikes out more positively than any other into some new lines of thought .

		The religions of both
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Babylonia	LOCATION	are composites .

		That of
Egypt	LOCATION	is a fusion of the beliefs of the Semitic conquerors of
Egypt	LOCATION	and the non - Semitic or possibly Libyan ab - origines .

		The Babylonian religion is a fusion of the primitive Sumerian beliefs and those of the conquering Semitic peoples .

		Professor Sayce main - tains the identity of the conquering Semitic popula - tion of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and the dynastic Egyptians -- both Semites with common customs and beliefs .

		He goes farther , and attempts to separate the elements contributed by each of these elemental peoples .

		This is a hazardous task , in view of the fragmentary character of the material already discovered and available .

		Professor
Sayce	PERSON	's discussion of the prim - itive animism and of the later pantheons of those ancient peoples is replete with carefully gleaned facts .

		The entire volume is both attractive in style and full of interesting and instructive material .

		This is the best work , from several points of view , that Professor
Sayce	PERSON	has ever written . ''

		An Introductory Study of Ethics '' 22
# # ELa	MONEY	-LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.

		Mr.
Fite	PERSON	protests against the assumption of certain writers that the ethical problem is one of no practical importance .

		Granted that opinion is practically unanimous in declaring certain element - ary lines of conduct to be right , and certain others 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, wrong , it is nevertheless true that the very terms in which we state these principles are far from being exactly defined , and thus `` this practical unanimity is largely illusory . ''

		Moreover , the ethical field abounds in problems that are too complicated to be referred with confidence to any one principle , and thereby definitely solved .

		The author passes in review , and subjects to close analysis , first the various forms of utilitarian or hedonistic ethics , then the opposed forms of the system to which the general designation of idealism may be given .

		His own leanings are clearly toward the ethics of idealism , but he also recognizes the value of hedonism as a basis of right conduct , and in the end seeks a middle course , the establishment of a modus vivendi between the two schools , or perhaps the reconciliation of the opposing themes in a broader synthesis than has yet been achieved .

		He offers a novelty in his attempt to show that the hedonist must accept the Lamarckian view of biological evolution , while the idealist is bound to be a partisan of the doctrine of
Herr Weissmann	PERSON	.

		But we are unable to see that he makes his point .

		And his argument does not shake us in the opinion that it is perfectly possible to believe at the same time in the ethics of principle or of purpose and in the transmission of acquired characteristics .

		Mr.
Fite	PERSON	's references throughout the work are almost exclusively to English thinkers , and thus his book has too narrow a range .

		The Kantian view , in - deed , is discussed at length , but no other Germans are mentioned , save for an occasional allusion to
Paulsen	PERSON	and Wundt .

		We recommend to the au - thor particularly a careful study of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, whose ethical theory can not possibly be ignored .

		And among English writers , the author would have been especially well-advised had he taken into ac - count Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's essay '' On Compromise , '' which bears directly upon the very questions of practical conduct always to the fore in the present volume .

		A study of The fourth volume in the '' Popular the French Library of Art '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is an impresrionisu .

		attractive little book on the Freneh Impressionists , by
M. Camille Mauclair	PERSON	.

		He has attempted , he tells us , '' to sum up the ideas , per - sonalities , and works of a group of artists who have remained but little known and who have been greatly misjudged . ''

		The book is especially ad - dressed to the `` British Public '' ; perhaps the au - thor considers such an appreciation less needed in
America	LOCATION	.

		His presentation is clear and sympa - thetic , avoiding alike the over - technical and the merely popular discussion of the subject .

		He takes the ground that no art manifestation is really isolated , and that the Impressionists were the legitimate de - scendents of
Ruysdael	ORGANIZATION	,
Lorraine	PERSON	, and
Poussin	LOCATION	.

		The author finds also in this school much that is related to the work of the Preraphaelites , though he regards the latter as bound together '' by intellectual prin - ciples ; the Impressionists , by temperament , friend - ship , and unjust derision . ''

		Of particular interest is the chapter on the theories of this group of paint - ers , which M. Mauclair sums up as follows : `` Study of atmosphere , dissociation of tones , study of char - acter rather than classic beauty , subordination of subject to interest of execution , movement toward ' symphonisation ' of colors . ''

		This discussion of the theory of Impressionism is followed by a study in detail of the work of its greatest exponents ,
Edouard Manet	PERSON	,
Degas	LOCATION	,
Claude Monet	PERSON	, and
Renoir	ORGANIZATION	; while the lesser painters of the school , and neo-impres - sionism , receive due attention .

		The many good en - gravings well illustrate this subject .

		These were made from photographs in the private gallery of
M. Durand-Ruel	PERSON	, to whom the author makes due acknowledgment .

		The translation , by Mr.
P. 6	PERSON	.

		Eonody , is in general carefully done , though show - ing a fondness for rare words and at times rendering the French idiom too literally .

		In example , '' since a long time '' and `` he revolted the prejudiced . ''

		But in spite of these and similar blemishes , the ren - dering is accurate and merits commendation .

		One of the most interesting phases Irlmce ` ndwtaium .

		of American literature is discussed and illustrated in Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	's anthology of '' The Poets of Transcenden - talism '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Few people realize how much poetry -LRB- of a kind -RRB- the movement produced , and it is only by ransacking '' The Dial '' and other peri - odicals of the time that an adequate showing of transcendental poetry can be made .

		This work of investigation Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	has performed , with the result that he has brought together in his interest - ing volume not only the well-known pieces of
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and a few others , but also a host of pieces deserving to be known , but not heretofore reprinted from the sources of their original publica - tion .

		No less than forty-two authors are repre - sented , a few of whom , however , hardly seem to us to have been sufficiently identified with the transcen - dental movement to warrant their inclusion .

		We can - not quite see , for example , what
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	and
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	are doing in this galley .

		It is only by a broad definition , which shall itself transcend geographical and social limitations , that these forty-two poets may be brought into the same category .

		Such a definition Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	has evi - dently adopted , and , indeed , he embodies it in his introduction when he calls transcendentalism '' de - mocracy in contact with Puritanism , '' and proceeds to indicate its connotations as inquiry , revolt , indi - viduality , inwardness , and optimism .

		We are glad to have this book , and glad to have the poems which it rescues for us from so many scattered quarters .

		international The enormous increase in the facili - probiems ties for transportation and in the ra - of disease .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 science of preventive medicine is unknown .

		The position which
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	holds as the foremost nation in colonization has given her exceptional re - sponsibilities and opportunities for dealing with the international problems of disease .

		It is therefore fitting that one volume of the
Cambridge Geograph	LOCATION	- ical Series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should be devoted to '' The Geography of Disease . ''

		The author , Dr.
Clemon	PERSON	, is a member of the
Ottoman Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	, and has had unusual opportunities for observation in
Russia	LOCATION	and the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The volume treats general medical and surgical diseases , those of the skin , and those caused by animal parasites , giving the history of each , with its recent geographical distribution , and discussing its relation to climatic factors -- such as latitude , temperature , altitude , and humidity -- to social conditions , to race , and to sex .

		The agencies and methods of distribution are set forth wherever known , or discussed with candor when judgment must still be suspended till research shall decide among conflicting opinions .

		Instructive maps and charts show the known distribution of the more important diseases .

		The author 's perspective is such that the Orient ,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, and British colonies everywhere , enter largely into his treat - ment ; while the
United States	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	are only casually mentioned , and some of their lead - ing authorities are overlooked .

		This , and the ab - sence of an index , are , however , only minor defects in an excellent treatise .

		`` A History of French Versification , '' fnVJr ^ i ^ ian .

		h J Mr - L - E -
Kastner	PERSON	, is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	for the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the same time we have from
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in their series of '' En - glish Readings , '' a work on '' English Verse '' by Dr.
Raymond Macdonald Alden	PERSON	.

		Both these works undertake , in their respective fields , to do much the same thing .

		They survey the whole history of verse in French and English , discuss the chief technical questions of metrical theory , classify the many poetic forms , and are at every point illustrated by a bewildering array of carefully-chosen examples .

		These examples are in themselves so interesting , that in reading the books we have been constantly tempted to ignore their real purpose for the sake of the simple enjoyment they afford as anthologies of two great poetic literatures .

		Every reader will miss some of his own favorite illustrations , no doubt -LRB- in the case of the French book the absence of Baudelaire is inexplicable -RRB- , but will probably find compensation in many unfamiliar citations of great interest .

		Both books give us forms from the ear - liest literature as well as from the latest , and Dr.
Alden	PERSON	often finds it necessary to offset his English examples by their French prototypes .

		Both books are productions of wide and accurate scholarship , and are deserving of very high praise .

		Both au - thors lean heavily upon the Germans , Mr.
Kastner	PERSON	uponTobler 's `` Versbau , '' Dr.
Alden	PERSON	upon
Schipper	PERSON	's '' Englische Metrik . ''

		The Appleton series of '' Historic
William Johnson	PERSON	, the colonial In - dian commissioner for
America	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Augustus C. Buell	PERSON	.

		The well-balanced biography begins with the arrival of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	, at twenty-two years of age , to take control of a large tract of land lying in the
Mohawk Valley	LOCATION	belonging to his uncle , Sir
Peter Warren	PERSON	.

		Coming into contact with the Indians at this advanced point on the border , he early inaugu - rated a policy of just dealing with the savages wjrich won them to him by contrast with the tricks used by the ordinary trader of the Valley . ''

		He found time , '' says the sketch here presented , `` to learn to a degree never surpassed , and seldom if ever equalled by any white man , the character , ways , manner , modes of thinking , and the language of the Iroquois Indians . ''

		As proof of this , it is stated that he never made use of an interpreter even in the important proceedings of an Indian conference .

		Johnson 's numerous Indian wives and half-breed children , for which the agent is usually condemned , are here excused because the departure from social custom may have been done to bring him influence and esteem from his savage brethren .

		Incidentally , the volume treats of the struggle between the French and British for the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, the contact of the white men with the savages , and the various wars in which the Indians were engaged prior to the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Arnold 's march The courage of
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	, / rom
Cambridge	LOCATION	plunging with his Canadian expe - to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		dition into the wilderness between the
Maine	LOCATION	coast and
Quebec	LOCATION	, has frequently been praised , the endurance of his men eulogized , and the purpose and failure of the unfortunate attempt commented on .

		The exact route
Arnold	PERSON	took through the wilderness has never been fully deter - mined .

		It therefore remained for Professor
Justin H. Smyth	PERSON	to investigate the matter thoroughly , and then to write his account of ''
Arnold	PERSON	's
March	DATE	from
Cambridge	LOCATION	to
Quebec	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The materials for the investigation are found in old maps and in diaries kept on the expedition .

		Arnold 's is the chief of these , '' the one extant journal that has never been printed in full till now . ''

		It is from the
Sparks	PERSON	copy in the
Harvard	LOCATION	library .

		The book is confined closely to the subject , omitting all details foreign to the purpose of ascertaining the exact route traversed , and closing abruptly with the ar - rival of the expedition on the north shore of the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	near
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		An exhaustive set of explanatory notes includes Arnold 's diary men - tioned above .

		Professor
Jesse Benedict Carter	PERSON	has edited as a '' Twentieth Century Text - Book '' for the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	, the first six books of the `` JEueid . ''

		The volume has introduction , notes , vocabulary , and many attractive full-page illustrations , including a colored frontispiece from a mosaic discovered in
Africa	LOCATION	only a few years ago .

		Reading a Poem , '' a charming and hitherto rather inaccessible bit of
Thackerayana	LOCATION	, will be published shortly in an attractive limited edition by the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last book of the late
Paul Du Chaillu	PERSON	is an ac - count of adventures in the Dark Continent where he won his first fame .

		The title is '' In African Forest and Jungle , '' and it will be published by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	at the end of the present month .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	will publish this month Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Proud Prince . ''

		A few days after its publication in book form the play made from the story by Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	will be presented by
Daniel Frohman	PERSON	on the stage , with Mr.
E. H. Sothern	PERSON	in the title role .

		In view of the discussion , on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, of the project to bring
Wagner	PERSON	's opera '' Parsifal '' to
New York	LOCATION	, the announcement of a new poetic English version of this text is timely .

		It is from the pen of
Oliver Huckel	PERSON	, of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, who has had special advantages in studying the opera at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the volume .

		Miss
Margaret Horton Potter	PERSON	's '' The Castle of Twi - light , ''
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's leading novel of the season , is especially notable for the attractiveness of its outward appearance .

		In cover-design , end-papers , and initials , a consistent and distinctive decorative treat - ment has been followed , and the illustrations -LRB- made by Miss
Charlotte Weber	PERSON	, a young
New York	LOCATION	artist -RRB- are of striking originality .

		Mr.
Charles Josselyn	PERSON	, author of '' The True
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , '' has in press for early publication by
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a collection of interesting and in - structive selections from famous authors , entitled '' My Favorite Book Shelf . ''

		Unlike the usual book of quota - tions , this volume includes passages of readable length so chosen and arranged in many cases as to epitomize the messages of the voluminous originals .

		``
London	LOCATION	in the Time of the Stuarts '' is the title of the new book by the late Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish in the autumn .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	undertook an important work in several volumes which were to be called collectively '' The Survey of
London	LOCATION	. ''

		The first volume in the series , ''
London	LOCATION	in the Eigh - teenth Century , '' appeared
last winter	DATE	, and it is ex - pected that the third volume will be published next year .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have undertaken the American publication of a new series of English re - prints of old-time favorites . ''

		Doctor Syntax '' and ''
Mytton	PERSON	's Memoirs '' are the two volumes first pub - lished , and they are made very attractive by the re - production of all the original illustrations , which in both these cases are colored .


Blake	PERSON	's Illustrations of Job ,
Ainsworth	PERSON	's '' Windsor Castle , '' and
Bewick	PERSON	's fables , are among the issues soon to follow .

		With the
September	DATE	issue '' The Printing Art '' en - ters upon its second volume , having achieved during the half-year of its existence a success not often scored by any new periodical .

		The appeal of this magazine is not alone to the practical printer ; its interest is no less vital to book lovers and those who are but indirectly concerned with the making of books .

		By the sound - ness of its teachings and the example of its mechanical beauty , '' The Printing Art '' bids fair to do more to raise the standards of American typographic taste than any other force now at work .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who are now bringing out the '' National '' edition of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	's works in eighteen volumes , to be sold only by subscription , will publish in the Fall a book of
Webster	PERSON	's best speeches entitled ''
Daniel Webster	PERSON	for Young Americans . ''

		This book will contain , in addition to the important speeches by the great statesman , an introduction and notes by Prof.
Chas	PERSON	.


F. Richardson	PERSON	of
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	and an essay on
Webster	PERSON	as a master of English style by
Edwin P. Whipple	PERSON	.

		Better things than usually emanate from American '' private presses '' may confidently be expected of the '' Village Press , '' lately established at
Park Ridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, by Messrs.
F. W. Goudy	PERSON	and
W. H. Ransom	PERSON	.

		Both proprietors have had practical experience in the printing craft , and Mr.
Goudy	PERSON	is in addition a decora - tive artist of ability and reputation .

		The first pro- duction of the press will be a reprint of the essay on '' Printing '' by
William Morris	PERSON	and
Emery Walker	PERSON	, from the volume of '' Arts and Crafts Essays . ''

		The next work in the series of notable Americana in - augurated by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	last Fall with a reprint of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark Journals	ORGANIZATION	, will be an edition of Father Louis Hennepin 's '' A New Discovery , '' based on the second issue of
1698	DATE	, and edited by Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	.

		Besides the regular library edition in two octavo volumes , there will be a limited edition on hand - made paper which from a typographical point of view will probably form the most attractive historical reprint yet put forth by an American pub - lisher .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	has just acquired a series of drawings on wood made by
George Cruikshank	PERSON	nearly fifty years ago to illustrate '' The Pilgrim 's Progress . ''

		These drawings have never yet been published , and they will form the chief feature of an edition de luxe of
Bunyan	PERSON	's masterpiece which will be issued from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	in the autumn .

		Some of the drawings were cut on wood under the artist 's own di - rection , and the others have now been similarly pre - pared , and each is to be printed as a separate plate on Japanese paper .

		For upwards of thirty years these drawings have been in the possession of a well-known collector , who was a friend of
Cruikshank	ORGANIZATION	, and they are thoroughly characteristic of the artist 's genius .

		Some interesting additions will be made during the coming Fall and
Winter	DATE	to the limited ''
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	editions '' published under the imprint of
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes so far an - nounced comprise a work by Mrs.
Elizabeth Robins Penuell	PERSON	entitled `` My Cookery Books , '' illustrated with numerous reproductions of old engravings and titles ; '' The History of
Oliver	PERSON	and
Arthur	PERSON	, '' a mediaeval Latin romance translated into English by
William Leighton	PERSON	and
Eliza Barrett	PERSON	, illustrated with fifty engravings re - drawn from the old wood-cuts that appeared in the original ; '' Fifteen Sonnets of Petrarch , '' selected and translated by Mr.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	; and the third and concluding volume of the sumptuous folio reprint of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's Essays .

		THE DIAL 179 Announcements of Fall Books .

		The Dial 's list of the books announced for publica - tion this Fall , presented herewith , is as usual the earli - est comprehensive and classified information given to the public regarding the important forthcoming books of the present season .

		Entry is here made of more than twelve hundred titles , representing the season 's output of over fifty leading American publishers .

		The list has been prepared entirely from advance informa - tion secured especially for this purpose .

		All the books entered are presumably new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and , with a few necessary exceptions , the list does not in - clude Fall books already issued and entered in our reg - ular List of New Books .

		While no attempt has been made to include titles as titles merely , regardless of their significance or interest to our readers , yet it is believed that no really important title is missing from this list .

		One important exception must be noted , -- the books to be issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, whose list , always of much interest , unfortunately reached us too late for insertion here .

		The announcements of this firm will , however , be given in our next issue .

		Some of the more interesting features of the present list are commented on in the leading editorial in this issue of The Dial .

		OUR CRITICAL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS Since the literature produced in this country is only a part , and a small part at that , of the whole body of English literature , it is inevi - table that its relations to the literature of the mother-country should be constantly before the mind of its historian .

		But although always present in the consciousness , it does not seem either necessary or desirable that these rela - tions should be all the time pressed forward in the discussion ; it would be better to acknowl - edge them frankly once for all , and then leave them to be taken as implicit in the history , bringing them into prominence only when some case of real analogy or contrast arises .

		Instead of seeking for points of contact which are not obvious , and of forcing comparisons for their own sake , we would do well to drink out of our own glass , and be content for the time being with our refreshment .

		The centuries of En - glish literature from
Caedmon	LOCATION	to
Tennyson	LOCATION	are there in the background , no doubt , but we do not need to invoke them all the time for the ex - planation or the criticism of every production that happens for the moment to occupy the foreground of our attention .

		American critics have now been writing about American literature for something like a hundred years , and their work has been characterized , as a rule , by an exaggerated consciousness of the existence of the parent literature on the other side of the ocean .

		It is true , of course , that no literary phenomenon may be adequately discussed without taking account of all its bearings , historical and ideal , but this is a very different matter from the habit of thought with which we are now concerned .

		That habit has for its distinctive feature a sort of intellectual uneasiness , born of the fear that somehow , unless we dot all our i 's and cross all our t 's , we may be cheated out of something that is our due .

		Now there is an uneasiness of servility , and another of boastfulness , and another betokened by the apologetic attitude , and yet another bound up with a chastened but still vigorous self-esteem .

		And our national at - titude toward our own literature , as evidenced by the writings of our critics and historians , has been marked successively by these four types 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, of the uneasy feeling that we are not appre - ciated quite in accordance with our deserts .

		Let us take them one at a time , and explain just what we mean .

		During the first decades of the nineteenth century the attitude of our writers toward their English brethren was one of self-abasement .

		English models were every - where set up for imitation and English praise was the only praise worth having .

		This is the attitude satirized by
Lowell	PERSON	when he wrote : '' In private we 're always embracing the knees Of some two-penny editor over the seas , And licking his critical shoes , for you know 't is The whole aim of our lives to get one English notice ; My American puffs I would willingly burn all -LRB- They 're all from one source , monthly , weekly , diurnal -RRB- To get but a kick from a transmarine journal . ''

		This craving for notice on any terms clearly shows the uneasiness of one who fears lest his light be hidden under a bushel , of one who is willing to endure `` the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes '' rather than not receive any attention at all .

		That the boaster is a person uneasy in his mind is proverbial , and boastfulness has been one of our national vices for over a century , marking more clearly than anything else our persistence in provincialism .

		Even
Lowell	PERSON	, in his earlier period , blew the American trumpet too blaringly to be in the best of taste , and the spirit which , two hundred years before , had styled Mistress
Anne Bradstreet	PERSON	'' the tenth muse , lately sprung up in
America	LOCATION	, '' was dis - played unabashed by many of the earlier of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries .

		Every goose was a swan in those days , and our periodical press bestowed resounding praise upon all kinds of ephemeral scribblers .

		It was the special delight of
Poe	PERSON	, who happened to be about during the thirties and forties , to prick these bubble rep - utations , and this negative activity is no small part of his service to our criticism .

		It put an end to vaunting of the cruder sort , at least , and prepared the way for something like na - tional judgment of books and their writers .

		The third phase of sensitive uneasiness about our literary status has for its note
Touchstone	ORGANIZATION	's description of Audrey : `` A poor thing , but mine own . ''

		It is represented by those critics who freely admit that
Cooper	PERSON	was not a
Scott	PERSON	, that
Irving	PERSON	was not a Lamb , and that Long - fellow was not a
Tennyson	LOCATION	, but who at the same time insist that these men and their com - peers , being of our own flesh and blood , and embodying the traits of our own national char - acter , are for us even more significant than their greater English contemporaries .

		These apologists exalt the importance of the relative at the expense of the absolute in judgment , and thus seek to restore the national self-re - spect by a logical quibble .

		There is a certain validity in this argument , for we naturally love the men whose writings make so intimate an appeal to our sympathies , and there is no cause for shame in the confession of our affec - tion .

		But it is possible to make overmuch of the matter ; its very obviousness to our own consciousness makes unnecessary any very lav - ish use of words to set it forth , and our over - insistence upon it betokens a trifle too much of anxiety to force our English brethren into our own way of thinking about American lit - erature .

		It was
Heine	PERSON	who once wickedly re - marked that a woman writer always has one eye on her subject and the other on some man , and we fancy that it is with one eye to the Britisher that many an American critic of this apologetic type has thus praised the work of his fellow-countrymen .

		The fourth and last phase of our uneasy self - consciousness concerning the national lit - erature comes very near to bridging over the gap between the provincial and the cosmopol - itan outlook , and marking the transition from the relative view to the absolute .

		It takes the form of some such expression of opinion as the following : `` In our desire to be just we have perhaps overshot the mark and made greater concessions than were necessary ; com - ing to look at it candidly , and with a full re - cognition of the legitimate demands of literary art , this work is not so bad after all , and there is no reason why we should apologize for it . ''

		Now the attitude thus summarized is one suf - ficiently justified by the evident achievements of American literature , and no fault is to be found with it as an attitude .

		It represents the point of view of the self-respecting critic , neither unduly subservient to alien standards and influences , nor asserting an unwarranted prerogative of independent judgment .

		But it is possible to force the note overmuch , to make too explicit what had better have been left im - plicit , and thus to betray in a subtle form the very uneasiness , the very self - consciousness which has with so much effort been so nearly eliminated from our appraisement of our own literature .

		In the last and best of the critical discus - sions to which American literature has been subjected there are frequent illustrations of the attitude which we have just characterized , and they prompt us by so much to take exception
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 to a critical performance which is in most re - spects entitled to unqualified praise .

		We are told of Franklin that he was M the most com - plete representative of his century that any nation can point to , ... yet ... he was the product of colonial dependencies on which the old world looked down . '

		; The essays of Mar - garet Fuller '' are much more deserving of praise and perusal than the latter-day public seems to think . ''

		Irving 's qualities '' fully war - rant his admirers in continuing to enjoy the four or five volumes in which his best work is contained , and in joining his name without apology to those of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and Lamb . ''

		Since such essays as those of Curtis ** are not abundant in American literature , there is no reason for the readers of to-day to be super - cilious with regard to them . ''

		In these and many similar passages the author seems to us to protest too much , to touch a note that were better left unsounded .

		This guarded way of calling attention to our own merits is as far as possible removed from the blustering self-as - sertion and the mutual-admiration methods that aroused
Poe	PERSON	's ire in the earlier days of our let - ters , but we can not quite reconcile it with the highest ideal of critical conduct .

		That ideal will no doubt long remain a coun - sel of perfection for the American critic deal - ing with the literature of his own people .

		It is wellnigh impossible that it should be other - wise , for as long as criticism is a matter of judgment -- and it can never escape being that -- it must invoke comparisons and resort to illustrative parallels .

		Particularly must this be the case with criticism of a literature which is only the offshoot and collateral development of another and far more important literature .

		And the treatment thus forced upon it by circumstances will inevitably lead to such bal - ancings as
Emerson	LOCATION	against
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	against
Burns	PERSON	, and
Bryant	PERSON	against Words - worth .

		Xor will it be surprising if , whenever the inclination of the balance appears uncer - tain , the critic 's word shall be cast into the scale in such wise as to give his compatriot the benefit of the doubt .

		However fully we may take to heart the injunction of the American declaration of intellectual independence , as voiced in
Emerson	LOCATION	's '' American Scholar , '' to walk on our own feet , to work with our own hands , and to speak our own minds , we shall be likely for long years to come to keep on reminding each other and the rest of mankind that we are walking , and working , and speak - ing to some purpose .

		SHAKESPEARE 'S HEIR .

		It is a matter for poignant regret , that the great poet of our Northern races never came into the fall inheritance of his estate .

		He might almost be com - pared to
Aladdin	LOCATION	, who , with the Wonderful Lamp in his possession , pawned piecemeal , to keep himself from starvation , the silver dishes brought him by the genie on the first trial of his talisman .

		Most of the tragic themes to which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was driven , by the ignorance of his age as to its origins and mighty past , are certainly inferior .

		They are his - torical , and the long series on English subjects are not even great history .

		It is true that , stirred by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's breath , lit by the splendor of his im - agination and the lambent play of his humor , they live and thrive in literature ; but this does not alter the fact that they have not the looming largeness , the metaphysical profundity , of subjects drawn from mythic sources .

		The Roman tragedies deal with world figures ; but there is a stiffening and formalizing tendency in the Latin character which even
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not wholly escape .

		In the three tragedies and one romance where
Shakespeare	PERSON	did seize on myths and legends of his own race , -- in
Lear	LOCATION	,
Macbeth	LOCATION	,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and Cymbeline , -- he rises to the highest heaven of poetic creation .

		What would he not have done had there lain open to his hand the themes of Scandinavian mythology , the Celtic legends and folk-lore , the cycles of Arthurian and Charlemagnic romance ?

		For myself , I feel so strongly that he should have handled all this ma - terial , that I let my fancy run riot as to the char - acter of his versions , as I do about the lost tragedies of i # * chylu8 .

		Possibly that chest of papers which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's daughter is said to have burned after his death contained a Wotan , an Ossian , an
Arthur	PERSON	, or a
Roland	LOCATION	.

		iEschylus described his works as crumbs from the banquet of Homer ; and in an - other way Shakespeare too had to make the most of crumbs , while later poets of his language or lineage have been seated at the full , many-course banquet of the myths and traditions of our
Northern World	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
Little Edda	PERSON	, there is a story about
Wotan	PERSON	, who in one of his wanderings comes to the home of certain giants and is challenged to a test of prowess .

		One of the feats he has to perform is to empty a mighty drinking-horn in three draughts .

		He makes the attempt , but only slightly lowers the level of the liquid in the vessel .

		His hosts taunt him with failure ; but afterwards acknowledge that he per - formed a feat which made their bones freeze within them .

		For the drinking-horn contained nothing less than the ocean , which
Wotan	ORGANIZATION	's draughts had visibly shrunk and ebbed within its shores .

		The modern English poets who have drunk of the foun - tain of mythic lore have not done so much as this .

		Tennyson comes off best , with his recast of the Arthurian legend ; but this poem , pat as it is with the peculiarities and prejudices of his own time , shows but a doubtful promise of immortality .

		Swin - burne , and
Morris	PERSON	, and Arnold have followed him , -- 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, have written noble poems on themes of Northern eld , none of which , however , has imposed itself on the world , has become necessary to the thinking of civilized humanity .

		Yet the thing has been done , -- done , as it were , by accident , done as a by-product of another form of art , -- done by
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		That
Wagner	PERSON	's dramas have not been widely recognized as great works of literature is due partly to his own un - consciousness of their merit -LRB- though he said of The Ring when finished that it was the greatest poem ever written -RRB- , partly to his preoccupation with the musical side of his adventure , partly to the dust which this music has stirred up .

		In the cloud and confusion of the world-wide battle over the Music of the Future , the plays have in a measure been lost sight of , or have been thrust aside as mere libretti of no more importance or significance than the lyric books of other operas .

		Yet
Wagner	PERSON	's own critical attitude was widely dif - ferent from this .

		He called music the bride of the masculine verse , and insisted in many volumes of prose polemic that the play was the thing , -- that music was merely an interpreter of the creative part of his work , -- that its business was only to follow and wait upon and help and adorn the drama .

		That the instinct of mankind dimly perceives this , I believe to be the case .

		What makes the popu - larity of the Wagnerian opera ?

		The music ?

		I doubt it .


M. Lavignac	PERSON	, a trained student of Wag - ner 's music , who has written a book about it , con - fesses that , after all his familiarity with the other operas , on hearing Tristan for the first time he understood nothing at all ; nothing -- absolutely nothing .

		Well , then , how is it possible for an ordi - nary human being with no especial knowledge of music to understand at the first or twentieth time
Wagner	PERSON	's new system of organized sound ?

		But he can and does appreciate readily enough the mighty action , the splendid passion , the humanity , and the pictures of the plays .

		Of course I do not wish to say that the music may not have some effect on the average listener as well as upon the trained musician .

		But the main things which attract are the dramatic skill , the literary art , and the crea - tive power of the plays .

		Possibly in time the music may fall away from them , as it has fallen away from the tragedies of ^ Eschylus and his com - peers ; but the dramas will remain , colossal and beautiful , -- the greatest , I think , that have ap - peared since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's hand was stilled .

		Poetry deals with emotions , actions , ideas , and images .

		Music deals with emotions alone , or with something less definite than emotions , -- those sen - suous or sub-sensuous affections which lie at the root of our being .

		Music can sway us powerfully , of course ; but it is neither so coherent nor so rememberable as poetry .

		It may be doubted whether
Wagner	PERSON	's music , however much it might have in - fluenced musicians and their art , would ever have got much hold on the hearts or minds of mankind .

		But his ideas and images , his varied human figures in their scenic settings , are the property to-day of millions of people , -- mind-furniture not to be set aside or forgotten .


Wagner	PERSON	's dramas break up into two great groups : the legendary one , including Tannhauser ,
Lohen	PERSON	- grin , Tristan , and Parsifal , and the mythical one of
The Nibelung	ORGANIZATION	's Ring .

		As prologue to these there is the brief piece of sombre fire , The Flying Dutchman , and as epilogue or interlude the sunny comedy of Die Meistersinger .

		Here are ten crown-jewels of Literature which Music has been playing with for many years as if they were cheap pebbles or common pieces of glass .

		In The Flying Dutchman
Wagner	PERSON	struck full almost every note in the compass of his literary genius .

		Here is the visuality with which he al - ways projects his figures , his marvellous contrast of light and shade , his sense of the value of remote backgrounds , his terseness of words and hurricane swirl of emotion .

		It is hardly more than a sketch ; but what vigor there is in the opening scene !

		what charm and naturalness in the spinning one !

		what power in the contrast between the liveliness of
Daland	LOCATION	's crew and the sinister silence of the Dutch - man 's ship .

		Considered as a piece of literary art , one has to make allowance here , as in the other plays , for those lacunae which are filled in by the music .

		Reading it is a little like striding in seven - league boots over the peaks and ridges of a moun - tainous country .

		The swiftness with which the Dutchman demands a home and wife , and the sud - denness of the catastrophe , are real flaws .

		Wagner owed something to
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's sketch of the legend ; but almost everything that makes the piece valu - able in a dramatic way is his own , -- particularly the pathetic figure of the inspired and doom-devoted
Senta	PERSON	.

		What variety there is in the four legendary dramas !

		What piling up of pictorial effects !

		What figures of passion and power !

		As was said of Chaucer , '' Here is God 's plenty . ''

		Wagner well understood that in literature , as in war , one can not have an omelette without breaking eggs .

		He went through his whole career breaking eggs by the hand - ful .

		He shrank from no subject that would give him great dramatic effects .

		It was no timid poet who brought
Venus	PERSON	and her bacchantes on the stage in
Tannhauser	LOCATION	.

		The whole play is a struggle be - tween sacred and profane Love .

		Wagner under - stood also , extremely well , one essential part of a dramatic poet 's conduct of his plot , -- the contrast , that is , of masses with the central figures , the bring - ing to bear of varied interests on the main action .

		The singing contest at the
Castle of Wartburg	ORGANIZATION	is an instance of this ; and
Wagner	PERSON	repeated the same inci - dent in a comic way in Die Meistersinger .

		The crews and maidens of The Flying Dutchman , the Rhine girls and Valkyrs of the Ring , and the Knights of the Holy Grail in
Parsifal	LOCATION	, are other examples .


Wagner	PERSON	's real superiority over most modern poets in terseness of form and visuality of presen - tation comes out in a comparison of his two plays
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 touching on the Holy Grail with
Tennyson	PERSON	's
Arthur	PERSON	- ian epic .

		Tennyson , by dint of immense detail and labored literary art , has projected some pictures which live in the mind .

		Elaine floating down the river ,
Merlin	PERSON	's enchantment by
Vivien	PERSON	, the abase - ment of Guinevere , and
Arthur	PERSON	's death , -- these are vivid indeed ; yet I think they fail beside com - panion pictures from
Wagner	PERSON	, -- the advent and departure of the Hero of the Swan , the struggle be - tween
Lohengrin	LOCATION	and
Elsa	PERSON	in their chamber with the black shadow of Ortrud below the balcony , Parsifal resisting the advances of Kundry in the gardens of Elingsor , the Restoration of the
Holy Lance	ORGANIZATION	to the castle of
Titurel	ORGANIZATION	.

		In Parsifal , in - deed ,
Wagner	PERSON	has wrought a work of such wonder - ful sensuous richness and such profound spiritual implications as would alone suffice to place him with the immortals .

		Kundry is a figure such as Shakespeare alone , of all the masters , could have conceived and executed ; and Ortrud , in
Lohen	LOCATION	- grin , is one of the most magnificent studies of evil in modern literature .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in one of his letters , comments on hearing Tristan and Isolde , and says that it is very well , but that he prefers his own version .

		His poem is dignified and pathetic , but it is a gentle zephyr compared to
Wagner	PERSON	's whirlwind in verse .

		Yet this is a monotone ; and if it is a second
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, as has been claimed , it is a much slighter thing , and lacks both the naturalness and intoxi - cating richness of that supreme love-poem .

		In treating Die Meistersinger as comedy , one must premise that German comedy really differs from the French and English types .

		Lessing 's
Minna von Barnhelm	PERSON	approximates to the refined and concentrated comedy of those nations ; but the real German type of comedy is the scene in
Auer	PERSON	- bach 's cellar in
Faust	LOCATION	.

		Here is simply a broad picture of low life , with no complication of intrigue and no especial sharpness of situation .


Wallen	PERSON	- stein 's Lager is of this genus , and the whole of
Wagner	PERSON	's play answers to it .

		To reproach it , there - fore , for simplicity of situation , would be useless .

		It gives , as it was intended to do , a perfect picture of bustling human life in an old German town ; and the figures of
Hans Sachs	PERSON	,
Pogner	ORGANIZATION	, and Beckmesser stand out as vivid as reality .

		They are a true ad - dition to the world 's repertoire of comic creations .

		The opening scene , where
Eva	PERSON	sends
Magdalena	PERSON	for her handkerchief and brooch , and the faithful servant obligingly forgets her own prayer-book in order to prolong the lover 's interview , is as charm - ing and naive as anything in
Goethe	LOCATION	.

		And now I near my journey 's end , and see rising on the horizon a long range of glittering and collateral peaks -- the linked but separated dramas of The Ring .

		In The Rheingold , the whole thesis of the work is set forth with baleful presage .

		It is surely as strange a piece as ever dramatist dreamed , but despaired , of having set upon the stage .

		Even
Wagner	PERSON	, the great master of scenic daring , never imagined anything more amazing yet enchanting than the opening scene of the Rhine maidens disporting in their element .

		Die Walkilre is , I suppose , on the whole the world 's favorite Wagnerian drama ; and well it deserves to be so .

		Is there anywhere else such a succession of lovely or magnificent pictures , such a hurry and clash of impetuous action , such a display of high-thoughted nobility of womanly character ?

		Think of the hut , with the ash-tree growing up through its midst ; the entrance of the hunted man ; the compassion of the woman ; the collision of the enemies .

		Think of the love-scene , with the
May	DATE	moonlight showing through the open door .

		Then comes the dispute between the god and goddess over the lovers ;
Brtionhilde	ORGANIZATION	's errand ; the fight between
Hunding	LOCATION	and
Siegmund	PERSON	, and
Briinnhilde	ORGANIZATION	's revolt .

		Lastly ,
Briinnhilde	ORGANIZATION	's flight with
Sieglinde	PERSON	; the gath - ering of the Valkyrs ;
Wotan	ORGANIZATION	's approach on the storm ; his rage and broken-hearted despair ; his ban upon
Biiiunhilde	PERSON	; his placing her sleeping on the rock , clothed in her armor , covered by her shield and enclosed in the raging ring of fire .

		What variety !

		What vigor !

		What charm of invention and execution !

		Die Walkilre is
Brunnhilde	LOCATION	's play .

		In Siegfried , that hero holds the stage throughout , and is drawn with a freshness and power hardly equalled outside of Homer and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is the northern Achilles , ruder and more primeval than the Greek , but equally heroic , equally human .

		The play has in it all the forest romance of
Germany	LOCATION	, the myste - rious lights and shadows of the Smithy in the woods ; the lair of the dragon , the magic whisper - ings of the birds .

		The scene at the end , when
Siegfried	PERSON	drives through the ring of fire , cuts
Biunnhilde	ORGANIZATION	's armor and awakes a being new in kind to him , is , in long-drawn beauty , splendor , and nobility the loftiest love-scene in literature .

		Even Shakespeare , I think , must give place here .

		And the consummating kiss of that incomparable pair ,
Siegfried	PERSON	and Briinnhilde , is the object and anticipated moment of the whole Ring .

		After this climax , one must expect a falling off in power and interest .

		The Gotterdammerung is , I believe , accounted musically one of the greatest of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Structurally , and as a poem , it is a failure .

		Partly this is due to the fact that here the Icelandic sagas which
Wagner	PERSON	has been following come into competition with the
Nieb	ORGANIZATION	- elungenlied .

		Up to this point , the older myths have an infinite superiority in poetry , significance , and mystic presage ; but as the catastrophe ap - proaches , the Niebelungenlied takes up the story with far more tremendous human power .

		Chriemhilde and
Hagen	PERSON	, like two towering pillars of cyclonic storm , move over the vast areas of the poem ; as they approach each other , there comes an appalling hush in the air ; they clash , and the earth is deluged with a red rain .

		Compared to the horror and splen - dor of the struggle in
Etzel	LOCATION	's hall ,
Wagner	PERSON	's trag - edy is only the domestic misadventures of a fam - ily in good circumstances in mediaeval
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Partly , I think , the structural failure of the piece is 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, due to
Wagner	PERSON	himself .

		The mere operatic vision , dragged in at the end of the burning
Walhalla	LOCATION	, is not enough .

		For
Wotan	ORGANIZATION	is really the hero of the whole Ring -- the Hamlet of the piece .

		It is he who binds together the scattered threads of the drama .

		It is the All - Father 's weakness in paltering with the base elements of life , that wakes the Furies , that brings the tragic issues into action .

		The most pathetic , and , after the closing scene of Siegfried , the noblest scene in the work is that in which he condemns and punishes his dearest daughter ,
Brunnhilde	LOCATION	, for doing what he , in secret , wished and inspired her to do .

		A third reason for the lagging of interest in this play is the change in the character of Bitlnnhilde .

		The legends demand it , -- the essential savagery of human nature de - mands it ; but oh , to lose our ideal of the perfect , gentle , fearless creature , -- the Wish Maiden who as an immortal was the protectress of Siegfried 's infancy , and who , when she put off her divinity , became his bride !

		If anyone desires to measure what
Wagner	PERSON	did with the
Niblung Saga	ORGANIZATION	, let him compare The Ring with the
Sigurd of William Morris	ORGANIZATION	.

		Morris was an accomplished versifier , and at times a poet of uncommon charm ; but set beside
Wagner	PERSON	's terse and burning web of words , where every figure is visualized with flaming distinctness , every scene set forth with the extremest definiteness of light and shade , every profound thought borne in upon the reader or spectator 's mind with awful force , -- compared with this ,
Morris	PERSON	's work is but a dull , blurred , tedious chronicle in rhyme .

		I have called
Wagner Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's heir .

		Of course , in claiming this precedence I have made count only of dramatic poets .

		I omit from the comparison , if comparison there can be , such epic or lyric or reflective poets as have won their way to the empyrean since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		And of course I do not consider that other order of literary crafts - men , the novelists -- those Alberich gnomas who delve amid the low levels of life .

		Who is there to dispute
Wagner	PERSON	's place in the drama ?

		Not Hugo , with his theatre of tinsel and falsetto ; not
Ibsen	LOCATION	, marvellous playwright as he is , but moving amid the intricate paths of the drama with his feet en - cased in lead ; not
Schiller	PERSON	, noble and powerful , but lacking in real creative gift .

		Only Goethe remains .

		Goethe is great and tender and lovely and profound .

		Wagner is great and tender and lovely and pro- found .

		Goethe has probably the advantage in lit - erary form , -- though this is a point about which , unless I greatly mistake , the future will have much to say .

		Both are prattling babes in expression compared to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with his gift of tongues .

		None of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's plays has held the boards .

		You could not drive
Wagner	PERSON	from the theatre by an edict of the law .

		Goethe epitomized
Germany	LOCATION	in a single work .

		Wagner summed up our Northern races in a series of almost equal plays .

		For my part , I would award him the wreath .

		Captain Elers , or the Twelfth Foot .

		* The career of Captain
George Elers	PERSON	, of the British 12th Regiment of Foot , shines mainly through the reflected light of more notable con - temporaries .

		He was a cousin of Maria Edge - worth , the sons of
Boswell	PERSON	were his schoolmates , and he was a personal friend of the hero of
Waterloo	LOCATION	when that distinguished person was still Colonel
Wellesley	LOCATION	.

		His own achievements were not brilliant , but his autobiography , from which most of the pleasant volume now issued has been edited by his kinsmen , is simply writ - ten , and gives a portrait of an officer and gentle - man whose life was always interesting to himself and far from devoid of interest to others .


George Elers	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	on
May 14 , 1777	DATE	, of a noble German family domiciled long in
England	LOCATION	, and died on the island of Jer - sey in
January , 1842	DATE	.

		As a youth he attended Doctor
Barrow	PERSON	's celebrated school in
Soho Square	LOCATION	, whence , curiously enough , came a num - ber of famous English actors .

		It was here that he studied with the two sons of
Boswell	PERSON	-LRB- though Mrs.
Boswell	PERSON	is mentioned by her husband often enough , further relationships of that best of bi - ographers come to one as a surprise -RRB- , and their father would not have been gratified at the characterization of them as '' clever , but with a strong Scotch accent . ''

		This appears to be all the formal schooling the youth received .

		His father became innocently involved in pecuniary difficulties that required his retirement to the continent when the young man was eighteen years old ; his mother died soon after , and in - fluence procured for him an ensigncy without purchase in the 90th Kegiment .

		Within a fort - night
Elers	ORGANIZATION	was able to buy a lieutenancy in the
12th Regiment	ORGANIZATION	, and he found himself launched upon a military career with what may fitly be termed a flying start .

		It is in accordance with the military feeling of the day that the young officer has a great deal to say about his ward - robe -- his colonel , when first waited upon , ended the interview '' by asking me the name of my tailor '' -- and nothing whatever about other possible qualifications .

		War was rife , and
Elers	ORGANIZATION	's regiment was or - dered to

		THE
DIAL 149 Misses Smith	ORGANIZATION	,
Jemima	PERSON	and
Henrietta	PERSON	, were fellow-passengers on the voyage , and the latter '' afterwards made a conquest of the future hero , Colonel
Arthur Wellesley	PERSON	, '' of whom a pleasant picture is drawn , the time being in
September , 1796	DATE	, when he was just turned twenty-seven .

		`` At this time he was all life and spirits .

		In height he was about 5 feet 7 inches , with a long , pale face , a remarkably large aquiline nose , a clear blue eye , and the blackest beard I ever saw .

		He was remarkably clean in his person , and I have known him shave twice a day , which I believe was his constant practice .

		His features always reminded me of
John Philip Kemble	PERSON	, and , what is more remarkable , I observed , many years after , the great likeness between him and the per - former , Mr.
Charles Young	PERSON	, which he told me he had - often heard remarked .

		He spoke at this time remark - ably quickly , with , I think , a very , very slight lisp .

		He had very narrow jaw-bones , and there was a great peculiarity in his ear , which I never observed but in one other person , the late Lord
Byron	PERSON	-- the lobe of the ear uniting to the cheek .

		He had a particular way , when pleased , of pursing up his mouth .

		I have often observed it when he has been thinking abstractly . ''

		In
August , 1797	DATE	,
Elers	ORGANIZATION	with half his regi - ment took part in the expedition against Man - ila which was afterwards abandoned -- perhaps for the same reasons , now sufficiently obvious to thinking Americans , which led Great Brit - ain to restore the archipelago to
Spain	LOCATION	after its capture in
1762	DATE	.

		While stationed near
Tajore	LOCATION	on the way out ,
Captain Elers	ORGANIZATION	saw the '' horrid ceremony '' of suttee practiced by a young widow . ''

		I was very near her during the different parts of the ceremony , and could have saved her life by merely touching her , as she would then have been defiled , and would not have been permitted to have the honor of sacrificing herself .

		But in saving her life I stood the chance of being torn in pieces , and I certainly should have been brought to a court-martial for disobedience of orders , for the English in those days were strictly forbidden to meddle with the customs and prejudices of the natives . ''

		In the expedition against
Seringapatam , Elers	ORGANIZATION	sets down a failure by
Colonel Wellesley	ORGANIZATION	to obey orders to dislodge the enemy , on which he passes the following observation : '' Had Colonel
Wellesley	LOCATION	been an obscure soldier of fortune , he would have been brought to a court-mar - tial , and perhaps received such a reprimand for bad management as might have induced him in disgust to have resigned His Majesty 's service , whereby one of the greatest soldiers
England	LOCATION	ever had would have been lost to the country .

		But Colonel
Wellesley	LOCATION	, fortu - nately for himself and his country , was brother to the Governor-General of
India	LOCATION	, and that was enough to wipe away any neglect or bad management . ''

		For several chapters the narrative is given up to accounts of hard fighting , even harder drinking , gambling , feasting , and the practice of the duello , -- interesting to read of but not the sort of conduct that raises the profession of arms in the estimation of the thoughtful .

		There were ten years of this with
Captain Elers	ORGANIZATION	, and then a return to
England	LOCATION	, where a somewhat similar life was led .

		Elers speaks of his friend Colonel
Thornton	PERSON	and the life of the time thus : '' At his house in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's Inn Fields he gave bad dinners but plenty of good wine .

		I used generally to > dine there four days out of the seven , and there I met all sorts of people , consisting of actors , authors , painters , .

		musicians , peers , boxers , poets , etc. .

		Of the former I have met
Kelly	PERSON	,
Incledon	LOCATION	,
Munden	PERSON	, etc. ;
Bowden	PERSON	, Rey - nolds , etc. ;
Ashley	LOCATION	,
Attwood	LOCATION	, etc. ;
Peter Pindar	PERSON	,
Lord Scarborough	PERSON	, Lord Coleraine -LRB- the celebrated
George	PERSON	- Hanger -RRB- ; Major
Wilson	PERSON	, afterwards Lord
Berners	PERSON	;
Daniel Mendoza	PERSON	-LSB- the Jewish pugilist -RSB- ; Messrs.
Wichelo	PERSON	,
Reinagle	PERSON	,
Barrett	PERSON	, and
Morland	LOCATION	, these last celebrated painters , and a variety of others .

		What scenes of fun , wit , and humor I have witnessed at these parties !

		I have not enumerated one-half of them , and there are now very few alive that used ' to set the table in a roar . ' ''

		Life went on in this generous and delightful manner for
Captain Elers	ORGANIZATION	until he was trans - ferred to the
Maldon Barracks	ORGANIZATION	in
Essex	LOCATION	in
1811	DATE	, where he had several months of disa - greeable work , followed by really bad luck in the matter of promotion .

		Not only that , but
Captain Elers	ORGANIZATION	at this time sold his commis - sions and retired from the army in order to overcome the objection held against the pro- fession of arms by the mother of a pretty girl he was in love with , only to be met after the sale with the further -- and even more cogent -- objection that now he had no profession at all .

		At this point the autobiography closes , and is followed by numbers of letters from the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	,
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	, and other persons of consequence .

		Certain Scotch marriages and divorces set the brilliant father of a more brilliant daughter to rhyming , and
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	quotes him as follows in one of her pleasant letters : '' To ready
Scotland	LOCATION	boys and girls are carried Before their time , impatient to be married .

		Soon wiser grown the selfsame road they runs In eager haste to get the knot undone .

		The indulgent
Scot	PERSON	, when English law too nice is > Sanctions our follies first and then our vices . ''

		The lines are usually attributed to
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		The book closes with a genealogical table setting forth the relationship of
Elers	ORGANIZATION	to the noble family of
Monson	PERSON	.

		150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Historic Highways of
America	LOCATION	.

		* Perhaps the most striking fact in the history of the
United States	LOCATION	is the westward movement of population , which in little more than a cen - tury filled a continent and furnished the most extraordinary example of national expansion that has ever taken place .

		This movement pro- ceeded so gradually and quietly that for a long time it escaped the notice of the historian ; but as it has approached completion its magnitude and significance have attracted attention to such an extent that its study has become the historical fad of the hour .

		One phase of this movement , -- the highways by which it took place , -- Mr.
Archer Butler Hulbert	PERSON	has taken for his field .

		He published some studies upon particular points some time ago , and more recently has been expanding and extending his former studies into an elaborate series of monographs entitled `` Historic Highways of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Of this series , six volumes have been issued .

		They treat of Indian and buffalo roads ; of the roads of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Braddock	PERSON	, and
Forbes	PERSON	to the headwaters of the
Ohio River	LOCATION	, and of
Boone	PERSON	's '' Wilderness '' road through Cumberland Gap to
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	presents at the outset the con - clusions that he draws from his studies .

		The first is that the modern highway is a gradual evolution from prehistoric times .

		The buffalo made the first roads that it is now possible to locate ; the Indians adopted them in part , and in part made new ones ; the earliest explorers , trappers , and traders followed the Indian trails , and these trails were later widened into roads for the conquest aud settlement of the country , and after settlement the old roads remained the chief avenues of communication and finally became in large part the routes of the railroads .

		The three great routes of western migration were from the
New England States	LOCATION	up the Mohawk valley and overland to the lakes , from the
Middle States	LOCATION	through western
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania to the headwaters of the
Ohio	LOCATION	, and from the South through
Cumberland Gap	LOCATION	to
Ken	PERSON	- tucky .

		All three were originally buffalo tracks or Indian trails , and two have become routes of great trunk railroads .

		The most interesting case of this completed evolution is the
Balti	LOCATION	- * Historic Highways of
America	LOCATION	.

		Cleveland :
Arthur H. Clark	PERSON	Company .

		more and
Ohio Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, which follows the In - dian trail very closely , and at two points , where it became necessary to tunnel the mountains , the tunnels run exactly under the trail .

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's second general conclusion is that the Indians and pioneers followed , not the water - ways , as is commonly supposed , but the water - sheds ; that most of the travel was overland , or , in his phrase , that the highways were the '' highestways . ''

		The navigation of the large rivers was dangerous , aud the small ones could not be depended upon , since they were frozen in winter , swollen in
spring	DATE	, and dry in
summer	DATE	.

		The highlands were the lines of least resistance , because they avoided the swamps , were less thickly wooded , and the wind swept them bare of debris in
summer	DATE	and of snow in winter .

		Although perhaps a little overstated , these conclusions seem to be borne out by the data presented .

		The first two volumes of the series treat of Indian and buffalo roads .

		From the absence of buffalo bones in the mounds , the author con - cludes that the mound-builders preceded the buffalo , and discusses their roads first .

		It must be confessed that this part of the work is purely speculative .

		From the fact that traces of local roads approaching or ascending the mounds have been found , it is concluded that there must have been general roads connecting them .

		If such roads existed , then they must have followed the lines of least resistance , which later buffalo and Indian instinct proved to be the watersheds .

		Therefore the mound-builders ' roads coincide with the later ones .

		This theory is apparently sustained by investigations of the
Bureau of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, showing that the lines of migration of the mound-building Indians lie across rather than along the great rivers .

		The buffalo roads are classed as local and transcontinental .

		The local roads , connecting feeding-grounds and salt licks , often determined the location of settle - ments , and were used for roads by the pioneers .

		In illustration of this fact , it is reported that even the main street of
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, became almost impassable in bad weather , and was de - serted for the buffalo road near by .

		The trans - continental roads marked the north and south migrations of the buffalo , and were less useful to the pioneer because not ordinarily in the line of his travel .

		The later Indian trails , which were not '' blazed '' as many suppose , are de - scribed and classified , and the evidence is col - lected from early narratives proving their use by the pioneers .

		Then particular descriptions are given of the great Indian trails from the
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 seaboard to the
Ohio	LOCATION	valley , and of the Indian trails of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The third , fourth , and fifth volumes of the series treat of the roads of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Brad	PERSON	- dock , and
Forbes	ORGANIZATION	.

		They tell the story of the French and Indian war in the west , from Wash - ington 's mission to the French forts to Bou - quet 's defeat of the Indians at
Bushy Bun	ORGANIZATION	in the aftermath of
Pontiac	LOCATION	's conspiracy .

		They present a good deal of new material , and some in - teresting contemporary maps , reproduced from originals in the British Museum .

		The Wash - ington volume contains a careful survey of
Fort Necessity	ORGANIZATION	, which supports the plan of
Jared Sparks	PERSON	as against the one usually accepted ; the
Braddock	PERSON	volume gives an interesting con - temporary journal of the expedition not before printed in its original form , and the Forbes vol - ume presents a full account of the controversy as to whether the old road should be used or a new one made .

		A new one was made , and be - came the great highway across the mountains until the later
Cumberland	LOCATION	road revived in part the route of
Braddock	LOCATION	.

		In his sixth volume , Mr.
Butler	PERSON	uses
Boone	PERSON	's road as a basis for the story of the beginnings of
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		His argument is that the settle - ment of
Kentucky	LOCATION	saved the West , and that , since
Boone	PERSON	's road was the means of its settle - ment ,
Boone	PERSON	's road saved the
West	LOCATION	.

		Unlike the other roads described , this one did not be - come a permanent highway but served a purely temporary purpose .

		A number of diaries of journeys over the road are given .

		One was kept by
William Calk	PERSON	when crossing the mountains in
1775	DATE	.

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	assumes that the Abra - ham
Hanks	PERSON	, who started with Mr.
Calk	PERSON	's party , was the grandfather of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, but this assumption does not agree with the accepted genealogy of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's mother .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	exaggerates the extent to which
Kentucky	LOCATION	was purely Virginian and speaks , doubtless by acci - dent , of the
Wyoming	LOCATION	massacre as taking place in the
State of New York	LOCATION	.

		It is easy to find fault with Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's work .

		He hardly makes good the title of his series .

		So far , he has treated only the high - ways of
Ohio	LOCATION	and neighboring States , and evi - dently does not intend to come west of the Mis - sissippi ; that is not all of
America	LOCATION	, nor even of the
United States	LOCATION	, by any means .

		He always speaks of
Ohio	LOCATION	as the
Central West	ORGANIZATION	, as it once was , but it is now the
Eastern West	ORGANIZATION	.

		His style is somewhat inflated and characterized by some mannerisms , especially a habit of preparing a surprise at the end of a sentence , which becomes tiresome .

		Occasionally his imagination runs away , as when he says that the Delawares `` range to-day over a million acres on the Kan - sas river and its tributaries , still dreaming of the time when they will again assume their his - toric position at the head of the Indian family . ''

		It is thirty-five years since the Delawares were removed from
Kansas	LOCATION	, and their former reser - vation is now the richest and most populous section of the State ; while the conditions at present obtaining in the Indian Territory are such that it is scarcely possible that they dream the dreams attributed to them .

		He indulges in a good deal of hazardous conjecture , such as the statement that the English conquest of the continent would have been easier `` had Provi - dence reversed the decree which allowed French - men to settle the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	and Englishmen the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard . ''

		The English position certainly had more advantages , among others the military one of enabling them to strike from interior lines .

		He also repeats a great deal , and presents much irrelevant matter .

		But notwith - standing these faults , Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	has the great merit of writing with enthusiasm and of vividly portraying the conditions that obtained during the period of which he treats .

		He has struck a new vein , developed novel ideas , and pro- duced some very entertaining books .

Stevenson	PERSON	's Religious Faith .

		* Reversals of judgment are common enough in all phases of literary history , and striking examples are not hard to find in the past or in the present .

		The novel that impelled the re - viewers to shriek at `` Currer Bell '' for immo - rality has its place to-day in reading-lists for young people ; the cynical
Thackeray	PERSON	has be - come the soft-hearted ; Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has only just finished explaining to us very con - vincingly that what we had condemned as form - lessness and obscurity in
Robert Browning	PERSON	's verse should be recognized as excess of the opposite virtues .

		And perhaps as notable an instance as any is furnished by the latest addi - tion to Stevensonian criticism , '' The Faith of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, '' by the Reverend
John Kelman , Jr.	PERSON	, of the
Free New North Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, happy by the '' horrible atheism '' of his son ; and what might have been discomforting het - erodoxy even in a layman of that epoch may to-day be uttered safely enough from the pul - pit itself .

		We know now that the '' family theo - logian '' of
Heriot Row	ORGANIZATION	lived to learn that the current had not carried the stray from
Calvin	PERSON	- ism hopelessly beyond all shelter of belief .

		But it is safe to say that at the time when the future writer was struggling with the difficulties of his youth , the idea of a book such as Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	has written would have been dis - missed from the mind of the elder
Stevenson	PERSON	as a worse than fantastic improbability .

		The theme of Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	's book , as the author reminds us , has under various names received more or less detailed attention from most Stevensonian critics .

		But Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	is the first to discuss the topic at length from the standpoint of official clericalism , and from that position to consider as faith what others have called
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' attitude to life , '' '' optimism , '' etc. '' It is only beginning to be realized , '' he tells us , in an admirably - written preface , `` that
Stevenson	PERSON	had a message to his times , and that his faith is to be taken seriously . ''

		In interpreting the religious ele - ment of this message , Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	has al - lowed himself great freedom .

		It is needful to recall Professor
James	PERSON	's recent definition of religion as `` a man 's total reaction upon life '' in order to get rid of surprise at such chapter - headings as '' The Gift of Vision '' and '' The Instinct of Travel . ''

		Another quotation from the preface will , however , best indicate the writer 's attitude toward his subject : `` The type of faith which his own words declare is peculiarly valuable at the present time .

		There is around us much unconscious Christianity .

		There are strong men whom God has girded though they have not known Him , and quiet men who do not seem to be fol - lowing Christ , and yet unquestionably are casting out devils .

		These are the men who will best appreciate
Stevenson	PERSON	's faith .

		Its unconventionality , its freedom from dogmatic expression , and the inseparable weaving of it into the warp and woof of his life 's various activ - ities , must appeal to many who have found themselves out of sympathy with the external forms of modern Christianity , though in heart they have remained true to its spirit . ''

		To some readers -- and they perhaps not the least Stevensonian of Stevensonians -- it may seem that Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	has brought to his Home more than a little of what he has found there .

		It is not easy , for example , to assent unqualifiedly to the following sentence , which summarizes a discussion of
Stevenson	PERSON	's marvellous power of reliving his childhood . ''

		It will be apparent to every reader that all this has a religious as well as a psychological significance . ''

		And if the revelation of personality is in itself a lit - erary manifestation of the religious instinct , there are some odd pagan and semi-pagan figures which may find their way into that gal - ley with
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		But even though we may at times be conscious of the special pleader in some of the deductions , the consciousness counts for very little in view of much admir - able criticism in which the insight is as evi - dent as the frankly-avowed enthusiasm .

		The closeness of the relation between
Stev	PERSON	- enson the writer and
Stevenson	PERSON	the man -- which is the starting-point for almost all
Stev	PERSON	- ensonian criticism -- has made it possible for Mr.
Kellman	PERSON	to consider very varied aspects of his author 's personality and work .

		In the chapters on '' Subjectivity , '' '' The Child , '' '' Revolt and Originality , '' much that is familiar is retold sympathetically , and the ethical significance of characteristics such as conscious egoism , the recurrence of particular images , the directness and vividness of physical impressions , is newly insisted upon .

		Of es - pecial interest in the chapter on books is the division which shows just how much the covenanting writers counted for among the contents of that strange literary crucible in which
Stevenson	PERSON	fused his style .

		And nothing could be more delightful reading to the lovers of the earlier , inconsequent
Stevenson	PERSON	of the '' Essay on Roads '' and '' Forest Notes '' than the two chapters on '' The Instinct of Travel , '' the charm of which is not lessened by the perception of the fact that their writer is not seldom more of a royalist than his king .

		The concluding chapters , '' Manliness and Health , '' `` The Great Task of Happiness , '' and finally ''
Stevenson	PERSON	and his Times , '' deal with
Stevenson	PERSON	's philosophy as he definitely enunciated it .

		Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	analyzes
Steven	PERSON	- son into '' a Hebrew conscience and a Greek imagination , a Scottish sense of sin and a French delight in beauty , '' and perceives in him the chief representative of the
New Hel	ORGANIZATION	- lenism , the note of whose spirit is the health and gladness which arises out of an energetic and compassionate life .

		It will not be necessary to accept all Mr.
Kelman	PERSON	's conclusions in order to recognize that the publication of his book is in itself a proof of the thesis he maintains .

		Whether or not
Stev	PERSON	- son 's message is of such a nature as to include all the essential elements of Christianity as it may be preached from a pulpit , it is still a mes -

Stevenson	PERSON	's listeners than their fathers , whom Arnold and
Clough	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son made half in love with despair , or at best taught to trust blindly in a vague hope , lit - erary historians have already noted .

		There are some critics according to whom
Stevenson	PERSON	came dangerously near to forfeiting his artistic birthright when he made it possible for a book to be written dealing with all that the term '' faith '' includes .

		They are might - ily offended that the graceful essayist and teller of tales should have permitted him - self to `` descant upon morals '' ; and the fam - ous characterization of '' Shorter Catechist '' is quoted by them with a sigh of reproach .

Henry James	PERSON	has called him ; and the need for the qualification is unforgiven .

Marjorie Fleming	PERSON	in at least the first two items of her confession that < l she never reads sermons , but only novelettes and her Bible , '' there will be those who will not regret the possible loss to art in view of the compensation .

		For , taking
Stevenson	PERSON	's utter - ance to his generation as little seriously as may be , he has given to all who can hear him a '' part - nership of interest in youth . ''

		those Italian cities that have diverted the at - tention of tourists and writers from her .

		She is the most perfectly mediaeval of them all , and remains practically the same as she was in the middle of the sixteenth century .

		Enclosed within fourteenth-century walls , and with an abundance of mediaeval and Renaissance build - ings in her streets of a style distinctly Sienese , she maintains a striking individuality that makes it impossible to institute a comparison between her and any other city .

		At one time the architecture of
Siena	LOCATION	was enriched by towers so numerous that the city was hyperbolically likened to a canebrake , by those who saw her from a distance .

		Some of these towers were destroyed in the factional wars that were waged about them ; yet those that remain are entitled to an honored place among the Italian towers whence modern architects derive suggestions .


Siena	LOCATION	was once of great commercial and manufacturing im - portance , the wealthy capital of a prosperous republic , the home of bankers who financed the
Papacy	LOCATION	, and boasted a population of more than a hundred thousand souls .

		The
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	visited
Siena	LOCATION	for six months about the middle of the fourteenth century , and not only reduced her population but checked the execu - tion of her ambitious plans for a cathedral of greater size and rarer beauty than that of her great rival ,
Florence	LOCATION	.

		The transept , all that was built of the magnificent church that had been planned , remains to-day the most beauti - ful of the Italian cathedrals , and the city is filled with art-treasures representing schools of painting and sculpture distinct from all others in the history of art .

		But at last
Siena	LOCATION	is coming to her own in a literary way if in no other .

		The appearance of no less than five books in the English lan - guage within the last few months , all upon various phases of the city 's life and history , is evidence that she is no longer to be allowed to hide her charms from the passers-by .

		Three of these books have been already noticed in The Dial -LRB- `` The Pavement Masters of

William Hey	PERSON	- wood -RRB- .

		The two admirably printed and richly illustrated volumes now before us claim to deal with the city chiefly from the historic standpoint .

		The larger of these , Professor

Oct. 1	DATE	, Professor

		The re - maining chapters in either book are devoted to other matters pertaining to the city .

		This is not to say , however , that the proper proportions have been unobserved in either case .

		The history of
Siena	LOCATION	closed in
1555	DATE	, when after a long struggle the Ghibelline city-republic succumbed to her more powerful
Guelph	LOCATION	rival , was deprived of her liberty , and became henceforth a '' kind of glorified pro- vincial town . ''

		For the past three and a half centuries she has followed the fortunes of the Grand Duchy of

		There were saints like
San Ansano	LOCATION	,
St. Catharine	LOCATION	, and

		To all these due atten - tion is given in both the '' History '' and the '' Story . ''

		To Professor
Gardner	PERSON	's delightful chapters upon
Siena	LOCATION	, he adds two upon
San Gimignano	LOCATION	, the suburban `` Town of the beautiful towers '' ; and a touch of present-day human interest is given to the book by the fact that the artist to whom was due the exquisite drawings illustrating the text , died while the work was in progress , and to her memory the author and publisher dedicate the '' Story of

		Recent Fiction .

		* A new novel by Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	is in the nature of a literary event , for he is of the small number who put conscience into their writing , and never publish anything that is not the product of painstaking effort .

		His '' Choir Invisible '' of a few years ago set a new mark in our modern fiction , and almost made us feel that
Hawthorne	PERSON	had found a worthy successor .

		But '' The Reign of Law , '' which came next , fell far below the mark set by its predecessor , being labored in its thesis , and ob - trusively didactic in its treatment .

		We regret to say that Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Mettle of the Pasture , '' is also a disappointment , and for much the same reasons .

		The sermonizing is perhaps not so pronounced , but the lack of spontaneity is quite as evident .

		The title itself is hopelessly forced , and requires a lengthy explanation which somehow does not explain altogether to our satisfaction .

		The situation upon which the story rests is both simple and familiar .

		The hero , during the years spent by him at a Northern college long before the story opens , has betrayed a young girl .

		A child has been born of their union , but has been legitimized by her timely marriage with another man .

		The betrayer returns to his Southern borne with this secret gnaw - ing at his heart , wins the love of the heroine , and is about to become engaged to her .

		The ordinary novelist 's treatment of this situation would be to have the secret revealed by some outside means or accidental circumstance .

		The discovery would be made more important than the thing itself .

		But Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's hero does not wait for his sin to find him out ; he makes a clean breast of it at the critical moment , and the outraged young woman at once ends the relations between them .

		After several years of suffering for both , his feelings soften , and in the end the two are married , but not soon enough to spare for very long the broken life of the hero .

		His dying wish is a prayer for his infant son : '' This is my prayer for you : may you find one to love you such as your father found ; when you come to ask her to unite her life with yours , may you be prepared to tell her the truth about yourself , and have nothing to tell that would break her heart and break the hearts of others .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 here is exactly right , and the teaching of the story , as far as it upholds the principle that the moral standard for the two sexes should he one and the same , is absolutely just .

		The style of the narrative , also , has a grave beanty and a subtlety of tonch that are beyond the reach of more than a very few of our novelists .

		But the situation above ontlined does not afford matter enongh for a book of this length , and the author has been singularly un - fortunate in his provision of subordinate characters and subsidiary episodes .

		These have little organic relation to his text , and are conceived in anything but a happy fashion .

		And in one instance at least -LRB- found at the close of Book I. , Chapter 9 -RRB- the author has so far lapsed from probability and good taste , has permitted himself so grotesque an aberration of style and characterization , that we read with sheer amazement what he has written , and rub our eyes to make sure that the words are really there .

		If the thing is intended for humor , Mr.
Allen	PERSON	should offer up a fervent prayer to be delivered from all future temptations to be humorous , for of such are the promptings of the Fiend .


Paul Clitheroe	PERSON	was a young poet and journalist who lived in
San Francisco	LOCATION	in the seventies .

		He had an engaging personality , and made many friends , particularly among women .

		The practical problems of life were difficult for him to master , because anything like routine or patient endeavor was abhorrent to his artistic nature .

		He tried many experiments by way of making a living , including a few weeks as an actor in a provincial troupe .

		Being a Catholic , he sought counsel from his confessor , but could get no lasting consolation in that quarter .

		He was a Bohemian , a dreamer , almost a mystic , and his restless soul brooded perpetually over the enigma of existence .

		His life was a confessed fail - ure , yet it had its hours of quiet satisfaction and even serenity of outlook .

		In his younger days , he had wandered in many countries , and had known the languid island life of the Southern seas .

		One day he disappeared from his customary haunts , and his friends knew him no more .

		Rumor had it that he had joined the Franciscans and was living the contemplative life in a Venetian community .

		In fact , he had been drawn away to the Southern seas , impelled by an irresistible memory of the ancient charm , and , like
Waring	ORGANIZATION	, had dropped out of the ken of civilization .

		A series of the episodes in this troubled career -- if so futile a life-history may be called a career -- put together without much regard to their actual time-sequence , is given us in a book entitled `` For the Pleasure of his Company . ''

		When we say that the author is Mr.
Charles War	PERSON	-
ren Stoddard	PERSON	, nothing need be added for those to whom this name has already made its magic appeal ; for others , we may say that the book , for all its ram - bling and inconsequent manner , is a piece of charm - ing literature , the expression of a spirit unfettered by the conventions , freely disporting itself in its own native element of imagination and fantasy .

		Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	, the historian of litera - ture in
Indiana	LOCATION	, has bestowed much praise upon his fellow-citizens addicted to authorship .

		Meanwhile , he has been producing literature of his own in a modest way -- poetry , criticism , and now a novel , which is a far more creditable piece of work than most of the
Indiana	LOCATION	products that he has marked for laudation .

		It is a novel of modern life , largely a novel of the world of business , the scene being laid in an aspiring Western town which seems to be situated somewhere on the
Missouri River	LOCATION	.

		The practical interest culminates in a struggle for the control of the local traction company , although we think that when the critical moment is reached , the author might have dealt more strikingly with the situation .

		The romantic and personal interest of the novel is created by a young woman , the daughter of the local magnate , for whose hand three men are claimants .

		We are kept guessing until near the close , when the atmosphere is cleared by the death of one and the flight of another , a victim of moral cowardice .

		There is also a flamboyant local festival and a mysterious abduction .

		Out of these materials '' The Main Chance '' is constructed , and with such skill as to keep the interest sustained throughout .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	knows intimately the scenes and types which he manipulates , and his work is craftsmanlike and meritorious in a marked degree .

		Some time ago , Mr.
William Farquhar Payson	PERSON	wrote a historical novel of the
Lost Colony	ORGANIZATION	in Vir - ginia , and made it noteworthy by the somewhat audacious introduction of the figure of
Christopher Marlowe	PERSON	.

		He now presents us with a novel of mod - ern conditions entitled '' The Triumph of Life . ''

		Unfortunately , he has acquired a taste for fine writing , and the result is a novel that is unpleas - antly strained and fantastical in manner .

		A young collegian writes a novel filled with noble thoughts .

		It fails of success , and he is plunged into gloom and cynicism .

		Then a most exasperating young woman treats him badly , and he resolves to have done with idealism , and win success by pandering to the lower tastes of the public .

		His name is
Enoch Lloyd	PERSON	, and he discovers one day that he can give to it the anagrammatic form of
Dolly Cohen	PERSON	.

		Under this pseudonym he writes sensational rubbish which has a large sale .

		Then he tries to write noble thoughts once more , and finds that the power has left him .

		Meanwhile his first book has a belated success , and he is sorry that he deserted his ideals .

		He is elected to the
Millennial Club	ORGANIZATION	, an introduc - tory banquet is arranged for him , and there , in - stead of accepting the honor with thanks , he makes an open breast of his literary turpitude , and resigns .

		This is the triumph of life , and averts the sinister influence of an impossible young woman of French extraction who thinks she has him in her toils .

		In the end , the exasperating young woman first men - tioned behaves more reasonably , he gets back his lost inspiration , and the future is made bright .

		This is the material for a good story , but it is wellnigh spoiled by an artificial intensity and all sorts of 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, inflated mannerisms .

		Unhappily , we can not all be Merediths , and it is just as well for most of us to recognize this hard fact .

		`` The Lions of the Lord , '' by Mr.
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	, is a chronicle history of Mormonism done into fiction .

		It begins with the expulsion from
Nau	ORGANIZATION	- voo of the followers of that very cheap prophet ,
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, and goes on to tell about the journey across the plains , the settlement in Salt Lake Val - ley , the growth of the theocratic community , the deeds of the Danites and the Mountain Meadow massacre , the schemes of the crafty
Brigham	LOCATION	, the fanaticism of his dupes , and the long conflict with the Federal authorities .

		As the author warns us , '' the make-believe is hardly more than a cement to join the queerly-wrought stones of fact that were found ready . ''

		Still , there is enough of romantic interest to keep the narrative alive , and the leading character offers an interesting study in the tempera - ment of the religious enthusiast .

		But this is a case in which the truth is stranger than any possible fic - tion , and the author has done well in keeping close to history .

		Mormonism is worth knowing about , because it typifies a form of human credulity that finds examples -- although less striking ones -- in the history of every age .

		The vulgar tirades of
Brigham	LOCATION	, as they are reproduced in these pages , are paralleled in the spirit , and almost in the letter , by the outpourings of a present-day religious charlatan , who plays upon the same coarse fibres of human nature , and who likewise counts his followers by the thousands .

		The Rev.
Bradley Gilman	PERSON	, in writing ``
Ronald Carnaquay	PERSON	, '' has sought to portray two contrasted types of the modern clergyman ; the one a quiet worker of fine fibre and absolute purity of motive , the other an ornate person of strictly superficial attainments and wholly devoid of spirituality .

		A
New England	LOCATION	city of moderate size is the scene of this story , which is chiefly concerned with the fort - unes of the two clergymen in question , and with the church which first the one , and then the other , has in charge .

		The author 's purpose -- for this is a book with a purpose , if there ever was one -- may be gathered from these prefatory words : '' When a church and preacher disregard the sacred leader - ship of Truth , and undervalue the worth of pastoral ministration , and subordinate worship to amuse - ment , and when they test the merit or strength of a church and minister solely by mercantile standards , then that preacher and people have become com - mercial and sordid ; then the higher vision is with - drawn ; and where there is no vision , the people perish . ''

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	writes from the fulness of knowledge , and , while his work has little to com - mend it as a work of fiction , its value as a sociolog - ical study is considerable .

		Most serious people feel that the clerical profession , more than any other -- unless we admit the politician to the professional classes -- is exposed to influences of so subtly de - moralizing a nature that it takes a strong man in - deed to escape their contagion .

		It is in its analysis of these influences that the strength of ''
Ronald Carnaquay	PERSON	'' is found , and in the force with which the spiritual , as opposed to the commercial , ideal of the minister 's calling is presented .

		Mr.
Justus Miles Forman	PERSON	's new novel , `` Mon - signy , '' is a thin and sugary performance which pretends to depict deep passions , but hardly comes within speaking distance of actual life .

		The central situation is so hopelessly far-fetched and strained that the story has about as much reality as a fairy tale , and is , besides , characterized by cheap theat - rical effects and artificial sentimentality .

		The doll heroine , the wooden manikin hero , and the hyster - ical woman who tries to be their evil genius are alike uninteresting and unreal .

		The action takes place in a French chateau -- the Monsigny of the title -- but the characters are all English except the doll heroine , whose mother was French . ''

		The Silver Poppy '' is a novel of literary and artistic life in
New York	LOCATION	, and is written by Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	.

		It is about a young Englishman from
Oxford	LOCATION	, doing slum work and hack journalism in the American metropolis , and a young woman from
Kentucky	LOCATION	, who has scored a great success with a novel called `` The Silver Poppy . ''

		Unfortunately , her reputation is based upon the filching of another man 's brains , and when a second novel is demanded of her by the impatient public , she is in a hopeless impasse .

		Here the Englishman comes to her rescue , and rewrites her manuscript , making a strong and vital thing out of it .

		He also falls in love with her , not knowing of her past deceit .

		When the facts come out , he goes back to
England	LOCATION	, and she is left despairing .

		He is a good deal of a prig , and the young woman is better off without him , did she but know it .

		The whole action of the story is uncon - vincing , and we are not greatly concerned about what happens to any of the characters .

		The best thing about the book is its semi-humorous account of the conditions of journalism as it is viewed by the commercial syndicate in whose hands the hero is a victim , during his early apprenticeship to the trade . ''

		The bureau had a Menu Page , too , made up by a very lean and hungry-looking old gentleman who lunched sparingly on a sandwich each noon , and a Religious Thought Page , edited by a very stout individual who kept a brandy-flask standing beside his ink-bottle . ''

		This is the sort of thing we mean , mildly amusing and yet reasonably truthful in its revelations .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		A war in society between rival cliques , with the in - terest centring in a beautiful woman , is ideal subject matter for historical romance , as Mr.
Alfred Henry Lewis	PERSON	proves in ''
Peggy O'Neal	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Drexel Biddle	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The heroine , a sweet , sensible , and beautiful Irish woman , daughter of a
Washington	LOCATION	tavern-keeper , be - comes the wife of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	's Secretary of War ,
John Henry Eaton	PERSON	.

		Her antecedents , and envy of the charm she exerts over the men who come in contact
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIu 157 with her , induce the other ladies of the Cabinet to re - fuse to her social recognition .

		President
Jackson	PERSON	espoused her cause in the thorough-going way char - acteristic of him , with the result that his Cabinet was eventually disrupted .

		These are the historical facts upon which the story is based , and the incident stands quite by itself in our national annals .

		But the treat - ment of the story , its vividness of presentation and realization of the time , are entirely Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's .

		He - writes in a quaint , individual manner , with abundant humor , setting the narrative in the mouth of one of
Jackson	PERSON	's '' kitchen cabinet , '' and enabling the reader of to-day to form an estimate of `` Old Hickory '' hardly to be obtained in any other way .

		Mr.
I. Zangwill	PERSON	seems to be coming into the requisite prominence to justify a uniform edition of his prose writings , and '' The
Grey Wig	PERSON	, Stories and Novelettes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a step in that direction .

		It contains some of his earliest as well as some of his latest work , as he is careful to explain in a prefatory note ; yet it leaves a general impression of uniform strength and skill , various as are the subjects treated .

		These range from a study of the French bourgeoisie , through British politics , feminine psychology exhibited in love-making , an Arctic explorer in
London	LOCATION	society , a good old-fash - ioned murder story with a modern denouement , a serving maid who inherits millions , to a little Irish lady who is at once a governess to the young and a singer in music - halls .

		More variety could hardly be contrived , and the treatment is quite as versatile as the choice of themes .

		Nothing Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	has written , not even '' The Schnorrer , '' leaves quite so strong an impression of his mastery of English humor , while the evenness of treat - ment , diversified in time as is the work , must be con - sidered remarkable .

		Notwithstanding that Mr.
Nathaniel Stephenson	PERSON	has made an undeniably good story of his ■
Eleanor Day	PERSON	- ton '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , it is so complete a disappointment as regards the working out of the love element that it will hardly be judged fairly by the average reader .

		The heroine , whose name is lent to the book , is one of the most beautiful of women , the descendant of two col - onial families of distinction in
Maryland	LOCATION	and southern
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Yet she is disposed of toward the close of the book as a decayed gentlewoman , keeper of a boarding - house , and the companion of fashionable young ladies desiring a European tour .

		This is not an alluring fate , and Mr.
Stephenson	PERSON	does not succeed in proving that
Eleanor	PERSON	did anything to deserve it .

		The trick of taking the most dramatic scene in the book out of its due place and using it for the opening chapter , though sanctioned by age and authority , here gives an im - pression largely erroneous and is responsible for much of the disappointment .

		Yet the book is ably written , and in some of the battle pictures of the civil war approaches excellence , while proving on almost every page the right of the author to rank among the most promising of younger American writers .

		A conscientious and able workman , Mrs.
Ellen Olney Kirk	PERSON	will lose nothing in reputation by the publication of `` Good-Bye , Proud World '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The tale opens in a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper office , discovering the heroine in the person of the editor of the ■ Hearth and Home '' department .

		She is a woman past early youth , of excellent connections , practically alone in the world , respected by her associates , always busy , and from a man 's point of view overworked .

		She longs exceed - ingly for rest -- not a mere vacation , but a lifetime with no more writing nor newsgetting , nor drafts on ingenuity perpetual and insistent .

		To her comes -- as happens so much oftener in novels than in real life -- an elderly lawyer to inform her that she is the sole survivor of her father 's family , and as such entitled to a pleasant little property in a
New England	LOCATION	seaport town , including an old-fashioned house and investments enough to maintain it .

		The scene then shifts to the new home , and a pretty romance begins , well conceived and thoroughly knit together .

		The book is delightful reading , and of more than usual merit .

		One of those annoying slips which arise to the dis - comfiture of authors appears in Mr.
Vance Thompson	PERSON	's `` Spinners of Life '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Though the fact is not mentioned directly , and the inference is in just the other direction , Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	makes bis protagonist at least nine years younger than his heroine , -- that is , the night his father killed her 's she was `` a fright - ened child of ten '' -LRB- page 57 -RRB- , and he '' was a baby '' -LRB- page 216 -RRB- .

		The story turns upon the willingness of a man deliberately to slay another whom he has never seen , by seemingly innocent means , for the sake of great financial gain , -- a temptation to which the son of the murderer succumbs .

		The situation , though essenti - ally stated by
J. J. Rousseau	PERSON	, is a novel one , and is most originally worked out , lending the book an inter - est it could not have had otherwise .

		The scene is in
New York	LOCATION	, and classes in society not ordinarily met are involved .

		The book is marred here and there by too obvious symbolism .

		Mr.
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	has put far behind him the atmosphere of romance in his third book , '' The Sherrods '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , making it a story of life in a farm - ing community in
Indiana	LOCATION	and in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The action is not the principal feature of this book , which follows the more ambitious plan of showing how one human soul can sink into the depths through over-much pros - perity , while another ascends the heights through love of a woman both good and pretty .

		Depending in this way upon subjective rather than objective processes , there is small chance for intricacies of plot , but there is still a flavor of melodrama which keeps dulness aloof .

		The protagonist of the story succeeds in marry - ing two good women , an ingenious way of introducing an element of immorality or vice without in any manner reflecting upon American womanhood .

		The most apparent criticism to be brought against Mr.
McCutch	PERSON	- eon 's story is that he has given himself too little room for the full development of so purely psychical a study .

		Nor has he been able to devise a sufficiently heaping reward for his good young man .

		Mrs.
Alfred Lawrence Felkin	PERSON	, known to novel read - ers under her maiden name of
Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler	PERSON	, has written `` Place and Power '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a story of two English families which raise themselves from provincial obscurity to the highest places of power in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		The story develops itself by leaps and bounds , covering more than half a century and ending in the living present .

		Somewhat disconnected as a result of this treatment , the book is made disagreeable by a certain narrowness of view which is the more marked because similar narrowness in one of the families discussed comes in for so much reprobration at the novelist 's hands .

		One of the families is atheistical , the other of the established church .

		A curse pronounced upon the head of the former house working itself ont feebly through the later portions of the narrative gives Mrs.
Felkin	PERSON	the 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. %	PERCENT	element of the supernatural she so affects , but its con - clusion , though ingenious , is not in the least inspiring .

		The appeal of the book is markedly British , politics playing a principal part , so that the interest for Amer - ican readers is comparatively slight , and difficult to estimate at its true value .

		Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's '' Marjorie '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- continually suggests
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Treasure Island . ''

		There are pirates enough and to spare , and , too , they conspire to obtain possession of a ship fitted out for a lawful purpose .

		Shipwreck ensuing , the bet - ter inclined among the crew erect a stockade and under - go a seige from the pirates , whose efforts would have been crowned with success did not a frigate send the customary shell into their midst at exactly the right moment .

		The differences chiefly lie in the two women who figure in the story , one on each side , the nice one lending her name to the book and her fate to the hero 's , while the other one is wedded to the pirate king .

		Melodramatic as the book is , it is a great improvement on its predecessor , '' If I Were King . ''

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	has left South African novels and South African history , and , seemingly getting as far from both as possible , gleans the grain for his '' Pearl Maiden '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- from the ripe harvest of Josephus .

		Very early Christians ,
Essenes	ORGANIZATION	, and the fall of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, afford him abundant opportunity to exhibit his matured powers of imagination and descrip - tion , the details of the siege and its termination being too horrible to permit of elaboration .

		It can not be said that the resulting story is as interesting as some of his later romances , particularly those in which the redoubt - able Umslopogaas figures ; but there is a compensating ripeness and reserve .

		The heroine is a beautiful figure , one likely to remain in the mind , and quite the best conception Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has embodied in his fictional work -- which includes his history .

		The notable difference between the tales of the French capital in Mr.
Guy Wetmore Carryl	PERSON	's '' Zut and Other Parisians '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and other similar tales is that these are really French , in conception , material , and execution , and the incidents as well as the atmos - phere can hardly be thought of in any other connection .

		There are eleven of them altogether , dealing with every social rank from the millionaire to the burglar , more than half taking in those in the humbler walks of life .

		For all these various conditions Mr.
Carryl	PERSON	has an abundant sympathy , the more marked in this par - ticular instance because in a previous book he showed himself entirely without sympathy for the working people who are his countrymen . ''

		Zut and Other Par - isians '' is commendable for many things , not least for having a decided style of its own , somewhat Gallicized , to be sure , but straightforward , sufficiently clear and simple , and with a nice perception of the mot juste .

		Its principal element , perhaps , is a delightful humor , read - ily shading into pathos .

		The incursion of the
Young Pretender	ORGANIZATION	, culminating in the fatalities of
Culloden	LOCATION	, is the historical episode about which Mrs.
Amelia	PERSON	# .

		Barr has grouped the suc - cessive love-stories of her heroine in the book called by her name , ``
Thyra Varrick	PERSON	'' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The two lovers arrive at a decision regarding the girl at the same moment , and quarrel bitterly before she takes the
Highlander MacDonald	PERSON	in the face of her father 's strenuous opposition .

		He is made captive on his wedding day , but when he sets out to wreak his vengeance on his rival he finds his life spared by him when defenseless , foregoes his quest , enlists for Prince
Charlie	PERSON	, and goes down with him to defeat and eventual death .

		Meanwhile the rival becomes a scholar , and in the fulness of time comes to his own .

		The book has the picturesqueness of narrative which is always Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's , avoids too great a tax upon the reader 's nerves by impersonal narration of the more exciting episodes , and is rather out of the common .

		The late
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	left a posthumous story called '' The Captain 's Toil-Gate , '' which is now pub - lished by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	, and abundantly sus - tains its author 's reputation for whimsical and quiet humor .

		The story is prefaced by a memoir from the graceful pen of Mrs.
Stockton	PERSON	, a portrait of the author serving for the frontispiece of the volume .

		The nar - rative is fully characteristic of
Stockton	PERSON	at his best , and it would be hard to imagine a better book so far as entertainment is concerned .

		American students of fiction will , for the most part , obtain their first knowledge of the late
William Ed	PERSON	- wards Tirebuck from the memoir of him by Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	which serves as a preface to his posthumous novel , '' ` Twixt God and Mammon '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The story is concerned with an English rector of ritualistic tendency , who falls in love with a pretty convert of his own making , a girl brought up in the
Kirk of Scotland	LOCATION	.

		The book shows a fine knowledge of the feminine and clerical mind , and brings out their kinship clearly in this particular instance .

		Another attempt toward making it impossible for those in a sheltered life to avoid a knowledge of the distress and woe of the less fortunate world is made in '' The Story of an East Side Family '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Lillian W. Betts	PERSON	.

		It is a book wholly different in treatment from such work as Mr.
Arthur Morrison	PERSON	, for example , has done in Eng - land , having something of the ordered detail and com - prehensive following of life from infancy to old age which characterized the books of Zola .

		Some quarrel can be had with the tendency , discernible throughout the book , to anticipate events , the subsequent returns to orderly narrative being confusing .

		Of the fashion of a day long gone , `` Retribution : A Tale of the Canadian Border '' -LRB-
Jennings & Pye	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has been written by Rev.
James B. Kenyon	PERSON	, known to many Americans through his volumes of graceful verse .

		Here Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	has been content to weave supersti - tion and an evident moral into a short narrative , not very well realized and astonishingly lacking in poetic quality .

		The tale concerns one family which in past generations has been able to raise itself upon the ruins of another .

		Remorse seizes one of the descendants of the prosperous house , and he turns the property back to its rightful owner .

		Through his improvidence the estate reverts to the descendant of the one who made restitution , and his daughter and the former owner 's son fall in love .

		They are thwarted on every side , and the outcome is doubly tragical .

		Dr.
James Ball Naylor	PERSON	has taken for the theme of '' Under Mad
Anthony	PERSON	's Banner '' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the cam - paign made by the hero of Stony Point against the Indians and British during
Washington	LOCATION	's second ad - ministration , the book and the campaign culminating together in the effective victory at
Fallen Timbers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The characters of the romance most in the eye of the reader are two scouts , and the one of the two who serves as hero is assigned the difficult part of being in love with two women at once .

		This complication the author treats
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 with a naivete really astonishing , leaving the interest of his book almost wholly in the hair-breadth escapes of the scouts and the perfidy of one of
Wayne	ORGANIZATION	's personal staff .

		The story is in no way remarkable , though it may serve to afford an occasional student of history a fair picture of the frontier life of the day .

		British imperialism comes near being reduced to an absurdity in Mr.
Cutcliffe Hyne	PERSON	's `` More Adventures of Captain Kettle : Captain Kettle K.C.B. '' -LRB-
Federal Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as the title-page reads , curiously enough .

		As those who read the tales of which these are the sequel will recall , Captain Kettle was everything a Briton ought to be for the display of the finer national qualities in a serio-comic vein .

		He was not much to look at , it is true ; but this is probably only to prove that it is not looks , but deeds , that the Briton values .

		Here the small but indomitable master mariner and minister of the `` Wharfedale Particular Methodists bears himself like a veritable Conquestador , rescuing strips of British Empire all over the world , conquering '' inferior '' races by a glance of his eye and a flourish of his revolver , taking possession of ships on the high seas without a suspicion of piracy , and exhibiting many more doughty deeds of dering-do .

		At the last , his death being sup - posed certain , he is knighted , characteristically enough .

		It is a conventional novel of the ultra-fashionable folk of
New York	LOCATION	that Mrs.
Dore	PERSON	'
Lyon	LOCATION	has written in ■ Prudence Pratt '' -LRB-
George V. Blackburne Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and it is rather more than ordinarily conventional .

		A young lawyer from the South , with a paltry income from his profession of S25 ,000 a year , has the audacity to fall in love with the daughter of a society leader who has ordered her into an engagement to marry a man worth 810,000,000 .

		It would be hard to conceive anything more obvious than the result certain to flow from such a situ - ation , -- and it flows accordingly .

		Mrs.
Lyon	PERSON	knows her people , and they are as conventional as the plot .

		`` Until Seventy Times Seven '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- is a moral story somewhat out of the common run , the work of an anonymous author .

		It deals with the life of an Episco - palian clergyman whose wife has deserted him for the stage , a child being born to her several years after the separation .

		She comes back to him while he is the rector of a parish in one of the American smaller towns , be - lieving herself to be near death .

		But care brings her physical health again , her husband 's manliness to moral regeneration , and the book ends happily .

		It is a daring theme , but one well carried off on the spiritual if not on the literary side .

		Briefs ox Xew Books .

		An entertaining In selecting Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	book about to prepare the volume on
Robert Browning	PERSON	.


Browning	PERSON	for the series of `` English Men of Letters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the editor was doubt - less aware that the resulting book would be any - thing but humdrum , and may very reasonably have entertained some misgivings as to the experiment .

		For Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is a young writer who is chiefly characterized by unexpectedness , and is determined to be original at all costs .

		He has certainly pro- duced an entertaining book , and a book which is , on the whole , reasonable in its conclusions , although these are often stated in somewhat startling terms .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's chief literary affectation is para - dox , as when he says that ''
Browning	PERSON	's love-poetry is the finest love-poetry in the world , because it does not talk about raptures , and ideals , and gates of heaven , but about window-panes , and gloves , and garden walls , '' or when he calmly remarks , a pro- pos of the elopement with
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	, that '' he had always had the courage to tell the truth ; and now it was demanded of him to have the greater courage to tell a lie , and he told it with perfect cheerfulness and lucidity . ''

		This sort of cleverness , and the other sort that finds expression in such in - cidental observations as `` Paul founded a civiliza - tion by keeping an ethical diary , '' is apt to pall upon the reader who discovers it upon every page ; but such is Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's way , and the defects of his qualities must be forgiven for the sake of the qualities themselves , which are freshness of mind , keenness of penetiation , and freedom from the ob - vious clichks of criticism .

		The author strains his points now and then , as when , speaking of the po - et 's last hour with his wife , he goes on to say : `` He , closing the door of that room behind him , closed a door in himself , and none ever saw
Brown	PERSON	- ing upon earth again , but only a splendid surface . ''

		This comes dangerously near to being nonsense .

		The materials for a study of
Browning	PERSON	are so eas - ily brought together that there has been no ques - tion of research in this work .

		There are the letters , and there is Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	's biography , and there are the poems .

		The
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	has brought out a few facts of its own , and many anecdotes are current in books of literary gossip .

		These are Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's sources ; the rest he has evolved from his imagination .

		Speaking of the cryptic titles of the later poems , he tells of '' a lady I once knew who had merely read the title of • Pacchiarotto and How He `` Worked in Distemper , ' and thought that
Pacchiarotto	PERSON	was the name of a dog , whom no at - tacks of canine disease could keep from the fulfilment of his duty . ''

		We must be pardoned for entertain - ing a dark suspicion that this lady is a myth .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has a good deal to say about
Browning	PERSON	's alleged obscurity , and the upshot of it all is about what Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has said in discussing the same subject .


Browning	PERSON	's vision was lightning-like in its swiftness of action and sharpness of revela - tion , and he did not think it necessary to help men of duller and slower vision to see all that he did ; or , rather , he could not comprehend how much duller and slower of vision the ordinary run of mor - tals are .

		As our author puts it , `` Sordello '' was '' the most glorious compliment that has ever been paid to the average man . ''

		The title to Professor
Gerard Bald	PERSON	- archuectu ™ w * n
Brown	PERSON	's two handsome octavo volumes on '' The Arts in Early En - gland '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is likely to be misleading to one who is seeking information in the history of art as that term is generally accepted .

		And the selection of that title is scarcely explained by the sub-titles to the two volumes respectively , -- `` The Life of 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Saxon England	LOCATION	in its Relation to the Arts '' and '' Ecclesiastical Architecture in
England	LOCATION	from the Conversion of the Saxons to the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These sub-titles , however , show the relation of one of the volumes to the other and of both to an earlier work , -- `` From Schola to Cathedral , a
Study of Early Christian Architecture	ORGANIZATION	and its Relation to the Life of the Church , '' published a few years after the appointment of the author to the Watson-Gordon Professorship of Fine Art in the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author finds the art of the Mid - dle Ages to a large extent centred in architecture .

		There were , indeed , in those days , forms of art which were not directly connected with the con - structive art , yet architecture is clearly marked out as the predominant Mediaeval craft ; and therein Professor
Brown	PERSON	finds his justification for regard - ing his dissertation upon architecture as inclusive of all the arts of
Saxon England	LOCATION	.

		To a proper study of the architectural monuments of the period under consideration , -- castles , churches , and mon - asteries , -- a knowledge of some of the facts of the religious and social life of the Saxons in
England	LOCATION	is necessary .

		It is to a discussion of these economic conditions of
Saxon England	LOCATION	that Professor
Brown	PERSON	devotes the first of the volumes before us .

		He draws his material more largely from the Venerable Bede 's '' Historia Ecclesiastica '' than from any other source .

		How thoroughly he pursues his in - quiries might be illustrated by his discussion of the '' Ing Theory , '' for example , -- that is , that En - glish place-names terminating in '' ing '' or '' inge '' imply an original settlement by an individual and not by a body of kinsfolk ; a theory which Professor
Brown	PERSON	does not hold as of unquestioned ortho - doxy .

		The Country and the Town of a thousand years ago , the Monastic seats , and the
Village Church	ORGANIZATION	in its varied relations , are all similarly discussed in a manner deeply interesting to the antiquary , the archaeologist , and the historian , as well as to the art student .

		The second volume contains a descriptive survey of the Saxon build - ings in
England	LOCATION	, and is a careful recension of a series of articles which have appeared in a prom - inent architectural journal in
England	LOCATION	.

		As a sur - vey , it is a fairly wide one , embracing examples from all periods and from all parts of the country .

		As a contribution to the architectural history of
England	LOCATION	, it is all the more valuable because of the discussions of economic questions in the preceding volume .

		The illustrations are for the most part original sketches drawn from the author 's measure - ments .

		Maps and an index list of Saxon buildings render valuable assistance to those who would seek to investigate the subject further .

		The success of the series of lectures at
Concord	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, celebrating the
Emerson	LOCATION	centenary during the
last two weeks of July	DATE	, was largely due to the zeal and practical devotion of a few promoters , among whom Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	merits special mention .

		A memorial of the
Emerson Centenary	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems fitting , therefore , that a memorial volume should issue from his pen , and record in more per - manent form his personal aim `` to prompt young men and women to such new companionship with
Emerson	PERSON	as shall give them a larger portion of his idealism and lofty spirit in religion and philosophy and in the service of mankind . ''

		The three essays now brought together in the volume entitled `` The Influence of Emerson '' are compiled from various public addresses , and have less of the evident pur - pose to be '' timely '' than has characterized much of the Emersonian criticism of the last few months .

		We find here frequent reiteration of familiar truths , yet there are passages of such deep feeling and personal revelation that the reader gains a new zest from the volume .

		The first chapter deals with '' The Philosophy of
Emerson	PERSON	, '' carefully choosing the term Idealist in preference to that of Tran - scendentalism and differentiating his Idealism from that of the great German philosophers . ''

		Nature , '' as the utterance of the poet and the thinker , was '' full of Darwinism . ''

		Of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's ethics and their relation to
Kant	PERSON	's principles , the author says : '' The three cardinal doctrines of the Kritik of Practical Reason never received such powerful summary statement as in
Emerson	LOCATION	's famous lines : 1 So nigh is grandeur to our dust , So near is God to man , When Duty whispers low , Thou must , The youth replies , I can . ' ''

		In the second essay , `` Emerson and Theodore Par - ker , '' Mr.
Mead	PERSON	has touched with a broad pen upon the correlation of the two men in religious teaching and their joint service for liberal theology and a reasonable faith .

		The third paper outlines with detailed vividness the personal relations between
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Without any expanded study of the two men in their intellectual or literary as - pects , Mr.
Mead	PERSON	has given an interesting review of the circumstances which began and continued this rare friendship of souls .

		Their differences of tem - perament , training , and social relations are well defined ; yet the bonds of unity are strongly pro- claimed and illustrated .

		Allied in friendship and aim , unlike in methods and direct influence , the two names will ever be linked '' as awakeners and inspirers , as preachers of self-reliance and individ - ualism against the compliance , superstitions , gre - gariousness , and sham that were rusting out the world ; as prophets of the soul , eternity , and God , the universal miracle , against agnosticism , mechan - ical philosophy , and a utilitarian morality . ''

		A volume by Mr.
Wirt Gerrare	PERSON	en - nZ ^
Hca	ORGANIZATION	.

		titled `` Greater
Russia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- embodies the results of personal im - pressions received in the course of a slow journey of investigation throughout
Russia	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	in
1901	DATE	.

		In making his observations the author has cared less for political questions or governmental institutions than for actual industrial opportunities and the extent to which these have been grasped .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 Petty official annoyances are , indeed , noted , bat more as an evidence of the inability of the Russian citizen to exist without paternalistic government than as in themselves an essential evil .

		For it is in this dependence upon the state that Mr.
Gerrare	PERSON	finds the chief lack of similarity between
America	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, which Russians themselves , he tells us , are fond of calling the `` New America . ''

		His esti - mate of the justice of the comparison is decidedly adverse . ''

		Physically ,
Russia	LOCATION	may resemble Amer - ica ; it may have a similar climate and equal nat - ural advantages , but unless the Russian people possess certain qualities the Americans have , they will not make any `
New America	LOCATION	' of any part of the empire .

		The difference is immense .

		In the
United States of America	LOCATION	the state is the servant of the public ; in
Russia	LOCATION	every individual is a ser - vant of the state .

		In
America	LOCATION	a number of individ - uals combine for a certain purpose , and the state confirms or legalizes their action .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	, it is the state that initiates , the state that achieves , and the state that looks to the public for approbation .

		It is the state that leads , guides , and pushes the public in the way it intends they should take . ''

		The greater portion of Mr.
Gerrare	PERSON	's work is , how - ever , devoted to a careful analysis , very nearly a census , of industrial conditions in
Siberia	LOCATION	, involving detailed explanations of the exact stage of develop - ment of railways , mines , roads , markets , agriculture , and trade , in each district traversed , together with an impartial opinion on the probable rapidity of , and opportunity for , future advancement .

		The in - evitable dulness of a semi-statistical compilation is largely relieved by shrewd characterizations of men and peoples , which , in conjunction with incidents illustrative of customs and habits , furnish the me - dium by which the author passes on to the reader his own fund of exact information .

		Still , it is in the very exactness of his information and the evi - dent impartiality of his judgments that Mr.
Ger	PERSON	- rare 's volume is distinctly a valuable addition to our literature on contemporary
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The work is profusely and excellently illustrated .

		Some new `` The Correspondence of Lady letter * 0 / Burghersh with the
Duke of Wel	ORGANIZATION	- WeUingum .

		lington , '' edited by her daughter , has recently been published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are a photogravure portrait of Lady Burghersh and three excellent ones of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, one of which , a back view , from a water-color sketch by C
R. Leslie	PERSON	, is reproduced in color on the cover , making a unique decoration .

		The portraits acquire fresh interest after the letters have been read , with their frequent references to the nuisance of being '' the slave of these great artists , '' who were always clamoring for sittings , and whom the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	had grdmblingly to endure because all the world and its monarchs insisted upon being given his portrait .

		Most of the letters included in this collection are from the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	to Lady
Burghersh	PERSON	, who was his niece and the wife of a favorite aide ; but there are a few to Lord
Burghersh	PERSON	, and a few more from Lady Burghersh to the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	or her husband .

		Altogether , they are meant to show the Duke as he was to his friends and family : a man to be loved , as well as a military genius .

		Some of the letters are as baiting and repetitious as Wel - lington 's speeches .

		Others are terse , coldly formal .

		and full of matter , like the famous despatches ; bat occasionally they become confidential , humorous .

		and very entertaining , like the letters to Lady de Ros .

		We find in them discussions of military af - fairs and politics , in which Lady Burghersh took a keen and intelligent interest ; many references to the number of tiresome people he must entertain , and the countless matters he must attend to `` be - cause no one else will , '' and to the multitude of let - ters he received '' which might as well have been written to any body else . ''

		Only , as the Duke pat it . ''

		That which people will not understand is that the whole labour and business and ceremony and everything else of the world can not be thrown upon one man , and that an old one ! ''

		Yet he never flinched from the responsibilities that were thrust upon him , and he had time enough left to do all in his power for the comfort and pleasure of Lady Burghersh and her children .

		He was continually asking them to
Walmer Castle	ORGANIZATION	, -- in the warmth of whose rooms he took a pride that sometimes threatened to suffocate his guests , -- and on the day of his death he had made all preparations to meet her at
Dover	LOCATION	and speed her on her journey to the Continent .

		The letters are not models of the epistolary art .

		They reveal nothing but the kind heart and unselfish thoughtfulness of a great gen - eral and statesman .

		It is as setting forth this rather neglected side of
Wellington	LOCATION	's character that they make their claim to attention .

		For although it does not claim to be scientific , it is closely allied to science , being the first of its class , as far as we know , based upon or definitely recognizing a regional adaptation of foods .

		It is strange , as is pointed out in the preface to this book , that people should wish to eat in Labrador or in the tropics the same food they eat at home .

		An Indian tribe in any country , it is said , has more dietary sense than the most intellectual vis - itor .

		By the slow gravitation of common-sense , k has arrived at the food rigime best adapted to its environment , and that without medical conventions , chemical analyses , health-foods , or `` faked '' coffees .

		A
New Englander	ORGANIZATION	goes to
Panama	LOCATION	and calls for beans and beefsteak , or in

		162 THE DIAL -LSB-

		With signed recipes from everywhere , its specialty is Spanish - American cook - ery , and its masterpieces are famous dishes of
Old California	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, and
Peru	LOCATION	.

		The fact that Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	contributes an introductory ar - ticle on Spanish-American cookery vouches for its accuracy as well as for its charm .

		He also gives recipes for many historic dishes of those southern lands which have held a large portion of his life and of his heart , and his section of this book is the only place known to us where one can get English cooking directions for real Spanish dishes .

		Every American has reason to thank the
Landmarks Club	ORGANIZATION	for its efforts to preserve the most interesting of the historic remains of
Southern California	LOCATION	.

		It has worked under expert supervision , and the reports of what it has accomplished with little money are most interesting .

		The compilation of this book has been a labor of love on the part of the club , and the proceeds of its sale will go to the further work of restoration of the now faat decaying yet still beau - tiful mission buildings .

		The book is published by the
Out West Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Los Angeles	LOCATION	,
Cal	LOCATION	.

		Professor
William Cranston	PERSON	Law - ton 's '' Introduction to Greek Clas - sical Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the latest addition to the list of manuals of the subject prepared primarily for teaching purposes , but not without attraction for the general reader .

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	- ton 's book has an unusual measure of this attractive quality , for he is a much-practiced writer , and has acquired a method of expression which makes its points strikingly yet with a surprising economy of words .

		He is not as successful in making his mean - ing clear , as may be illustrated by the following sentences , which would be sure to lead a beginner into sad misconceptions : `` Herodotos ,
Plato	LOCATION	,
Plu	ORGANIZATION	- tarch , the tragic three , are ... indispensable . ''

		`` In - vestigations no less fruitful are now in progress in various parts of the iEgean , notably in
Crete	LOCATION	, and in
Cyprus	LOCATION	. ''

		Imagine the feelings of the teacher who is informed , with our author as authority , that
Crete	LOCATION	is in the iEgean , and that Herodotos ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	are commonly spoken of as `` the tragic three '' !

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	's book is divided into a large number of brief chapters , and many of these into still briefer sections , treating of individual authors .

		The chapters include such special topics as `` The Mythic World , '' `` Homeric Problems , '' `` Beginnings of Greek Music , '' and `` Greek Athletics . ''

		The treatment of authors is perforce very brief , but such men as Aristotle and
Lucian	PERSON	surely deserve more than the few skimpy comments that are accorded them .

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	is up to date in his use of the results of recent discoveries -- Herondas ,
Bacchy	PERSON	- lides , Greek music , and the Constitution of
Athens	LOCATION	-- although the Timotheos find seems to have been just too late to get mentioned .

		We find
Timotheos	PERSON	in the index , but the page referred to contains no word to bear out the reference .

		The author is most nearly adequate in his treatment of the poets , but is a little too fond of experiment in hexameter translation .

		The book is supplied with chronolog - ical tables and brief bibliographical paragraphs , chiefly indicating English studies and translations .

		A score of well-selected full-page illustrations -- an - cient sculpture , Pompeian wall-paintings ,
Flaxman	PERSON	drawings , and modern imaginative works -- add greatly to the interest of the volume .

		In `` Watteau and his School '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Edgcumbe Staley	PERSON	has thrown some light on the little-known personality of the creator of this par - ticular school of art , as well as interesting informa - tion on his numerous followers .

		Jean
Antoine Watteau	PERSON	was born at
Valenciennes	ORGANIZATION	on
October 10 , 1684	DATE	, and the streets of
Valenciennes	LOCATION	were the cradle of his inspiration .

		He arrived at an early age in
Paris	LOCATION	, where his inspiration knew little bounds .

		The gay crowds in the gardens , the fasci - nating chanteuses of the opera , the animated groups in the streets , the elegant equipages and their courtly occupants , were to him so many tableaux vivants .

		Delicacy of touch and minute attention to detail gained for him the distinction of being the most brilliant and original draughtsman of the eighteenth century .

		The present biographer claims that no designer ever equalled him in piquancy of pencilling .

		Watteau 's rank and title in the world of art was '' Maistre-peintre des Fetes Galantes '' -- the exact meaning of which in our more re - strained vocabulary is difficult to give .

		He died
July 18 , 1721	DATE	.

		Considering the scarcity of infor - mation , Mr.
Staley	PERSON	has given us a very readable biography .

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, THE STORY OF A BOOK .

		IN THREE CHAPTERS .

		Chapter I .

		The Men Who Made It .

		ONE hundred years ago
Noah Webster	PERSON	-- journalist , scholar , patriot -- was brooding a great undertaking .

		He had worked with
Jay and Hamilton	PERSON	for the adoption of the Consti - tution and the support of
Washington	LOCATION	's admin - istration ; freedom and order were established ; now for a science and literature worthy of the young republic !

		At the foundation of all is language .


Webster	PERSON	had already made a Speller which speedily became and long remained a text - book for the entire people , training to uni - formity of spelling and pronunciation , and yielding the author a maintenance which en - abled him to carry on the vast and uncompen - sated work of '' An
American Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of the English Language . ''

		In the exposition of that language no real advance had been made since
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's dictionary sixty years before .

		The new age and the new country had pro- duced a flood of new words and usages for which there was no interpreter or arbiter .

		Webster essayed to cover the whole literature and the living use of the English-speaking race , with special inclusion of the new nation - ality .

		He brought to the task a natural genius for language , a special aptitude for lucid , ex - act , and terse definition , a ripe scholarship , and a tireless industry .

		With his work well begun , he stopped to broaden his knowledge , and mastered the main vocabularies of twenty lan - guages .

		He studied for a year in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Johnson worked intermittently for eight years on his dictionary ;
Webster	PERSON	spent twenty years on his .

		He gave it to the world in
1828	DATE	-- a splendid monument of scholarship , and in its substance fitted to every-day needs .

		But it was in two bulky volumes , its price was
$ 20	MONEY	, it con - tained a few eccentricities of spelling , and the American public was not yet emancipated from deference to English authority .

		The first edi - tion of
2600	DATE	copies was enough for thirteen years .


Webster	PERSON	stood to his guns , bated no jot of his peculiarities even where most unpopular , revised the work on its original lines , and brought out a new edition , at
$ 15	MONEY	, in
1841	DATE	.

		That , too , found little sale ; and in
1843	DATE	Webster passed away , after a full and happy life , but with his magnum opus lying stranded like
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	's boat , a vessel too big for the builder to launch .

		One hundred years ago , to a country printer in
Western Massachusetts	LOCATION	was born his first son ,
George Merriam	PERSON	.

		The second son was
Charles	PERSON	* and then came a flock of brothers and sisters .

		The boys were educated in the district school and the printing office ; they toiled early and late ; when their father died they gave their slender patrimony to their mother and sisters , and pushed their own way ; and in
1831	DATE
G. & C. Merriam	ORGANIZATION	began business as retail booksellers in
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		They gave to business every hour not given to their fam - ilies or their church .

		They began publishing in a modest way , notably an admirable series of school readers -- the '' Child 's Guide , '' `` Village Reader , '' etc. -- compiled by the elder brother .

		When , at Dr.
Webster	PERSON	's death , his book came into the market , they discerned something of its potential value , and bought the unsold edition and the publishing right .

		That purchase marked an alliance of business and scholarship which has borne fruit for sixty years .

		The new publishers ' first care was to fit the scholar 's wares to the public 's want .

		They employed Professor
Chauncey A. Good	PERSON	- rich ,
Webster	PERSON	's son-in-law and literary heir , to re-edit the book ; the eccentric spellings were dropped and the reasonable changes re - tained ; such scientists as
Silliman	PERSON	and
Dana	PERSON	were employed as contributors ; and in
1847	DATE	the full work was brought out in one volume for
$ 6	MONEY	.

		The public favor was instantly won and never was lost .


Webster	PERSON	's executors had appraised the copyright for the unexpired ten years at
$ 3000	MONEY	, and the Merriams bought it for that .

		They so increased its value that when the copyright was renewed for fourteen years they made terms with the
Webster	PERSON	family by which during that period they paid to them , for the large book with its Abridgments and the Speller , a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		The Merriams leased the Abridgments and the Speller to other houses , and concentrated their whole energy on the large book .

		In
1850	DATE	it was proposed in the
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts legislature , unsuggested by the publishers , that a copy of
Webster	PERSON	's large dictionary be placed in every district school .

		Before the leg - islative committee the advocate of a rival book sneered at
Webster	PERSON	as an ignorant pretender .

		Professor
Noah Porter	PERSON	of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	replied with so eloquent a vindication of
Webster	PERSON	's scholarship and services that local prejudice was conquered .

		The schools were offered their choice , and
3035	DATE	took
Webster	PERSON	and 105 its competitor .

		Soon after ,
New York	LOCATION	state placed
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 10,000 copies of
Webster	PERSON	in its schools , and thus began its acceptance as a school standard which to-day extends over the entire country .

		When the enlargement of
Worcester	LOCATION	to an illustrated quarto was announced in
1859	DATE	, the
Webster	PERSON	publishers made a prompt counter - stroke .

		They put into a supplement a large num - ber of classified illustrations -- a new feature in an American dictionary -- added a supplement of new words which had long been accumulat - ing ; appended a valuable table of synonyms by Professor
Goodrich	PERSON	; and brought out their enlarged work well in advance of the new Wor - cester , which never approached it in popularity .

		Then they set to work on a radical and thorough revision .

		Under Dr.
Porter	PERSON	's super - vision , with the aid of a group of eminent scholars , the advances in linguistic science and in popular usage were inwrought with
Webster	PERSON	's solid groundwork .

		The period of this revision was that of the Civil War ; busi - ness fell off ; the Southern market was lost ; the income from the Speller was intermitted , and payments to the
Webster	PERSON	family were by amicable arrangement postponed ; war taxes were heavy ; but the three brothers -LRB-
Homer Merriam	ORGANIZATION	being now included -RRB- pushed steadily the revision , while they supported the war , and looked for the return of peace and prosperity .

		So came to birth the great book of
1864	DATE	, known familiarly as `` The Unabridged '' ; its predecessor being completely superseded and withdrawn from the market , until revamped and foisted upon the public under false pre - tenses half a century later .

		A battle of pamphlets turning largely on the question of spellings ; the general prev - alence of the Websterian practice , and an eclipse of all rivalry in the commercial field ; a fresh supplement of new words in
1879	DATE	; the gradual addition of biographical and geograph - ical tables -- these were incidents preliminary to the next great revision .

		To this revision -- a work covering ten years and costing over a third of
a million of dollars	MONEY	-- were given the fuller elaboration , the larger permanent staff , the freer employment of specialists , and the exact attention to every detail , which accord with the advanced methods of modern scholar - ship and business .

		In a work carried on thus through generations , there has developed a special art of dictionary-making , with an inval - uable tradition of experience , yet progressive and always expanding to meet the new con - ditions .

		The result appeared in
1890	DATE	in a work whose title marked the supremacy won throughout the English-speaking world , Web - ster 's
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its improvement has never ceased for a day .

		New matter has been added ; tables have been scrupulously brought up to date ; the accumu - lation and sifting of new words and meanings has gone steadily on .

		A Supplement of new words in
1900	DATE	; tables of biography and geog - raphy substantially made over in
1902	DATE	; a steady accession of improvements with no spe - cial announcement -- this has been the later history of the book .

		To the chief editorship so long and ably filled by President
Porter	PERSON	has succeeded Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	,
United States Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	and a scholar of world-wide repute .

		It is to the alliance of scholarship and busi - ness sagacity that
Webster	PERSON	has owed its success and growth .

		From that alliance has sprung a harmonious aim and a comprehensive plan of work .

		Before setting forth that ideal , a word more may be given to the personnel of the combination , past and present .

		On the pub - lishers ' side the force was strengthened in
1877	DATE	by the addition of Mr.
O. M. Baker	PERSON	, trained as an educator and a school superintendent ; an experienced and able bookseller , Mr.
H. C. Rowley	PERSON	, came in
two years later	DATE	; the change by incorporation to '' The
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	'' in
1892	DATE	was a change of form only , the same hands still manning the ship ; to the directors was added Mr.
K. N. Washburn	PERSON	, who had been long engaged in the company 's serv - ice ; and while the first two
Merriam	PERSON	brothers have passed away , the directorship includes two of the family name and
Homer Merriam	ORGANIZATION	still presides in a hale old age .

		At the head of the editorial force have been in succession three scholars of high repute ; Dr.
Goodrich	PERSON	, the heir of Dr.
Webster	PERSON	in mental acumen ; President
Porter	PERSON	, with a rare combination of original intellect , acquired knowledge , and practical sagacity ; and Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, officially the first man in the Amer - ican educational world , and eminent in a wide variety of studies .

		Next to these have been a group of contributors of the highest standing in general scholarship or special branches , such as Dr.Mahnof
Germany	LOCATION	, Professor
W. D. Whitney	PERSON	, President
D. C. Gilman	PERSON	, Professors
Hadley	PERSON	,
Lounsbury	PERSON	,
Sheldon	PERSON	,
Remsen	LOCATION	,
Verrill	PERSON	,
Justice Brewer	ORGANIZATION	-- the list could be indefinitely prolonged .

		Of highest practical service have been men perhaps less famous who have through arduous years perfected themselves in the tech - nical art of dictionary-making ; as chiefs of 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, staff should be named , among the departed ,
William A. Wheeler	PERSON	and
Loomis J. Campbell	PERSON	, and , among the living ,
F. Sturges Allen	PERSON	.

		With these have been scores of faithful and service - able workers , whose lot has been '' to widen knowledge and escape the praise . ''

		So much for the men who have made the book ; the ideals they have followed and the methods they have used will be given in the next issue of The Dial .

Waterloo	LOCATION	to
St. Helena Translated	ORGANIZATION	, and with Notes By
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	Author of ``

		Gourgaud ' s famous Journal has never been translated into English , and this need has been keenly felt by students of
Napoleon	PERSON	, especially since the appearance of Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	's `` Napoleon : The Last Phase . ''

		In this admirable work the author says : `` The one capital and supreme record of life at
St. Helena	LOCATION	is the private journal of General Gourgaud . '' ''

		This journal is too prolix for complete translation , so that Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has extracted from the two volumes almost all that
Napoleon	PERSON	said to Gourgaud in familiar chats about his past life , and his speculations as to the future .

		She has omitted much that she considered irrelevant from the standpoint of the general reader , and the result is a book fairly crowded with interest from beginning to end .

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has always excelled in the faculty of picking out essentials , and nowhere has this characteristic been more pronounced than in her arrangement of the `` Talks of Napoleon . ''

		Those who have read -LRB- and we are sorry for those who have not read -RRB- the masterpiece of the great French novelist who wrote under the pen-name of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, and who , in a moment of piqne , directed that he should be described upon his tombstone as ''
Arrigo Beyle	PERSON	,
Milan	LOCATION	- ese , '' will remember those enigmatic words , `` To the Happy Few , '' which are appended to the last page of the French text .

		Although standing in the place of the usual '' Fin , '' they seem to be meant as a sort of dedication -- perhaps to the intellectual aristocracy of readers to whom alone the work could make its full appeal .

		Certainly , the '' few '' who are capable of appreciating the descriptive charm and the psychological subtlety of this extraordinary composition are made '' happy '' in as legitimate a way as literature may warrant , and are likely to renew their enjoyment more than once at the same source .

		Not many works of fiction have the assured immortality of '' La Chartreuse de Parme , '' and not many readers , unfortu - nately , acquire the refinement of appreciation which the work deserves .

		Among those readers , Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, whose delicate art has learned more than one lesson from
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, must surely be reckoned .

		Her `` Valley of Decision '' was clearly a reflec - tion of the theme , and to some extent of the method , illustrated by the work in question .

		Even where it failed most noticeably , as it certainly did in the matter of vitality , to follow in
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's footsteps , it still forced the com - parison upon the mind of the reader , who found on its every page a tribute , if not always conscious , to the source of its inspiration .

		We have been led to these retrospective observa - tions by a paper , contributed by Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	to the last number of `` The North American Review , '' entitled `` The Vice of Reading , '' which ends with the quotation of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's dedicatory words .

		Her interpretation of them coincides with the one which we have above suggested , and by their means she points a moral for writers and readers alike .

		She has been discussing the `` mechanical reader '' whose mind is too sluggish to react upon a book , and who gets from literature nothing worth having because he brings to it no personal element of 250 THE DIAL -LSB-

		And her conclusion runs as follows : `` Obviously , it is to the writer that he is most harmful .

		The broad way which leads to his approval is so easy to tread and so thronged with prosperous fellow-travellers that many a young pilgrim has been drawn into it by the mere craving for companionship ; and perhaps it is not until the journey 's end , when he reaches the
Palace of Platitudes	ORGANIZATION	and sits down to a feast of indiscriminate praise , with the scribblers he has most despised helping themselves unre - proved out of the very dish prepared in his honor , that his thoughts turn longingly to that other way -- the straight path leading * To the Happy Few . ' '' ''

		To read well is an art , and an art that only the born reader can acquire , '' says Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	.

		This is her version of the Shake - spearian '' to read and write comes by nature , '' aud the truth of the saying is one of many evi - dences of the wisdom inherent in the utterances of
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	, that much misunderstood philoso - pher , who has a message for the elect no less than for the groundling .

		To be a born reader , to use a book `` as the keynote of unpremedi - tated harmonies , as the gateway into some paysage choisi of the spirit , '' is , no doubt , to be numbered with a smaller `` remnant '' of mankind than that which was the subject of
Matthew Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's famous lecture .

		The `` gen - tle reader , '' in Lamb 's and
FitzGerald	PERSON	's sense , is one of the rarest of birds , and the most art - ful mimicry of his habit and coloring will not enable an outsider to intrude upon the flock undetected .

		But we can not all be gentle read - ers , since we were not all born that way , and it seems to us that Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is rather hard on those whose flight is debarred from the sunny uplands of imagination , and whose natural limitations compel them to range upon lower levels and in grayer lights .

		And so , turn - ing from the joys attainable only by the Happy Few , we are constrained to say a word for the satisfactions that are still accessible to the Un - happy Many . ''

		The mechanical reader '' is the title given by Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	to the individual member of this numerous company .

		She says many severe things about him , which are , no doubt , in some measure justified .

		He is self-sufficient , he is '' the slave of his book-mark , '' he thinks the books having the largest sales must be the books best worth reading , he is innocent of the art of judicious skipping , and , especially , he leels it his duty to express opinions . ''

		Anyone who frequents a group of mechanical readers soon becomes accustomed to their socialistic use of certain formulas , and to the rapid pro- cess of erosion and distortion undergone by much-borrowed opinions . ''

		These are his sub - jective failings .

		Objectively , his influence is pernicious because he creates an enlarged de - mand for mediocre writing , he retards true culture by his appetite for popularizations of difficult matters , he confuses moral and intel - lectual judgments , and he misdirects the ten - dencies of criticism , producing '' a creature in his own image -- the mechanical critic '' who makes precis - writing take the place of analysis .

		This is a heavy indictment , but does it warrant us in considering the case of the mechanical reader as hopeless , and in leaving him to wal - low in his Philistinism ?

		He may have a poor sort of soul , but is it not worth some effort to save , and is not his a case for the offices of the good Samaritan ?

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	seems to think it is not , and to urge that with such per - sons the habit of reading is a vice to be erad - icated .

		The suggestion is enough to take away one 's breath , especially when it leads to the con - demnation of all '' reading deliberately under - taken , '' for no better reason than that the highest form of intercourse between reader and book is more often missed than hit by the mind that is seeking culture of set purpose .

		There can be no such thing as wise guidance in the choice of books , because , forsooth , no reader is worthy of a good book unless his unaided in - stinct leads him to it .

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	would have something to say to this astonish - ing judgment .

		The conscientious persons '' who make it a rule to read '' are surely not de - serving of the scorn here heaped upon them , even if the books through which they plod their way '' are not like growing things that strike root and intertwine branches , but like fossils ticketed and put away in the drawers of a geol - ogist 's cabinet '' ; the superior critic may find their efforts amusing , but must be heartless in - deed not to see that they are also pathetic .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's view , if she really means it seriously , amounts to a flat condemnation of all the good advice given to aspiring readers by the wisest of counsellors , from
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	to
Buskin	PERSON	.

		It is a view the acceptance of which would paralyze the most fruitful modern edu - cational activities .

		If there is any one among recent educational developments more en - couraging than all the others , it is the increased attention given to the intelligent study of lit - erature , and the success with which thousands
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 of persons , young and old , are being persuaded to substitute the deliberate choice of good books for the random reading of anything that hap - pens to fall in their way .

		Every reader whose application is thus diverted represents so much clear gain to the cause of enlightenment .

		What if such a reader does for a time flounder blindly about in the unwonted element , and display all sorts of crudities of thought and expression ; is it not better that he should grope toward the light than dwell contented in the outer dark - ness ?

		Our word to the perplexed reader , then , would be no counsel of despair , but an exhort - ation to persist in what may at first and for long seem a thorny path .

		The world is wonder - fully interesting , and good books are the me - dium through which its wonder and interest mainly shine .

		There is no individual of so mean endowment as to remain wholly unre - sponsive to this light , and if one stimulus after another be applied , the right one will surely be found at last .

		Of a truth , the argument which we have undertaken to controvert is so insubstantial in its logic -LRB- if it be intended for anything more than a whimsicality or the utterance of a petu - lant mood -RRB- that it is dissipated by its own airi - ness .

		It would hardly deserve consideration were it not a specific application of a far larger argument that has done much mischief in the world .

		The most dangerous enemy of democ - racy is the comfortable persuasion of superior persons that it is entiiely fitting they should remain superior , and that things are very well as they are .

		In their interpretation , the prin - ciple of noblesse oblige becomes condescension merely ; it does not lapse into sympathy , still less does it join actively in the effort to lift those of low condition .

		In this view democracy is condemned because it does not at once usher in the ideal state , popular education is depre - cated because it tends to raise the masses from their proper place and thus fosters discontent , the oppression of the backward races is con - doned because we are enjoined by both destiny and duty to see that they are kept safely in leading-strings .

		This is an argument with which no generous soul can have any patience at all , for it seeks to shut the door of hope in the face of the majority of mankind .

		And be - cause the paper we have just had under dis - cussion seems to us dangerously symptomatic of this false and narrow view of human nature , we have taken it as a text for more serious comment than its own intrinsic weight would warrant .

		THE
QUAKER	ORGANIZATION	IN FICTION .

		Since the time when Mr * .

		Stowe portrayed the doughty person of
Phineas Fletcher	PERSON	in ' * Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' the Q laker has been a not unfa - miliar figure in fiction .

		There is something of the perverseness of fate in the fact that a people who have been taught to look upon the reading of fic - tion as baneful should themselves come to play a considerable role in imaginative literature . ''

		The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, '' says
Bancroft	PERSON	, `` distrusts the fine arts ; tbey are so easily perverted to purposes of super - stition and the delight of the senses . ''

		Accordingly ,
Qiakerism	LOCATION	, in its deep-rooted craving for the un - adorned realities of life and for deliverance from the mere show-world , has always frowned upon the literature of romance .

		The tales of fairy-land and of chivalry , and the song of the troubadour , have not been admitted to the carefully-guardt-d house - hold of the Q taker .

		Even to-day , in the most conservative secondary schools nf the Friends , the reading of u The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' of ''
Ivan	PERSON	- hoe , '' and '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' books among the College English requirements , is either done under protest or their equivalents in actual history or biography are substituted .

		The members of the Society of Friends have been brought up to deny themselves the aesthetic enrichment of life , the pleasures of art as expressed through music , pictures , the drama , and the novel .

		They have counted among their numbers prophets and reformers , but not philosophers or artists .

		Hence it is not strange that the romantic output of the S iciety is inconsiderable , a quantity practi - cally negligible .

		In a few instances where their own sectaries have practised the contemned art , the result has been destitute of literary importance .

		The moral purpose has always been too far in ex - cess of the artistic to secure a public outside of the Friendly world .

		Disregarding , then , the few and futile attempts of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	to interpret himself through the medium of the imagination , let us turn to the more numerous efforts of ' • the world 's people '' to interpret him .

		If the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	has been represented with inade - quate success by those of his own denomination who understand the principles underlying his id io - syncracies , he has suffered in equal if not in like measure from those outside the fold .

		It is not an easy thing for a non-member to obtain a sympa - thetic understanding of a sect whose very exclusive - ness , social and religious , binds them into a kind of brotherhood .

		Too often his portrayors seize merely upon the striking or picture > que externals , use ex - cessive daubs of gray in the portraiture of bonnet and waistcoat , and drag in with unnatural frequency the `` thou '' and `` thee . ''

		The result is a caricature rather than a character .

		As yet , no one has ade - quately rendered the hereditary quiet of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	without investing his character with a certain acidity .

		No interpreter has put into abiding form the 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	's bold demeanor in the face of all the powers of the world , and his loyalty to divine command , which are the basal principles of the Society .

		In the main , two types of Q laker have been presented in fiction .

		In the first , the outlines approach those of the Puritan ; and the Friend is hard , austere , forbidding .

		In the second he is in a nascent state , is emerging from the dominance of inherited Quakerism , or is perhaps in open revolt against its irksome tenets .

		As a rule , we find him more human and more appealing when there is a rift within the lute of his Quakerism .

		In ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' both types are exemplified .

		The father ,
John Wynne	PERSON	, is stern , implacable , scornful of the innocent joys of life .

		His character is unrelieved by any touch of human sweetness ; and we wonder how the grim and silent man could ever have won the hand of the merry-hearted daughter of
France	LOCATION	.

		The son and hero , however , whose soul is on fire with love of war , becomes an apostate to the doctrine of non-resistance , and wins the approval of the reader for his dash and gener - osity .

		In the story called '' Thee and Thou , '' Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	says of his heroine , '' The greatest charm of this woman was in her pretty little revolts against
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	ways , and her endless sympathy with every - body 's tastes and pursuits . ''

		The question here naturally suggests itself , whether the Friend , except the Friend in the unmaking , is fitted to take a prominent place in fiction ; whether in stories of war , conquest , and adventure , the typical Friend can be anything more than an accident , a portion of the background .

		The difficulty of evolving romance from material so deficient in color and sentiment is suggested by
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's characterization : '' I can not like the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	would say -RRB- ' to live with them . '

		I am all-over sophisticated with humors , fancies , craving hourly sympathy .

		I must have books , pictures , theaters , chit-chat , scandal , jokes , ambiguities , and a thousand whim-whams , which their simpler taste can do without . ''

		In ''
John Halifax	PERSON	, '' the old tanner ,
Abel Fletcher	PERSON	, is an unyielding piece of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	stoicism , and belongs to the type of
John Wynne	PERSON	.

		It is not until death is imminent that a strange tenderness possesses him and glorifies his end .

		Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	, in her story of `` Friend Olivia , '' treats of that last wave of the Reformation , the formative period of Quakerism , and uses the dra - matic background in which
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	,
Charles II.	PERSON	, and
George Fox	PERSON	are the chief figures .

		She has not been altogether successful in giving to this profound religious movement a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	atmosphere ; nor in the matter of detail is she faithful to the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	ideal , for the material surroundings suggest too much luxury and personal indulgence .

		Ancestral pictures ,
Brussels	LOCATION	lace , and `` women in white satin '' are hardly in keeping with the unworldly teachings of the founder of the sect .

		Very little definition is given to the character of the mystic ,
George Fox	PERSON	; the reader is not impressed with the dynamic force of the man who made the hearts of his listeners `` tremble at the word of the Lord . ''

		In Mrs.
Parr	PERSON	's tale of ''
Dorothy Fox	PERSON	, '' -- an old - fashioned story , sweet and entertaining , -- we get a sympathetic picture of an ingenuous little Quakeress with a forbidden taste for martial exploit .

		But here we have also a representative of the first type , an impossible taciturn young lover who follows a life of almost monastic asceticism .

		Perhaps no one has been more successful in seizing the essentials of Quakerism than has Mrs.
Mason	PERSON	in her story of '' The Windflower . ''

		Here is depicted the sharp contrast between the colorless and formless worship of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	and the elaborate ritualism of the liturgical church .

		The author shows unusual understanding of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	ideals when she invests father and daughter , the two representatives of the sect , with large-hearted tol - erance , patience , and tenderness .

		The more lofty strains of their religion are not subordinated to extraneous drab and sectarian foible .

		It may be that the present reaction among mod - ern Friends in favor of music and the expression of artistic enthusiasm indicates the passing of the traditional
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, whose dress and speech made him stand out as a figure distinct from the world 's people .

		According to statistics , the conservative membership of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	is steadily diminishing .

		A recent writer in the '' London Spec - tator '' says : '' It is a pity that the sect which has done most to make of philanthropy a dominant factor in modern life is hastening to an honored grave . ''

		The haste , however , is less marked in
America	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	, for the primitive principles of Quakerism have been more persistent here than in the mother - country .

		The more conservative
American Quaker	ORGANIZATION	has jealously guarded the doctrines of Friends brought over by
William Penn	PERSON	and his colonists , who were protestants against many of the social and religious forms then dominant in
England	LOCATION	.

		One may trace here a process analagous to that of the later survival of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's English in the new land of
America	LOCATION	.

		Just as the philologist must look to
New England	LOCATION	for obsolescent bits of Elizabethan English , already obsolete in
England	LOCATION	, so the student of Quakerism must turn to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and the surrounding country , if he would find the historic speech and dress which have disappeared among the more radical votaries in
England	LOCATION	.

		Here by the simplicity of their worship they still maintain their '' testimoney '' against the sensuous forms of faith .

		Their meeting-houses , never imposing or beautiful , are bare of ornament , and are without pulpit or desk ; their services are distinguished by absence of all liturgy , music , or prepared sermon .

		The phraseology of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	also has lingered longer in
America	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	, and in and around
Philadelphia	LOCATION	one still hears the quaint language of the memoirs and journals of the early Friends , such phrases as '' steeple houses '' appearing in suppli -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 cation , `` hat honor , '' `` creaturely activity , '' and '' meetings for sufferings . ''

		There is , however , a gradual relaxing of the old uncompromising forms of spotless dress and formal speech .

		And it may be that as the traditional type of the drab-coated and drab-petticoated generation becomes more rare , the vanishing sectary will so gain in charm and poetic quality as to offer rich material to the future romancer .

		THE ORIGINATORS OF THE MODERN SHORT STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		I think it is
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	who , in one of his inimitable contes , speaks of a man who was perfectly sane on all ordinary topics , bat whose mind suffered shipwreck whenever he considered one particular topic .

		An analogy might be drawn between
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's charac - ter and most recent critics of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	.

		They whose remarks on all other subjects are sound and well - informed , seem to lose their balance most unaccountably when dealing with this particular subject .

		There has lately been a deal of cheap criticism put forth in regard to the Short Story ; and while the initiated can not be misled thereby , it is to be feared that these biased statements will , unless controverted , deceive the multi - tude of readers .

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	is one of the offenders ; and Professor
T. M. Parrott	PERSON	is another .

		On page 75 of his work on '' The Philosophy of the Short Story , '' Professor
Matthews	PERSON	says : `` From Chaucer and Boccaccio we must
spring	DATE	across the centuries until we came to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and
Poe	PERSON	almost without finding another name that insists upon enrollment . ''

		And Professor
Parrott	PERSON	has recently been holding forth in a somewhat similar manner in the pages of a well-known monthly , a propos of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	owes a great deal both to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and to
Poe	PERSON	; but one critic has stumbled blindly after another in calling either of these writers '' the origin - ator of the modern Short Story . ''

		Both Me ` rime'e and Balzac wrote some of their very best Short Stories be - fore either
Hawthorne	PERSON	or
Poe	PERSON	had written any of theirs .

		And the best work of Me ` rime'e and of Balzac has not since been surpassed in this genre .

		It is of
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's `` La Grande Breteche '' -LRB- 1832 -RRB- that Professor
William P. Trent	PERSON	has well said : `` It is as dramatic a piece of writing as
Balzac	LOCATION	ever did , and is almost if not quite as perfect a Short Story as any that has since been written in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In his story '' A Seashore Drama '' -LRB- 1835 -RRB- , Balzac has voiced a never-to-be-forgotten ideal of the Short Story in these words : '' A narrative sharp and incisive as a blow with an axe . ''

		It needs only a glance at the chronology of the ear - liest stories of Me ` rime'e ,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	, to see that the credit for precedence belongs to the two French writers .

		Washington Irving 's '' Rip Van Winkle '' -LRB- 1819 -RRB- and Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's `` Wandering Willie 's Tale '' -LRB- 1824 -RRB- are not properly Short Stories , according to the modern definition , but may be said to be on the dividing line between the modern Short Story and the ancient tale .

		In the lists below are placed the first six stories of each of the four writers in ques - tion , with the dates of their first publication .

		All , or all but one -LRB- '' Sarrasine '' -RRB- , of the Balzac stories are of the first rank .

		Of the
Hawthorne	PERSON	stories , all but the first are of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's second-best , and none of them are equal to the best of the Me ` rime'e or Balzac lists .

		Of the Poe stories , only two , the first and the last listed , are up to his highest standard .

		Poe himself tells us , in a note affixed to the '' MS. Found in a Bottle , '' that this story was '' originally published in
1831	DATE	, '' but we have only his word for it .

		The facts of the matter seem to be thus : Meximee 's first really productive year in the Short Story was
1829	DATE	; Balzac 's ,
1830	DATE	;
Hawthorne	PERSON	's ,
1832	DATE	;
Poe	PERSON	's ,
1835	DATE	.

		By reason of '' The Gentle Boy '' -LRB- 1832 -RRB- , and by that only ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	could claim pri - ority to
Poe	PERSON	.

		But this is annulled if we accept
Poe	PERSON	's statement as to the date of the `` MS. Found in a Bottle . ''

		The only clear way out of the matter is to accept the first efforts of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and
Poe	PERSON	as coinci - dent in production .

		But Me ` rime'e came before
Balzac	LOCATION	, and both Me ` rime'e and
Balzac	LOCATION	preceded
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	.

		Hawthorne has had ascribed to him some work earlier than `` The Gentle Boy , '' but it is about as worthless as the first efforts of a genius well can be ; and there is no positive proof of its authenticity .

		It is not well to let our pride in American literature allow us to distort facts .

		Both
Hawthorne 's	ORGANIZATION	and
Poe	PERSON	's service to the Short Story was great .

		But '' the orig - inators of the modern Short Story '' are Me ` rime'e and
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		This is not to say that Me ` rime'e and Balzac owe nothing to still earlier writers , for their work in this genre .

		The Short Story , like all other literary forms , has had a gradual growth .

		But in their work the modern
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	, with its economy of means and its precision of effect , found its first perfect expression .

		Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's Reminiscences .

		* Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's narrative of his life and labors is interesting not only for its own sake , but also because it takes us once more among those
New England	LOCATION	immortals who , lost to sight , are every year increasingly dear to memory .

		Born in
1827	DATE	, and devoting himself unswerv - ingly from his youth to the cause of good lit - erature , he has every right but the claim of nativity to a seat in that select circle .

		Ogden , in western
New York	LOCATION	, was his birthplace , and so near to
midnight	TIME	was he born that he en - joyed the singular privilege of choosing be - tween two possible birthdays , the 17th and the
18th of September	DATE	.

		It is almost superfluous to add that the earlier date was the choice of his boyhood , the later that of his adult years .

		Among the writer 's childhood experiences that appeal so strongly to the boy , or girl , in us all , let us select one .

		A swamp , apparently impassable and filled with all sorts of delight - ful imaginary terrors , lay before the
Trow	ORGANIZATION	- bridge homestead .

		Into this terra incognita , however , the boy John mustered up courage to penetrate at the height of an unusually dry season .

		Scrambling through the thicket , he found to his surprise that it was nothing but an ordinary belt of woods , with high-and-dry farm lands beyond .

		From that day the swamp lost its terrors , and he almost wished he had left it unexplored .

		Beginning to write verses at thirteen , the young poet made his first appearance in print at sixteen , in the county newspaper .

		His verses , on the
Tomb of Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, had been written as a school exercise , and owed their publication either to his teacher or to his father .

		After much private reading and study , a taste of the classics at a
Lockport	LOCATION	academy , and two terms of school-teaching , he started at nineteen for
New York City	LOCATION	to earn his living by his pen , -- of course with the traditional roll of manu - script in his pocket or in his carpet-bag .

		There was the splendid audacity of genius in this ob - scure country boy 's plunge into the life of the great city , and his successful struggle to main - tain himself by his pen almost exclusively , de - spite tempting openings in other directions , makes interesting reading .

		Story-writing , play-writing , and editorial work followed , with now and then the publication of a poem .

		Both his se - rials and many of his short stories appeared later in book form , and are too well known to call for further mention here .

		It is not so well known that five volumes of verse stand also to his credit .

		In the capacity of editor , Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	is best remembered as the able conductor of '' Our Young Folks , '' until its publishers courted disaster by less success - ful enterprises than that excellent magazine .

		Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's pages are enlivened with many an anecdote that will endear him still further to his admirers .

		Here is one illustra - tive of his unwillingness to say no to the bor - rower who is always with us .

		■ After I had been so far prospered as to be able to place a small deposit in a savings-bank , the father of a family once besought me for a loan of sixty dollars .

		When I told him , to my sincere regret , that I had no such sum at command , he made answer that his quar - ter 's rent was due , that he had been unable to collect some bills he had relied on to make up the needful sum , and he did n't know which way to turn , if I could n't help him . '

		I have n't it , ' I repeated ; ' but ' -- I thought of my poor little savings-bank deposit , and of a family man 's natural distress on being unable to pay his rent -- ' I might possibly raise it for you . '

		Al - though I knew there would be a loss of accumulated and prospective interest if I withdrew my money from the bank , and I could not think of taking interest from a friend , his expressions of gratitude paid me in ad - vance for any such sacrifice .

		I went at once and drew the sixty dollars , which I handed him without saying bow I had come by it .

		He paid me in a week or two , thanked me warmly , and added this naive remark : ' If you had n't lent me the money , I should have had to take it out of the savings-bank , and have lost the interest . '

		I smiled and held my peace . ''

		Speaking of his literary passions , Mr.
Trow	PERSON	- bridge names
Emerson	PERSON	as the writer to whom his debt was greatest .

		At first ,
Epes Sargent	PERSON	's satirical comments on the
Concord	LOCATION	sage had inclined the young man against him ; but a chance quotation that met his eye sent him eagerly to the Essays , and thereafter he was a willing captive to their charm .

		On one oc - casion , when
Sargent	PERSON	chanced to find the ob - ject of his satire browsing among the books at the shop of
Phillips , Sampson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, he asked the senior partner for an introduction .

		The publisher conveyed the request to
Emerson	PERSON	, who bent his brows and replied in his slow , emphatic way , -- `` ' ' Sargent ?

		Mr.
Epes Sargent	PERSON	, of the Evening Tran - script ? '

		Then , after a pause : ' I have nothing for Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	, and Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	has nothing for me . '

		Perfectly dispassionate and dignified ; but there was nothing more to be said , and Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	had to go

		THE DIAL 255 back to his visitor and tell him that the desired intro - duction was declined .

		I was pleased through and through to learn how my own grievance in the matter had been atoned for , and still more interested to find that even the serene
Concord	LOCATION	sage was , after all , hu - man , and capable of a righteous resentment , -- if that can indeed be called by so misleading a name which was more likely the feeling he avowed in his letter to
Henry Ware	PERSON	, regarding their differences of opinion : ' I shall read what you and other good men write , as I have always done , -- glad when you speak my thought , and skipping the page that has nothing for me . '

		He simply * skipped ' Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	. ''

		At one point in this delightful volume the reader will be tempted to pick a quarrel with the author .

		It is where the latter , after graph - ically detailing the incidents that led up to the threatened duel between
Charles G.	PERSON	H alpine and the poet Handiboe -- a duel in which he himself was to have acted as
Halpine	LOCATION	's second -- suddenly breaks off with this lame and im - potent conclusion : '' How our two principals would have demeaned them - selves if they had thus been brought face to face , wea - pons in hand , can only be conjectured ; for the affair , even while our plans were pending , was precipitated to a most unlooked-for , calamitous conclusion , the cir - cumstances of which , although I was deeply concerned in it , can not be related here . ''

		Was it the old continued-story habit that made our narrator thus leave his readers in the lurch ?

		In this case , unfortunately , there is no cheering prospect of an early sequel , which is all the more regrettable as the incident is not referred to by the biographers of the genial '' Miles
O'Reilly	PERSON	. ''

		More than one of the Autocrat 's witty say - ings are recorded by Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	.

		They will be new to most readers .

		When the strife was raging over the true discoverer of anaes - thetics , and a monument in his honor was pro- posed , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	suggested that it should consist of a central group symbolizing painless surgery , a statue of
Morton	PERSON	on one side , one of
Jackson	PERSON	on the other , and an inscription below 44 To E -LRB- i -RRB- ther . ''

		The writer himself was well acquainted with Dr.
Morton	PERSON	, and unhesitat - ingly champions his claims .


Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's sancta simplicitas is amus - ingly illustrated by an anecdote .

		`` A friend of mine once saw him on a
Nantasket	LOCATION	boat , without a ticket , or money to pay for one .

		When called to account by the fare-taker , he remarked inno - cently that the trip had attracted him , and that he be - lieved ` there would be some provision , ' -- a belief that was immediately vindicated by a passenger recogniz - ing him , and stepping up to make the said ' provision . ' ''

		Many and interesting are Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's memories of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		He clears up the disputed point of Whitman 's indebtedness to
Emerson	LOCATION	, proving conclusively that `` Leaves of Grass '' was not written , even in its earliest form , until the poet had become a reader and admirer of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Beside
Whitman	PERSON	's own assertions to the author to this effect , several instances are cited of
Emerson	LOCATION	's thought in
Whitman	LOCATION	's verse .

		The eccentric poet 's sturdy defiance of criticism is illustrated in a small way by his refusal to correct a false phrase ,
Santa Spirita	LOCATION	, which he had coined and printed as good Italian , although it was pointed out to him afterward that
Spirito Santo	PERSON	, or , in - deed ,
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, would serve his purpose equally well .

		But he perversely retained the original blunder in later editions .

		Preliminary tastes of 44 My Own Story '' were given to the public in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		The book itself is a much more considerable and valuable work .

		Numerous photographs , some of them unfamiliar , add not a little to its attractiveness .

		The total im - pression on the reader is of a life so worthily lived that even the fullest account of it need not shrink from the publicity of the types .

		Especially gratifying is it to recall the author 's courageous rescue of a boy from drowning at
Mystic Lake	LOCATION	, in the
winter of 1872	DATE	, -- an act of humanity which the
Massachusetts Humane Society	ORGANIZATION	rewarded with a large silver medal .

		The writer modestly refers to the incident as 44 attesting qualities the quietest life may con - ceal , even from their possessor . ''

		One is glad to find in this life of honest endeavor and worthy achievement one more illustration of the truth of
Milton	LOCATION	's assertion regarding him 44 who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things . ''

Oct. 16	DATE	, style ; thorough assimilation and organization of facts , so that tendencies and periods of development are treated with a logical con - clusiveness ; and exhaustive research , in so far as materials for study were accessible at the time of writing .

		In all three respects , Mr.
Dorman	PERSON	is far below the standard of Lecky .

		His style is not bad , but it is distinctly not good .

		Its dry pedanticism oppresses one with the sense of a laborious task honestly and con - scientiously done , yet done without inspiration and without that genius for expression which characterizes a great historical work .

		His facts are given with painstaking exactness , and with careful references ; but far from being organized and arranged for the reader 's bene - fit , they are made to follow each other in such strict order in point of time that they become a mere catalogue of events -- almost , indeed , an ordinary epitome of history .

		His research has been exhaustive in one particular field of investigation , but other and easily accessible sources have been largely neglected .

		Judged , then , upon standards of ability in expression and authoritativeness of statement , the first volume of the present work is not a successful general history .

		Possibly , however , in the light of the modern tendency among his - torical students to demand exact information rather than illuminative treatment , Mr.
Dor	PERSON	- man 's work may be received with commenda - tion for his study of British Foreign Records ; and had he been content to produce a mon - ograph setting forth the contents of these documents , in place of attempting a general history , he would have been praised for hav - ing made a genuine contribution to historical knowledge .

		He gives us more information than any other author on the official diplomatic correspondecce of
England	LOCATION	in the period cov - ered .

		This has been his main study , and this should have been the subject of his monograph .

		Unfortunately for Mr.
Dorman	PERSON	, official diplo - matic correspondence for any period forms but a small part of the material necessary to the writing of history .

		An excellent illustration of this is offered in the treatment of Malmes - bury 's mission to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1796	DATE	, ostensibly to arrange for peace with
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dorman	PERSON	makes much of this incident , referring to it in his preface even , because he claims to have discovered evidence contradictory to the view set forth by
Lecky	PERSON	, that
Pitt	PERSON	honestly intended the mission to be productive of peace .

		Mr.
Dorman	PERSON	's view is that
Malmesbury	LOCATION	was sent solely for the purpose of securing information on the military and political condition of
France	LOCATION	; and this view he supports with cita - tions from the records of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, quoting also
Malmesbury	LOCATION	's private correspond - ence .

		The correctness of this conclusion is not here denied , though it is at least questionable ; but the important point is that the author has been content to base that conclusion on the official records and on
Malmesbury	LOCATION	's corre - spondence alone , and has wholly neglected , indeed seems to be unaware of the existence of , such important sources of information on the point in question as the Dropmore Manu - scripts , giving private and secret instructions to diplomats , and other important documents and letters lately published by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , the polit - ical situation in
England	LOCATION	at the exact moment when
Malmesbury	LOCATION	departed for
Paris	LOCATION	, a situa - tion of the highest importance to a correct understanding of the mission itself , is wholly neglected , -- an omission permissible in a spe - cialized study , but indefensible in what pur - ports to be a comprehensive history of
England	LOCATION	.

		The illustration just given is characteristic of the entire work .

		Its value as a history is therefore confined to two services : it may be useful as a convenient epitome of events , and it will be a convenient reference for those historical students who desire the latest in - formation on questions of fact brought out by researches in the British Foreign Office Rec - ords .

		Even in this latter , however , the work , if put forth within any reasonable limit , must soou lose its one particular claim to importance , since the records in question are not open for study subsequent to the year
1833	DATE	.

		And , fi - nally , it must be evident that anything ap - proaching an authoritative and conclusive history of the British Empire in the nineteenth century is as yet an impossibility .

		The best that can be hoped for is a practically contem - poraneous , and fairly exact , general survey .

		Mr.
Dorman	PERSON	has in fact attempted the im - possible .

		THE DIAL 257 A
Drama of Justice	ORGANIZATION	and Humanity .

		* Each new thing by a great man whose work is already familiar shows us the well-known figure , but sometimes in strange guise .

		One hardly knew , at first , where to meet with
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	in ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	. ''

		Here was a play of the early Renaissance , and definitely of places in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Place and time were precise .

		There was nothing of that strange and mystic country which we have come to think of as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's own , -- that belated Gallic cross between Preraphaelitism and German romance , that country where the subterraneous ocean laps between basaltic walls , and where deep dungeons with iron-studded doors shut out light and the cheerful sun , the land of ancient forest and of fountains , the land of wise old kings and weak young men and lovely large * eyed maids and wives with long locks of gold .

		Nor was there any everyday realism either , such as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	approved in theory so long ago , -- the realism of the static theatre , of the old , old house , of the lamp-lit parlor of '' L'Intrus , '' of the evening garden of '' L'ln - terieur . '' ''

		Monna Vanna '' seemed as though it were to be an ordinary play , as ordinary at least as
Browning	PERSON	's ''
Luria	PERSON	. ''

		M.
Maeterlinck	PERSON	had heretofore done some - thing to render himself intelligible . ''

		Ardiane et
Barbe	PERSON	Bleu '' had given some light as to the significance of his earlier romance .

		But when one begins `` Monna Vanna '' one is again in the dark .

		It seems far too ordinary .

		The only relief is that terrible prosy old man ,
Marco	PERSON	.

		He is a relief because in his inevitable , undeniable , impracticable appeal to
Justice	ORGANIZATION	we recognize something of the phi - losopher whom we have known , if not of the playwright .

		Not because
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has heretofore been prosy , but because he has sought for that absolute common-sense consid - eration of matters of human passion which
Marco	PERSON	seems to have obtained .

		It seems curi - ous to speak of a typical character of Maeter - linck 's being instinct with common-sense .

		But when
Guido	PERSON	, the general of helplessly belea - guered
Pisa	LOCATION	, is so naturally outraged at the idea of sending his wife to the camp of the Florentine conqueror , even as the sole means of saving his city , what sound good sense un - touched by romantic foolishness is to be found •
Monna Vanna	PERSON	.

		A Play in Three Acts .

		By
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		in
Marco	PERSON	's '' Yet ask yourself if you have the right to give a whole city up to death , and but to put off by some sad hours an inevitable ill : when the city is taken ,
Vanna	ORGANIZATION	will be in the victor 's power ... '' Surely that is sensible .

		If Guido will agree to what is sure to take place , the city will be saved ; otherwise all will be lost together .

		But he can not agree ; he will not even give Vanna herself a chance to decide on any such question .

		But
Marco	PERSON	has already , very sensibly , taken the precaution of inform - ing her before he told
Guido	LOCATION	; he saw in her a kind of force of which her humdrum husband was unaware .

		`` Everyone sees in another that which he sees in himself : each one knows him in a different way and according to his power of knowing . ''

		Guido will not even report the matter to the council .

		But
Marco	PERSON	has reported it already , and the council with nobility and firmness has put the fate of the city in
Vanna	LOCATION	's hands . ''

		She will give answer for both , '' says the indignant captain .

		`` I hope so , '' says the imperturbable old man , serenely conscious that she will accept and do what is really for the best of all .

		We can not help sympathiz - ing with
Guido	LOCATION	; he is human , but how far from the profound sagacity of the admirable Belgian !

		In the second act we get a little nearer what we are accustomed to ; and in the last we should surely be quite at home .

		When
Monna Vanna	PERSON	goes in her mantle and sandals to the tent of
Prinzivalle	LOCATION	, she hears that they have met before .

		Is it malicious to point out that it was long since , at a moment when she was weeping by a fountain ?

		That single touch allies
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, the noble , the devoted , the stately , to
Alladine	LOCATION	,
Selysette	LOCATION	,
Melisande	LOCATION	, so that we are by no means shocked when her heart turns from her simple , com - monplace , selfish husband to the devoted ideal - istic condottiere .

		Not in any ordinary sense , of course , -- it is no vulgar loving and being loved , -- but she recognizes that there is some - thing akin to her own high soul in this spirit which has remained for twenty years on fire with the intensity of a single moment .

		They return together to
Pisa	LOCATION	, which they have de - livered , -- for the victorious mercenary , dis - trusted very rightly by the ungrateful re - public which he serves , is to be arrested by his own soldiers .

		Here , surely , is as serene self - confidence in the higher justice as that of old
Marco	PERSON	.

		It is not astonishing that
Guido	PERSON	does not appreciate this high-mindedness .

		He is exceed - 258 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ingly angry , in the first place , that his wife should have gone on any such excursion , even with the best of motives : he has not such re - pose on universal wisdom that he can believe that she really loves him if she would do such a thing .

		Nor when she tells him that she comes back as pure as she went , does he believe that either .

		Further , when she presents to him Prinzivalle he so far mistakes her as to fancy that she has brought him back to be revenged upon him , as he himself had thought of a re - venge in years to come .

		He can not believe that Prinzivalle would have spared
Monna Van	PERSON	- na for love of her ; nor , of course , can he be - lieve anything else that comes after .

		It is all eminently right , wise , just , all that they have done ; but who can pretend that the crude world of husband and bystander will appre - ciate ?

		They feel , it is true , '' an honor more real and a happiness other than that which leads the rest astray . ''

		But when she tells how she and Prinzivalle have but exchanged a kiss upon the forehead , who will believe ?

		Guido sees that he may be prejudiced , and he appeals to the crowd to see who will believe .

		Marco does believe it ; but the others are as we may imagine .

		And as a close of the play
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, desperate at the impossi - bility of living further on the basis of the truth , sends Prinzivalle to a dungeon on the pretense before her husband and the crowd that it is only that she may herself finally take a fit vengeance upon him .

		I have read somewhere that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	had ceased to be pessimistic .

		His earlier plays always present people in the grip of an over - mastering fate .

		Mankind is but a pygmy in the hands of unknown and unavoidable forces that hurry it to the tomb by various sure though devious ways .

		That conception is cer - tainly absent in `` Monna Vanna '' ; we do not have weak and often silly lovers devoted from the first exchange of glances to an irrevocable fate .

		So far ,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	doubtless is not so pessimistic in `` Monna Vanna '' as in some earlier plays , -- so far he may be called an opti - mist .

		But when he looks out at the world he is surely not very optimistic .

		For what is the case of this play ?

		It is that though as we read we can sympathize entirely with the sense of justice of
Marco	PERSON	, the simple truth of
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, the unmeasured devotion of
Prinzivalle	LOCATION	, -- although we can take their view and pro- nounce it right , yet we must also have a fellow - feeling for the others who will not believe .

		Guido is selfish , no doubt ; blind , by no means high-minded , but a man for all that , and not very different from other men .

		And sympa - thize as we may with the others , we must admit that the world , and ourselves in it , is still very like
Guido	LOCATION	.

		And perhaps we can not but feel that it is quite as well that it is so , for all our human institutions , customs , habits ; having developed on the basis that men are human , it is well enough that for a time they should remain so .

		But if so , it would seem that justice -- Maeterlinckian justice -- can hardly , as yet , live in this world .

		People do not understand it .

		Their personality blinds them : they agree to generalizations in the abstract , but they are outraged at the particular application when it comes to them in some form that touches them keenly .

		Perhaps this may be for a time only :
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	studies to bring that time to an end .

		Such would seem to be the moral position , as we may say , in which
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	wrote ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	. ''

		To take it as the net out - come of the play , to fix our eyes upon it to the exclusion of all else , is certainly an uncritical thing to do .

		But when a man comes before the world as a philosopher as well as a play - wright , we may , perhaps , be excused for busy - ing ourselves with the philosophy of his plays .

		In this case , if we did not do so , there would be little else to occupy us .

		There are in the play , it is true , not a few of those simple , direct , glimpses of truth which
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's work rarely lacks ; but save for them and the philos - ophy , there is not much in the painful and preposterous story to interest the reader .

		Only as being a powerful presentation of some truth of life can such an episode really absorb one 's attention .

		As has been said , ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	'' is a de - parture .

		As such it does not seem to be per - manent . ''

		Joyzelle , '' which was produced
last spring	DATE	, has not been translated , but it is worth mention here .

		It resembles neither
M. Mae	ORGANIZATION	- terlinck 's earlier work nor that which just pre - cedes it ; nor does it carry on the ideas of either , so far as is superficially obvious .

		While it deals vaguely with unseen powers , and with justice , its main motive is presented with a simplicity with which it has not heretofore ap - peared in
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's writings .

		That mo - tive is the absolute power of Love .

		Here our author is on safer ground than that which he sometimes occupies , and his work is in conse - quence more commonplace .

		THE DIAL 259
The Historical Study of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The multiplication , in the last few years , of books intended to serve as an introduction to the historical study of philosophy , and of the great philosophical systems , marks , one may hope , a growing sense of the value which such a study has for culture and for life .

		It has been quite too common to find among educated men a conception of philosophy which is noth - ing less than a caricature , and a consequent disparagement of its aims and achievements which only a profound ignorance can excuse .

		It is hard to avoid setting this down as one more evidence of the intellectual flabbiness which has seemed likely to overtake us and our education , and which draws back from any really honest and thorough-going scrutiny of things in the intellectual realm , satisfied with vague impressions and half interpreted intui - tions and feelings .

		Philosophy is only the record of man 's most stubborn attempts to understand himself and the world ; and a cul - ture which ignores these can hardly claim to be well-rounded .

		Two introductory outlines of the history of philosophy have appeared during the present year , and both of these have distinct merits .

		The most noticeable feature of Turner 's '' His - tory of Philosophy '' is the thoroughness with which it deals with a period which has usually been somewhat neglected -- the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		This furnishes , indeed , as the preface states , the special excuse for the book 's existence .

		The account of
Mediaeval Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, accord - ingly , occupies nearly a third of the six hun - dred odd pages of the volume , and it supplies what probably is the most convenient summary of the scholastic writers that is available .

		To one who is not convinced , with the author , that Scholasticism at its best represents the most solid achievement of human thought , to which we are destined to go back after the vagaries which have led much of recent philosophy astray , it seems doubtful whether it is wise ped - agogically to utilize this material for the ordi - nary student ; but no doubt for a work which pretends to cover the field impartially , it rep - resents more nearly the true proportion of em - phasis than does the treatment of the ordinary text-book .

		Apart from its treatment of this special period , however , the book has merits as

Philadelphia	LOCATION	:

		a whole .

		It is clear and accurate , and reveals a good deal of solid learning .

		As a convenient handbook for the student with a technical in - terest , it is perhaps superior in some ways to any of its predecessors .

		An immense amount of information is crowded into it , and the me - chanical arrangement is admirable for ready reference .

		The volume includes a good sum - mary of Oriental thought , as well as a bird 's - eye view of the philosophy of the present day .

		It is of course inevitable that the exposition should , under the circumstances , be rather bare and formal , and at times should be too technical to mean much to the untrained reader ; but for the most part it may be said to be as intelligible as the plan of the book could well admit .

		Less encyclopaedic in character , but for that reason much more interesting from the stand - point of the general reader , is Mr.
Dewing	PERSON	's '' Introduction to the History of Modern Phi - losophy . ''

		Here the primary aim is rather to furnish an introduction to philosophical think - ing than to supply a book of reference .

		To this end there is a preliminary discussion of philosophical terms and problems which is helpful ; and throughout the effort is to inter - pret points of view rather than merely to sum - marize conclusions .

		The writer shows himself to be possessed of a distinct gift for lucid ex - position .

		The sections on
Berkeley	LOCATION	and on
Kant	PERSON	might perhaps be singled out as good examples of this skill ; the whole treatment , indeed , of the German Idealists is excellent , as an elementary introduction to a very difficult subject .

		The author concentrates attention almost wholly on the side of technical phi - losophy , and there is not much attempt to re - late this to the wider and less closely reasoned influences which enter into modern thought .

		So
Rousseau	PERSON	, for example , is not even men - tioned .

		But in the region of philosophical theory , a fair degree of success is attained in bringing out the continuity of development ; and the brief introductory statements and sum - maries contain not a few judicious remarks .

		A summing up of present tendencies , in the concluding chapter , is rather more useful than such attempts are apt to be , and gives a pretty good general survey of some of the significant sides of contemporary thought .

		* Some time ago a
London	LOCATION	publisher inserted ad - vertisements in the newspapers calling for the owner of a manuscript novel that had come to him from an anonymous source .

		Inclosed in a red box , the manuscript had been received at his office , ac - companied by no clue to its authorship .

		Mean - while , its publication was decided upon , and a number of persons were asked to suggest an appropriate name .

		By a most surprising coincidence , without any consultation or collusion , these persons -LRB- no less than seven in number -RRB- all suggested '' The MS. in a Red Box '' as a fitting title .

		Thus styled , the book is now given to the public with the benefit of an amount of ingenious advance advertising that falls to the lot of few new novels .

		It turns out to be a fairly readable romance of the conventional sort , which just escapes being hackneyed by the possession of a historical framework that has not heretofore , as far as we are aware , been brought into the novelist 's service .

		Daring the early years of the reign of
Charles I.	PERSON	, some years before the development of the dispute about the ship money , the
King	ORGANIZATION	granted to certain Dutchmen the right to construct drainage works in
Lincolnshire	LOCATION	for the purpose of reclaiming the fens .

		This grant aroused the antagonism of the inhabitants , and the men who were working the concession had to contend with an opposition that found expression in suits at law and in physical violence .

		About this situation a pretty story has been planned , filled with perils and hair-breadth escapes , and working out to the in - evitable pairing of the valiant English hero with the engaging Dutch heroine .

		It is not a very pleasant performance , and contains hardly a single sympathetic figure .

		In its deliberate choice of dis - agreeable scenes and situations , as well as in the forced smartness of its diction , it reminds us a little of the books of ''

		English politics form its groundwork , and it is given a topical character by the fact that the hero is a member of the

		They are thrills of melodramatic creating , as a rule , for the story is one of an oath-bound secret society , which resorts to the usual tricks for the furtherance of its ends .

		Its officers write their orders with a yellow crayon , which is the explanation of the title .

		The scene is first in
America	LOCATION	, but soon changes to
England	LOCATION	, where the society is plotting for the overthrow of a powerful radical leader .

		This is the leading mo - tive of the book , but many private interests come into play , and there is no end of excitement .

		The thing is done deftly enough , but the result is cheap stuff at the best .

		An awkward title -- `` Where Love Is '' -- has been given by Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	to his latest novel .

		The story moves in the
London	LOCATION	society of to-day , which the author knows well and appraises with a fair sense of relative values .

		There is much talk , smart or serious as the circumstances may demand , and natural in either case .

		The characters are nu - merous , and distinctly drawn ; indeed , Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's best gift is that of characterization .

		The plot is particularly hackneyed .

		A young woman , trained all her life for husband-hunting , is about to be mated with a man of the most eligible description , from society 's point of view .

		A most ineligible man , a struggling artist , appears upon the scene , awakens her better instincts , and finally wins her affections , although there is no deliberate siege on his part , and on hers only a dim sub-consciousness of what is going on until the crisis is precipitated .

		This crisis comes when she discovers that the man to whom she is plighted has been guilty of one of
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 the foulest of offenses , and that the artist has sought to save him by assuming the burden of the sin .

		She indignantly breaks off her engagement , discerns that she has loved the artist all along , and plans a marriage with him .

		By all the sentimental rules that govern such situations , this should be tbe end of the novel , or it should end with this con - summation clearly in view .

		But the author does not play the game fairly .

		Having brought us thus far , he abandons sentiment -LRB- which has hitherto been consistently worked -RRB- for realism and stern logic , makes his heroine suddenly revolt against the prospect of a life of poverty , and dismisses her from tbe scene as the hasty bride of a third man , who has before this hardly figured in the plot This sudden break in the natural development of the story is as unpardonable as it is startling , and con - stitutes a serious defect .

		Granted that the senti - mental theory is a convention , it is inexcusable to construct nine-tenths of a novel upon that basis , and then give us the other tenth -LRB- with the conclusion -RRB- upon a totally different plan .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's attempt to make this outcome seem legitimate is a miserable failure , and spoils what would otherwise have been an especially good story of its kind .

		The peculiar blend of public and private inter - ests that is characteristic of the life of our national capital has been found attractive by a number of novelists , although the possibilities of the subject are as yet far from having been exhausted .

		The anonymous author of '' Despotism and Democ - racy '' is the latest experimenter in this field of fiction , and his work is singularly delicate in its expression and singularly penetrating in its analy - sis of tbe social and political forces that actuate men and women in
Washington	LOCATION	society .

		It is clearly the work of a first-hand observer , for it avoids the pitfalls that await anyone working in this material speculatively and at a distance .

		The contrast between the theory and the practice of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	can be understood only by the observer at close range , and a theoretical study of the documents , unsupplemented by direct observa - tion , is sure to result in a hopelessly distorted pic - ture .

		In its private aspect , this novel is by no means thrilling , for its characters are all elderly people who think well before they act , and do not permit passion to blur their vision .

		They are gen - uine individuals of interestingly varied types , actu - ated by motives which , whether mean or generous , find their full warrant in the facts of average hu - man nature .

		They include several men in high political positions , who do not seem to be actual characters in disguise , although the temptation to find for them such identification is now and then strong .

		A certain amount of composite construc - tion from actual life may perhaps be admitted ; more than this it would be rash to assume .

		Mr.
Jack	PERSON
London	LOCATION	has certainly done a clever and appealing piece of work in '' The Call of the Wild , '' which must rank high among animal stories and , pace Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, is made sufficiently con - vincing to dull skepticism while it is being read .

		Doubts arise afterwards , and they are probably legitimate , but while the spell of the story is upon us , we are willing to allow that a dog may have the complex inner life which is here depicted .

		For the hero of this book is a dog , and the human be - ings who appear are of only secondary importance .

		He is a dog kidnapped from his home in
Califor	LOCATION	- nia , where he has led an easy and irresponsible life , to be broken into the service of sled-hauling in
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		He makes many trips over the deso - late Northern trails , falling in succession to several masters , and shows himself equal to all emergen - cies .

		And all these experiences , while they harden his muscles and develop his adaptiveness to new conditions , are at the same time working power - fully to bring out the slumbering instincts of his wolfish ancestry ; he hears '' the call of the wild '' more and more distinctly , and civilization gradu - ally drops away from him , until in the end , the last and best of his masters having been slain by the Indians , he abandons civilization for good , and joins the wolf-pack , of which his strength and craft at once make him the leader .

		The story is cer - tainly an impressive one , made so by the author 's insight into canine nature , and by the infusion of much poetical feeling .

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	has not a lit - tle of the magic which makes '' The Jungle Book '' almost the best of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's writings .

		Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	has a pretty taste in titles . ''

		The Maids of Paradise '' is almost as alluring as '' Ashes of Empire , '' but it does not fit the subject matter quite as well .

		Paradise is a Breton village , and its maids are mostly legendary .

		There is one maid , however , the heroine , who is a very real per - son , and a charming one .

		She is the
Countess de Yassart	ORGANIZATION	, and a dreamer .

		She becomes the tool of an unscrupulous agitator , who poses in her presence as an apostle of universal brotherhood , and who is really a leader of the Reds of
Belleville	LOCATION	, and a master spirit of the
Internationale	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the story is of the war between
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	, a matter with which Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has already proved his acquaintance in the series of three romances which are probably his best .

		The hero in the present in - stance is an American going by the name of Scar - lett .

		We never learn what his real name is , for when he reveals it in the end , it is only in a whis - pered communication to the Countess .

		He is first an officer of the
Imperial Police	ORGANIZATION	, and in that ca - pacity takes part in the early frontier operations of the war , and , among other things , rescues the he - roine and discomfits the villain .

		Afterwards , dis - missed from the service , and forced to disguise himself , he joins an American circus traveling in
France	LOCATION	, and acts as lion-tamer .

		The scene is then transferred to
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, and the interest centres in a plot , engineered by the villain , to capture the crown treasures that have been sent to the
Breton	LOCATION	coast for safety .

		Amid much excitement the vil - lain is thwarted , while hero and heroine come to the usual understanding .

		The story is a capital 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, one , full of vivid action , and colored with the poet - ry of genuine romance .

		May the author give us many more of the kind , and increase the debt of our gratitude to him for wholesome and stirring en - tertainment .

		`` The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come '' is the quaint but not infelicitous title of a new story by Mr.
John Fox , Jr.	PERSON	, the longest that he has thus far written .

		The scene is
Kentucky	LOCATION	, the time that of the Civil War and the years preceding .

		The ele - ments of the story are all familiar : there is the ambitious boy struggling for education in a rude and uncouth environment , there is the clash of pas - sionate opinion incident to tbe outbreak of tbe
Great Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	, there are the inevitable family divisions and personal estrangements , there is the Southern heroine indignant at the course of the hero in becoming a
Union	LOCATION	soldier , tbere are the battle scenes and the opportunities they afford for mutual services on tbe part of the friends in the opposed camps , and there is the chastened conclusion and reconciliation .

		All these things , of course , have been described many times before , but rarely with equal charm and poetic sentiment .

		Specifically , the story reflects the war as it was felt in a
Border State	ORGANIZATION	, where it was harder to bear than elsewhere because of the intimate ties which it was sure to sunder , and in this respect Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has given us a fair counterpart of what was given us by Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	in `` The Crisis . ''

		The most important historical figure is that of
John Morgan	PERSON	the raider , whose dashing career provides many picturesque and dramatic incidents .

		The first part of the book , describing the hero 's boyhood , is the best ; the war part is too confused to be wholly successful .

		But whatever its defects , the book is one that does marked credit to its author , and insures for him henceforth a position the promise of which was held out by his earlier work , although the fullfil - ment has been long delayed .

		Still another Civil War story , in its main outline running curiously parallel to the one just discussed , is `` The Vagabond , '' by Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	.

		Here again is an orphan hero , a runaway in child - hood , who becomes a man and a soldier , fights on the
Union	ORGANIZATION	side through the four years of strife , and wins the love of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	heroine after the neccessary difficulties and misunderstandings .

		He starts life somewhere in
New England	LOCATION	, and reaches the field of warfare after a detour to
California	LOCATION	with the forty-niners .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has been more successful with his war scenes than Mr.
Fox	PERSON	, and his account of
Bull Bun	ORGANIZATION	is particularly well done .

		Tbe later scenes take in the
Shenandoah	LOCATION	and the final operations about
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's style is not nearly so good as that of Mr.
Fox	PERSON	; it is often careless and some - times difficult .

		The `` vagabond '' hero is a very engaging youth in all the stages of his career ; his straightforward ingenuousness makes friends for him both within and without the book , and serves him far better than either subtlety or craft would have done .

		This quality is combined with the qualities of self-confidence and determination , and the combination proves equal to the most stubborn occasions .

		Among the countless stories of the Civil War that have thus far been written , the two we have just described must be set very near the top of the list .

		Mr.
Henry Burnham Boone	PERSON	, who has written two
Virginia	LOCATION	novels in conjunction with Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- neth
Brown	PERSON	, now gives us , in '' The Career Tri - umphant , '' a book that is wholly his own .

		It is a breezy book , with no pretensions to style , telling its story pleasantly , and from an intimate acquaintance with the ways of Virginians .

		The heroine is a tal - ented girl who makes for herself a `` career triumph - ant '' upon the stage , and the conflict between her ambition and her love keeps the story going until it has attained the dimensions necessary to a self - respecting novel .

		This feat is accomplished by a resort to the old device of the misunderstanding which keeps the lovers apart for several years .

		It is hard to imagine what our novelists would do if they had not this trick to fall back upon , or if their readers were suddenly to lose interest in persons who , otherwise sensible and intelligent , are repre - sented as capable of this particular sort of foolish - ness where their chief interests are concerned .

		`` The Millionaire 's Son , '' by Mrs.
Anna Robe	PERSON	- son
Brown	PERSON	, has for its scene a university town in
New England	LOCATION	.

		The university is named Chilling - worth , and corresponds to no actual institution , al - though there is now and then a possible suggestion of either
Williams	ORGANIZATION	or
Brown	PERSON	.

		The principal char - acter is a young man born to wealth -LRB- as the title indicates -RRB- but inheriting a marked intellectual bent , presumably from his grandfather , who is a delight - ful figure of a belated transcendentalism keeping his soul alive on the spiritual memories of New En - gland 's golden age .

		The young man honestly at - tempts to meet his father 's wishes , and devote him - self to the business operations which have prospered so exceedingly in the hands of the older man .

		But the scholarly impulse proves too strong for him , and his course is eventually decided by his successful competition for a university scholarship , offered by an unknown benefactor , and providing a generous income for its recipient .

		It turns out that his father is the unknown donor , but the prize has been fairly won , and the son accepts it , together with the con - sequence of being cut off from the family fortunes .

		A suitable heroine is provided , who finally yields because of this sacrifice , and who is an altogether charming and high-minded young woman .

		The es - sence of the book is found in this conflict between the lower and the higher motive , and the narrative is informed throughout by a true and healthy ideal - ism .

		It is , moreover , an exceptionally well-written and interesting story , with much variety of charac - ter and incident , and many happy bits of detail .

		It reflects some things that are not pleasant , such as the snobbishness of a society in which the Brah - min caste persists , and the commercial conception
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 263 of a university sometimes held by its trustees , bat these things are true , and belong to the picture .

		Curiously enough , a second novel coming to us at the same time is also concerned with the life of a university town , and is , like the other , the work of a woman .

		In `` The Law of Life , '' by Miss
Anna McClure Sholl	PERSON	, the university stands out as a distinctly-drawn portrait of
Cornell	LOCATION	, although the characters are not particularly suggestive of actual person ?

		.

		In this novel , the interests of the
University	ORGANIZATION	occupy the entire ground , and the traits of its deni - zens are portrayed with peculiar intimacy .

		The tone of its special combination of social and academic life is caught with surprising success -- the narrow - ness of the intellectual horizon , the interrelations of a small society thrown almost wholly on its own resources , and the momentous significance assumed by petty questions of rank , and promotion , and com - pensation .

		The exaggerated self-consciousness of the student body of such an institution has often been exhibited in tales of college life ; the present work gives us as a counterpart the special type of equally exaggerated self-consciousness developed in the members of the teaching body and their wives .

		The one broad question raised which involves a principle of ethics is that of the attitude of a uni - versity toward the would-be benefactor of dubious reputation .

		In this case his name is
John Rebbor	PERSON	-LRB- a name better understood when spelled backwards -RRB- and he offers an endowment of millions on condition of being made a trustee .

		The single scene in which he appears in person is remarkably well done .

		The outcome of the gift is the triumph of the president 's worldly wisdom , and the dismissal of the young in - structor who has led the opposition .

		We have said nothing thus far to account for the title of the book , which has also its aspect as a study of genuine hu - man passion .

		This same young instructor has for his chief a middle-aged and absent-minded professor of mathematics .

		And this same professor has for a ward a shy and unsophisticated maiden who comes to college knowing much of books but nothing of life .

		The guardian finds it pleasant to have her about , and asks her to marry him , which she con - sents to do .

		After the wedding , he returns to his problems , and leaves her to amuse herself .

		Mean - while , the young instructor discovers that he loves her , and she , gradually awakening to the meaning of womanhood , finds out to her horror that she is far more deeply interested in the younger than in the older man .

		Then follow the usual struggles and temptations , but her Puritan conscience wins the victory , and the moral law -- '' the law of life '' -- is vindicated .

		In proportion as she rises in our esteem the man sinks , and he gets much the lesser share of our sympathy when in the end he goes forth into the world to begin life over again .

		The author of this novel is to be congratulated upon a performance that is far above the average in artistic and ethical quality .

		`` The Castle of Twilight , '' by Miss
Margaret Horton Potter	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs. Black -RRB- , is a somewhat slighter performance than the earlier books of this talented writer , but exhibits , if anything , an advance in lit - erary skill .

		It is , in a sense , a historical romance of the days of feudalism , and seeks especially to portray the conditions under which women of noble birth lived their lives in those far-off days .

		There are no adventures worth speaking of , and no spec - tacular dramatic situations , but there is instead a deeply sympathetic portrayal of the conditions of every-day domestic existence in a Breton castle , remote from the world in which arms clash and passions rule .

		There are passions , to be sure , in the existence of these secluded women , but they are subdued in tone , and their tragic issue is softened .

		The book has many tender and graceful pages , and in place of excitement offers us that elusive quality which we call atmosphere for lack of a more definite characterization .

		The title is happily suggestive of the melancholy and even sombre tone of the entire composition .

		Historical romance of a very different sort , sprightly -LRB- too sprightly -RRB- , stirring , and filled with a certain sort of actuality , is given us by
Miss Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	in * The Shadow of Victory , '' a story of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	and the Indian massacre which marks the entrance of early
Chicago	LOCATION	into spectacular his - tory .

		The story was clamoring for treatment , and
Miss Reed	ORGANIZATION	has done fairly well with it , although the material is thin and requires to be eked out by many trivialities .

		As a whole , it has neither depth of insight nor strength of grasp , but it keeps the in - terest awake , and the climax , when at last reached , is vigorously presented .

		The horror of that
August	DATE	day , when the devoted little band of whites started for the
Fort Wayne	LOCATION	trail , knowing that they were advancing to as sure a fate -LRB- and one more horrible -RRB- as that which faced the heroic Spanish sailors at
Santiago	LOCATION	, is depicted with perhaps as much of ro - mantic coloring as is admissible without departing far from the recorded facts .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Interpretations of the life of a Western millionaire resident in
New York	LOCATION	form the theme of Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	's '' Letters Home '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The daugh - ter of a rich man writes to a girl friend in
Iowa	LOCATION	; a yonng man with literary ambitions writes to the editor of the local paper ; his friend , an employee of the rich man , writes to his brother , the clergyman in the town ; the secretary and companion of the rich man 's daughter writes to her mother in
Central New York	LOCATION	; and a
Boston	LOCATION	man of leisure sends word of his impressions of them all to his sister-in-law in
New England	LOCATION	.

		The book affords proof of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's earlier statement that practically all Americans , in or out of cities , are country born and bred ; and so of the corollary that they are pretty much at heart the same sort of human beings .

		The complicated little romance in the letters might quite as well have worked itself out in the
Iowa	LOCATION	home of most of the characters , the enormous wealth being too recently acquired to have hardened the hearts 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of its possessors .

		The nice differentiation of individ - ualities which is so entirely Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's may be seen here at its best , especially his understanding of the feminine mind which relates him to
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	.

		Of the three latest works of fiction from this distin - guished hand , this is perhaps the most generally inter - esting .

		In her new book , slight as it is in volume ,
Miss Alice Brown	PERSON	proves anew her right to rank with the best American writers of fiction . ''

		Judgment '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is so brief it must be called a novelette .

		Its protagonist is the wife of a man of the largest commercial affairs , governed by a severe sense of justice to which , presum - ably , he has in turn sacrificed his son , his daughter , and is on the point of sacrificing all his employees when the story begins .

		As a matter of spiritual fact , it is the wife whom he loves so passionately and tenderly who has been the real , if vicarious , sacrifice on every occasion .

		She is engaged , after the manner of wholly unselfish womanhood , in attempting to keep her son 's affianced wife from a sorrow that rises from his past as well , and comes within a little of giving up her love in the deed .

		Her danger awakens her husband to the truth which his daughter forces upon him , and the book concludes simply , after dealing with the most subtle of human motives .

		It is a worthy piece of literature in every respect .

		One notes an unusually large proportion of novels of the day in which either the hero , the heroine , or both , are far past the first flush of youth .

		In some of these books there is unquestionably the reflection of an age of growing luxury in which matrimony is deferred until a high standard of living can be maintained .

		In others it is probably due to the writer 's advancing age on one side , and to the late coming into the leisure necessary for the indulgence of the reading habit on the other .

		Whatever the reason ,
Miss Eliza Orne White	PERSON	's ''
Leslie Chilton	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is unusual , even among its kind , in making the hero an elderly widower with several children , who gains and keeps the affection of a girl through his intellectual and moral worth .

		By way of compensating disadvantages , the young woman is an ardent advocate of equal political rights for her sex , a fact which leads to her acquaintance with her true love , and , through the curious medium of a public debate on the question , to their better knowledge of one another .

		Their marriage under the circumstances is in some - thing of the nature of an armed neutrality .

		Slight as the materials for romance are in such a story ,
Miss White	LOCATION	has made the most of them , never falling below an assured if mild degree of interest .

		Among the serious works of art put forth in the guise of the historical novel , ''
Gorgo	PERSON	, a Romance of Old Athens '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- shows not only an adequate conception of the story-teller 's function , but a close knowledge of the time and country treated , and their availability for the purposes of romance .

		The author is Professor
Charles K. Gaines	PERSON	, Ph.D. , of the
St. Lawrence University	ORGANIZATION	; and it is unnecessary to add that his chair is that of Greek .

		Here the great deeds and sorrows of the Athenians in the days of Pericles unroll before the reader 's eyes .

		The overthrow in
Sicily	LOCATION	, with the death of
Socrates	LOCATION	, -- the saddest episode in Grecian history , -- finds its due place in the narrative ; and no higher praise can be awarded than to say that the English account leaves an adequate impression of the disaster as we know it from
Thucydides	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations , by Mr.
George Varian	PERSON	, really illustrate the text , and the book is handsome in outward form .

		An artless story of the
Maine	LOCATION	woods , and of a little settlement on their verge and far from a railway , will be found in '' The Hermit '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Clark Munn	PERSON	.

		At almost a single stroke , a young man who has left the town and made his fortune in the great world puts himself in the way of regaining his boyhood 's sweetheart and of clearing up a mystery that has harrowed the community for many years .

		In a remote nook of the great forest that stretches over
Maine	LOCATION	and
British America	LOCATION	to the eastward , he chances upon the strange old fellow who gives title to the story , and who proves to be the co-heir to the large property that has been amassed by the town miser .

		A rude sort of poetic justice is dealt this sordid old man through the instrumentality of a small boy he has deeply and doubly wronged .

		Apart from this , the book is a peace - ful and happy one , with many well-defined personalities in its pages , -- that of the narrator , conventionalized by contact with wider interests , being the most poorly defined of them all .

		The `` labor question '' fills a large share of the pleas - ant story told by Miss
Mary Moss	PERSON	under the title of '' A Sequence in Hearts '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , one of the lead - ing characters being the owner and operator of an anthracite mine .

		The difference in a business personally conducted as this is , and of one in the hands of an impersonal and soulless corporation , is well marked .

		But the real meaning of the story , as its nam * suggests , is to be found in the manner in which a young man gets on with a new love after he is off with the old .

		This , it is true , leaves the most fascinating personality in the story without even the shadow of a consolation , -- rather a striking defect in such a story ; but it is well worked out with this exception , and promises favorably for
Miss Moss	ORGANIZATION	's future in literature .

		Sixteen tales , each complete in itself , make up the contents of Mrs.
Elia W. Peattie	PERSON	's volume entitled '' The Edge of Things '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		All of them have to do with the confines of American civilization , most of them hav - ing their scene laid in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, where the shep - herd has succeeded to the cowboy , but some of them carrying the tale on to the Klondike region .

		Practically the same persons appear and reappear in the entire series , working out a number of distinct romances .

		The strength of Mrs.
Peattie	PERSON	's writing lies largely in her ability to correlate the spiritual life of her people with their surroundings , and she has here sought to accom - plish for the sheep rancher what she has previously done for the dweller in the Western mountains , and the farmer on the prairies of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley .

		Mrs.
George C. Biggs	PERSON	-LRB-
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	-RRB- brings to her ''
Rebecca	PERSON	of Sunnybrook Farm '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the same delightful play of wit that animated her tales of foreign travel ; and her story is the pleasantest possible reading in consequence .

		It follows the fortune of a spirited and mischievous little girl , through her school graduation into her work as teacher in one of the bleak - est parts of
New England	LOCATION	-- bleakest in both a material and spiritual sense .

		A man of means and cultivation comes into her life very early , and at the close of the book bids fair to remain in it until the end .

		Rebecca can be depended upon to endear herself to the reader long before the story is done , and the general impression left by the book is one of gratefulness to the author .

		A pretty little study of
Provence	LOCATION	at the height of its literary fame has been made by Mrs.
Julia de Wolf Addison	PERSON	in '' Florestane the Troubadour , a Mediaeval
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		265 Romance of
Southern France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The courts of love , the contests of the trouveres , the lawlessness of the barons , the power of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the superstitions regarding witches and their arts , and the splendor of the aristocracy , all have due place in the foreground , and are of the essence of romance .

		If any valid criti - cism is to be urged against the book , it is to the effect that the actors are not quite human enough , their deeds and words being as remote as their surroundings .

		The introduction of
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	,
Sordello	PERSON	, and
Dante	PERSON	, among the characters , is well carried off , once it is granted that the two last named are dragged in by the heels , so to speak .

		Following his curious tales of '' Captain Kettle , '' Mr.
Cutcliffe Hyne	PERSON	has found scope for his wide knowledge of the sea and its servants in another series grouped under the name of their narrator , `` McTodd '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Kettle , it will be remembered , was a reli - gionary of a pronounced Protestant type ;
McTodd	ORGANIZATION	is a Scotchman of views equally pronounced , but differing widely from his predecessor in manifesting his
Cal	LOCATION	- vinistic bias only when under the influence of much liquor .

		His adventures are in the Arctic zone for the most part , with some divergences into equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	.

		He is an engineer of a sort , and an interesting though wholly unlovable person .

		The book abounds in humor , sometimes of a rather broad and sailorlike flavor ; and it is pleasant to read for those who like ad - venture and the sea .

		There is always a placid sort of interest and whole - someness attaching to Miss
Rosa Nouchette Carey	PERSON	's stories , which can be perused without fear of their bringing a blush to the cheek of the most innocent , making them very safe reading for the young lady of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In '' A Passage Perilous '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB-
Miss Carey	PERSON	has gone as far toward extremes as is possible with her , her heroine marrying an officer in the British army after a mere shred of a courtship , leaving him at the church door immediately after the ceremony in compliance with orders taking him to the war just breaking in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Love was practically out of the ques - tion between them , but the dangers he suffers bring about their customary Othello-like effect , -- the attain - ment of a modus vivendi with his mother occupying most of the narrative between her husband 's departure and return .

		There is little attempt to portray the reconstructed Southerner in Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	's `` A Candle of Understanding '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , the story opening , just at the close of the war between the States , on a sugar planta - tion in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, with its proprietor in failing circum - stances .

		It is told by his daughter , a tiny girl at the outset , and follows her hard and unlovely life , until , years after , she achieves success on the metropolitan stage .

		The story is exceedingly well told , with a fine humor and an outline both delicate and firm .

		While the book says almost nothing about a reunited country , its entire trend is such that it can not help bringing about a better comprehension and sympathy , so far as the South , both old and new , is concerned ; and the few touches dealing with the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	negro make to the same end .

		Americans of the
Michigan	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	lumber regions , little known to readers of modern novels , crowd the pages of Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	's sympathetic and delightful '' Story of
Hunch Badeau	PERSON	, '' or as its chief title gives it , '' His Little World '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Whether the book is laid down with the feeling that its hero is con - ventionally American or not , it will surely be found that he is of his own place and time , and that , however uncouth , the author has here drawn the figure of a manly man .

		His career is that of captain of a lumber schooner trafficking on the Great Lakes , and involves many stir - ring episodes , including the loss of his vessel in a heavy gale .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	shows himself master of his mate - rials , and few books more convincingly realistic have been written .

		Mr.
Roswell Field	PERSON	has written his third graceful story and called it '' The Bondage of Ballinger '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It will recall his brother
Eugene	PERSON	's '' Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac '' in its choice of subject matter , the hero of it being himself an ardent lover of rare editions of worthy books .

		He is , moreover , a man of small means , a printer by trade , who keeps himself and his patient wife in poverty through his inability to withstand tempt - ation such as ordinarily besets the bibliophile .

		Fortu - nately for himself and the world , the charming old fellow undertakes to teach a youthful neighbor , only daughter of a merchant prince , what it is in books that is so engrossing ; and in later life it is she who acts as his preserver , -- more than that , as the preserver of his darling library .

		It requires both skill and courage to write a serene , placid , affectionately disposed story like this , in which there are no unworthy passions and none of what the modern reader calls '' love interest . ''

		Since the use by
Miss Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	of the word '' sprightly '' in one of her romances , no word has been as fit for their characterization as a whole .

		And of none of them is it any more apt than of `` The Fortunes of Fifi '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- .

		Given a bright and pretty little Italian girl , adopted as a Parisian by an old soldier of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, make them both actors in a little Parisian theatre , give her the Pope for an uncle and him the friendship of the great
Napoleon	PERSON	himself , and it is evident that all that happens must be inter - esting to dwellers in times and under skies less romantic than those that are here depicted .

		It required considerable daring for Mr.
Roland Burnbam Molineux	PERSON	to seize upon the notorious amour between Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Lord Nelson	PERSON	as the basis of '' The Vice Admiral of the Blue '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- , and almost as mnch to put the story in the mouth of Admiral Sir
Thomas Masterman Hardy	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	,
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's devoted friend and the receiver of his dying request .

		There is , of course , no reason why , if the facts are as they are here reported , they should be suppressed in order to leave the figure of
England	LOCATION	's greatest seaman as immaculate as it is heroic ; but when doubt so grave exists , as in the case of the entire series of episodes at the court of
Naples	LOCATION	, it is hardly fair to set them down as they are told here , without any question of their actuality .

		The rest of the story is intensely interesting , and is told with more than ordinary skill .

		It is a far cry to the Southwestern frontier when the army was still engaged in keeping peace between the aborigines and the settlers , but few books have the wealth of detail and of action utilized by General
Charles King	PERSON	in `` An Apache Princess '' -LRB-
The Hobart Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The various mysterious crimes that bring on an uprising of the Indians , and keep the garrison in a state of gos - sip , scandal , and turmoil , are very ingeniously contrived for holding the interest of the reader from cover to cover .

		The effect is somewhat melodramatic , though convincing as a whole .

		At the core of it all is a very pretty love-story .

		266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Briefs on New Books .

		The fourth and concluding volume VgXZZ ° * ^ e Cheyne-Black `` Encyclopaedia Biblica '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has appeared .

		It is distinctly and avowedly the most complete ex - ponent of the radical school of Biblical criticism yet published .

		Its staff of contributors includes some of the extremists both in the Old and
New Testament	LOCATION	fields .

		Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	himself leads the van in speculative and critical theories touching the Old Testament .

		This volume maintains the standard of its three predecessors , and , like the third , ventures out into the realm of Biblical the - ology .

		There are several notable articles whose titles and authors at least merit mention .

		Profes - sor Schniedel of
Zurich	LOCATION	contributes three long articles on '' Resurrection and Ascension-Narra - tives , '' `` Spiritual Gifts , '' and ``
Simon Peter	PERSON	, '' -- all of them permeated with the same spirit and method that characterized his contributions in earlier volumes of the work .

		Professor van
Manen of Leyden	ORGANIZATION	has written on '' Romans . ''

		A single sentence may point out his position on one point : `` What is certain , at any rate , is that the canonical epistle -LSB- Romans -RSB- is not by Paul '' -LRB- col. 4141 -RRB- .

		`` Sacrifice , '' by Professor
G. F. Moore	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, is a well prepared and comprehensive article .

		Pro- fessor F. C Barkitt contributes a most helpful treatment of '' Text and Versions . '' ''

		Trade and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
George Adam Smith	PERSON	, is an elaborate treatment on the basis of the latest discoveries in the inscriptions of the Orient , illus - trated by three useful maps .

		There are three other maps of exceptional value , illustrating or locating ancient and modern places .

		A new map of '' Trachonitis ,
Bashan	LOCATION	,
Hauran	PERSON	,
Golan	LOCATION	, etc. , '' de - scribes by colors the elevations of that newly sur - veyed district of Palestine .

		But the treatment of proper names is a more marked idiosyncrasy of this than of previous volumes .

		Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	's `` Jerahmeel '' derivation for hundreds of these names is here reduced to a veritable absurdity .

		The most valuable and permanent contributions to this volume are those articles that deal with themes archaeological and geographical .

		The radically critical positions will , of course , prove to be evan - escent and temporary .

		We congratulate the edi - tors on the completion of this great work .

		Of real interest , and real value too , ojapoet '' 9 * ° a ^ Wordsworthians is the volume on Wordsworth by Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	-LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The value of this mono - graph of 232 pages lies in the reasonableness of its author 's method and in the frank directness of his manner . ''

		A criticism of a poet that omits all reference to his failures is as futile a thing as a biography of a great soldier that passes in silence over his defeats . ''

		That Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	is sym - pathetic as well as dispassionate appears , however , at the start . ''

		Of
Wordsworth	PERSON	in particular it is hardly true to say that his strength and weakness are closely knit up together ; rather , they are the same ; his strength at its best is weakness made perfect , his weakness is the wasteful ebullition of his strength . ''

		This study of the poet is critical in the sense of being interpretative .

		Wordsworth 's cause most readers will consider already judged ; '' but there will always remain a certain curious minority of the human race whose desire is not so much to judge a poet as to understand him . ''

		In the process of attempting thus to `` explain '' the poet , primary importance is laid upon the confes - sions and assertions of `` The Prelude , '' which is made conspicuous throughout the book as oar most significant source of information concerning the development of the poet in the man .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's childhood and education are studied in the opening chapter ; the influences of the French Revolution and the notable benefits of the intercourse with
Coleridge	PERSON	are discussed in the second .

		We wish that this last-mentioned theme could have received more extended treatment ; a thorough study of the relations between these poets would be indeed a wel - come contribution to our acquaintance with both .

		Other chapters follow , upon
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetic diction , his attitude toward Nature , his feeling for Humanity , and upon his experiences of illumina - tion .

		But Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	's book is something more than a mere attempt to interpret
Wordsworth	PERSON	; his purpose expands with the study until we realize that this particular poet is being analyzed as a type of his genus ; and the processes by which this boy , roaming the hills of
Cumberland	LOCATION	and
Westmore	PERSON	- land , venturesome , passionate , headstrong , and heedless , grew into the sedate , contemplative inter - preter of '' The Being that is in the clouds and air , '' are taken to be
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's processes by which all poets born are matured into the poets who really are .

		Whether Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	's readers gain much actual knowledge of the mystery from his efforts to elucidate the secret , perhaps does not mat - ter ; they certainly owe him their thanks for a vol - ume of unusual interest in the field of personal interpretation , agreeable in style , and full of helpful and illuminating thought .

		Contemporary letters often correct the appearance of fixedness which the historical narrative inevitably gives to events .

		The drama revealed in them does not move on with the usual well-considered em - phasis of each element of the plot ; there is some - thing of the real confusion of the events them - selves .

		But reasoning like this is not required to encourage the reading of the letters of the Baron -
ess Bonde	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written amidst the surprises and the disillusionment * of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion of
1848	DATE	.

		The writer of the letters was at that time
Miss Robinson	PERSON	, the daughter of an Irish baronet who had lived in
Paris	LOCATION	since
1819	DATE	.

		Her long acquaintance among influential persons , diplo - Parit during -LRB- he Revolution of
1848	DATE	.


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 267 mats , and others , gave a special value to her letters , and they were at once appreciated by the English friends into whose hands they fell .

		Even '' the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	and
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	were said to have clamoured for them . ''

		This is not to be wondered at , for althongh occasionally they seem full of the echoes of distrust and discourage - ment which fly through the air in Revolutionary days , they portray vividly the movement of senti - ment in certain social strata during that strange
spring	DATE	and
summer	DATE	.

		Often they contain descrip - tions which must have been of great interest to the Englishmen who were familiar with every foot of
Paris	LOCATION	, and who could follow
Miss Robinson	PERSON	in her venturesome tours of exploration through the dis - ordered streets .

		The description of the
Boule	LOCATION	- vards just after the overthrow of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	, and the description of the
Rue St. Antoine	ORGANIZATION	after the terrible fighting in
June	DATE	, are particularly well drawn .

		The latter , especially , deserves to be compared with some of the finest pictures in Toc - queville 's Recollections , which is saying a good deal for it .

		For such passages as these , for the evi - dence scattered over the pages of the rapid pas - sing of great reputations like that of
Lamartine	LOCATION	, the letters have value also for the historical stu - dent , although he will not attach much weight to rumors which the salons took for realities .

		The book is provided with historical notes and a brief introduction by the editor , Miss
Constance E. Warr	PERSON	.

		The high tone and fresh enthusiasm * 3/i # , ^ own by Mr.
Henry Dwight Sedg	PERSON	- wick , Jr. , in his `` Essays on Great Writers '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , can not fail to give pleasure .

		Romance , chivalry , the love of one woman , the joy of combat , the glory of death in a good cause , the final triumph of the right -- in all these he strength - ens our belief , and helps us to see that books which tend to lessen our respect for the idols of our youth are not the best literature .

		Thackeray comes in for his share of condemnation , because he '' has no faith ; he does not entertain high expectations .

		His characters do shameless things , and
Thackeray	PERSON	says to the reader , ` Be not surprised , injured-seeming friend ; you would have done the like under the like temptation . ' ''

		With a keen appreciation of d' An - nunzio 's marvellous literary skill , he declares against him in no uncertain terms : `` We do not believe that a novel of the first rank can be made out of the materials at d'Annunzio 's command .

		Instead of humor he has scorn and sneer ; in place of con - science he gives us swollen egotism ; for the deep affections he proffers lust . ''

		In his chapter on
Lockhart	PERSON	's Scott Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	suggests the substi - tution of biography for Greek composition or even solid geometry in the school curriculum .

		This essay , though written to call attention toa -
River	LOCATION	- side '' edition of the
Life of Scott	ORGANIZATION	, sends us with such renewed zest to the Waverleys , that we can - not call it hack-work .

		Other chapters deal with
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Don Quixote	PERSON	, and `` En - glish and French Literature , '' besides the subjects already referred to .

		Wide scholarship , insight , imagination , and humor are found in these pleasant and instructive papers , which are chiefly reprints from the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' A wealth of apt and erudite quotation points the moral . ''

		The child is father to the man '' -LRB- page 23 -RRB- seems , like '' All that glitters is not gold , '' and many other popular misquotations , more than likely to hold its own against the correct reading .

		Ruskin 's '' Letters to
M. G.	PERSON	and H. by ` euMh .

		U ™ W -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- show him in a mood , now tender , now playful , that will be new to most of his readers .

		The initials mani - festly stand for Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's daughters Mary and
Helen	PERSON	.

		It was in
the seventh decade	DATE	of Rus - kin 's life , and the eighth of
Gladstone	PERSON	's , that the two met for the first time at
Hawarden	LOCATION	, not long after
Ruskin	PERSON	's tart reply to the Liberals of Glas - gow , rather comically disclaiming any more regard for either
Gladstone	PERSON	or Disraeli than for two old bagpipes blown by steam .

		Despite the violent con - trast in all respects between guest and host , they conceived a warm admiration for each other , and remained true friends .

		For
Mary Gladstone Rus	PERSON	- kin cherished a tender affection , addressing her in his letters as '' my darling little Madonna , '' '' dar - ling
Mary	PERSON	, '' `` my dear little Mother , '' `` you darling little Mother , '' etc. .

		This prodigal expenditure of endearments , which might indicate dotage in an - other , serves rather as a pathetic reminder in his case of the life barren of domestic joys that it was his lot to lead .

		To
Carlyle	PERSON	, his acknowledged '' master , '' he was wont to write in terms of almost equal tenderness , calling him '' dearest Papa , '' and signing himself , '' ever your faithful and loving son '' -- as is shown in a letter written in
1878	DATE	, and quoted by Mr.
George Wyndham	PERSON	in his pre - face to the present volume .

		Two short papers by
Canon Scott Holland	ORGANIZATION	are appended , treating of ``
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Gladstone	PERSON	, '' and `` The Dead Rus - kin . ''

		A profile view of
Ruskin	PERSON	in his old age , and an exquisite pencil sketch of
Mary Gladstone	PERSON	by
Burne-Jones	PERSON	, embellish the little book , which all sincere lovers of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	will heartily welcome .

		To others it will be as a gift of almonds to the tooth - less . ''

		The Aftermath ; or , Gleanings from MtowiwqjT .

		a Busy Life , called upon the outer cover , for purposes of sale ,
Caliban	ORGANIZATION	's Guide to Letters , '' -- such is the legend upon the title-page of an amusing skit by Mr.
Hilaire Bel	PERSON	- loc , published by
Messrs. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An intro - duction gives a personal account of the mythical Dr.
Caliban	PERSON	, a man of solemn platitudes and impressive mediocrity ; and then follow practical chapters upon such phases of the literary craft as reviewing , the short lyric , the interview , and the personal par. , all based upon the most correct Philistine principles , and illustrated by examples of the literary forms in question .

		We quote a model `` personal par . ''

		as 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, an example of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's quiet humor : `` It is not generally known that the late Lord Grumble - tooth rose from the ranks .

		His lordship was a singularly reticent man , and the matter is still shrouded in obscurity .

		He was , however , a politi - cian in the best sense of the word , and owed his ad - vancement to the virtues that have made
England	LOCATION	famous .

		The collection of domestic china at
Grumbletooth House	ORGANIZATION	will vie with any other col - lection at any similar house in the Kingdom . ''

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's fun is never boisterous , but it raises many a quiet chuckle ; and his satire , if subdued , is for that all the more deadly .

		We commend particu - larly the note on the five canons of effective style , and the following injunction can not be taken too seriously : '' As to the practice , which has recently grown up , of writing only when one is drunk , or of introducing plain lies into every sentence , they are quite unworthy of the stylist properly so-called , and can never permanently add to one 's reputation . ''

		We also call special attention to the '' opinions of the press , '' the `` errata and addenda , '' and the index .

		It is not every man who can make an index hu - morous .

		The absence of any complete manual iSSrSS < > f Nor t h American game birds is cited by Mr.
Dwight W. Huntington	PERSON	as the occasion for the preparation of his volume on `` Our Feathered Game '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		As the title indicates , this is a book for sportsmen .

		It is written by a successful and enthusiastic hunter , and from the point of view of one who finds in birds only a mark to shoot at or a toothsome tidbit .

		There is little appreciation of the naturalist 's interest , and often contempt for those who have a sentimental interest in birds or who seek , for example , to save our native doves from the fate of the passenger pigeon by protecting them from the sportsman 's slaughter .

		The author is open in his condemnation of market hunters , but regales his readers with glow - ing accounts of days of good hunting when the shooting was fast and furious and the record of the slaughter a phenomenal one .

		He calls for national game preserves in the natural haunts of wild fowl , -- especially water-fowl , which as yet have profited but little by our forest reserves and national parks .

		The rapid growth of great private preserves in re - cent year 8 is recorded , and the belief is expressed that in them the European custom of driving up game to the slaughter will become general .

		Brief color descriptions in the appendix and a number of plates of bird portraits will help the sportsman to identify the contents of his bag .

		A brusque style , with an abundance of varied anecdote , lend interest to the book .

		In accordance with a time-honored custom , the Christmas lectures be - fore the Royal Institution of
Great Britain	LOCATION	are always addressed to young people .

		A high order of intellectual development must be ac - corded British youth if Professor
J. A. Flemming	PERSON	's Wave * and Ripples .

		`` Waves and Ripples in Water , Air , and JEther '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- is to be taken as a criterion of their capa - city .

		The author has reduced to book form his lectures , which were abundantly illustrated by ex - periments with and demonstrations of the move - ments of waves and ripples in various media and their agency in the transmission of the several forms of energy .

		Beginning with the visible and well known forms in water , the author passes to the in - visible and less known vibrations in air and aether which are concerned with sound , heat , light , and electricity .

		Simple explanations are given of their properties and functions and of their utilization in the arts and industries .

		Thus we learn how the wave-making resistance of a battle ship is deter - mined and why a racing yacht makes but a small wave at the bow and leaves a clean wake behind .

		British and American models are figured , but their waves and ripples fail to show why the Queen 's cup remains in Yankee hands .

		Considerable attention is paid to the electrical phenomena which make wireless telegraphy possible , and a clear scientific description is given of the Marconi system .

		The phenomena of heat and light are only mentioned incidentally , but sound is very fully treated , with abundant illustrations .

		Enough of the book is free from technicalities to make it intelligible to the en - quiring reader , and enough of the fibre remains to whet his appetite for stronger meat .

		Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	has written a
Anthony	LOCATION
w %	PERCENT	ne .

		rather commonplace Life of An - thony Wayne for the `` Historic Lives '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Full use has been made of the meagre details which posterity knows of
Anthony Wayne	PERSON	the surveyor , and the author grasps the opportunity of making comparison with the early life of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		As
General Wayne	ORGANIZATION	, the subject provides more material , especially in connection with the battle of
Stony Point	ORGANIZATION	and the much later Indian battle at the
Fallen Timber	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ingratitude of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the treatment of Wayne is dwelt upon ; and
Washington	LOCATION	's poor opinion of the reckless general , even when ap - pointing him to the command of the Western army , is attributed to the influence of jealous fellow-officers in the Revolutionary days .

		The au - thor would have difficulty in proving to the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can public that
Silas Deane	PERSON	'' became a traitor '' to his country , to be mentioned in connection with
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		No patience is confessed for those who would palliate
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's conduct .

		A number of minor errors , like the inauguration of
Washington	LOCATION	on
March 4 , 1789	DATE	, can scarcely be condoned by the good literary style of the little biography .

		The late
Henry Demarest Lloyd	PERSON	's `` Newest Eng - land , '' a thorough study of the workings and extensions of popular government in
Australia	LOCATION	, has been through four editions , since it was first issued three years ago by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 269 BRIEFER MENTION .

		It was on the
last day of the year 1870	DATE	that the late Sir
Henry Yule	PERSON	dated the preface to his great edition of
Marco Polo	PERSON	, and added the words which dedicated the work to the Princess of
Piedmont	LOCATION	who afterwards became the Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Four years later , a second edition appeared , with much additional matter .

		From then until his death
fifteen years later	DATE	, Yule was every - where recognized as the chief authority upon the Vene - tian traveller and his book , and continued to accumulate new materials for future use .

		We now have , imported by the Messrs.

		Ruf us King 's ''
Ohio	LOCATION	, '' and
John Esten Cooke	PERSON	's '' Vir - ginia , '' in the '' American Commonwealths '' series , have just been reissued by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, each volume with a new supplementary chapter .

		Pro- fessor
Theodore Clarke Smith	PERSON	is the one who brings the history of
Ohio	LOCATION	down to date , and a like service is done for the history of
Virginia	LOCATION	by Mr.
William Garrott Brown	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, who has privately issued his rendering in verse of '' Odes from the Divan of Hafiz , '' freely rendered from literal translations , has made arrangements by which the book may be obtained from
Messrs. Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The special edition on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum has been sold out , but there remain a few copies of the ordinary edition on hand-made paper .

		Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	-
Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, announce for publication in the early Fall , an edition of
Hans Holbein	PERSON	's '' Dance of Death , '' with an introductory note by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		The volume will be printed entirely on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum , and will contain a complete series of the illustrations reproduced from the wood - cuts included in
Lyon	LOCATION	's edition of
1538	DATE	.

		The edition is to be limited to 750 copies .

		Arrangements have been made for the publication in
England	LOCATION	of the following
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	books of
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	: '' Long Will '' by Miss Flor - ence Converse , and '' The Young Ice Whalers '' by Mr.
Winthrop Packard	PERSON	, will be issued through Messrs.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish , in co-operation with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, a new school edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays called the `` Temple School Shakespeare . ''

		Though entirely distinct from the well-known '' Temple Shakespeare , '' it will be in its way equally attractive .

		The special features include a large-type text , an adequate introduction and full notes of a literary rather than philological character , together with a glossary .

		The illustrations are by well-known artists .

		• ` The Journal of English and Germanic Philology '' is the new title of the quarterly review which has hitherto been known as '' The Journal of Germanic Philology . ''

		With this extension of its scope , the periodical , now entering upon its fifth year , considerably enlarges its usefulness , and the association of Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	with Professor
Gustaf E Karsten	PERSON	, the former editor-in-chief , brings new strength to the enter - prise .

		The contents remain , as formerly , predomi - nantly of a linguistic character , although literature -LRB- in the historical sense , at least -RRB- finds its way into a number of the contributions .

		The death of
Henry Demarest Lloyd	PERSON	, on the twenty - eighth of last month , at the age of fifty-six , is a cause of sincere mourning to all who are working for the amelioration of social conditions .

		One does not need to approve of all his methods , or accept all his conclu - sions , to feel that the world is poorer for his loss .

		He was a reformer of the practical type , who was sure of what be wanted , and set about its accomplishment by deed as well as word .

		It has often seemed to us that his vision was clouded by sentiment , and that his deep sympathy with the toiler made him a biased judge of the complicated issues between labor and capital ; but we could never question his sincerity or his force .

		Born in
New York	LOCATION	, he lived there for the first twenty - five years of his life , aud made his mark in the movements for free trade and for municipal reform .

		After
1872	DATE	he was a resident of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and for many years an editorial writer for the '' Tribune . ''

		He was a valued reviewer for
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	in its earlier years .

		His books came late in life , and include `` Wealth against Commonwealth , '' `` Labor Copartnership , '' `` Newest Englaud , '' and `` A Country without Strikes . ''

		His power of marshalling facts and figures was extraordinary in its effective - ness , and although he was always an advocate , it was of causes in which he thoroughly believed .

		A gentle and lovable man , his memory is dear to all who knew him , and will remain a permanent inspiration for many lives .

		274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, THE STORY OF A BOOK .

		IN THREE CHAPTERS .

		* Chapter 2 .

		How the Book Is Made . ''

		A LL young people should have a dictionary ** ■ at their elbow ; and while you are about it , get the best -- get
Webster	PERSON	. ''

		So said a school journal many years ago , and the
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	took the phrase as their motto .

		`` Get the Best '' -- this for the public .

		`` Make the Best '' -- this for themselves .

		Successful business rests on two principles : make a good article , and let the world know it .

		In their work the Merriams have emphasized quality even more than publicity .

		Starting sixty years ago with the great fabric
Noah Webster	PERSON	had reared , they spent years in refash - ioning it for popular needs before publishing , and the
Webster	PERSON	's
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of to-day is the result of a long series of revisions .

		Spending freely for advertising , they have in the
last quarter century	DATE	spent a much larger sum for improvements , in re-editing and re - casting .

		Some leading member of the firm has always had the editorial work as his specialty , and between publishers and editors there has been thorough harmony and cooperation .

		The constant aim has been to make the best possible one-volume dictionary , for the use of the man on the street , the cultivated reader , the teacher and pupil , the scholar and expert , the mechanic , the foreign student , the whole read - ing public .

		The basal principle has been to employ the amplest stores of scholarship so as to best serve the average consulter .

		The qualities kept in view have been Accuracy , Clearness , Fullness , Convenience , Attractive - ness .

		Any single word in the vocabulary will illustrate these principles .

		First , the word is easily found , -- a strict alphabetical order being followed , with ingenious resources of arrangement and type to facilitate the search .

		Next , note that the word 's mere presence in the vocabulary shows that it has a certain standing .

		There has been no attempt to pile up numbers ; neither dead words nor gutter - scrapings have been favored ; something of merit and of permanence is implied in each word .

		Then comes the pronunciation , -- are - spelling which is quickly caught by the ordi - nary eye and ear ; and a use of the phonetic marks which every public school child has learned .

		Substantially these same marks , be - * Chapter 1 of `` The Story of a Book '' appeared in our previous issue .

		ginning with
Webster	PERSON	's Speller and extending into the nation 's school books , have been uni - fying the pronunciation of the whole people for a century .

		Next comes the etymology -- the parentage of the word in earlier tongues .

		Into this has gone a world of toil .

		When Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was questioned as to the source of his etymologies , he answered easily , '' Why , sir , here is a shelf with
Junius	PERSON	and
Skinner	PERSON	and others ; and there is a
Welch	PERSON	gentleman who will help me with the
Welch	PERSON	. ''

		But
Webster	PERSON	, though at the out - set well equipped according to the standard of the time , stopped in his work for years to ac - quire twenty foreign vocabularies .

		The next generation saw a great advance in linguistic science , and the fruits of this were harvested by a distinguished German scholar , Dr.
Mahn	PERSON	, for the
1864	DATE	edition .

		The later gains in etymology have been inwrought in the
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- national and its Supplement by the eminent Professor
Edward S. Sheldon	PERSON	, of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a result , each word 's treatment opens with its clear and exact lineage , on which the scholar 's eye pauses with fascination .

		Then come the definitions in their historical order .

		Accuracy and lucidity of definition ,
Webster	PERSON	's special distinction , have been the first aim and constant care of his successors in the work .

		The searcher for a special meaning finds it easily and to his satisfaction ; and , be - yond his original quest , his attention is apt to be caught by the curious way in which one meaning has grown out of another , by some bit of interesting fact , by a felicitous quotation or striking picture , and so his eye wanders over the page from one attraction to another .

		The old story of the man who found the dictionary interesting reading , but with a frequent change of subject , had a solid basis .

		There are few more entertaining volumes for a leisure hour than
Webster	PERSON	's International .

		The book has been naturally broadened by the addition to its vocabulary of various Tables .

		One goes to the dictionary for all sorts of words ; why not then for proper names , which require not definition but information ?

		So here in one Appendix are the world 's distinguished people of all times , some 10,000 ; name and its pronunciation , nationality , characteristic , birth and death dates .

		Here is the Gazetteer with more than 25,000 geographical titles , each line a miracle of condensed information .

		And here is a Dictionary of Fictitious Persons and Places in Literature , which one should hardly consult when his moments are precious , so strongly
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		275 do its pages fascinate and detain .

		These , and various other Tables -- foreign proverbs , ab - breviations , etc. -- too many to be here set down .

		Taken as a whole ,
Webster	PERSON	's Inter - national is , in the words of President Eliot of
Harvard	LOCATION	, '' a wonderfully compact storehouse of accurate information . ''

		This whole mass of information -- vocabu - lary and appendixes -- is constantly brought up to the latest date by an unintermitted pro- cess of revision .

		The results appear partly in occasional Supplements , more rarely in general revisions , and constantly in minute corrections made without announcement .

		Thus to the vo - cabulary of the International of
1890	DATE	there was added ten years later a Supplement of 25,000 new words and meanings .

		On the mere num - ber no stress is laid ; nothing is easier than to pitchfork words together by the thousand and ten thousand ; -- technical , obsolete , disrepu - table , and useless .

		The real need , the real task , comes in the sifting , the choosing from the huge welter of written and spoken language those words which have an individuality and in some way a real use .

		The International had made a satisfactory record of the English lan - guage until
1890	DATE	; the additition of 25,000 words , phrases , etc. , was a fair representation of the actual growth of the language for a de - cade in this swift , rushing , and prolific age .

		The contributors to this Supplement , besides the office staff , were such specialists as Presi - dent
Remsen of Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	,
Justice Brewer of the United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, General Greely of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Chittenden	PERSON	, director of the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Dudley Buck	PERSON	, and a score of other eminent experts .

		At this time the plates of the entire work were newly cast .

		Of other improvements , a good instance is the very recent and thorough revision of the
Biographical Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	and the Gazetteer .

		These have been worked over line by line and word by word , with reference to spelling and pronunciation as well as other information .

		In geography the publications of official boards have been consulted ; in hundreds of cases not thus to be settled recourse has been had to Mr.
Henry Gannett	PERSON	, chairman of the
U. S. Board	ORGANIZATION	on Geographic Names ; uncounted letters have been written to local authorities .

		The biogra - phies have not only been amended to include the fresh death dates , but old dates have been corrected , sometimes fifteen centuries back , and many minor points retouched .

		This revision , the work of able scholars , was , like the Sup - plement of New Words , supervised by Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	,
U. S. Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		As occasions arise , new words and meanings are frequently inserted in the body of the work by costly plate corrections .

		When
Ohm	ORGANIZATION	and Volt were redefined by
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	and
U. S.	PERSON	statute , the new measurements went into the body of the vocabulary ; when the
Roentgen	PERSON	ray was discovered , it was given due place and description ; when Appendicitis be - gan to plague humanity under its own name , it was duly entered ; and so in hundreds of cases .

		In its mechanical features , the
International	ORGANIZATION	, like its predecessors , is a serviceable , durable , and beautiful book .

		Made at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, by
H. O. Houghton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, its binding , paper , typography , all are fully up to the standard set long ago by its manufacturers and publishers .

		On the commercial side of their business , the
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	have found no occasion to resort to premiums , * ' combines , '' '' great reductions , '' and the various devices by which wares are foisted on indifferent or reluctant buyers .

		They have steadily offered good value for a reasonable price , and have found always an ample market .

		They have made a Subscription Edition of the
Interna	ORGANIZATION	- tional , with a Historical Supplement , corre - sponding in merit and attractiveness to the main work .

		The regular edition is sold through the bookstores , and it is a great satisfaction to the publishers that their relations with '' the trade '' -- as the bookselling fraternity is for some occult reason entitled -- have always been marked by confidence and cordiality .

		For some years past , the market has been flooded with large M
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionaries '' other than the
International	ORGANIZATION	, generally at a low price and often with extravagant claims as to authenticity and value .

		All these books have the same basis , the
Webster	PERSON	's of
1847	DATE	, on which the copyright has expired , and which was completely superseded by the ** Unabridged '' of
1864	DATE	, and that in turn by the editions of
1879	DATE	,
1890	DATE	, and
1900	DATE	.

		This now ancient vol - ume of
1847	DATE	, reprinted by cheap processes which have faithfully reproduced all the obso - lete scholarship , all the discredited etymologies , all the statements falsified by modern discov - ery , every accidental misprint , every blurred line and broken letter in the original ; padded out with supplementary matter , in one or two instances of some real value , in most cases crude 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, and of little worth , and in no case of first-class scholarship ; made generally with poor paper , print and binding ; sold sometimes under fairly honest descriptions , but frequently under false pretenses of being the authentic , modern , and best
Webster	PERSON	, -- these books have no standing with scholars , and for the general public they have no recommendation in comparison with the
International	ORGANIZATION	, except their cheapness .

		`` The best '' is never the cheapest .

		More exactly , using '' cheap '' as meaning '' low - priced , '' the best is never the cheapest ; while using cheap to signify good value relative to price , the best is generally the cheapest .

		Web - ster 's International is an expensive book , com - pared with dictionaries of a lower grade ; it is not expensive , compared with other works re - sembling it in the mental and material toil and cost involved in the construction . ''

		The best '' is stamped on every stage of its production ; on the original genius and life-long labor of
Noah Webster	PERSON	; the succession of eminent scholars who have perfected it ; the care which keeps it always abreast of modern knowledge ; and the mechanical processes which make a volume unsurpassed in usability , durability , and beauty .

		The series of authorized Abridgments , headed by the admirable
Webster	PERSON	's
Collegiate Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary , and ended by the '' Pocket , '' meet the various wants of different classes .

		But the English speaking public has been educated by
Webster	PERSON	and his successors beyond any other people to the common use of the large one - volume dictionary -- a work of some 2400 pages , with 5000 illustrations ; a complete in - terpreter of the English language ; a treasury of general information .

		Not for the scholar and the expert only , but for the merchant , the mechanic , the housewife , the professional man , the average man and woman , `` the best '' is none too good .

		But what impartial and competent authority shall decide among various claimants to supe - riority which is the best ?

		In the next issue shall be cited on that question the pronouncements of three tribunals , widely diverse in character , and all of the highest standing .

		It is n't a bit of sprint work , good for a hundred yards .

		He keeps up the pace ; indeed , he grows better as he proceeds ... It is a far better book from all points of the literary compass than his ` Graustark ' and he fairly wins his spurs in it ... '' --
Cleveland	LOCATION	Leader . ''

		It is a strong story in its chief points and in delinea - ment of character . ''

		--

		`` His unflagging vigor and veracity compel respect . ''

		Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's book has all the elements of success , being a plain unadorned story of real life , carrying the conviction of its reality on every page . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 316 NOTES 317 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 318 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 318 WILLIAM EDWARD HARTPOLE L ECKY .

		Among the historians of the older genera - tion , who knew how to temper the scientific method with the philosophical spirit , and who did not disdain the adventitious aid of literary grace in the composition of their works , the great Irishman who has just passed away will always be given a high place .

		Born in
1838	DATE	,
William Edward Hartpole Lecky	PERSON	achieved dis - tinction at an early age .

		Only two years after he had taken his first degree at
Trinity Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ,
Dublin	LOCATION	, he published the group of essays on Swift , Flood ,
Grattan	LOCATION	, and
O'Connell	PERSON	, which first gave the public the measure of his abili - ties .

		This volume , entitled `` The Leaders of Public Opinion in
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' embodied esti - mates , at once searching and sympathetic , of the men who stood for Irish nationalism a hun - dred years ago , when the question of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	occupied the foreground of political discussion .

		The successive revisions of this book , the last of which appeared only a few months ago , offer an interesting study of the growing conserva - tism of the writer , for , although he sympa - thized with the opposition to the Act of
1800	DATE	, he accepted it as a fait accompli , and his face was set , in his later years , against the home rule agitation which sought in some measure to undo the work of
Pitt	PERSON	and weaken the bonds of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		For this course he earned his share of violent abuse from the ex - cited Irish nationalists of the time , and the quiet approval of all philosophical and far - seeing students of human affairs .

		The first appearance of the work above - mentioned was followed , two years later , by the '' History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' while four years after that a second large work was pro- duced having for its title '' A History of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean Morals from
Augustus	LOCATION	to Charlemagne . ''

		These works appealed to a far wider public than had been drawn to the essays on Irish leaders , and established the author 's reputation as one of the clearest and soundest of modern historians .

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	was barely thirty years of age when both these productions stood to his credit , and they have held their place as 296 THE DIAL .

		-LRB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, standard works upon their subjects for so long a period that it is not easy for men of our younger generation to realize that the years of their author were but sixty-five when their tale was completed a few days ago .

		He seems to have belonged to as old a generation as that of Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, for example , but Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is now eighty years old , and had achieved marked distinction when Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	was but a youngster .

		The introduction to the '' History of Ration - alism '' makes the following statement of the author 's aim : '' My object in the present work has been to trace the history of the spirit of Rationalism ; by which I under - stand , not any class of definite doctrines or criticisms , but rather a certain cast of thought , or bias of reasoning , which has during the last three centuries gained a marked ascendancy in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The nature of this bias will be exhibited in detail in the ensuing pages , when we examine its influence upon the various forms of moral and intellectual development .

		At present , it will be sufficient to say , that it leads men on all occasions to subordinate dogmatic theology to the dictates of reason and of conscience , and , as a necessary consequence , greatly to restrict its influence upon life .

		It predisposes men , in history , to attribute all kinds of phenomena to natural rather than miraculous causes ; in theology , to esteem succeeding systems the expressions of the wants and aspirations of that religious sentiment which is planted in all men ; and , in ethics , to regard as duties only those which conscience reveals to be such . ''

		The determination thus evinced to recognize the paramount importance of the dictates of reason in dealing with the vexed problems of conduct and religious thought characterizes the entire development both of this work and of the '' History of Morals '' which soon fol - lowed it .

		Such a programme does not appear very startling to us , but to the public of a generation ago it made Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	seem a very dangerous radical .

		The softening of old preju - dices and the dissipating of old dogmatisms which have marked the last thirty or forty years have brought silent but convincing testi - mony to the clearness of his vision and the essential soundness of his principles .

		The next great work of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	was his '' History of
England	LOCATION	in the Eighteenth Cen - tury . ''

		This work embraces four volumes , and their publication falls between
1878	DATE	and
1882	DATE	.

		The treatment is not chronological , nor does it involve the attention to details found in his - tory of the conventional sort .

		It is rather , in the author 's own words , an attempt '' to dis - engage from the great mass of facts those which relate to the permanent forces of the nation , or which indicate some of the more enduring features of national life . ''

		We have , then , in this work , a philosophical discussion in the best sense , a treatment of English history which deals in the main with political ideas , with social institutions , and with the development of the various forces that make for culture and enlightenment .

		The work is one which every student of modern English history finds indis - pensable for his purposes .

		To American stu - dents , in particular , it is valuable for its judicial and dispassionate treatment of the revolt from English rule which made an inde - pendent nation of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's two remaining works of im - portance are his '' Democracy and Liberty , '' dated
1896	DATE	, and '' The Map of Life , '' dated
1899	DATE	.

		In the first of these works he discusses the faults of democracy as they appear in the eyes of a life-long liberal , or , in other words , of a critic predisposed to sympathize with the principles of popular government , but also de - termined to hold it up to an exalted standard of conduct .

		The truest friends of democracy are those who , like Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	, unsparingly censure its shortcomings , and insist that it can justify its existence in no other way than by making clearly manifest its superiority over the older polities which it seeks to supplant .

		In '' The Map of Life '' the ripeness of a scholar 's wisdom is brought to bear upon the problems that chiefly press upon the modern world for solution .

		The book is concerned with the two great themes of '' conduct and character , '' and the author , always prominently a moralist , here becomes predominantly one .

		Even more than Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's earlier books , this collection of essays places their author distinctly among the small number of great thinkers who have reduced prejudice and per - sonal predilection to a minimum , who have discarded hobbies and are incapable of wild vagaries , and who are essentially right in their view of the questions with which they deal .

		He is of the company of such men as Mill and Huxley and
John Fiske	PERSON	and
John Morley	PERSON	and
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	-- men whose devotion to truth is absolute , and who are incapable of making any sort of compromise with error .

		Our account of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's writings would be noticeably incomplete without a few words about the small volume of '' Poems '' which he published about ten years ago .

		It was an un - pretentious little volume , and got small atten - tion from the public .

		Those who took the trouble to mention it in a critical way seem to have taken for granted that a writer of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's severe philosophical cast could not
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		297 compose verses that were worth reading , and to have expressed their opinion without attempt - ing to verify it .

		To us the volume came as a delightful surprise , for it displayed qualities of grace and tenderness , of deep emotion and no - bility of temper that could hardly have been in - ferred from the author 's prose .

		The verses are reflective , and tinged with melancholy , inspired by the Wordsworthian tradition , and belonging in the same category with those of Arnold and
Clough	PERSON	.

		If we may not linger over these deli - cate and wistful songs , we may at least find in one of them -- '' The Dying Seer '' -- a sort of epitaph for their author , now departed from the community of the living .

		`` Close the book -- the words are written , They will stand for good or ill ; True , the stately palm is smitten , Bnt its seeds are living still ; Darkness gathers round the writer , Envious murmurs greet his name , But his thoughts will shine the brighter In the after-glow of fame . ''

		THE REIGN OF THE SPECTACULAR .

		In the varied phases of modern thought and ac - tivity , the obvious holds unchallenged sway .

		The deeds that are conspicuous , the ideas that are garish , the literature that is episodic and pictorial , gain the popular favor .

		The eye of the senses is regnant , -- often a substitute for ear , imagination , and reason .

		Surface-impressions satisfy ; '' the eyes of our un - derstanding '' are dimly enlightened .

		In the ver - nacular of the American youth , every entertainment is a `` show , '' whether at the theatre or the church , at home or at school .

		With all possible tribute to the progress and appreciation of art during the
last quarter-century	DATE	, one must admit that there is a craze for pictures and pageants apart from their essential or even relative value .

		There is a commercial de - mand for all grades of illustration , from classics to crudities .

		No calling , no field of activity , is exempt .

		The clergyman who uses an angling-line and bait as illustration in his sermon , the '' reportorial artist '' who haunts the President and '' catches five facial expressions '' during an earnest address , the prolix hack-writer who produces an emblazoned book of travel in countries that he has never seen , the hostess who entertains by a flaring vaudeville , -- all these are alike offenders against dignity and taste .

		Speakers of renown may find listeners to a discourse upon some scientific or literary theme , but even such are occasionally startled by the inquiry , `` Have n't you some lectures with lantern slides ? ''

		Privileged to listen to Mrs. MeynelFs sympathetic interpreta - tion of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	,
Vaughan	PERSON	, and their Cavalier com - panions , I heard , in exit , the following sentences : `` Was n't she charming ? '' ''

		Oh , yes , I was glad to hear her , but I do n't care much now for lectures unless they are illustrated . ''

		What , indeed , had this poet-essayist accomplished , if she had not illustrated her chosen authors ?

		The true meaning of the word , -- to elucidate , or make luminous , -- seems almost lost in its exclusive reference to '' sense material . ''

		Comment is needless upon the supremacy of the pictorial journal , and upon the scanty discrimination , among the mass of readers , as to literary or artistic merits .

		Only experience could make credible the fact that in homes , refined in other ways , the `` pic - ture section '' of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper is given to > the children as amusement , -- lofty pabulum for the traditional if not lineal descendants of the Puritans I
Lowell	PERSON	's words are relevant : '' Good taste may not be necessary to salvation or to success in life , but it is one of the most powerful factors of civilization . ''

		The alliance of picture and text dates back even to the crude wood-cuts of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's '' Game and Play of the Chesse '' in
1476	DATE	, and the early broadsides down to
Bewick	PERSON	and his successors .

		Pictorial and lit - erary art have been reciprocally stimulating .

		Hiram Powers 's '' Greek Slave '' evoked one of Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's most tender sonnets .

		Giotto 's portrait of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	inspired
Lowell	LOCATION	to rare verse .

		The
Cenci	PERSON	gave incentive to
Shelley	PERSON	's drama and
Hawthorne	PERSON	's romance .

		Many an artist of a later generation has infused fresh vitality into a hackneyed literary model .

		Millai8 visualized
Effie Deans	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Abbey	PERSON	's character-interpretations have revealed anew the creative genius of both poet and painter .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	and Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	have been rejuvenated by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	's delineations .

		`` Lewis Car - roll '' could not have foreseen the revival of popu - larity which would greet his wonderland-child when Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	should portray the droll fancies of his creation .

		Because of the usefulness of such commingled art of a high grade , one must the more deplore the bizarre in text and illustration .

		Perhaps with pre - vision of this danger ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	wrote his sonnet on `` Blustrated Books and Magazines , '' with its warning , -- '' Avaunt this vile abuse of pictured page !

		Must eyes be all in all , the tongue and ear Nothing ?

		Heaven keep us from a lower stage ! ''

		As a natural means of educating the starved im - aginations of children , victims of the lifeless , sta - tistical text-books of the past , as a road to forming word-concepts and moral ideas , picture-studies have been of inestimable value .

		A few far-seeing stu - dents of pedagogy , however , have sounded the alarm against excess of picture-teaching , lest it defeat its end and leave inert both mind and fancy .

		To cul - tivate individual ideas , to educe subjective interpre - tations of life and letters , is the desideratum of all education ; such results are often hindered by excess of scenic material .

		The fashion of dramatized novels , to keep pace with the melodramatic trend of modern life , is only an extravagant revival of earlier literary custom .

		Shakespeare dramatized chronicles , traditions , and 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, the meagre fiction then available .

		Scott and
Dickens	PERSON	were often staged during the years of their first j success .

		A bibliography of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	mentions over I fifty plays adapted from his works , five versions of ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' appearing the year of its publication . ''

		Monte Christo , '' ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' ''
Rip Van Winkle	PERSON	, '' and `` Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' are only a few of many familiar examples of long-popular dramatizations .

		The danger to-day , however , lurks in the motives of the authors .

		Dickens and
Scott	PERSON	and
Irving	PERSON	did not write to satisfy an immediate audience .

		Literary impulse actuated their fiction ; pictorial and dramatic effects were interwoven as natural expressions of theme or characters .

		Within the essence of the life portrayed is the dynamic force , the truly dramatic force , in all literature of highest rank .

		One can readily recall novels of the past and present , of strong dramatic power , where both action and dialogue were scantily used in di - rect evidence , but where analysis and interpretation have projected the characters and theme upon the reader 's mind with great dramatic force .

		Of such types are ''
Daniel Deronda	PERSON	'' and ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	, '' `` The Scarlet Letter '' and ``
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	, '' `` The Valley of Decision '' and `` The Mettle of the Pasture . ''

		In the effort to adapt fiction of the most delicate literary quality to the stage , there is generally a loss of subtle charm , both in characterization and emo - tional development .

		To hasten in unveiling the gradual mental processes , in response to the demands of the stage , is to detract from subtlety and strength .

		After witnessing a few of the popular dramatiza - tions of romance , one can appreciate the dread of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	when she heard that ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' was to be staged , and her unwillingness to witness it ; and can sympathize with the sarcasm of a present - day novelist to her playwright , '' I congratulate you upon the success with which you have dramatized the title of my novel . ''

		To justify the excess of melodrama and the drama - tized romance , the half-truth has been reiterated , '' After all , we go to the theatre to see a spectacle . ''

		In gratifying this surface pleasure , which is really only a means to an end , we have forgotten the primal use of the stage for religious and moral culture .

		There may seem a radicalism in the proposed ex - periment , in one or two specific cases , to unite the theatre and the church ; yet such would be only a return to historical models .

		The revival of the best Moralities , heralded by '' Everyman , '' will achieve more than passing amusement or merely intellectual culture .

		The dramaturgic devices in such plays will not submerge the motive and symbolism , and the drama will thus become a potent religious agency , as it was in the days before the reign of Puritanism .

		The inventions and mechanical devices used in pro- ducing '' Ben-Hur '' occasioned wonder in the world of art and science ; the religious element and the personalities , however , were subservient to the glit - tering pageant , in marked contrast to the simple and soul-stirring miracle-plays at
Oberammergau	LOCATION	, Brix - legg , and other peasant villages in
Southern Europe	LOCATION	.

		In the complex mental and social phases of modern life , there are classified interests ; and the indivi - dual 's choice defines his tastes and moral standards .

		To meet the excessive demand for the spectacular , however , the higher grades of fiction and drama have been pushed aside , and many a promising imagination has been perverted by undue attention to vapid or erotic plays .

		With anxiety , a manager of loftier aim ventures to offer an occasional work of literary excellence like Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	's '' Ulysses . ''

		This effort to cultivate a better taste is decreed a signal failure by the public , unless the opening night brings a crowded house , frequent curtain-calls , and fulsome praise from critics who deem it their mission chiefly to carp .

		In contem - porary revival of Shakespeare there is insistent hope , for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	no longer means '' financial ruin to the theatrical agent . ''

		To satisfy the popular craze for spectacular background , there is often de - traction from dramatic simplicity and potency .

		To reproduce
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without any illusive charm would be a futile experiment for general adoption .

		One may cite
Edwin Booth	PERSON	's story of his most satis - factory portrayal of '' Hamlet '' in a small Western town when the scenery and costumes failed to arrive ; but this signal victory over adventitious circumstances did not convert him to such custom .

		Our quarrel is with the abuse , not the decorous use , of scenic art .

		When Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	appears in '' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' with a single crude interior scene and one change of simple dress , she so holds her auditors by her grasp and revelation of the tragic discord between
Nora	PERSON	and
Thorwald	PERSON	that they forget to make those rude preparations for departure which stigmatize our '' nation in a hurry . ''

		As an influence to counteract melodrama and sensationalism , one might suggest a revival of the best comedies of the past and adaptation of fiction with gently satiric vein .

		Shakespeare 's comedies are ever popular .

		Why not more frequent presen - tation of Moliere and
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	?

		Under the witty cleavage of wholesome satire , many of the excesses of current art and fashion would disappear .

		Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	has well empha - sized the effect of comedy upon sensationalism : `` Thus , for want of instruction in the comic idea , we lose a large audience among our cultivated mid - dle class that we should expect to support comedy .

		One excellent test of the civilization of a country I take to be the flourishing of the comic idea and comedy ; and the test of true comedy is that it shall awaken laughter ... You see Folly perpetually sliding into new shapes in a society possessed of wealth and leisure , with many whims , many strange ailments , and strange doctors .

		Plenty of common - sense in the world to thrust her back when she pre - tends to empire .

		But the first form of common - sense , the vigilant comic , which is the genius of thoughtful laughter , which would readily extinguish her at the outset , is not serving as a public advo - cate . ''

		Why would not many of his novels , if dramatized with skill , offer enjoyable comedy ? ''

		The Landlord at Lion 's Head '' and `` The Kentons , '' without further enumeration , contain pic - torial elements cleverly interwoven with subtle wit ; while underlying all elements is the true love for honest humanity .

		American fiction has reproduced , with scenic brilliance , pictures of varied sections which might well allure the dramatist .

		The social contrasts in large cities have as yet been merely out - lined .

		Why should not the tragedies and comedies of '' the other half '' afford scope for drama as thrill - ing and corrective as its oral and written recital by Mr.
Riis	PERSON	?

		The student of history is not depressed by the flaunting symptoms of current life and literature .

		Under different aspects , in varied ages , there have been like excesses of fashion .

		After the reign of euphuism and the later age of poetic artifice , there came reactions , renewed devotion to simple funda - mental truths .

		Satiated with the spectacular , there are indications to-day of a tendency toward a saner life .

		In many communities , nobler standards al - ready rebuke mere affluence and gaud .

		There is a general recognition of

		Haunting old book-stalls after working hours , he picked up many odd volumes of the English poets , among them
Beattie	PERSON	and
Falconer	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-- the last volume containing two of his Roman plays and '' Troilus and Cres - sida , '' which the boy found hard reading .

		He constantly practised the writing of verse ; and made the acquaintance of
Park Benjamin	LOCATION	and of
Lewis	PERSON	Gay lord
Clark	PERSON	, editor of '' The Knick - erbocker Magazine . ''

		Of his early literary work he has this to say : '' From continuous and patient practice I had now acquired considerable skill in the construction of melo - dious lines and the use of unforced rhymes , and if I had not attained excellence of execution , I had attained definiteness of conception .

		I knew what I wanted to write , and , within my limitations , how to write it .

		It was something outside of myself , something healthier and larger , something that concerned the emotions of mankind , and not my own petty feelings .

		If it was a river , and I wrote about a river , I described the stretch of country through which it flowed , and its human environments ; if it was a wood , and I wrote about a wood , I described its shadowy leafage , the notes of its birds , and recalled the phantoms of its aboriginal in - habitants ; if it was a cathedral , and I wrote about a cathedral , I described its massive architecture and its historic associations , peopling the long-drawn aisles with mediaeval worshippers , the festivity of their wed - dings , the solemnity of their funerals , and whatever else imagination suggested as proper to the place and time . ''

		While this formula did not produce verse of the highest order , it shows that the young poet had progressed in his conception of the art .

		He had now a sure foothold in the liter - ary world and published much verse in '' The Knickerbocker , '' '' The Union Magazine , '' and '' The Home Journal . ''

		Of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, whom he met in
1848	DATE	, Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	has much to say .

		For years they were as
Damon	PERSON	and Pythias . ''


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and I met at night generally , for neither could call the day his own ; he had his work to do on `` The Tribune , ' and I had mine to do in the foundry .

		Apart from politics , his was the cleaner of the two , but not the least laborious , I am sure .

		I have forgotten where his rooms were , but as nearly as I can recollect they were in a boarding-house on
Murray Street	ORGANIZATION	, not far from
Broadway	LOCATION	.

		They were sky par - lours -LSB- five stories up ; the building still stands .

		-- N. -RSB- , as the saying is , for he liked a good outlook ; and be - sides , they suited his purse , which was not plethoric with shekels .

		In the first of these rooms , which was set apart for bis books , there was a little table at which he wrote late into the night , resting his soul with poetry after the prosaic labours of the day . ''

		In chapter vii .

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	gives an in - teresting account of a visit to
Lowell	LOCATION	, with some of the latter 's table-talk .

		Here is what
Lowell	PERSON	had to say on the subject of poetry : \ | '' ' Poetry , as I understand it , is the recognition of something new and true in thought or feeling , the re - collection of some profound experience , the conception of some heroic action , the creation of something beau - tiful and pathetic .

		There are things in verse which may be questioned , but they are not the poetical things , are not the things which are Poetry .

		There can be no doubt about that , for it authenticates itself , and so absolutely that it seems not to have been written , but always to have been .

		We are not conscious of Shake - speare in his great plays , but of Nature , whose pen and instrument he was .

		The poetry of Shakespeare and his fellow-dramatists , ' he continued , ` in other words , the poetry of the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, was greater than any that has been written since , because the Englishman of the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	was greater than any Englishman that has lived since .

		He was more hardy and adventurous than his descendants , more resolute and reckless , more given to action and less to speculation , of strong natural parts , and no learning to speak of , clear-sighted , hearty in his manners , and plain , blunt , and idiomatic in his speech .

		If he had been other than he was , he could not have been the bulwark of Protestantism , could not have destroyed the Spanish Armada , and could not have had the Shakespearian drama . ' ''

		The chapter on `` My Life in the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	'' is full of interesting reminiscences of a by-gone day .

		One of the experiences re - counted was of a ball in
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A Tammany ball was something to be remem - bered , though the memory of one of them should suffice .

		There was dancing , of course ; there was also speech - making , principally by
Captain Rynders	ORGANIZATION	and his gang .

		Toasts , generally patriotic , were proposed , and there never was lack of the wherewithal to wet them with ; there were songs , too , and our national hymn was roared energetically , though there were reasons why some of the singers called it the ■ Bar Tangled Spanner . '

		Some of the guests were supposed to be absent-minded , for in the ladies ' dressing-room the combs and brushes were chained to the wall . ''

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	has elsewhere recounted the episode of
Poe	PERSON	's reception of his '' Ode on a Grecian Flute , '' which he repeats here .

		Though Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	bore no malice toward
Poe	PERSON	be - cause of this incident , and in fact shows great generosity in speaking of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's writings , yet it can not be said that he sets
Poe	PERSON	out in a favor - able light .

		He discovered for himself a fact not unknown to others , friends and foes alike , -- that
Poe	PERSON	often sold his literary wares three or four times over ; and that he was always a

		THE DIAL , 301 plagiarist , though he was somehow , at the same time , always original .

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	had a high opinion of
Boker	ORGANIZATION	, the dramatist , who , like Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	, never became as well known as he deserved to be .

		Boker wrote thus to Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	of his `` Fran - cesca da
Rimini	LOCATION	'' : `` Of course , you know the story , -- every one does ; but you , nor any one else , do not know it as I have treated it .

		I have great faith in the successful issue of this new attempt .

		I think all day and write all night .

		This is one of my peculiarities , by the bye : a subject seizes me soul and body , which accounts for the rapidity of my exe - cution .

		My muse resembles a whirlwind : she catches me up , hurries me along , and drops me all breathless at the end of her career . ''

		More than once Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	insists , with justice , that a poet should not be judged by an absolute present-day standard , but should be read in connection with his time .

		He applies this to
Longfellow	LOCATION	, the spirit of whose verse belongs to an earlier period .

		Read '' by the glimmering twilight of American literature , ''
Longfellow	PERSON	deserves the high reputation which he at one time possessed .


Halleck	PERSON	's poetry , too , considered in relation to its time , must be called remarkable .

		Not the least interesting and touching pas - sages in the book are those relating to the poet 's home-life .

		His admiration for his wife was immense ; yet
Longfellow	PERSON	told him that he rated her literary abilities none too highly .

		Her fiction , -- `` The Morgesons , '' '' Two Men , '' and ''
Temple House	ORGANIZATION	'' -- he believed to be '' the most original and powerful novels ever written by an American woman . ''

		Of their homes , -- at No. 46 Third Street , at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Tenth Street , at the old No. 181 Thirteenth Street , and in Fifteenth Street , east of Stuy vesant Square , -- he speaks with ten - derness ; and of the death of
Willy Stoddard	PERSON	, even after the lapse of forty years , he is unable to write without betraying great emotion .

		That he was intensely proud of his son
Lorimer	PERSON	, the brilliant young dramatist , is evident . ''

		He was thought to be a clever lad , was
Lorimer Stoddard	PERSON	, though he had the good sense not to think so himself .

		He was tall for his age , slight of build , addicted to reading everything except poetry , for which he cared nothing , greatly to the joy of his father , who thought that there were altogether too many poets . ''

		The all too brief Introduction , written by his friend of over forty years , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, dwells on the brave and manly struggle of the young artisan to become a poet ; on his devo - tion to the intellectual life ; on the modesty of
Stoddard	PERSON	and his group in not heralding their own praises ; and on his unselfish counsel to his younger brethren of the craft , to whom he thus passed on the favors he himself had re - ceived as a young man .

		It is a worthy tribute to a heroic soul , a warrior who fought a good fight , who at the same time '' knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme , '' and whose best work is his enduring monument .

		He was a bold , original , and independent thinker .

		His theories produced a sensation , and set scores of investigators to work .

		His fate has been most curious .

		While everyone assigns him notable rank as a scholar , and must read his writings , few if any of his theories are actually held , as he presented them , by present-day scholars .

		His work on `` Systems of Consanguinity and Terms of Relationship '' was a marvel of laborious and painstaking industry ; its ap - pearance marks an epoch ; but its conclusions are probably repudiated by every modern student .

		Morgan ,
McLennan	ORGANIZATION	,
Lubbock	LOCATION	,
Howitt	PERSON	,
Fison	LOCATION	,
Westermarck	LOCATION	, -- these names flash to the mind when Social Origins are mentioned , or when such words are spoken as gens , clan , phratry , exogamy , totemism , and communal marriage .

		And , probably , most students of ethnology and sociology find their heads whirl - ing at the memory of their efforts to bring some order out of the disorder and confusion and inconsistency of the writings on the prim - itive family and marriage .

		What is totemism ?

		302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, totemism and exogamy , we must expect con - fusion and uncertainty in discussions regard - ing them .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	was impelled to write the book by the fact that the late
James Jasper Atkinson	PERSON	, whose mother was Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's aunt , left at his death an unpublished manuscript upon '' Pri - mal Law . ''

		Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	was born in
India	LOCATION	, of Scottish parents .

		While he was still a young man , he settled in
New Caledonia	LOCATION	, where he spent the greater part of his life .

		In that archipelago he became greatly interested in native life and customs .

		He at first worked alone , but later became acquainted with the works of other students in ethnology , being particularly attracted to writings regarding primitive social organization .

		In preparing Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	's manuscript for the press , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	was led to re-study what has been writ - ten upon such lines .

		The result is his part of the book before us .

		We shall not consider it at length , but shall merely indicate some of the special points which he makes .

		Several of these are the direct result of
Atkinson	ORGANIZATION	's argument .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	claims that exogamic tendencies probably existed before totemic names ; after the totemic name is fixed , the exogamic ten - dency became accentuated ; the class system of nomenclature has reference to generations , to relative age , rather than to actual kinship ; the phratries are later than the exogamous totem - gentes and are produced by their amalgama - tion , rather than earlier and producing them by cleavage ; totem names are not born in the gens , but are imposed from outside , often be - ing nick-names , even terms of reproach or con - tempt .

		This last point is perhaps distinctively Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's .

		To its support the author brings some curious nicknames applied to English villagers , and some Sioux Indian totem-names .

		We confess that at first thought it seems highly unlikely that a totem-gens should accept , and use for itself , a term applied -- perhaps con - temptuously -- by outsiders .

		Nor does it really seem to have been done among the English vil - lages mentioned .

		It may be that
Hillborough	PERSON	men call the men of
Loughton	PERSON	`` cuckoos '' ; is it true that the
Loughton	PERSON	men have accepted the name and use it among themselves ?

		As to his Sioux evidence , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's argument com - pels the belief that it needs to be reexamined in the field .

		Are '' hide-scrapers '' and '' dung - eaters '' really totem names used and recognized by the totem-members themselves ; or , are they not truly contemptuous nicknames applied by the outsider who gave Mr.
Dorsey	PERSON	his original list ?

		Of course , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is justified in using the material as he does until its force is weak - ened .

		While it is accepted , his suggestion is novel and interesting .

		Returning now to Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	's paper , we find it important and original .

		He begins with the query why brothers and sisters may not marry , why they must avoid each other .

		The origin of this avoidance he seeks , not among savages or primitive men , but in the life of non-human animals .

		He aims to reconstruct the life of man 's anthropoid ancestor .

		In the sex jealousy of the father in the little wandering group , he finds the basis of exogamy , of non - marriage between the brother and sister .

		He then traces the social progress of this anthro - poid form , step by step , in a way that is for the most part natural and reasonable .

		His first steps appeal strongly to us .

		The original and absolute control of the father ; the driving out of the young males ; the way in which first one -LRB- the youngest -RRB- and then all the young males were tolerated ; the social effect of this toler - ance ; the resulting exogamy , introducing for - eign females into the group ; the prohibitions and avoidances -LRB- a -RRB- of sister and brother , -LRB- 6 -RRB- of patriarch and captured females -- fathers - in-law and daughters-in-law , -- and -LRB- c -RRB- between mother and son , are clearly and rather satisfac - torily shown .

		What is not equally well brought out is the rise of the gens , with clear female descent and headship , which really precedes the form of gens with clear male headship and descent .

		Some of the difficulties and weak - nesses of the latter part of the discussion might perhaps have been overcome if Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	had lived .

		His '' Primal Law , '' as it stands , is an ingenious and novel argument , which will assist us -- as it has assisted Mr.
Lang	PERSON	-- in answering some difficult fundamental questions more simply and naturally than they had before been answered .

		THE DIAL 303 and they take the several forms of history , anec - dote , and critical comment , such as might well have distinguished a camp-fire gathering of the leaders of the two contending armies during that struggle .

		General
Gordon	PERSON	is one of the few general officers of that war who now survive ; and , fortunately for the purposes of such a work as this , his opportunities for gathering and preserving the ana of the whole period have been exceptionally good .

		Among the first to enlist in the Southern army , and achieving early promotion and frequent enlargements of his field of action , his service continued to the very close of the war .

		He and the men under his command were participants in the first battle of Bull Run , and held prominent position in such contests as
Malvern Hill	LOCATION	and
Antietam	LOCATION	; they reached
Gettysburg	LOCATION	in time to help turn the tide of battle on the first day , and took part in guarding the Confederate retreat across the Potomac : they experienced the full stress of the sanguinary fields of the Wilderness and
Spottsylvania	LOCATION	, engineered the surprise which the Federals suffered in the morning at
Cedar Creek	LOCATION	, and shared in the flight of the Confed - erates at night ; they joined in the last great effort of Lee and his men in the works at
Petersburg	LOCATION	, and conceived and carried out the capture of
Fort Stedman	LOCATION	, the last spasm of Confederate aggressive action before the sur - render .

		The man of quick wit and keen acu - men , who passes successfully through such a maze of strenuous experiences , must of neces - sity have an entertaining tale to tell , and it has been told in this volume with a spirit and in a form which will give exceeding pleasure to his readers .

		Sample chapters from this story , which have appeared recently in the pages of one of the magazines , and have been widely read , well illustrate the general character of these `` Reminiscences . ''

		There is no asperity in the tone which
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	assumes in his recitals .

		The past is not forgotten , and it is remembered and dis - cussed without apologies ; but it is for the
United States	LOCATION	and her people of the present that the former soldier writes , and with a gaze turned toward the nation and the nation 's peo - ple of the future .

		The leading and dominant spirit of the book is a desire to honor and glorify the patriotic and honorable manhood which struggled through the momentous con - test of the Civil War , and without any em - phasis upon the color of the uniform with which that manhood was clothed .

		It would be difficult to say upon which side those soldiers fought , to whose valor or gallantry
Gordon	PERSON	would ascribe the higher praise .

		It needs no other acquaint - ance with him than that afforded by these re - miniscences , to discern in his chivalrous nature '' That stern joy which warriors feel In foemen worthy of their steel . ''

		There is no false or insincere tone in the lan - guage in which he lauds and magnifies the American valor which waged the Civil War -- on the one side successfully , on the other without avail .

		He does not write with the view of overlooking or obscuring the issues involved in the war ; he states them fairly and temper - ately , as follows : '' The dominating thought of the North and of the Sonth may be summarized in a few sentences .

		The South maintained with the depth of religious convic - tion that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	formed under the Constitution was a Union of consent and not of force ; that the original States were not the creatures but the creators of the
Union	LOCATION	; that these States had gained their indepen - dence , their freedom , and their sovereignty from the mother country , and had not surrendered these on entering the
Union	LOCATION	; that by the express terms of the Constitution all rights and powers not delegated were reserved to the States ; and the South challenged the North to find one trace of authority in that Constitu - tion for invading and coercing a sovereign State . ''

		The North , on the other hand , maintained , with the utmost confidence in the correctness of her position , that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	formed under the Constitution was in - tended to be perpetual ; that sovereignty was a unit and could not be divided ; that whether or not there was any express power granted in that Constitution for invading a
State	ORGANIZATION	, the right of self-preservation was inherent in all governments ; that the life of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was essential to the life of liberty ; or , in the words of
Webster	PERSON	, ' Liberty and union are one and inseparable . ' ''

		His summary of those issues emphasizes the Americanism which he sees distinguishing the motives of the actors on both sides . ''

		Truth , justice and patriotism unite in proclaiming that both sides fought for liberty as bequeathed by the Fathers , the one for liberty in the
Union of the States	LOCATION	, the other for liberty in the Independence of the States . ''

		He does not undertake to argue anew the ques - tions which led to the assumption of these antagonistic points of view ; he thinks such argument would now be useless and superfluous .

		It is rather by way of explanation than argu - ment that he refers to the views then held by the Southerners , in one instance quoting from the speech of a Southern statesman , as indica - tive of the education in national politics which the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	soldiers had received .

		The posi - tion of the Southerners was there assumed to be one '' not of aggression but purely of de - fence '' ; and in support of the assumption of sovereignty by the
Southern States	LOCATION	, reliance was placed upon the mythical '' declaration of 304 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Khode Island	LOCATION	, and
Virginia	LOCATION	, when they entered the Union , '' that those States had reserved something from their obligations to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		But these suggestions have appar - ently no polemic purpose ; they are offered in illustration of the author 's proposition that the conflict was between two antithetic types of one original Americanism , and in the same spirit in which he finds satisfaction in the reflection that the constitution of the '' Confederate States '' was '' so nearly like '' the `` old Ameri - can Constitution . ''

		The clearest remembrance which he retains of the war and its events , and the strongest conviction which he entertains concerning its results , are that the American character was thereby tested , chastened , and strengthened ; so that out of the conflict he draws reassurance for the future of the Republic . ''

		The stability of popular government depends far more upon the character , the individual personal char - acter , of its people , than it does upon any constitution that could be adopted or statutes that could be enacted .

		What would safeguards be worth if the character of the people did not sustain and enforce them ?

		The constitu - tion would be broken , the laws defied ; riot and anarchy would destroy both , and with them the government it - self .

		I am not assuming or suggesting that this coun - try is in any present danger of such an experience ; but of all the countries on earth this one , with its universal suffrage , its divergent and conflicting interests , its im - mense expanse of territory , and its large population , made up from every class and clime , and still to be in - creased in the coming years , is far more dependent than any other upon the character of its people .

		It is a great support to our hope for the future and to our confidence in the stability of this government , to recall now and then some illustration of the combination of virtues which make up character , as they gleam with peculiar lustre through the darkest hours of our Civil War period .

		That war not only gave the occasion for its exhibition , but furnished the food upon which character fed and grew strong . ''

		When an active participant in the Confederate war looks upon the past and the future of the Republic with such patriotic optimism , we seem to be nearing the time when the actors on both sides in the great contest can reach a common ground from which to observe their own past experiences .

		The same calmness of judgment enables General
Gordon	PERSON	to estimate at their true worth the characteristics displayed by
Lee	PERSON	,
Jackson	PERSON	, and others of the Confederate lead - ers .

		His opportunities for knowing and study - ing these men were exceptionally good , and his portraiture of them is clear and enlighten - ing .

		Lee and
Jackson	PERSON	, in particular , will be better understood and appreciated than before , by those who shall read General
Gordon	PERSON	's No class of these war-memories is recited with a keener zest by
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	than those in which is manifested the manly and knightly courtesy shown by the soldiers on each side toward those upon the other .

		It is appar - ently with delight that he fills his pages with incidents exhibiting the chivalry of true soldiers ; many of them occurring within his own knowl - edge , but many others told from hearsay .

		By the same token , the narrator writes himself down a man of innate chivalry .

		Not only in the knightly demeanor of officers toward their leading antagonists on the battle-field , or when capturing prisoners , or under cartel , but in the secret visits of both officers and soldiers across the lines , in the '' swapping '' by pickets of news - papers and tobacco , in the ceasing of firing in unusual contingencies , and in the fair notice given of the renewal of hostilities , `` Hello , there , Johnnies , get into your holes , we 're going to shoot ! ''

		General
Gordon	PERSON	finds the dominance of the native American chivalry .

		But in all these , the cynic will probably find , as cynics have found heretofore , that it was '' a very Civil War . ''

		The purely military comments , descriptions , and criticisms in this volume will attract and in - terest General
Gordon	PERSON	's readers .

		He pictures the opening scenes of the battle of
Antietam	LOCATION	, which , he says , '' left its lasting impress upon my body as well as upon my memory , '' in these words : `` Vigorously following up the success achieved at
South Mountain	LOCATION	,
McClellan	PERSON	, on the 16th day of Sep - tember ,
1862	DATE	, marshalled his veteran legions on the eastern hills bordering the
Antietam	LOCATION	.

		On the opposite slopes , near the picturesque village of
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	, stood the embattled lines of Lee .

		As these vast American armies , the one clad in blue and the other in gray , stood contemplating each other from the adjacent hills , flaunt - ing their defiant banners , they presented an array of martial splendor that was not equalled , perhaps , on any other field .

		It was in marked contrast with other battle - grounds .

		On the open plain , where stood these hos - tile hosts in long lines , listening in silence for the signal summoning them to battle , there were no breastworks , no abatis , no intervening woodlands , nor abrupt hills , nor hiding-places , nor impassable streams .

		The space over which the assaulting columns were to march , and on which was soon to occur the tremendous struggle , consisted of smooth and gentle undulations and a narrow valley covered with green grass and growing corn .

		From the position assigned me near the centre of Lee 's lines , both armies and the entire field were in view .

		The scene was not only magnificent to look upon , but the realization of what it meant was deeply impressive . ''

		The author 's recollections of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	pre - sent themselves in a series of pictures , of which the following is a specimen :
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 ■ The fiercest struggle is now for the possession of Little Round Top .

		Standing on its rugged summit like a lone sentinel , is seen an erect but slender form clad in the uniform of a
Union	LOCATION	officer .

		It is
Warren	LOCATION	,
Meade	PERSON	's chief of engineers .

		With practised eye , he sees at a glance that , quickly seized , that rock-ribbed hill would prove a
Gibraltar	LOCATION	amidst the whirling currents of the battle , resisting its heaviest shocks .

		Staff and couriers are summoned , who swiftly bear his messages to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	leaders .

		Veterans from
Hancock	PERSON	and
Sykes	PERSON	re - spond at a ' double-quick . '

		Around its base , along its sides , and away toward the
Union	LOCATION	right , with the forces of
Sickles	PERSON	and
Hancock	PERSON	, the gray veterans of Long - street are in herculean wrestle .


Wilcox	PERSON	's Alabamians and
Barksdale	PERSON	's Mississippians seize a
Union	ORGANIZATION	battery and rush on .

		The
Union	ORGANIZATION	lines under
Humphreys	PERSON	break through a Confederate gap and sweep around Barks - dale 's left .

		Wright 's Georgians and
Perry	PERSON	's Floridians are hurled against
Humphreys	PERSON	and break him in turn .

		Amidst the smoke and fury ,
Sickles	LOCATION	, with thigh-bone shivered , sickens and falls from his saddle into the arms of his soldiers .

		Sixty per cent of
Hancock	PERSON	's veterans go down with his gallant
Brigadiers Willard	PERSON	,
Zook	PERSON	,
Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and
Brooke	PERSON	.

		The impetuous Confederate lead - ers ,
Barksdale	PERSON	and Semmes , fall and die , but their places are quickly assumed by the next in command .

		The Union forces of
Vincent	PERSON	and Weed , with
Hazlett	PERSON	's artillery , have reached the summit , but all three are killed .

		The apex of Little Round Top is the point of deadliest struggle .

		The day ends , and thus ends the battle .

		As the last rays of the setting sun fall upon the summit , they are reflected from the batteries and bayonets of the
Union	LOCATION	soldiers still upon it , with the bleeding Confederates struggling to possess it . ''

		But it should not be supposed that these reminiscences are as largely serious as the foregoing comments might be taken to inti - mate .

		Our author shines as a raconteur .

		The lighter and more humorous sides of even serious situations are always luminous to him , and the liveliest and most amusing anecdotes throng his pages .

		The sprightliness of the camp-fire enlivens nearly every chapter , and the fun is always of that genteel geniality which depends in no whit upon vulgarity .

		The reviewer who would give examples of the wit which
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	enjoys , sufficient to illustrate his capac - ity for appreciating the humorous , would be in danger of surfeiting his readers with an em - barrassment of riches .

		One anecdote may be selected to serve as a specimen , -- that of the ante-bellum '' Debating Society '' in
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		Two waggish youths in the society , chancing to be made a committee to select a question for debate , determined to amuse themselves by choosing a subject expressive of incomprehen - sible nonsense , to be debated by themselves with profound though mock seriousness .

		The question selected was , '' Whether at public elections should the votes of faction predomi - nate by internal suggestions , or the bias of jurisprudence ? ''

		How the leaders debated this with '' resounding rhetoric and rounded pe - riods , '' how the other boys painfully tried to follow the course of the great argument , and how the president of the society floundered in attempting to '' sum up the arguments , '' will be gathered from
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	's pages , as he tells us how the odd story came to solace and amuse his weary hours when convalescing from serious wounds received on the field , and how it remains one of the well-remembered epi - sodes of a sanguinary experience .

		With such medicine as this , it is no wonder that the mer - curial spirit of the wounded officer survived all the hardships of a prolonged and terrible war , to illumine the days of peace in his native land with the story of his memorable life .


James Oscar Pierce	PERSON	.

		Some
Types of Religious Thought	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The books noticed below , diverse as they are , nearly all serve to illustrate the fact that the religion of the English-speaking peoples is undergoing a change .

		While this movement is of course part of one affecting the whole of civilization , it is being carried forward inde - pendently , in different quarters , and with de - cidedly different results .

		In the course of evolution , when physical conditions change , it is not usually the most elaborately specialized animals which leave descendants .

		Perfectly and minutely adjusted to a given environment , these wonders of their time fail utterly when confronted by altered circumstances , while more plastic and simple creatures succeed .

		The organized religions of the world , regarded by themselves , impress one in different degrees by their completeness , logical coherence , or vis - ible display .

		In the struggle for existence it might readily be supposed that such things as these , combined with great antiquity , would be causes of success ; but as a matter of fact it • Religion as a Credible Doctrine .

		306 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, looks rather as if the coming religion would be a child of doubt , conflicting opinions , and dis - organization .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's work on `` Religion as a Cred - ible Doctrine , a Study of the Fundamental Difficulty , '' takes up the arguments of various religious apologists , and discusses them critic - ally at considerable length .

		To say that the criticism is destructive , is to use a mild expres - sion ; the theological arguments are pulverized , scattered to the four winds , and covered with ridicule .

		It is worth while to illustrate this statement by a quotation : '' When he -LSB- the theist -RSB- sets out with telling us that the purpose of God in creation is most surely and in - timately revealed to us in the production of sentient creatures , he is thinking of the lives of sentient , of con - scious individuals .

		He is thinking , for example , not of sparrows as a species , but of each separate little bird , when he says that not one of them falls without its maker 's knowledge ; and it is still more evident that of man he is thinking in the same way .

		The whole mean - ing , the essence , of the theist 's doctrine of God is his doctrine of God 's love for the individual human soul .

		Christ did not die , according to the Christian 's idea of his death , in order to preserve the peculiarities of the Teutonic race or the Celtic , or to save the soul of any corporate body .

		The Church , no doubt , is spoken of as the divine Bride ; but the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is nothing if not com - posed of individuals ; and , except as related to the life and conduct of the individual , God 's love is nothing also , as every theist knows ... The scientific view which our modern apologists appropriate is not even analogous to their own .

		It is a monstrous and horrible inversion of it .

		How does the fact that the weak , the vicious , and the criminal transmit their tendencies to their descendants with such effect and certainty that the latter , if left to themselves , die of their own unfit - ness , justify God in having made them unfit at all ?

		If the unfit are thrust into the world , it may well be that they should be thrust out of it , and the process of thrusting them out may be admirable exercise for the fit ; but to the unfit themselves , who never asked to be born , the God who created them is either a dolt or a monster , so far as we judge of him by the light which the process of evolution throws upon him '' -LRB- pp. 172-173 -RRB- .

		The author explains -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- that in speaking of religion he assumes it to involve an assent to three fundamental propositions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that a living God exists who is worthy of our reli - gious emotion , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the will of man is free , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that his life does not cease with the dissolution of this physical organism .

		After showing , for the most part in a lucid and con - vincing way , that the arguments advanced by theologians in favor of these postulates are unsound , he turns round and proceeds to an - nihilate Professor Huxley and Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	with complete success .

		In the fol - lowing gentle manner is Huxley 's '' Evolution and Ethics '' lecture dismissed : '' None of ' the wretched little curates , ' at whose apologetics he delighted to sneer , ever committed him - self to an argument more transparently and more feebly false .

		In the first place , what is less honest or more unscientific than the manner in which he begs the ques - tion , by confining the term ' cosmic process , ' which naturally suggests and includes all the processes of the universe , to the single process of selection , or the survival of the fittest ?

		And yet on this procedure his whole contention depends .

		He confines the term `` cosmic ' to this one particular process , in order that he may represent any process which is opposed to this one , as being a process which is opposed to the cosmic also -- a process by which , within a cosmos essentially natural , man builds up for himself an artificial world which is independent of it .

		To call this pitiable piece of card-sharping with words and ideas sophistry is to pay it a high compliment '' -LRB- p. 269 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's final conclusion -LRB- to which the present reviewer heartily assents -RRB- is that we may accept the fundamental postulates of religion without being in a position to exhibit their scientific validity .

		No genuinely monistic philosophy is possible , other than a mere mental abstraction . ''

		Let us remember that we may know something -- that we may increase our knowledge indefinitely -- of many portions of existence ; but that by no intellectual device can we fit all the portions together .

		If we try to comprehend them all in a single system of philosophy , we will find that in explaining one part we have to leave another inexplicable ; -- that philosophy , in fact , is like a coat which we are able to button across our stomach only by leaving a broken seam at our back .

		We must learn , in short , with regard to the deeper things of life , that the fact of our adopting a creed which involves an assent to contradictions is not a sign that our creed is useless or absurd , but that the ultimate nature of things is for our minds inscrutable '' -LRB- p. 287 -RRB- .

		The other books before us appear to be of minor importance , and may be discussed more briefly .

		In '' The Law of Likeness '' Dr.
David Bates	PERSON	shows how , partly through some inter - estingly described experiences in
West Africa	LOCATION	, the author was led to abandon a Calvinistic type of Christianity and to adopt a spiritual creed which did not seem to be contradicted by the facts of history , science , and every-day experience . ''

		The Heaven of our Hope is dis - tinctly foreshadowed by the Kingdom of God that is within us .

		In what we know even now , as the life of the spirit -- in our higher thoughts ' appreciation of the manifest opera - tion of God ; in the untiring joy of our seeking after Him , the evergrowing desire to know His Way , and to participate in the fulfilment of His Purpose -- we have certain revelation of the life to come . ''

		Thus in this work , as in Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's , the justification of religion is .

		found in the subjective field .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 '' The Essence of Christianity , '' by Mr.
William Adams Brown	PERSON	, is an historical study of the definitions of Christianity .

		The author seems rather to discount the value of his own re - searches as a contribution to religious thought when he says at the end : '' What the theology of the f uttfre will be like in its details it is too soon to predict .

		But of one thing we may be sure .

		It will be a theology for the people .

		It will have its roots deep in life , and will utter its message in language so simple and direct that a layman as well as the theologian can understand it . ''

		`` Divinity and Man , '' by Mr.
W.K. Roberts	PERSON	, is stated on the title-page to be '' An Interpre - tation of Spiritual Law in its Relation to Mun - dane Phenomena and to the
Ruling Incentives and Moral Duties of Man	ORGANIZATION	.

		Together with an Allegory Dealing with Cosmic Evolution and certain Social and Religious Problems . ''

		While it contains some good ideas , it appears to me to be mainly nonsense .

		It is recommended to certain of the orthodox , as an illustration of what some of their own doctrines would look like if approached without favorable bias .

		`` Jesus ' Way , '' by President
DeWitt Hyde	PERSON	of
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, is an attempt to set forth the teaching of Jesus , unhampered by the theo - logical trappings which usually cover it .

		It is a reasonable and even inspiring little book , though here and there one finds what seems to be a false note or an exaggeration .

		`` The Spark in the Clod , '' by the Rev.
J. T. Sunderland	PERSON	, deals with evolution from the reli - gious standpoint , and shows that the tendency is from the lower to the higher , that man has risen instead of fallen , and that in this fact lies our hope for the future .

		`` God and the Individual , '' by Dr.
T. B. Strong	PERSON	, is a defence of organized religion , against such '' individualistic '' notions as are held by Dr.
James	PERSON	.

		There is a great deal about the early customs of the church , but from the Jamesian standpoint it is to be feared that this has '' nothing to do with the case . '' ''

		Of Religion '' is a little book of '' The Arts of Life '' series , by Mr.
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	.

		The author sums up as follows : `` And whether we think only of the life that now is , or also of the life that is to come , whether the pathway of being seems to any one of us to lead to the shut or to the open door , it is in the supremacy of the higher man , in the fulfilment of the su - preme art of life , that life on earth is indeed worth the living .

Martyr of Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Every intelligent man or woman must have a lively and sympathetic interest in the story of the almost superhuman struggles of a great genius who , amid severe trials , domestic , phys - ical , and religious , made a multitude of epoch - making discoveries , any one of which would now-a-days command the instant admiration and applause of the world .

		Such a genius was
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, a satisfactory biography of whom , in the English tongue , has now first appeared from the pen of Mr.
J. J. Fabie	PERSON	and the press of
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the past twenty-five years , Professor
Favaro	PERSON	, of
the University of Padua	ORGANIZATION	, has de - voted himself almost exclusively to the study of the life of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, and to the collection of his writings .

		At the present time the
Italian Government	ORGANIZATION	is issuing , under his direction , an edition of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	's works , in twenty large volumes , the first dozen of which have been printed .

		All of the material collected by the Italian professor has been courteously placed at the service of Mr.
Fahie	PERSON	, who has also had access to the best of former publications , in - cluding the extensive work of
Alberi	ORGANIZATION	, which appeared in sixteen volumes in the years 1842-56 .

		The first twenty-five years of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	's life are passed over by his biographer in as many pages ; in them he is pictured as an ardent , disputatious , and headstrong young man whose refusal to take with easy compliance the cap - sules of Aristotelian dogmatics prescribed for him from day to day by the
University	ORGANIZATION	pro- fessors brought him into great disfavor with those worthies , and earned him the sobriquet of '' The Wrangler . ''

		That some of this spirit may be attributed to heredity is probable from the following extract from the writings of his father , Vincenzio : '' I , on the contrary , wish to be allowed freely to question and freely to answer without any sort of adula - lation , as well becomes those who are sincerely in search of truth . ''

		After several unsuccessful endeavors to secure a
University	ORGANIZATION	professorship ,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	obtained such an office at
Pisa	LOCATION	in
July , 1589	DATE	, before he was twenty-six years old .

		The salary was only
sixty-five dollars	MONEY	per annum , but he was expected to augment it by giving private lessons .

Nov. 1	DATE	, led to excessive bitterness on the part of his Aristotelian colleagues .

		After three years the situation became intolerable , and he resigned , accepting soon after a similar place at
Padua	LOCATION	.

		This professional seat he occupied for eighteen years , displaying extraordinary ability and versatility .

		This period is specially marked by his re-invention of the telescope , and his discovery with it of the mountains of the moon , the moons of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, the `` servitors '' of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		Our author gives some facsimiles of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	's MSS. , showing his drawings and notes on the satellites of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, and his sketches of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	.

		A common story about his observations of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	is that when the appearances now known to be rings vanished -LRB- because turned edgewise to us -RRB-
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	was so disturbed that he never directed his tele - scope to the planet again .

		But the researches of
Favaro	PERSON	have completely disproved this , showing that
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	observed
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	assidu - ously , and drew some sketches so true that it is astonishing that he did not perceive what the very drawings plainly suggested , namely , that the planet was surrounded by a ring .

		These discoveries brought
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	great re - nown , as well as much trouble from the con - tinual necessity of defending them against the malignant attacks of his enemies .

		A snare was skilfully laid for him , and he was led to express opinions as to the bearings of his scien - tific doctrines on the Scriptures .

		Thus he was brought into direct conflict with the
Roman Curia	PERSON	, and the hand of the Inquisition was laid upon him .

		For thirty long years he was never free from the pressure of this iron hand .

		Mr.
Fahie	PERSON	has endeavored to give a faithful account of the happenings of these tedious years , quot - ing freely from official documents and private letters .

		Upon the black background of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	's suf - ferings from physical illness and mental dis - tress there stands out the lovely figure of his daughter , the nun
Maria Celeste	PERSON	, who corre - sponded with him continually , and brightened the hours of his gloom by her loving devotion .

		She continually addresses him as '' Dearest Lord and Father , '' and is full of solicitude for his welfare : the other nuns have their patron saints , but she needs none , since she has her father to confide in ; in one letter she expresses a desire to die , so that in the next world her prayers for him may have greater efficacy .

		This ministering angel passed away when her father was seventy years of age ; he felt that he was soon to follow ; he seemed to hear her call - ing him ; but eight long years intervened be - fore his weary spirit took its flight .

		Having given an admirable account of

		Recent Discussions in Private and
Public Finance	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The controversy over certain proposed currency and fiscal reforms , which has been waged with un - parallelled vigor during the last decade by certain economic writers as well as in the public press , has doubtless led more than one timid observer to the belief that , within the fields of public and private finance at least , scientific conclusions are impossible and speculation is the only guide .

		Tet students of economics will doubtless agree that these financial controversies have had other than merely negative results .

		Not only have scientific research and popular argumentation done much to free the intel - lectual atmosphere from certain mists which had befogged the public mind , but , as one after another cloud has been cleared away , the investigators them - selves have discovered much solid ground on which they could meet .

		Let us take as an example the question of bi - metallism .

		While the reviewer has no statistics to support his assertion , he ventures the statement that if ten years ago a poll of economic teachers and writers in this country had been taken , it would have been found that a majority of them were inclined to favor , if not openly to support , international bi - metallism .

		To-day , that poll would undoubtedly show a large majority to be , for one reason or an - other , in opposition to such a policy .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 recent years have caused him to change his former views concerning the necessity of a doable standard .

		Such a change in the trend of scientific opinion as well as in monetary legislation has doubtless caused satisfaction to no one more than to that vet - eran economist , Prof essor
James Laurence Laughlin	PERSON	, who for some years carried on , almost alone , the battle among scientific students in behalf of the gold standard .

		Since
1886	DATE	, when the first edition of his `` History of Bimetallism '' appeared , he has con - tinued his advocacy of the single gold standard for this country , in various articles , books , and reports , which have without doubt aided materially in the attainment of that end , as well as in establishing the author 's right to be considered as
America	LOCATION	's leading authority in monetary science .

		Not content with his former achievements , Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	has now planned a series of works covering the entire field of money and banking , which is so comprehensive in its scope and so thorough-going in its plan of execution that it must constitute the author 's life - work ; indeed , he confesses that he has doubts as to whether '' the plan is ever finished . ''

		It is the first volume of this opus magnum , which the author entitles `` The Principles of Money , '' which is now before us .

		The author believes that much of the confusion and uncertainty that have resulted from the attempts to state monetary theories and to carry them into practice has arisen from the failure to discern clearly the principles that govern the value of money and determine the prices of com - modities .

		Especially is this true of those writers who adhere to the classical quantity theory of money ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that '' the value of money , other things being the same , varies inversely as its quantity . ''

		Accord - ingly , Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	's statement of the prin - ciples of money is very largely devoted to a refuta - tion of this false doctrine , as he considers it to be .

		Indeed , his book might well have been entitled , `` The Quantity Theory of Money , '' since there is scarcely a chapter in it which does not attempt to point out the false logic involved in this theory or the failure of the theory to explain the facts of ac - tual life .

		In the first chapter , which deals with '' The Func - tions of Money , '' the author takes sharp issue with Professor Menger , who maintained that the func - tion of money as a medium of exchange antedated its use as a standard of values .

		This our author denies , and he submits considerable historical evi - dence to support him in his contention .

		The ques - tion of priority is not important in itself ; but as Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	attributes much of the false reasoning of the quantity theorists to the failure to distinguish between these two functions , his own treatment receives logical support from the claim that the prime importance of money as a standard of values was recognized from the time of its first use .

		His lengthy review of the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	question leads him to reject on grounds of abstract justice , as well as of practicability , all the standards pro- posed by various writers for securing justice in the case of deferred payments , such as the multiple standard , the corn standard , the labor standard , etc. .

		All of them , as well as gold and silver , fail , because they all assume that justice can be done by regu - lating prices through changes in the quantity of the circulating medium . ''

		A perfectly just standard of deferred payments is not possible , '' the author concludes .

		The solution of the problem is to be found in the realms of expediency ; and expediency has decided in favor of the gold standard .

		The author 's treatment of Credit is decidedly original , and so complete as almost to confuse the reader .

		He finds the essence of credit to be , not confidence but the element of futurity .

		Its basis is goods , not money ; and its great service to a com - munity is that it furnishes the machinery by which a large part of general wealth , or goods , is converted into general purchasing power .

		Distinguishing be - tween '' normal credit , '' which is '' the coinage of goods , or property , into present means of payment in amount no greater than the value of the market - able goods , or property , owned by the borrower , '' and `` abnormal credit , '' in which the amount is greater than the value of the goods owned , the author proceeds to show that normal credit merely enlarges the field of exchange by increasing purchasing power to the full extent of the bankable property .

		It is the same as if there had been an increased produc - tion of goods , and does not affect in any way the general level of prices .

		Abnormal credit , on the other hand , creates a false demand for goods .

		It raises the general level of prices the same as if the demand had been genuine , and a supply of goods is brought forward in consequence .

		Then the bubble is pricked ; the demand is seen not to be real , and the supply of goods is in excess of real demands .

		Liquidation follows , at prices which will not cover the amount of the obligations .

		It is in this way that crises are produced , according to Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	.

		Several years ago , in reviewing the second volume of Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's `` Political Economy , '' -LRB- The Dial ,
June 16 , 1898	DATE	-RRB- , the present reviewer called attention to the fact that this author 's defense of the quantity theory laid especial emphasis on the claim that the growth of credit transactions in mod - ern times required an increase , pari passu , of me - tallic money to act as reserves .

		Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	says of this argument : '' The effect of an expanding use of credit in demanding more specie reserves has had a very slight effect upon the world 's value of gold and through it upon prices ... The reserves in cash are used as a test of , not as a limit to , the amount of currency which can be issued ... The order of events is this : first , a transaction in goods , next the appear - ance of credit forms arising out of the transactions ; then , the collection of that amount of specie found by experience to be needed to keep np a continuous test of the solvency of the credit in terms of the standard . ''

		In his treatment of '' Deposit Currency '' Profes - sor
Laughlin	PERSON	follows the lead of the late Professor
Dunbar	PERSON	, borrowing , indeed , from that author the argument that the great use of deposits as currency 310 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, to-day had dispelled all dangers of contraction , as well as rendering of little account the gains , made much of by many writers , from having an elastic currency .

		The only gain would be the providing , for small transactions , of a medium of exchange more convenient than coin .

		To the ordinary reader there will seem to be something like false logic in Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	's argument that while '' the loans a bank can make are limited by the amount of its reserves , '' and '' a fall in reserves restricts the purchasing power which can be created in the form of deposit currency , fol - lowing from loans based on goods , '' yet '' it is not relevant to the main question to say that the de - posit currency is limited by money reserves . ''

		With - out arguing here the question as to which is cause and which is effect , when the relation of reserves , loans , and deposits is so intimate as the foregoing sentences indicate , is it not within the truth to ob - serve that one of these factors acts as a limit to the other ?

		Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	's explanation of the paradox is that , '' while at any one moment the amount of reserves actually held does limit the then existing loans and deposits , yet it is perfectly clear that , as more good loans are offered year by year , the banks will provide more gold by changing a frac - tional part of their increasing resources -- which rise pari passu with their liabilities -- for addi - tional supplies of gold . ''

		Yet is not this just what the quantity theorists urge ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that an increased use of credit demands an increased amount of specie ?

		The safe argument , and the most convinc - ing , is of course the one on which all mono-metal - lists fall back ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that the increased production of gold since
1850	DATE	has so enlarged the volume of that metal that one need not fear that bank re - serves , as well as other monetary demands for specie , can not be met from this supply .

		The author 's elaborate treatment of tables of priees and index-numbers seems scarcely necessary to the development of his subject , or even to prove his point that '' many of the suggestions as to the measurement of prices have a squint toward some means of arriving at changes in the value of money , -- and the causes thereof , -- and they seem to imply the acceptance of the quantity theory of money . ''

		Suffice it to say that the author 's conclusion is in favor of the simple unweighted average , as he says : '' It is more important to have a large number of goods quoted in the price-tables than to attempt accurate calculations of the proper weights to be attached to each article . ''

		In his lengthy chapter on the history of the quantity theory , with its numerous references to and quotations from many writers , past and present , perhaps the most common error which our author discovers is the confusion of money as a standard of values with its function as a means of payment .

		Whenever the first function is held in mind , the reasoning of these writers seems to be sound ; but when they begin to treat the amount of money in a country as the total demand for goods , a false theory of prices is developed .

		In his elaboration of '' The True Theory of Prices , '' he shows that the general level of prices is determined by the same forces , constituting supply and demand , which go to deter - mine the price of any single article .

		Goods are exchanged for goods .

		Their value is expressed in terms of gold ; and sometimes , but not always , gold or some other article acts as a medium of exchange .

		If gold is the standard commodity in which prices are expressed , all exchanges , no matter what the medium of exchange may be , refer themselves to this standard commodity whose value is determined in the manner already described .

		Both the mone - tary and the non-monetary demands for gold aid in fixing its price , which is in nowise dependent on the quantity of the circulating medium .

		In fact , the adjustment of value between gold and goods , -- what the author terms '' the evaluation process , '' -- has been effected antecedent to the exchange process . ''

		The quantity of the media of exchange is a result , not a cause , of the evaluation between gold and goods , and therefore can not have been the means of fixing prices . ''

		The real nature of this exchange process is well illustrated in international trade , where it is universally recognized that the quantity theory in its usual form does not hold ; that goods are exchanged for goods , and usually no medium of exchange other than bills of exchange are used .

		Therefore a movement of gold , so far from being the causes of changes in the general price-level and thus causing exports or imports , if it does take place , is a result of these movements of goods . ''

		The arrival of a gold balance in any one commercial country no more lowers the world value of gold in the markets of that country than would the price of the existing supply of wheat be lowered if one of the places of storing wheat should be changed from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
Buffalo	LOCATION	; for if the existing demand for wheat and the existing supply of wheat remain unchanged , it is only a matter of convenience where it is stored . ''

		Naturally enough , Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	does not agree with the late President
Walker	PERSON	, and other writers , that an increase in the amount of money by gradually raising prices acts as a stimulus to in - dustry and brings prosperity .

		The only case where general prosperity results from such an increase , he believes , is when , as in the case of the great gold discoveries , the increase of the standard metal is itself an increase of actual wealth , just the same as in the case of a discovery of iron or coal deposits .

		In any other case , the increase of the medium of exchange , if it affects prices at all , does so by means of depreciation , and the false stimulus given to industry is followed by acute depression .

		Only the shrewd speculator , who knows that the high prices were temporary , has gained .

		Holding that the fall of prices in the
last quarter-century	DATE	has been due to progress in the industrial arts , which has increased the productivity of industries , the author asserts that '' through the general decline of prices the laboring classes have , as a matter of fact ,
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 311 profited by the tremendous industrial progress of the world . ''

		In regard to the amount of money needed by a country , Professor
Langhlin	PERSON	's advice to legislators may well be quoted : '' First assure the permanency of the standard , then remove all shadow of doubt as to the immediate convertibility of the medium of exchange into that standard , and the expansion and contraction of the media of exchange -LRB- i. e. , the currency -RRB- can be , with confidence , left to take care of itself . ''

		Professor
Scott	PERSON	's work on '' Money and
Bank	ORGANIZATION	- ing '' is far less ambitious in character than the one just reviewed .

		The author 's main purpose was to furnish a good elementary treatise on these subjects for use as a text in colleges and universities .

		This he has succeeded in doing .

		His definitions are simple and clear , and his statements of monetary principles are usually exact .

		The treatment of
Gresham	PERSON	's law , and the explanation of the reasons why gold and silver and paper concurrently circulate in this country , are especially good .

		It is unfortunate that the author has not always made use of the latest reports , as there are numerous inaccuracies in his statements of facts , especially in his description of the coinage systems of the chief commercial coun - tries .

		Perhaps the most striking feature of the book , and that which gives it especial value as a text , is the amount of space given over to a descrip - tion of the forms , processes , and methods of ex - change .

		This attention to commercial processes and machinery is doubtless due in large measure to the author 's recently acquired interest in higher commercial education , and it certainly makes the book a valuable means of giving instruction in the practical aspects of these subjects .

		There is com - paratively little attention given to theory .

		Profes - sor
Scott	PERSON	, like Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	, expresses his disbelief in the quantity theory of money , which he asserts '' will not bear analysis and the tests of logic and facts . ''

		He claims that the doctrine of demand and supply is only a description '' of a process through which the value-determining forces work , '' and not an explanation of the way prices are de - termined .

		He rests his theory of prices entirely upon the value given to the commodity standard by the estimation of the people who have made it the standard , because it has proved to be the most useful for this purpose .

		Price is simply `` the numerical expression of the ratio of exchange be - tween the value of the standard and that of com - modities . ''

		The author 's survey of the banking systems in the leading countries closes with a com - parison of the free banking systems of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	with the centralized systems of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Though acknowledging that any discus - sion of the respective merits of the two systems must be carried on in the light of the actual condi - tions and experiences of the people concerned , the author nevertheless favors the free banking system under American conditions .

		The Canadian system of note - issue he regards as ideally the best , but thinks '' it would probably be difficult to employ it in a country like the
United States	LOCATION	, on account of the responsibility which it places upon the stronger banks for the conduct of the weaker . ''

		The chap - ter on '' The Theory of Bimetallism '' seems to the reviewer the weakest in the book .

		The author states the theory of the bimetallists fairly enough , and apparently accepts their argument concerning the compensatory action of the double standard as sound doctrine , '' admitted by all . ''

		His fault with the theory lies in his belief that the dearer metal would still continue to be used as the standard in the case of long-time contracts at an enhanced valuation as compared to the cheaper metal .

		But does not the bimetallic theory assume that a cer - tain quantity of money is needed in order to main - tain prices at a given level ?

		-- in other words , the quantity theory which Professor
Scott	PERSON	has rejected .

		The closing chapter , on '' The History of Bimetal - lism , '' affords a more cogent argument against the bimetallic standard than does Professor
Scott	PERSON	's theoretical treatment .

		For many readers , more progress will be made toward an understanding of our present monetary situation , as well as of our fiscal system , by turning from these theoretical controversies to Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's admirable historical survey of our financial experiences as a nation .

		The need of such a work was imperative , and those persons who knew the author 's reputation for thoroughness greeted with delight the publishers ' announcement .

		Nor have the earlier expectations been disappointed .

		It is surprising how much information has been packed into these five hundred pages of text , and that , too , in such a way as to preserve a pleasant narrative .

		Each chapter is equipped with a full bibliography , and other helpful aids are found in the introduction and appendix .

		The statistics are carefully pre - pared and intelligently and scientifically arranged , -- no easy matter when dealing with financial af - fairs , where systems of accounting and classifications are constantly changing .

		The diagrams also are very skilfully drawn , and are truly helpful in under - standing the trend of fiscal affairs .

		The author does not undertake to point out the mistakes in our fiscal policy , bat seeks rather to interpret the past in the light of the experiences of that time .

		While this is undoubtedly a safe policy to pursue , and may be of some advantage to the teacher who desires to use the book in his classes and yet desires to put his own interpretation on financial happenings , it is a gource of regret that the very obvious lessons furnished by some chapters in our financial history could not have been indicated by a wise guide for the benefit of the immature reader .

		Departing somewhat from scientific definitions of the word Finance , Professor Dewey makes financial history broad enough to include some consideration of our monetary systems .

		This is almost a matter of necessity , rather than of deliberate choice , since our monetary legislation has been so interwoven with our fiscal policy that an attempt to separate them for treatment would lead to wrong conclusions .

		312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, There is , unfortunately , not space here to review even hastily all the chapters of this hook , and we are obliged to content ourselves with a very brief reference to a few of the main incidents in the nar - rative .

		The continental currency , which is so often assailed , Professor
Dewey	PERSON	calls the `` culminating incident in a half-century of financial experience , '' and he rightly holds that the criticism of such issues should not be based on `` what is possible among a people properly grounded in the principles of mon - etary experience , '' but should proceed from a know - ledge of the views held by the politicians of the time concerning paper money , and from a consideration of the lack of power in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to adopt any other expedient .

		The author 's review of
Hamilton	LOCATION	's ad - ministration of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	is on the whole favor - able to the Secretary .

		He admits that
Hamilton	PERSON	's management of the debt was not successful , but he agrees with Professor
Dunbar	PERSON	in the claim that the reliance on sinking funds was not due to
Hamilton	PERSON	's belief that '' compound interest could be made to supply the place of an adequate revenue . ''

		His mis - take was merely due to his relying on a surplus when no such surplus , in fact , appeared .


Gallatin	LOCATION	, on the other hand , receives less commendation .

		He is accused of a vacillating policy , especially in his attitude toward the necessity of internal duties du - ring the war .

		There is no doubt that
Gallatin	LOCATION	's policy was less aggressive than that of
Hamilton	LOCATION	.

		He had taken office , committed to a policy of re - trenchment in expenditures and a reduction of tax - ation .

		His advocacy of internal taxes at times , and his reluctance to lay them at other times , was due to no change of policy , but to necessity , or the absence of it ; while
Hamilton	PERSON	favored an exten - sion of the Federal fiscal system for political rea - sons .

		Gallatin 's failures were in large measure due to the lack of financial acumen on the part of his superiors in office , and to the jealousy of his party allies .

		The author is somewhat of an apologist for
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary Chase .

		He admits that Chase was not a stu - dent of finance , but points out that his appointment was similar in this respect to preceding ones , made from among the leading politicians of the day .

		He makes much of
Chase	ORGANIZATION	's inherent dislike of paper money , and but little of his weakness in finally ac - cepting the dictation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in this matter .

		He calls the issuance of legal tender a '' striking illus - tration of the unsympathetic relations of a Cabinet minister with the legislative branch , '' and pronounces it '' a remarkable commentary upon the methods of financial legislation at this period , '' but apparently does not consider that this lack of sympathy was due to a distrust on the part of
Congress of Chase	ORGANIZATION	's ability as a fiscal leader .

		The long and at times bitter controversy which took place at the close of the war in regard to the question as to whether the
United States	LOCATION	bonds could be redeemed in green - backs , and as to whether or not these bonds were , or should be , liable to taxation by the States , shows clearly the difficulties involved in creating any form of government investments which rests on a differ - ent basis than other property .

		It inevitably creates a privileged class , and , even though this privilege may have been purchased by an acceptance of lower rates of interest at the time , this fact is soon lost sight of , while the enjoyment of the privilege is a fact which is constantly forcing itself upon the public attention .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	falls into the popular delusion , though in an exaggerated degree , in attributing the railway legislation in the
Western States	LOCATION	to the
Granger	PERSON	agitation .

		That the two movements had a common origin in the discontent of the farmer , is not to be doubted ; but as a matter of fact , in
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and
Iowa	LOCATION	, -- the
States	LOCATION	chiefly responsible for this regulative legislation , -- the
Granger	PERSON	movement followed rather than preceded the effort to control rates through the legislatures .

		The chapters dealing with the silver and tariff legislation of the '90 's has been handled in a scholarly manner , and with an effort to give an unprejudiced account and to let the facts speak for themselves .

		Perhaps for this very reason , the sim - ple recital of the occurrences makes the strongest possible argument against the currency inflation of this period .

		The treatment of the Spanish War period , and of the more recent events , seems less satisfactory .

		Apparently the author was unwilling to pass judgment on matters that have scarcely become history .

		The history of the
Second Bank of the United States	ORGANIZATION	constitutes probably the most important topic in the financial , if not the political , history of this country between the close of the second war with
England	LOCATION	and the outbreak of the Civil War .

		There are doubtless few students of either economics or history who have felt that our information in re - gard to this famous institution was such as to en - able us to say with any degree of certainty as to just how great were its services as a fiscal machine to the
United States	LOCATION	government , or even as to whose feet ,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	's or
Nicholas Bid	PERSON	- die 's , should be laid the charge of having destroyed it .

		All students , therefore , will welcome the care - ful work of Professor
Catterall	PERSON	on this subject , especially as its author has had the advantage of using some hitherto unused material ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the man - uscript correspondence and papers of the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	's most famous president ,
Nicholas Biddle	PERSON	.

		But though the use of this material has thrown much light on the history and management of the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	, we can not say that it has changed in any consider - able degree our former views as to the wisdom of its management or the extent of its political influ - ence .

		In spite of the fact that the evidence gath - ered by Professor
Catterall	PERSON	proves that Mr.
Biddle	PERSON	possessed many claims to be called a brilliant finan - cier , it also goes to show that he was an unsafe leader ; and the judgment of Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	, that '' nobody at the present day considers
Biddle	PERSON	a good banker , '' is sustained .

		Neither is our belief that the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	meddled in politics , to its own and
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 the country 's detriment , shaken .

		It is true that the author has shown that
Biddle	PERSON	entered politics very reluctantly , and that the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	was drawn into the political arena and was obliged to fight for its ex - istence ; it nevertheless remains true that it exerted a dangerous if not corrupt influence in political affairs , and that if
Jackson	PERSON	's attack was based on ignorance ,
Biddle	PERSON	's resistance to it led him into measures of a purely vindictive sort , and such as were harmful to the public interests .

		One impor - tant point has been cleared up beyond controversy , and that is that
Henry Clay	PERSON	had very little to do with the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward the administration .

		Bid - die first attempted to keep out of politics altogether ; then , seeing that this was impossible , he endeavored to win the support of the administration by various friendly tactics , and only as a last resort he very re - luctantly joined the National Republicans in their war on
Jackson	PERSON	and his political advisers .

		It is this fact , that the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	was forced into politics against the will and strenuous efforts of its autocratic presi - dent , which causes us to hesitate to accept Professor
Catterall	PERSON	' i conclusion that there can be no reason for asserting that a central bank which plays so impor - tant a part in the financial and commercial life of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, etc. , would not be of equal value to the
United States	LOCATION	; and a careful read - ing of his own work does not allow us to accept his further statement that `` the Bank possessed no politi - cal power . ''

		The value of the central bank to the governments of the countries named needs not be questioned , and it may even be admitted that simi - lar services could be rendered by a central bank to the
United States	LOCATION	government ; but the question of the desirability of such an institution is one to be decided on in view of many circumstances , political as well as fiscal .

		It can scarcely be doubted that a President hostile to banking monopolies , -- like Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	, for instance , -- would feel it incumbent on him to interfere with the management of a fiscal in - stitution of this sort ; and it is also easy to infer that such interference and hostility would cause the of - ficials of such an institution to oppose such a policy by participating in politics if necessary .

		Nor will all authorities acknowledge Professor
Catterall	PERSON	's claim that '' a great bank with a large capital under its control can meet local demands much more easily and safely than a small bank . ''

		We have already mentioned Professor
Scott	PERSON	's preference for the `` free banking system . ''

		The truth of the matter is that the knowledge of banking is so much greater to - day , and other conditions are so different from what they were in
1836	DATE	, that the history of the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond Bank of the
United States	LOCATION	does not throw much light on the question as to whether or not a central - ized banking system would now be a good thing in this country .

		That such a bank would be more conservatively managed than the
Second Bank	ORGANIZATION	was under Jones , or even under
Biddle	PERSON	, goes without saying ; on the other hand , the state and private banks are to-day immensely superior to those of
Jackson	PERSON	's day .

		Miss
Breckinridge	PERSON	, in her work on '' Legal Tender , '' has endeavored to discover through a study of English and American monetary history , -LRB- 1 -RRB- what organ of government has exercised the power of conferring on money the legal tender quality ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- what kinds of money have had the legal tender quality bestowed on them ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- why this power has been bestowed .

		The answer to the first question is that it was originally a royal prerogative exercised in a nearly arbitrary manner , in spite of some protests on the part of the Com - mons , from
1066	DATE	until the period of the Common - wealth .

		The courts having declared certain coins lawful money , debtors were obliged to receive them at their legal value in settlement of debts , even when these were contracted at a time prior to the declaring of the coins '' lawful and current money . ''

		This decision in the case of '' Mixt Monies '' -LRB- 43d
Elizabeth	PERSON	-RRB- has formed the basis of subsequent de - cisions in both the English and American courts .

		In regard to the much debated question as to whether or not the framers of the Federal Con - stitution intended to prohibit the emission of bills of credit having legal tender power , the author holds that the Convention itself intended to leave the matter in doubt .

		`` All that can be said as to the interpretation of that silence is that , although there was a strong and well-nigh universal dread of paper issues , there was a stronger dread of too narrowly limiting the powers of the new legislature ; and that there was neither a very definite nor a unanimous opinion as to the effect of striking oat the clause , or as to the extent of the power granted . ''

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	, in the work already reviewed , arrives at practically the same conclusion .

		Arguing from the legal maxim , expressio unites est exclusio alterius ,
Miss Breckinridge	PERSON	claims that the act of
1873	DATE	, which prohibited the further coinage of the silver dollar and stated the legal tender of the gold coins and that of the subsidiary silver , by its failure to mention the silver dollar took away its legal tender quality .

		In this opinion she is not sup - ported by her teacher , Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	, whose chapter `` On the Origin and History of Legal Tender '' is in the main a lengthy summary of Miss
Breckinridge	PERSON	's work .

		The results of the author 's study as applied to the most important question of this character which has ever come before the courts of this country , namely , the legality of the Legal Tender acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during the Civil War , are opposed to the final decision of the Su - preme Court .

		The bases of this decision , she says , '' are large considerations of public policy , of con - stitutional interpretations , of judicial policy , rather than strictly legal considerations .

		The power to bestow the quality of being a tender in private transactions has been adjudged an incident to sov - ereign powers vested in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	similar to the ancient prerogative money power of the English Crown . ''

		Even stronger than this is her statement in the concluding chapter , that '' by an extraordi - nary departure from both legislative and judicial precedents , an act as tyrannical as any act of 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	,
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		in dealing with his coins found legis - lative and judicial sanction . ''

		It is interesting to compare with this the opinions on this question of two leading authors whom we have already quoted .

		Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	is even more emphatic than
Miss Breckinridge	PERSON	in his disap - proval of the decision . ''

		The arguments of the Court in the last legal-tender case , followed to its logical conclusion makes the existence of a written constitution of no effect , and breaks ' down the bar - riers ' which separate a government of limited from one of unlimited powers .

		The people of the
United States	LOCATION	are no longer protected from the medisevalism of unlimited power over money by any guarantees except those of an enlightened public opinion . ''

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	, on the other hand , expresses himself as satisfied with the decision in these words : `` Popular judgment on the whole was favorable ; lawyers and constitutional commentators were slowly coming to the conclusion that the interpretation of the Constitution must rest upon a broader basis than that of the debates of

T. W. Hig	PERSON	- in American ginson gave a course or lectures be - uterature .

		f ore ^ he
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	upon the subject of American literature . ''

		Their essential plan was that of concentrating attention on leading figures , instead of burdening the memory with a great many minor names and data . ''

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	has now , with the help of Mr.
H. W. Boynton	PERSON	, recast these lectures into a book intended -LRB- although by no means exclusively -RRB- for the use of schools , and en - titled `` A Reader 's History of American Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work falls into ten chapters , and is illustrated by autograph letters in facsimile and by a few old title-pages .

		The autograph letter from
Emerson	LOCATION	to the author affords a characteristic illustration of the serene optimism of the
Concord	LOCATION	sage .

		The letter is dated
1864	DATE	, and its recipient is lying in the hospital , his usefulness as a soldier being at an end .

		And
Emerson	PERSON	writes him cheerfully as follows : '' If we lose you from the field , it is excel - lent to have a second and better arm .

		You will come back to so many old studies with the basis and the rhetoric of new experience .

		So I am forced to wish you joy in any view I take of your position . ''

		The special interest in this book is supplied by the reminiscent and personal element provided by the senior author .

		Its special defects arise from the same cause , for both the enthusiasms and the preju - dices of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	find free expression .

		As a consequence of the enthusiasms , we take for granted the somewhat exaggerated estimates of
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	,
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	, and
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	; ae an illustration of the prejudices , we may cite the astonishing opinion that '' no one ever did more than
Poe	PERSON	to lower the tone of literary criticism in this country . ''

		We note the inaccuracy that '' in
1774	DATE	the first and second
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gresses met '' in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and we would sug - gest the fact that
Bryant	PERSON	was still living as the probable explanation of the omission of his name from the ninth edition of the '' Encyclopaedia Brit - annica . ''

		For the readable qualities and the literary charm of this book we have only praise ; Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	could not be dull if he tried , and his collaborator is a writer whose work is always done intelligently and gracefully .

		Literary , political , A gentleman 's essays for gentle - and biographical men 's reading -- so one might char - mUceiianiei .

		These two volumes of papers and addresses , by the author of `` Notes from a Diary , '' contain some things worth preserving , and others , in the shape of book-reviews and brief obituary notices , that call less urgently for republication in book form .

		In matters of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	the author shows himself much at home .

		His article on '' Manning and the Catholic Reaction , '' reprinted from the `` Edinburgh Review , '' is an admirable summary .

		The writer 's breadth of view and freedom from bigotry is indicated by his approving reference , elsewhere , to
Henry of Na	ORGANIZATION	- varre , who `` became a Catholic and remained a Protestant . ''

		Years of service in the Colonial Of - fice , in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and as Governor of
Madras	LOCATION	, have so richly stored the author 's mind that his septuagenarian reminiscences can not fail to entertain and instruct . ''

		Recollections of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, 1858-1881 , '' and chapters on Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	, both friends of his , are , with the essay already named , perhaps the best things in the collection .

		We note with ap - proval what he has to say against aggressive terri - torial expansion , against militarism , and against protection .

		But when , turning from politics and economics , he takes
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	to task for rating
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays as the most important prose work done in English in this century , and protests that he himself can find nothing in Em - erson 's prose which he `` should even put alongside the Hyperion of his friend and neighbour Long - fellow , '' we must part company .

		An incidental cen - sure of buckram binding for books will meet with the disapproval of all who have had experience of the undurability of leather and ordinary cloth .

		i jj j - '' / r rv the class-room must be added Mr.
W. Roy Smith	PERSON	's study of ''
South Carolina	LOCATION	as a Royal Province , 1719-1776 '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The treatise is based on the plausible assumption that the be - ginning of the independence of the American col - onies must be sought , not in the era of
1760	DATE	, but from the very foundation of each colony .

		In
South Carolina	LOCATION	, this evolution took the shape of a pro- longed contest between the representatives of the
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 315 proprietary or prerogative interests and the repre - sentatives of the masses .

		These differences were to a large extent reflexes of the contest in the Old World between prerogative and people .

		The con - stant popular encroachment upon the proprietary faction in
South Carolina	LOCATION	culminated in the polit - ical and peaceful revolution of
1719	DATE	, which con - verted the province from a proprietary into a royal colony .

		The contest is presented in the various forms it assumed , such as the quit-rents and the land frauds , together with the universal and ever - present dispute between Governor and
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	over the public finances .

		One chapter gives a clear and readable description of the machinery of a colonial government in the province in its various functions .

		The chief weakness in the system is found to lie in the impossibility of instituting gov - ernment in the backwoods in the form devised in councils of the Old World and promulgated in commissions , statutes , and instructions .

		It was to be supposed that Mr.
McCrady	PERSON	had said the last word on colonial
South Carolina	LOCATION	; but this author , by treating of one phase and doing it well , has made a real contribution to the literature on the subject .

		The hutory and Musical libraries have been enriched the meaning of in the last few years by the publica - noiatum in mutie .

		tion Q f a num ber of books designed to explain some of the complexer things that go to make up the technical structure of modern music , as well as some of the higher aesthetic problems connected with it .

		The representation of musical sounds in writing , called musical notation , -- from nota , a mark or sign , -- is a thing so commonplace , so universal , so apparently simple , that we are apt to overlook the fact that our stave , with its variously shaped '' notes , '' and all that goes to convey a com - poser 's thoughts to the world , are the outcome of centuries of experiments and gradual improvements .

		In '' The Story of Notation '' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- , Mr.
C F. Abdy Williams	PERSON	is shown to be a clear and sound thinker on musical subjects and an able expositor of the complications that enmesh many aspects of them .

		He points out that the roots of our modern musical system lie so deeply embedded in antiquity that it is impossible to trace the early history of its notation without reference to the Greek system from which it has sprung ; and this involves the use of certain words , found in ancient treatises , which are as unfamiliar to modern musicians and Greek scholars as the technicalities of modern musical structure are to the general public .

		Much information has been gathered by the author that has hitherto been difficult of access ; and con - siderable skill is shown in the condensation of the narrative , as well as the clearness with which facts not easily made plain to the modern point of view are here set forth .

		The book will appeal to musi - cians who have a curiosity to get behind the outer veil of sensuous sound upon the reasoned founda - tions that give to music its power of interpretation .

		PeriUtmd During the
year 1902-3	DATE	, four lec - preterraiion tures on Christian Sociology were de - of the home .

		li ve red by Mr.
Jacob A. Biis	PERSON	before the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Divinity School ; and these lectures are now published under the title of '' The Peril and Preservation of the Home '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This will explain why the style of the book is rhetorical rather than literary , and why its substance is re - ligious rather than scientific .

		Upon the preserva - tion of the home , says Mr.
Riis	PERSON	, depends the vitality of our republic .

		It is not necessary to prove it .

		he says , because '' we know that it is so , that it has been so in all ages ; that the home-loving peoples have been the strong peoples in all time , those that have left a lasting impression upon the world . ''

		And our present poor citizenship is a product of the wretched environments in which the majority of men live , -- their lack of a '' home '' in the best sense of the word .

		The causes of this state of affairs he finds in human selfishness as shown in various ways , especially in the tyranny of capital and labor , and the weakening of religious restraints .

		But '' our sins of the past '' have been partially counteracted by our recent awakening to the fact that there is a moral duty imposed upon us to rescue the slums , to provide better tenements as homes for our poor , to abolish child-labor , as a means of preserving these homes .

		The interest of the book lies largely in Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's intimate know - ledge of the conditions which he describes , -- his enthusiasm in the work to be accomplished com - pensating in some measure for the none too system - atic treatment of the subject .

		The borderland As Mr.
Ely	PERSON	states in the preface to
# feT & #	ORGANIZATION	tow .

		his '' Studies in the Evolution of In - and sociology .

		dustrial Society '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the field traversed belongs to that general borderland where economics , ethics , biology , and sociology meet .

		Conscious of his limitations in time and space , he aims to be suggestive rather than ex - haustive ; to give his readers a general idea of the proportionate parts the various factors play in evo - lution of industrial society .

		With this end in view , he begins by surveying broadly the successive stages through which society has passed before it reaches the conditions favorable to an industrial economy .

		Although the line of development which he adopts has little that is new in the way of theory to add to the work of other economists , his treatment is ex - tremely careful and is fortified by statistical state - ments of supplementary and independent interest .

		Certain problems of industrial society suggested in this general survey are treated in separate chapters , where the author shows himself conversant not only with the opinions of a very large number of soci - ological and economic writers , but also with the actual conditions of to-day .

		He touches on the vital questions of competition , trusts , monopolies , municipal and national ownership , social progress , the concentration of wealth , public expenditures , and industrial adjustment in general .

		The book 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, contains some admirable chapters , -- among them an analysis of the
Steel Trust	ORGANIZATION	and a summary of the
United States Industrial Commission	ORGANIZATION	's Report on Labor .

		Mr.
Ely	PERSON	's style lacks conciseness , and for this reason his readers must exercise a little pa - tience in following his thought and argument .

		Admiral
Porter	PERSON	, A vei 7 readable account of the naval at a Great operations along the lower Missis - Commander .

		8 ippi and Red rivers during the Civil War is contained in several chapters of the life of Admiral
Porter	PERSON	, which Mr.
James Russell Soley	PERSON	has written for the '' Great Commanders '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The material is derived largely from the official records of the
Naval War Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the author remarks , the work of
Porter	PERSON	was not of the dashing or dramatic order likely to catch public attention , as was that of Farragut at
New Orleans	LOCATION	,
Du Pont	ORGANIZATION	at
Port Royal	ORGANIZATION	, or especially of Winslow on the '' Kearsarge '' ; but it demanded even a higher degree of patience , attention to details , and a broader grasp of an extended situation to be dealt with .


Porter	PERSON	's familiar penchant for rash speech , which frequently precipitated him into hot water with both the authorities and his friends , is attributed to an over-honesty of character and a rare straightfor - wardness .

		The author also admits a frequent in - consistency in
Porter	LOCATION	's views at different times .

		The volume , both in the abundance of historic matter presented and in giving facts instead of fulsome eulogy , is decidedly superior to many of the biogra - phies appearing in the various '' series '' at this time .

		A bicentennial life of
Wesley	LOCATION	.

		The history of famous assassinations , Many are the threads on which have been strung the beads of historical incidents of note , that they might at - tract the attention of the general reader ; but sel - dom has there been a stranger thread than that used by Mr.
Francis Johnson	PERSON	in his '' Thirty Famous As - sassinations '' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In this book are described assassinations that have grown out of the general conditions of the various periods of western history , from that of
Philip of Macedon	LOCATION	, in 336
B.C.	LOCATION	, to that of
King Alexander	ORGANIZATION	and Queen
Draga	PERSON	in the present year .

		The author has selected those '' which either had an important and political bearing on the world , or on the nation immediately affected , or which left a profound impression on the imagination of contemporaries and posterity . ''

		The American subjects are Presidents Lincoln and Mc -
Kinley	PERSON	; the assassination of President
Garfield	PERSON	is omitted as growing out of the aberration of a single diseased mind , and having no marked political significance .

		When there have been several note - worthy assassinations growing out of one general condition , a typical example has been selected .

		The stories are well told and the book is a compact presentation of some of the most interesting and dramatic chapters in political history .

		A number of interesting portraits of the men and women dealt with adds to the attractiveness of the volume , which is unusually presentable in outward form .

		The Rev.
William Henry Meredith	PERSON	does well to base his account of `` The Real John Wesley '' -LRB-
Jen	PERSON	- nings & Pye -RRB- on the Journal of that ever - interest - ing man .

		But perhaps we should have entered upon our reading of this attractive volume with keener zest , had not the author proclaimed it in his preface as '' giving a unique portraiture '' of its sub - ject .

		Moreover , the Methodist minister is through - out a little too obvious in the narrator .

		Wesley 's is a life that can best be left to point its own moral .

		The chapter on his wit and humor hardly succeeds in proving him a humorist .

		Wit he had in good measure , for he was surprisingly alert in mind no less than in body .

		Meeting in a narrow lane a purse-proud squire who rudely declared that he never turned out for a fool , Wesley at once replied , '' I always do , '' and turned aside to let the other pass .

		A sense of humor would have saved
Wesley	PERSON	from the childish credulity and absurd superstition that here and there crop out in his Journal .

		Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's book will give special satisfaction to those of his own communion , though it fails to make the great Methodist any more real to the reader than do other accounts written with that ob - ject less obviously in view .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Clement Huart	PERSON	, of the
Ecole des Langues Orientales	ORGANIZATION	, has prepared '' A History of Arabic Litera - ture '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- for the series of '' Literatures of the World , '' now numbering an even dozen of volumes .

		The scope of this work is wide , since it includes all literature in the Arabic language , and extends from the pre-lslamic poets of the desert all the way down to the journalism of to-day .

		A work so packed with un - familiar names and titles can hardly be said to make interesting reading for anyone but a specialist , but there can be no doubt of its scholarly character , or of the desirability for reference purposes of such a com - pendium of a literature that has played a great part in the world 's thought .

		The appearance of the seventh and concluding vol - ume in the '' definitive edition de luxe '' of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's works , published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, leads us to add a final word of praise to what we have already said regarding this edition .

		Here , for the first time , the incomparable Letters are brought together and arranged in correct chronological order , with an Index making their wealth of allusion readily available for reference .

		This fact , together with the handsome out - ward appearance of the set , makes it by far the best edition of

		To the already unu - sually large number of illustrations in this work the pub - lishers have added twenty-five photogravure portraits of the Presidents , from

		Both in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	the first edition of
Morley 's Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	was sold out on publication , owing to the unexpectedly large demand for the book .

		So eagerly has the British public taken up the work that there is talk of its issue in parts , as novels used to be published in the days of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		The first volume in ''
Margaret Sidney	PERSON	's '' famous '' Pepper '' series , entitled '' Five Little Peppers and How They Grew , '' has taken a new lease of life in the illustrated edition just issued by the

Samuel Brohl	PERSON	and Company , '' by
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	, is published by the
Ormeril Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, in their '' Collection of Foreign Authors , '' which leads us to ask the question why some publisher does not have the good sense to give us a complete Cherbuliez -- the whole twenty or more volumes -- in English , and thus earn the gratitude -LRB- as well as the dollars -RRB- of hosts of readers .

		`` The Dance of Life , '' by the author of `` Doctor Syntax , '' and
Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' both with the original colored illustrations by Row - landson , are the latest additions to the series of reprints published by the Messrs.

		We should be grateful to the publishers if they would provide the series with a col - lective title .

		The
A. Wessels Company	ORGANIZATION	has secured the American edition of '' Stevensoniana '' by Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	, which will be published by them immediately .

		The edi - tion is limited to 1000 copies for
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and is issued uniform with the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The single aim before the compiler was to search for his material only in the forgotten pages of English and American periodicals , and in books by writers of eminence not entirely devoted to
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The '' Mermaid Series '' of old English dramatists was one of the most nsef ul collections of reprints ever undertaken .

		The volumes were well-edited , and pro- vided trustworthy reproductions of the original plays .

		When the publication slackened , and , after the appear - ance of about a score of volumes , ceased altogether , it was to us a matter of deep regret .

		We now welcome a new edition of this series , reduced in size of volume and made more attractive than the earlier issue in many 318 THE DIAL -LSB-

		322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, THE STORY OF A BOOK .

		IN THREK CHAPTERS .

		♦ Chapter 3 .

		A Triple Verdict . ''

		/ ^ ET ` the best '' -- this to the public ; `` make > - r the best '' -- this to themselves , has been the motto of the publishers of
Webster	PERSON	's Inter - national Dictionary .

		Their aim has been to make the best popular dictionary in the En - glish language , in respect to accuracy , clear - ness , fullness , convenience , and usefulness to all classes of consulters .

		Comparison is not here made with the many-volumed and ency - clopedic works , but with those whose size and form adapt them to quick and easy use ; the one-volume books which aim to serve all classes from the erudite scholar to the school-child .

		Without a word of disparaging comment on other works which claim to rival
Webster	PERSON	, let us seek the verdict of some tribunal so high in character and intelligence , so numerous in membership , and so impartial in constitution , as to give a sanction like that of a court of last resort .

		Three such tribunals will be cited as to the merits of
Webster	PERSON	's
International Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary , in comparison with all works of simi - lar aim .

		To what authority upon doubtful questions do the American people habitually pay the highest deference ?

		Unquestionably , to the Na - tional and
State Supreme Courts	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are not only accepted as final arbiters on the vast and vital matters within their immediate sphere , but in great emergencies , like a disputed presi - dency or a wide-spread labor disturbance , the national impulse turns to these courts as the strongholds of broad intelligence and the high - est fairness .

		Weighty then are their opinions on a subject so peculiarly within their range as text-books of definitions .

		Language , the medium through which all statutes and prece - dents are expressed , is the very subject matter with which courts are continually dealing .

		It is of the first consequence to them to have some standard of appeal as to the meanings and usages of words , which is not only of the first order of intrinsic merit , but is so widely recognized as to command popular approval .

		Hear then the opinions , first of individuals and then virtually of the entire body , of the highest judiciary of the country .

		In the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	,
Chief Justice Fuller	ORGANIZATION	says of the International : '' I ♦ Chapters 1 and 2 of '' The Story of a Book '' appeared in the two previous issues of The Dial .

		regard it as of the utmost value in accuracy of definition , and have found it in all respects complete and thorough . ''

		Justice Gray : '' I always considered
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary as the best in the language in the matter of defini - tions . ''

		Justice Brewer : '' From my child - hood up ,
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary has been my authority .

		The last , the
International Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary , is the perfection of dictionaries . ''

		Jus -
tice Brown	PERSON	, after a life-long experience , has found it '' invaluable as a book of easy refer - ence , '' and believes '' it will succeed for many years in maintaining its position as the lead - ing dictionary of the language . ''

		Justice
Shiras	PERSON	is no less emphatic .

		Justice
Harlan	PERSON	says : '' It should be in the library of every American judge , lawyer , preacher , journalist , statesman , and student '' ; and while it is desir - able to have more than one dictionary always at hand , '' if only one can be afforded , prefer - ence should be given to
Webster	PERSON	's Interna - tional Dictionary . ''

		Justice
McKenna	PERSON	has '' always used the Webster '' and finds its old reputation as to completeness and accuracy sustained by the International .

		Justice White in `` daily use '' finds the book `` of the great - est utility '' ; and
Justice Peckham	PERSON	, praising especially the Supplement of
1900	DATE	, regards the whole work as constituting '' a perfect ex - position of the English language as existing at this time . ''

		Turning now to the highest courts of all the States , we find an almost unanimous consen - sus to the same effect .

		Thus
Chief Justice Knowlton	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	says : '' For all who want but one dictionary of the English language for general use in any department of study , or in literary or profes - sional work , I regard
Webster	PERSON	's International as decidedly the best . ''

		And so on through the
State Courts	ORGANIZATION	, the entire body of judges generally speaking as one .

		In many instances the statement is explicit that the Interna - tional is preferred before all others .

		The most guarded expression is that of the Justices of the
New York Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	, and they speak of the International as '' in no respect falling behind its numerous rivals , however re - markable for their extent and accuracy . ''

		The opinions of the entire bench of other State Su - preme Courts may be briefly sampled .


Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania : `` No other single volume is so valuable or so satisfactory . ''

		New Hampshire : `` The best one-book dictionary of the English language . ''


Arkansas	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	say the same .

		Kentucky calls it '' the
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 most comprehensive and accurate dictionary in existence . ''


Nevada	LOCATION	says : '' In our library we have many other dictionaries , but all of them put together are not consulted as much as
Webster	PERSON	. ''

		New Jersey : '' For everyday use , no English lexicon is at all comparable with
Webster	PERSON	's International . ''

		Equally emphatic are
Delaware	LOCATION	,
Idaho	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, Min - nesota ,
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	.

		All these are explicit in affirming the International as the best for general use ; and this is since the publication of all its would-be rivals .

		The
Florida	LOCATION	Justices define its peculiar service to the bench : '' Frequently the proper interpre - tation of an instrument or a statute , before us for review , hinges upon the accurate definition of a word : in all such cases we turn with con - fidence to
Webster	PERSON	's International . ''

		Others dwell upon the fund of general information ; thus the
North Dakota	LOCATION	Justices : '' No other single book extant contains such stores of rich , varied , and exact knowledge . ''

		The
Ohio	LOCATION	Su - preme Court : '' The new -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- edition of
Webster	PERSON	's International seems to have reached the acme of perfection in book-making , edi - torially and mechanically . ''

		In brief , the en - tire body of Judges in the
National and State Supreme Courts	ORGANIZATION	, with the exception of hardly a dozen individuals -LRB- and these recommended no other -RRB- , have borne testimony to the pre - eminent merit of the International .

		To the question , '' What popular dictionary is accepted as of the highest authority and value by the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' -- could there be any more weighty answer than this almost unanimous testimony of the Su - preme Court Judges of the Nation and all the States ?

		Another tribunal may be cited , which in a different field carries not less authority , and which speaks with one voice .

		The public school systems of the forty-five States are practically a unit in favor of the
International	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every one of their State Superintendents recom - mends it in the highest terms .

		In every
State Normal	ORGANIZATION	school it is the accepted standard .

		Wherever State funds have been appropriated for the purchase of a large dictionary for the schools ,
Webster	PERSON	's has been the book .

		The school books of the country , wherever they are of such character as to require a standard in spelling , pronunciation , and definition , follow the International with hardly an exception .

		The highest judiciary and the entire public school svstem -- better indexes of American opinion can hardly be named .

		It remains to question that broader constituency which the name '' International '' suggests , -- the English - speaking peoples beyond
America	LOCATION	.

		It has been said that the judgment of foreigners carries a weight like that of posterity , -- owing to its freedom from local or temporary bias .

		Taking first Great
Britain	LOCATION	: the popular test shows a sale of the International far beyond that of any other one - volume dictionary , English or Amer - ican .

		The official test is given by the fact that the only Governmental departments of
Great Britain	LOCATION	using any standard of language -- the Postal and Telegraphic , both managed entirely by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	-- follow the International .

		The scholar 's test may .

		be best indicated , to take from many tributes the most authoritative and impressive , by the unsolicited words of Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, editor of the unfinished many-volumed
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, and probably the highest individual authority on lexicography in the English-speaking world : '' In this its latest form , and with its large Supplement and nu - merous Appendices ,
Webster	PERSON	's
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	is a wonderful volume , which well maintains its grounds against all rivals , on its own lines . ''

		And again : '' The last edition of
Webster	PERSON	, the
International	ORGANIZATION	, is perhaps the best of one - volume dictionaries . ''

		In
Canada	LOCATION	,
the International	ORGANIZATION	far outsells all rivals .

		In
Australia	LOCATION	it has the field to itself , and with special reason ; for this great com - monwealth has been explored with the utmost thoroughness as to its wealth of new words and usages , by representatives of
Webster	PERSON	on the ground , cooperating with the best local scholarship , and reaping a harvest which the home office has winnowed and inwrought with the main work .

		In the new American Col - onies , in
South Africa	LOCATION	, in
India	LOCATION	, in
China	LOCATION	, in
Japan	LOCATION	, throughout
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, and wherever flies the Stars and Stripes or the
Union Jack	ORGANIZATION	, the International goes as a chief symbol and agent of that language which leads the world 's civilization . ''

		The story of a book '' -- it has been shown as a story of supreme concentration ;
Noah Webster	PERSON	devoting a lifetime of genius , learn - ing , and character to one book ; the
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	giving their whole energy for sixty years to perfecting and spreading the work .

		It has been a story of the close alliance of Scholarship and Business ; the scholar 's thirst for perfection wedded to the business man 's sense of practical needs .

		It is a story of growth , the patriot scholar 's lonely dream 324 THE DIAL I
Nov. 1	DATE	, of an ''
American Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of the English Language , '' maturing to an '' International Dictionary , '' the accepted authority of a world - encompassing race .

		The blue-backed
Webster	PERSON	's Speller , of which the public have consumed some seventy-five million copies , concluded with a few pungent fables , `` The Milkmaid , '' `` The Old Man 's Apple Tree and the Rude Boy , '' etc. , and to each fable was appended a moral .

		To the present Story the Moral may be given in words a little amplified from an old quotation : All young persons , and all older ones no less , should have a dictionary at their elbow ; and while you are about it , get the best -- get Web - ster 's International .

GEORGE F. HOAR	PERSON	'S new book Autobiography of Seventy Years In Two Volumes , Large 8vo , with Portrait ,
$ 7.50	MONEY	net NOT only for its political importance , but for the unusual personal , social , and literary interest of the reminiscences it brings together , Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's autobiography will be the most notable contribution of the year to memoir-literature .

		It would be impossible to find another man in the country who has known more of the important men and measures of his time than Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	; and the charm and piquancy of his style , with its range , from the eloquent discussion of his political principles to the humor of his anecdotes , are as remarkable as his experiences .

		The book is re - freshingly frank and full of character and individuality -- a record of opinions as well as events .

		One thinks of
John B. Gordon	PERSON	as a virile and lovable character .

		It was a fine thing for a man to bear himself so worthily in the great war : it was finer to write about it so sweetly and fairly in the decline of life -- ' nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice . '

		Every American should read
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		He will be a better citizen for it , and it will be a tonic to his patriotism . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 362 NOTES 363 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 364 THE ODOR MOMMSEN .

		The Germans have made the history of
Rome	LOCATION	and the study of its antiquities pecu - liarly their own , and the students of other na - tions have sat at their feet for a century past .

		The long line of investigators from
Niebuhr	PERSON	to
Mommsen	PERSON	constitutes one of the greatest glories of German scholarship , and the last of the line , who died on the first day of the pres - ent month , was the greatest scholar of them all .


Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	, preeminent among the '' grand old men '' left to the
twentieth century	DATE	as a legacy from the nineteenth , was born in Schleswig on the
last day of November , 1817	DATE	, and had nearly completed his eighty-sixth year at the time of his death .

		His life was one of uninterrupted labor in his chosen field , and his prodigious achievement has set a mark which will not easily be approached by any scholar of the coming time .


Mommsen	PERSON	's preliminary studies , in philol - ogy , jurisprudence , and archaeology , were made at the
University of Kiel	ORGANIZATION	, and during a tour of three years in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, spent in col - lecting Roman inscriptions .

		In
1848	DATE	, he be - gan his professional career , occupying chairs in
Leipzig	LOCATION	,
Zurich	LOCATION	, and
Breslau	PERSON	, before settling down , ten years later , in the city which was to become the capital of the German Empire , and which thus became his home for the forty-five years remaining to him .

		Here he entered upon the great work of his life , the publication of the '' Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , '' of which the first part appeared in
1863	DATE	, and which fills many volumes , collecting and preserving all extant Latin inscriptions down to the time of
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		Other works of great importance are his handbook of Roman antiquities , his editions of the Digest and the
Corpus Juris Civilis	PERSON	, and his ''
Rbmische Forschungen	PERSON	, '' to say nothing of his countless papers on coins , dialects , epi - graphy , and jurisprudence .

		Overshadowing all these productions in the estimation of the general public , the five vol - umes of his Roman history , with the two sup - plementary volumes on the provinces of the Empire , constitute his chief claim to the re - gard of cultivated readers who are not special - ists .

		It is by this work alone that he is widely 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, read throughout the world , and through its agency that his name has been a household word during the last half-century wherever books are read .

		It is a work of strong preju - dices , no doubt , and its deification of mere strength , as typified by
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, some - what discredits it with those who lay stress upon moral distinctions .

		It is also open to the criticism of the late
C. K. Adams	PERSON	, who pointed out that neither philology nor the study of inscriptions may be regarded as a perfectly secure foundation for history .

		But whatever its defects from an ideal standpoint , there is no denying its brilliancy of style , its incisiveness of characterization , and the im - petuous energy with which it rushes onward .

		Its theories stand by no means unopposed , but it is the work of a great advocate , and the first impression it produces is simply overwhelming .

		A man who has served learning as well as
Mommsen	PERSON	has might well be forgiven had he done nothing more than this .

		But the ideal of cloistered scholarship did not satisfy his own sense of obligation to his fellows , and for many years he has been conspicuous among the scholars who are also men of affairs .

		His en - trance into public life in the strict sense was made late in his career , but from the early sev - enties down to the time of his death he was a force to be reckoned with in practical politics .

		He was always the outspoken champion of liberalism , and he even locked horns with
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck in one memorable instance , being pros - ecuted for his alleged libellous utterances , and triumphantly acquitted in both the ensuing trials .

		Unlike most German liberalists , he did not ally himself with the Socialist movement , but opposed it with all his might as a menace to individualism , which he believed to be a necessary condition of progress .

		He was the champion of the Jew when attacked by the anti-Semitic fury , and of academic freedom when threatened by administrative intolerance .

		During very recent years his voice was raised in sharp condemnation of the American folly which led to our needless war with
Spain	LOCATION	and our wanton piracy in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	.

		He was also outspoken in his censure of the English policy which resulted in the South African war .

		Yet in spite of this censure , to which con - science constrained him , of the recent acts of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in the international arena , he was at heart the friend of the English-speaking peoples , because he knew that they had been historically , and in spite I of temporary aberrations , the defenders of lib - erty , and the trustees of the hope of democracy .

		And almost the last of his published words , written for the pages of an English review , expressed his confidence in the race which he had so recently criticised in such caustic terms . ''

		I know , '' he said , '' That I speak not only for myself , but for the best , and , at the same time , for the great majority of the German people , when I say that , though we have no doubt disapproved , and shall continue to disapprove , a single act of the English nation , we yet feel ourselves more nearly akin , and in every respect more intimately allied , to them than to any other nation .

		The English language is , after all , in its main elements
Saxon	LOCATION	; and
Shakespeare	PERSON	has been for
Germany	LOCATION	as well as for En - gland a spiritual deliverer , and the father of our poetry .

		... I look back over a long life : of what I hoped for my own nation and for the world at large , only a small part has been fulfilled .

		But the holy alliance of the nations was the aim of my youth , and is still the star of my old age . ''

		With these noble words still echoing in our consciousness , we now take leave of the man who uttered them , and know full well that the world is indescribably the poorer for his death .

		Accuracy is very properly regarded as the most essential of all the attributes of -LSB- an Encyclopaedia -RSB- . ''

		Let the owner of a book find within its covers erroneous , misleading , or even prejudiced or partisan statements , and he distrusts it ever afterward . ''

		-- Editorial in the
Encyclo	LOCATION	- pedia Americana .

		The older editions of `` Chambers 's Encyclopaedia '' contain an article on Slugs which is not altogether accurate .

		In the one before me -- that of
1876	DATE	-- I find these words : '' The Red S. -LRB- Agrion agrestis -RRB- is also very plentiful . ''

		Now the red slug is not Agrion agrestis , but is Arion ater var .

		rufus , sometimes called Arion empiricorum .

		Agrion is the name of a genus of dragon-flies , while agrestis is the specific name of the field slug -LRB- Agriolimax agrestis -RRB- .

		If the doc - trine of the survival of the fittest is worth anything in literature , it would seem that this curious hybrid animal , a mixture of two sorts of slugs and a dragon - fly , should have quickly become extinct .

		But not so .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 dred works prevents me from following its slimy - trail any farther , but it is only fair to mention that '' Chambers '' has long ago disavowed the animal . ''

		Johnson 's Universal Cyclopaedia , ''
1897	DATE	, figures the red slug , but wisely refrains from offering a scientific name .

		The figure represents the genuine beast -LRB- Arion -RRB- and the only criticism one can offer is that it is not found in
America	LOCATION	- The '' American Cyclopaedia , ''
1881	DATE	, gives a figure of a slug , labeled Limax -LRB- i. e. Agriolimax -RRB- agrestis ; but unfortu - nately the picture is that of a totally different
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean species , Amalia sowerbii .

		In the text are some remarks on `` the common slug of New En - gland , L. tunicata ,
Gould	PERSON	, '' the writer being evi - dently unaware that this name is a synonym of Agriolimax agrestis .

		Even the '' Century Diction - ary , '' usually a model of accuracy , can not with im - punity handle the dangerous subject of Slugs .

		It tells us about the Teneriffe Slug , '' which shines at night like the glow-worm , '' an apparently fabulous creature unknown to modern naturalists ; and
Alaska	LOCATION	is given -- surely in error -- as a locality for Ario - limax Columbianus .

		The `` New International '' and the u Encyclopaedia Americana '' have not yet reached the letter S , so we can not tell what sur - prises they may have in store for us .

		The above criticism is a little technical , no doubt ; but it is written for the average reader .

		One of the first signs of prosperity in an American household is the purchase of an encyclopaedia .

		The owner feels that he has acquired a new brain , at a very moderate cost , considering its utility .

		It would be hard to overestimate the educational value of a good encyclopaedia well used .

		The writer of these lines was brought up on '' Chambers , '' and to-day he can - not look upon the familiar volumes without a f eeling akin to reverence .

		It is with the strongest possible sense of the importance of encyclopaedias , and of the good work they have done and are doing , that these remarks are offered .

		Because of this feeling , and because of the trust that is everywhere placed in these works , it becomes necessary to insist that they should be in all respects worthy of their mission .

		Their editors would be the last to deny this , but where the spirit has been willing , the flesh has been all too weak .

		Some time ago , in the town of
Las Vegas	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	, I was visited by a lady and gentleman who were acting as travelling agents for the New Inter - national Encyclopaedia .

		I expressed surprise that these well-educated and competent people could make any sort of a living out of the sales of a single encyclopaedia in a comparatively thinly peopled region .

		They assured me , however , that the work paid .

		Although I was not a purchaser , they kindly loaned me the first volume -LRB- the only one then out -RRB- , and I examined it with very great interest .

		The ful - ness of detail , the number of subjects treated , and the excellence of many of the illustrations , were indeed remarkable .

		But alas !

		here and there were the queerest things .

		In an article on `` The Arctic Region '' a figure of an arctic plant was upside down .

		Under `` Ant Lion '' was a figure of a quite different insect , the lace-wing fly or Chrysopa .

		Under '' An - thocyan '' the facts about the well-known chemical reaction were exactly reversed .

		These and a few other errors were pointed out to the publishers -LRB- who had very likely heard of them from other quarters ! -RRB-

		, and in the more recently printed copies they have been corrected .

		Thus , I find that while the copy at
Colorado College	ORGANIZATION	contains them , that at the
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	public library is correct .

		It must have been very troublesome to make the changes after the printing was far advanced , and the fact that they were made illustrates the genuineness of the editors ' desire for accuracy .

		However , there are other things in later volumes .

		One or two may be cited : ARTICLE `` LAC . ''

		ARTICLE '' LAC-mSECT . '' ''

		The general name under '' Any one of the several which the various products of scale-insects of the coccid the lac-insect -LRB- Coccus lacca -RRB- genus
Carteria	LOCATION	, which se - are known .

		The insects live cretes lac -LRB- q. v. -RRB-
Carteria	LOCATION	upon the twigs of certain lacca , of
Asia	LOCATION	, secretes the trees , and soon entomb them - gum lac or stick lac of corn - selves in a mass of matter , merce . ''

		-LSB- Only three species which oozes from small of lac-insects are indicated as punctures made in the twigs known ; the known species of the tree , and which thus actually number 24 . -RSB-

		furnishes them with both food and shelter . ''

		In one of these articles we are told that the insect secretes the lac , in the other that it oozes from the tree .

		The lac is actually secreted by the insect .

		The names given for the lac insect are different in the two articles ; one of them was current a hundred years ago , the other twenty-five years ago and later , while modern entomologists call the creature Tach - ardia lacca .

		In the article `` Coccidae '' we read : `` For the latest systematic account of the family by
Cockerell	PERSON	consult ' Four New Diaspine Coccidae , ' besides other articles in the Canadian Entomologist . ' '

		The article cited is one of the least important of those by the writer mentioned , and nothing whatever is said about the beautiful and indispensable works of
Signoret	LOCATION	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	, and
Newstead	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the article `` Mantis '' the figure is labelled
Mantis Carolina	LOCATION	, while the text has Stagamomantis -LSB- misprint for Stagmomantis -RSB-
Carolina	LOCATION	, the latter being correct except for the misprint - The
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean mantis is called Mantio -LSB- misprint for Mantis -RSB- religiosa .

		The `` Encyclopedia Americana , '' also in course of publication , suffers from the same general malady .

		There are good signed articles by
Packard	ORGANIZATION	,
Coville	PERSON	, etc. , but they cover only part of the scientific field .

		A rather hasty examination reveals a few things like these : Butterflies .

		-- The second plate has most of the names misplaced .

		Cabbage insects .

		-- The harlequin cabbage-bug is called a beetle , and Plusia brassicai is apparently intended by the name Noctua brassicai .

Nov. 16	DATE	,
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		-- We are told that ``
Arizona	LOCATION	is a tropic country modified by its elevation in the north ; ... there are no true
summer	DATE	and
winter	DATE	, but a short rainy season in midsummer and a dry one the rest of the year . ''

		What is the remedy for this unfortunate condi - tion of affairs ?

		It can not be denied that the editors of the encyclopaedias are good men , and that the pub - lishers have done bravely .

		Moreover , the writings of the most competent living authorities , on their own chosen subjects , are by no means free from error .

		Nevertheless , there are ample opportunities for improvement .

		Those who have done any writing for encyclopaedias know how trifling is the pay of - fered , and how the work is farmed out to almost anyone who is reasonably competent .

		Compare this with the enormous sums expended in putting the books upon the market , -- in agents and advertise - ments , -- and it seems sufficiently evident that things are not properly balanced .

		The expenses involved in publication are necessarily high , but at present they must be out of all proportion to the cost of get - ting the material .

		I do not mean by this that the writing and editing may not cost more than the advertising , -- whether they do or not I have no knowledge , -- but I do mean that the time and ex - pense given to the preparation of the text is usually quite inadequate .

		Considering the great importance of the encyclopaedias to the people of this country , it would seem as if they could not be too carefully prepared , and that the very best authorities should in every case be consulted .

		Those who , having knowledge of special matters , refuse to place it at the service of the encyclopaedias are surely blame - worthy , always assuming that they are not required to work for an unreasonably small wage .

		One dif - ficulty , no doubt , arises from the number of parallel publications , resulting in competition , which does not seem to encourage anything but activity in adver - tising .

		It might be supposed that the competing works would be stirred up to excel in all good qual - ities ; but I believe that the contrary effect is pro- duced , because of the necessity for economy and the attempts to catch the public eye by other than schol - arly means .

		To illustrate my meaning , I will ask the explanation of several of the full-page portraits in the `` Encyclopedia Americana . ''

		They are cer - tainly not there because the fitness of things de - mands it .

		Another source of trouble arises I think from the anonymity of the articles .

		The editors of the `` New International '' set forth a plea for an - onymity ; but the fact remains that signed articles are at least on the average more carefully prepared , and as for the revision spoken of as necessary , the authors themselves should revise as frequently as occasion demands .

		To an intelligent reader , also , the knowledge of the author 's name is of material assistance in estimating the character and value of what is read .

		It has been well said that no litera - ture can be quite perfectly understood without a certain knowledge of the personal equation of the writer .

		Would it not be possible for American scholars to follow somewhat the plan of the great
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, and cooperate toward the production of a really national encyclopaedia , which should reflect the very best knowledge and scholarship in the land ?

		Probably one of the existing works could be taken as the foundation .

		I do not suggest an international encyclopaedia , because I believe we require one which meets our special conditions and needs , and at any rate that is a sufficient under - taking for the present .

		In a notice of Sir

Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' rating
Emerson	PERSON	's Essays as the most impor - tant prose work done in English in this century . ''

		The words quoted make one rub his eyes .

		Recalling how Arnold was berated in this country for his supposed disparagement of

Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's prose work is thus made of paramount importance includes such writers as
Carlyle	LOCATION	,

Philippine Islands	LOCATION	only to the beginning of the nineteenth century .

		The reasons for this seemed ob - vious and sufficient .

		But so many and urgent requests have come from subscribers and reviewers for such ex - tension of the series as shall cover the entire period of Spanish domination , that it has been decided to modify the former plan in the manner here briefly indicated .

		It is proposed not to exceed the number of volumes already announced , -- fifty-five .

		This can be done be - cause , in the original plan , to avoid a subsequent in - crease in the number of volumes , a certain amount of space was purposely left for possible future changes as a result of later investigations to be made in foreign archives , or on account of the necessary excision of extraneous or irrelevant matter from the printed works to be presented in this series .

		The new title will be '' The Philippine Islands : 1493-1898 . ''

		Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's Autobiography .

		* In commending to the reader Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's '' Autobiography of Seventy Years , '' no words of personal eulogy are called for from this pen .

		The man is known by his works , of which this book is a worthy record .

		Indeed , so packed is it with memorable things that the reviewer , se - lecting here and there a chapter or a passage for special notice , feels like one gathering peb - bles on the seashore .

		The author appears to have had somewhat the same feeling in writing ; for he says , '' I have no doubt that after these volumes are published , there will come up in my mind matter enough to make a dozen bet - ter ones . ''

		Having rarely kept a diary , he here writes , or rather dictates , from the abundant stores of a well - furnished memory .

		To the advantages of good birth and breeding was added the best education obtainable for a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	boy of his time .

		But even of this best he has a poor opinion . ''

		There was , '' he writes , describing
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, '' as it seems to me in looking back , little instruction of much value .

		The good scholars and the bad went to the recitation together .

		The good ones lost the hour , and the poor scholars got the benefit of hearing the good ones recite . ''

		Yet he adds later , '' There was something in the col - lege training of that day , imperfect as were its instruments , and slender as were its resources , from which more intellectual strength in the pupil was begotten than there is in the college training of the present generation . ''

		To the personality of the instructors he ascribes the difference .

		Among the best fitting schools of his day he names Mrs.
Sarah Ripley	PERSON	's at Wal - tham , and gives in full
Emerson	PERSON	's excellent obituary notice of that wonderful woman , of whom
Edward Everett	PERSON	used to say that she could fill any of the professorships at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Emerson 's tribute , not being included in his collected works , adds value to Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	's vol - umes .

		The two members of the author 's class -LRB- 1846 -RRB- whom he thinks the most entitled to fame are Dr.
Calvin Ellis	PERSON	and Judge
Nathan Webb	PERSON	, both now deceased .

		Again , however , he declares that the one member whose fame will last to remote posterity is
Walter Mitchell	PERSON	; and this fame he bases on a single poem of
Mitchell	ORGANIZATION	's , `` Tacking the Ship off Fire Island . ''

Autobiography of Seventy Years	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Lane , also , the Latin grammarian and author of the song , '' The Lone Fish Ball , '' he singles out for claims to immortality ; and so of Child and
Short	PERSON	and
Fitzedward Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		Let us settle the question which has thus baffled his generous indiscrimination , and find , without going beyond the title-page of his book , the name that will survive those of all his classmates .

		Speaking of his instructors , Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	refuses to Professor
Channing	PERSON	, that teacher of great writers , the praise we have learned to expect from his pupils .

		But he acknowledges that he may be wrong , and adds a generous word of eulogy for the professor 's textbook on rhetoric and oratory .

		In this connection it is worth while adding that Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	, searching English literature for a vigorous and manly style , the fit vehicle for conveying weighty thoughts to courts or juries or popular assemblies , advises the law student to give his days and nights to South 's sermons .

		.

		Hastening on to more important matters , we read of the young lawyer 's entry into public life . ''

		Bat I happened one night in the
autumn of 1850	DATE	to be at a great mass meeting in the
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	, at
Worcester	LOCATION	, which
Charles Allen	PERSON	was expected to ad - dress ... Judge
Allen	PERSON	, as he was somewhat apt to do , came in late .

		A vast audience had gathered and were waiting .

		Nobody seemed ready to speak .

		Somebody started the cry , `` Hoar !

		Hoar ! '

		My father and brother were known as leaders in the
Free Soil Party	ORGANIZATION	, and that I suppose made somebody call on me .

		I got up in my place in the middle of the hall in great confusion .

		There were shouts of ' platform , ' • platform . '

		I made my way to the platform , hoping only to make my excuses and get off without being detected .

		But the people were disposed to be good-natured , and liked what I said .

		... It was printed in the Free Soil papers , and from that time I was in considerable demand as a public speaker ... The next year
Worcester	LOCATION	failed to elect her representatives to the Legislature , which were voted for all on one ticket and required a majority , and there was to be a second election on the
fourth Monday of November	DATE	.

		There was a delegate convention to nomi - nate representatives , of which I was a member .

		When the vote was announced , to my surprise and consterna - tion , I was one of the persons nominated . ''

		Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	was then but twenty-five years old , and felt that he could not accept the nomination without his father 's approval , which however he obtained and was elected , but refused a re - election .

		The young politician 's modest ambition had been to build up a sufficient practice in Wor - cester to bring him in twelve or
fifteen hundred dollars	MONEY	a year .

		He expected to remain unmar - ried , to hire a comfortable room where he could live in contentment with his books , and so to end his days .

		But in this instance the thatched cottage had to give place to the castle in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Want of space forbids an enumeration of Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	's varied activities and unsought honors .

		Let it be borne in mind as not least to his credit , that he has now stood at his post in
Washing	LOCATION	- ton for thirty-five years , enduring a life dis - tasteful to him , at the urgent bidding of his constituents , and receiving a salary barely suf - ficient for his needs , when with far less labor he might have been earning fifty thousand dollars a year in law practice , and enjoying at the same time a mode of life much more congenial to his tastes .

		How truly he has obeyed his conscience in this devotion to the public service , his own words will show . ''

		I have often been charged with a blind and zealous attachment to party .

		The charge is sometimes made by persons who consider that I desire to do right , but think that my understanding and intellectual faculties are guided and blinded by that emotion .

		Others are not so charitable ... But I will say two things : 1 .

		I have never in my life cast a vote or done an act in legislation that I did not at the time believe to be right , and that I am not now willing to avow and to defend and debate with any champion , of sufficient im - portance , who desires to attack it at any time and in any presence .

		2 .

		Whether I am right or wrong in my opinion as to the duty of acting with and adherence to party , it is the result not of emotion or attachment or excitement , but of as cool , calculating , sober , and de - liberate reflection as I am able to give to any question of conduct or duty . ''

		Then follows an able defence of his course in sticking to party and refusing to join the Anti- Imperialists .

		He believes the country is to be saved by the Republican party , not by the de - serters from its ranks or by the party opposed to it .

		Not every reader will be convinced , but the thorough honesty and the exalted motives of the writer are evident .

		On the burning question of how to deal with inferior races , he says : '' We should have had little difficulty in dealing with the Negro or the Indian , or the Oriental , if the Amer - ican people had applied to them , as the Golden Rule requires , the principles they expect to apply and to have applied to themselves .

		We have never under - stood that in some essential matters human nature is the same in men of all colors and races .

		Our Fathers of the time of the Revolution understood this matter better than we do ... The problem of to-day is not how to convert the heathen from heathenism , it is how to convert the Christian from heathenism ; not to teach the physician to heal the patient , but to heal himself . ''

		Memories of great men , most of them no longer living , crowd Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	's pages .

		Elo - quent tributes are paid to those he admires , and his enemies are treated with courtesy and fairness .

		Of
Benjamin F. Butler	PERSON	, however , he has little to say that is good .

		That little he does say most conscientiously , and then he proceeds to disclose his iniquities with a fulness that shows how deeply seated , and indeed how jus - tified , is his dislike of the man and his unscru - pulous methods .

		Nearly all that can be placed to
Butler	PERSON	's credit is of a negative character : he contributed to certain victories in the war by being absent when the battles were fought , and he perhaps prevented Grant 's renomination for a third term by the discreditable
Massachu	PERSON	- setts appointments he urged upon the Presi - dent , thus disgusting his
State	ORGANIZATION	and causing her to throw all her influence against Grant in the nominating convention .

		An epigrammatic presentation of the differ - ence in manner between
Blaine	PERSON	and
Harrison	PERSON	is worth quoting .

		`` Blaine , '' says Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	, `` would refuse a request in a way that would seem like doing a favor .


Harrison	PERSON	would grant a request in a way which seemed as if he were denying it . ''

		Of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	the author has many interesting reminiscences .

		He greatly admired the man and is generous in dealing with his faults .

		Speaking of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's reputed intemperance in early and middle life , Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	regards his later correct deportment as more to his credit than if he had never yielded to temptation , -- a curious reminder of the old sophistry that we must first sin in order to ac - quire virtue .

		One might perhaps better say that Grant deserved more praise for his self - restraint that if he had never been susceptible to temptation .

		Excellent accounts of four Republican na - tional conventions -- at all of which the writer was present , and over one of which he presided -- are among the notably instructive and read - able chapters of this work .

		Some matters hith - erto imperfectly understood are made plain by Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	's narrative .

		His presiding over the convention of
1880	DATE	, and his friendship for
Garfield	PERSON	, appear to have contributed in no small measure to the latter 's nomination .

		At one critical moment it was only the chairman 's prompt and decisive ruling on a point of order that saved
Garfield	PERSON	from generously throwing away his chance of victory .

		But this must be read to be understood .

		Passing to other mat - ters , we read with peculiar pleasure this tribute to his old friend , the late Senator Dawes : '' I should like to put on record one instance of the generosity and affection of Mr.
Dawes	PERSON	.

		He had not voted -LSB- on the
River	LOCATION	and Harbor Bill of
1882	DATE	-RSB- when his name was called , expecting to vote against the pas - sage of the bill over the veto .

		But when he heard my vote for it , he saw that I was bringing down on my head a storm of popular indignation , and made up his mind that he would not throw the weight of his ex -
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 ample on the side against me .

		So , contrary to his opinion of the merits of the bill , he came to my side and votedwith me .

		... I would not probably put what I am about to say in an address to a Sunday-school , or into a sermon to the inmates of a jail or house of cor - rection .

		I can not , perhaps , defend it by reason .

		But somehow or other , I am strongly tempted to say there are occasions in life where the meanest thing a man can do is to do perfectly right .

		But I do not say it .

		It would be better to say that there are occasions when the instinct is a better guide than the reason .

		At any rate , I do not believe the recording angel made any trouble for Mr.
Dawes	PERSON	for that vote . ''

		Limitations of space bring this inadequate review to an abrupt close .

		The book shows here and there signs of haste in its dictation or proof-reading , or both .

		But these are trifles .

		Nor is unfailing accuracy of statement to be expected in so extended an effort of the mem - ory ; but so far as a rapid reading can deter - mine , the book seems remarkably free from errors of this kind .

		In paying tribute to his ancestors and kinsfolk , Mr.
Hoar	PERSON	speaks of
Jeremiah Evarts	PERSON	as '' the founder and
Secre	PERSON	- tary of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Haystack at Will - iams
College	ORGANIZATION	tells a different story as to the origin of this association .


Samuel J. Mills	PERSON	and his student comrades , and the
Andover	LOCATION	professors who later met these young men in Professor
Stuart	PERSON	's parlor , would all seem to have claims prior to those of
Jeremiah Evarts	PERSON	.

		But perhaps we are here merely disputing about words , without first determining what is meant by `` founder . ''

		of equal importance and value , was in part the aim of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	in that thesis ; and it is a thought which well deserves the more extended development which it has since received .

		The second motto above named might , with better grace and more truth , have ascribed the ful - ness of its praise to the principle of Religious Liberty .

		Toleration does not rise to the height of the American standard in religious affairs .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	proceeded to discourse conserva - tively of Toleration in Religion , and thus fol - lowed in words his chosen motto ; but his thought seems to have risen higher than his words , and to have reached the height of char - ity which American political practice has de - veloped , for his illustrations showed the people in possession of full Religious Liberty .

		The attitude of
America	LOCATION	toward the subject of freedom in religious affairs was , when first assumed , unique ; nor does it appear otherwise even now , for our pattern has not been copied by other peoples .

		The conception of a com - plete separation of church from state , present - ing the church as an institution standing by itself , entirely independent of the state and of other institutions , and the state as an institu - tion indifferent to the church in all its aspects save its independence , was a startling pro- position originally .

		It is such now to many conservative thinkers of the old world .

		Yet this has ever been a feature of American con - stitutional government .

		The principle was introduced into the policies of the world con - temporaneously with our Declaration of Inde - pendence .

		The political liberty announced by that instrument embraced as one of its factors an absolute freedom in entertaining and ex - pressing religious opinions , and in the practice of religious worship ; and this freedom was to be achieved and preserved by the perpetual divorcement of church from state .

		The freedom thus secured and protected is purely personal ; it pertains to the individual .

		The principle upon which we have separated church from state operates , in our political system , not negatively but positively .

		The people 's government does not rest with leaving the individual alone as to his religious convic - tions ; it guarantees that he shall be continu - ously let alone .

		It denudes itself of office , mission , and duty , as to all religious questions .

		It disclaims the right to interfere with the individual conscience , and it proclaims that no such interference shall be allowed .

		Thus the right of private opinion and the right of free worship become constitutional rights , to 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, protect which the government is affirmatively pledged .

		The American doctrine has been by no one more clearly stated than by Dr.
Philip Schaff	PERSON	, in his thesis on '' Church and
State	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' as providing for '' A free Church in a free State , '' or , in other words , `` A self-supporting and self-governing
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , in independent but friendly relation to the
Civil Government	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	did not , however , attempt to treat the subject elabo - rately ; he contented himself with a monograph opening up a discussion upon this interesting topic , inviting and urging later writers to develop the theme in historical form .

		This work has now been ably performed by Mr.
Sanford H. Cobb	PERSON	, in his recent history of '' The Rise of Religious Liberty in
America	LOCATION	, '' the first named in the group of books which has prompted this article .

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	has a clear idea of the distinctive characteristics of the American doctrine , as well as of the peculiar features of the Old - World theory , and he has illustrated with perspicuity the differences between the two systems .

		His opening chapter on '' The Amer - ican Principle '' sets forth categorically the elements of the occidental system , as it appears operative and dominant to-day , after a cen - tury 's successful experience .

		He contrasts with this `` The Old - World Idea , '' of which he presents a historical sketch , tracing its de - velopment out of the conflicting theories of the early years of the Christian era .

		The American conception of religious liberty is not to be identified with or mistaken for
Tolera	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		It is neither a modification nor an ex - tension of Toleration , but rather its complete and irreconcilable antithesis ; for
Toleration	ORGANIZATION	is a concession or a gift , tendered with the implication of a right to withhold , while Re - ligious Liberty is an inherent and inalienable right .

		Nor , on the other hand , is it to be confounded with Freedom of Conscience ; for to assert that the conscience is free is to state merely a psychological truism , while the polit - ical conception includes the element of freedom of worship .

		This conception must be observed in its distinctive individuality in order that the American doctrine be understood .

		Over against it , Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	sets the Old-World con - ception of a system which , at numerous points , brings the political relations of the citizen into interference with his religious views and prac - tices .

		The prevailing thought in
Europe	LOCATION	has been that there was a necessary union between the Church and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' so intimate that whatever became of interest to one was matter for action by the other . ''

		Various phases of this union have been in vogue , in all of which the central thought was that the rights , priv - ileges , and interests of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	required support by and protection from
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not all the agitation of the Protestant Reformation sufficed to shake the dominance of this ancient assumption .

		As Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	succinctly states : '' In the immediate reformation era there was in all the Protestant churches a practical unanimity of opinion , , that to the civil magistrate belonged a religious func - tion , in some , intimately related to the very life of the church , in others , restricted to the suppression of heresy .

		... Bossuet was substantially correct in saying that on one point all Christians had long been unanimous , the right of the civil magistrate to propagate truth by the sword ; that even heretics were orthodox on this point . ''

		The attainment by
America	LOCATION	of her present elevated type of religious liberty was no holi - day episode .

		There was a gradual advance , traceable through a succession of struggles .

		The notable features of the present system are that it is distinctively American , and that its development has been accomplished on our soil , its origin being found in the colonial be - ginnings of our republican institutions .

		It is this accomplishment which Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	outlines as `` The Rise of Religious Liberty in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The European theory was brought over to our shores by the settlers of several of the colonies , here to be shocked by sharp conflict with the freedom of conscience or '' soul-liberty '' cham - pioned by
Roger Williams	PERSON	.

		These '' Colonial Beginnings '' are set forth in a brief chapter by Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	, who then , after dividing the colo - nies into four classes , proceeds to illustrate each class historically .

		Three colonies intro - duced the Church of
England	LOCATION	establishment , three others the Puritan form of church govern - ment , while in four others there were various and changing forms of church establishment in succession .

		No character of union between church and state was admitted into the remain - ing three colonies , which Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	classifies as `` The Free Colonies . ''

		These three are the col - onies which have , in the main , set the example of religious liberty for all the states .

		The all - important but simple record of these colonies is presented in thirty-two pages .

		To portray the varying steps and the diverse and often agitating experiences through which the other ten states have progressed to their present po - sition , requires 347 pages , or nearly two-thirds of Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	's book ; an illustration of the fidelity of detail with which he has outlined
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 the struggle for religious freedom .

		Now , all these thirteen original states , as well as all their younger sisters , occupy a practically com - mon ground ; and the national policy is vir - tually a re-affirmation and a guaranty of the policy of the states .

		The larger part of the work of assimilating the states to a common model was done during the revolutionary pe - riod , to which the author devotes a separate chapter ; and in a concluding chapter , he out - lines the post-revolutionary steps which have finally brought the state versions of religious freedom into substantial accord .

		The historical method is the one best adapt - ed to the elucidation of this subject , and Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	exhibits the true historical spirit in his manner of treating it .

		The religious liberty which is the heritage of the American people of this century presents a phase of their coun - try 's history which both warrants and demands the mode of treatment here employed ; so that the volume before us may well assume the sub - title of '' A History . ''

		Among the aspects of the religious liberty of
America	LOCATION	which are unique , should be noted its intimate relation to our familiar type of civil liberty .

		These two types of personal freedom are sistere ; they have the same par - entage , and they grew together .

		In turn each has stimulated , encouraged , and helped to nur - ture the other .

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	's pages illustrate this fact clearly .

		The experiences of both Con - necticut and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	exemplify it , though not in the same way .

		A notable example is presented by our author , which appeared in
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		The first assembly held in that colony was composed wholly of Roman Catho - lics ; and
Lord Baltimore	LOCATION	, the proprietary , was known to be aiming to secure for his colony freedom of conscience .

		He sent over a pre - pared M Body of Laws , '' proposing that it be enacted .

		The assembly promptly rejected the document , and appointed a committee to pre - pare a code .

		In a few days , the committee reported the same code lately rejected , and the assembly without delay adopted the report and enacted the `` Body of Laws . ''

		`` Thus early did the American settlers learn to stickle for a point .

		They had no objection to the code itself , but to
Baltimore	LOCATION	's initiative .

		They would not formally ratify his will .

		What laws they passed must be their own , and transmitted to governor and proprietary for approval . ''

		And thus early did religious freedom begin to stiffen the backbone of constitutional civil liberty .

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	's history finds timely companions in the other volumes of our group , and his broad and generalizing deductions are well sup - plemented by more minute statements of the experiences of the two commonwealths which became the examplars of their sister states .

		It was in the small state of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	that religious liberty came to its earliest and fullest fruition ; and this was also the organized com - munity which became the most distinctive rep - resentative of individual freedom in govern - ment .

		This colony and its sister
Connecticut	LOCATION	each grew from a revolt against the rigidity of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Theocracy .

		The reaction in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	was along the line of freedom of conscience .

		Starting with the advocacy of Soul-Liberty , the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	pioneers were from it led into , and came to adopt , the com - plementary theory of Individualism as the basis of healthy political action .

		Connecticut revolted from the theocracy on its political side .

		Very near to irony was the movement by which two of the leaders in the banishment of
Roger Williams	PERSON	from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	soon after led an exodus to the wilds of Connecti - cut .

		It was a desire for greater liberty for the individual in governmental affairs which prompted their migration , and from this desire the emigrants advanced logically to broader freedom in matters of religion .

		Though start - ing thus by different routes , these colonies gradually grew into a similarity of views on the two subjects of Civil and Religious Liberty , and into leaders in the championship of these views .

		The early experiences of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	in this progress are graphically summarized in the two volumes entitled ''
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, Its
Mak	PERSON	- ing and Its Meaning , '' by
Irving B. Richman	PERSON	.

		His work is essentially a biography of
Roger Williams	PERSON	, in that it begins and ends with the life of this pioneer of religious liberty .

		But
Carlyle	PERSON	has said that '' the history of a nation is the biography of its great men '' ; and the history of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and the biography of
Roger Williams	PERSON	are practically convertible terms dur - ing the period indicated .

		It was
Williams	PERSON	who took the lead in advocating and teaching liberty of conscience , and it was through his influence that his fellow - refugees advanced from
Tolera	LOCATION	- tion , through Freedom of Religious Belief , to the fulness of Religious Liberty , as the car - dinal principle of their government .

		But Will - iams was never a great governor or statesman ; and his
Rhode Island	LOCATION	associates preceded him in reaching the conclusion that Soul-Liberty necessarily implied Political Liberty , and in 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, adopting this principle as the corollary of the other .

		Mr.
Richman	PERSON	's account of the development of these mighty principles by the simple democ - racy which settled
Rhode Island	LOCATION	is a keen investigation into primitive government , and furnishes the best exposition extant of the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	experiment .

		He makes a detailed study of the political and constitutional begin - nings of the colony , recounts the boundary and other civil difficulties encountered , elucidates the details of what
Fiske	PERSON	called '' the turbulence of dissent '' which raged during the life of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	; and through the whole story , traces the threads of Religious Liberty and Individ - ualism in government which finally interlaced in the web of the state 's institutions .

		To develop this as the '' Meaning of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	'' is maintained as the dominant purpose of the author .

		A brief explanatory note by the emi - nent Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	emphasizes and pays due tribute to this praiseworthy purpose .

		The achievements of
Connecticut	LOCATION	within her own limited boundaries have been notable ; but they are far surpassed by the achievements of her people away from home .

		The migratory spirit that led to the first settlement of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	colony has descended to her chil - dren as an inheritance ; and '' how it has pushed them over her borders , and made them state - builders , '' and animated other localities , parts of other states , with the same purposeful energy that has been the honor of the parent state , is the theme of Mr.
Alfred Mathews	PERSON	, one of those descendants , in the volume entitled ''
Ohio	LOCATION	and her Western Reserve : With a Story of Three States . ''

		This small book is packed full of interesting statistical information .

		Connecti - cut 's charter claims reached westward over the northern limits of the present states of
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania and
Ohio	LOCATION	; and the well-known story of the attempts of
Connecticut	LOCATION	to make her western claims actual possessions by organized settlements , is here retold by Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	with all its inherent glamour of romance .

		The experiences of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	men at
Cushu	LOCATION	- tunk and
Wyoming	LOCATION	are set forth in order to show and accentuate their relation to the later episode of the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, and to exhibit a steady stream of virile enterprise , flowing from the fountain of
Connecticut	LOCATION	manhood , through northern
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	into northern
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		It is Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's thesis that the spirit which settled the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, and which built it up into an important part of a new western state , has become the distinguishing element of the spirit of that state ; so that the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	was practically a new Con - necticut in the west , and
Ohio	LOCATION	, though a thor - oughly cosmopolitan people , owes to
Connecticut	LOCATION	more than to any other of the original thirteen States .

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	develops his thesis along two leading lines .

		One traces the devotion to indi - vidual liberty , which always distinguished Con - necticut , and which there moulded Theocracy into the friendly relation now established be - tween state and church , through the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	, which dedicated a great empire to Freedom and gave
Ohio	LOCATION	a place as a bul - wark against human slavery , into the final anti-slavery movement of which
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	and Wade were such efficient factors .

		The other line follows the individuality of the leading
Connecticut	LOCATION	pioneers through their children to their descendants , and calls a long roll of statesmen and public officials , commencing with
Wilmot	PERSON	and Grow of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and closing with an almost innumerable list of prominent men of
Ohio	LOCATION	, who were of
New England	ORGANIZATION	descent , and who have been at the head of state and national affairs , active in doing the work of finally ridding the country of the incubus of slavery , and giving a national scope to the principles of the Great Ordinance .

		It is the newer states , developed out of ter - ritory consecrated to Freedom , in which the American types of religious and civil liberty have now become so readily domesticated as to prove themselves part of the birth-right of the American citizen .

		The volumes in this group are persuasive to convince the reader of a fact which many political economists of recent years are urging upon public attention , namely , that the residents within the
United States	LOCATION	are growing into a thoroughly homo - geneous .

		THE DIAL 349 most gifted of our representative Americans .

		Few lives have been so significant in aspira - tion and accomplishment ; few have been so unappreciated .

		Again , this life was passed amid circumstances of nnequaled inspiration and fellowship with some of the greatest minds of the last century .

		The background of the life-history is vital with new and rare glimpses of the men and women whose names are synony - mous with the best literature and art of the Victorian period .

		A third cause for congratu - lation in this work is found in its editing .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	's discrimination and taste in the use of his over-abundant material have been unerring .

		Whatever may be the individual opinion regarding his rhetorical manners , his writing bears a literary stamp of positive and permanent influence .

		His first sentence is almost daunting , with that peculiar haziness which must be accepted -- and deplored -- as a fixed quality of Mr.
James	PERSON	's style .

		■ It may appear a new application of the truth that honour , where honour , as to any frank advance , attaches , is especially due to the light skirmishers , the eclaireurs , who have gone before ; yet there are occasions on which it comes home to us that , so far as we are contentedly cosmopolite to-day and move about in a world that has been made for us both larger and more amusing , we owe much of our extension and diversion to those com - paratively few who , amid difficulties and dangers , set the example and made out the road . ''

		The thoughts of Mr.
James	PERSON	are well worth a second or third reading to gain full compre - hension of them ; and as he continues , in his opening chapter , his pseudo-philosophic memo - ries of these eclaireurs , -- these precursors in art and letters , to whom we owe an unacknowl - edged debt of gratitude , -- he permits the reader to share his attitude of mind , as , in reverence and joy , he unfolds the contents of his rt boxful of old papers . ''

		With ' careful insistence Mr.
James	PERSON	has emphasized the noble inheritance of
William Story	PERSON	, his legacy of culture and conscience , his early opportunities and successess at the law , his published reports that required several edi - tions to meet the demand of his own time , and , in varied republications , have stable value .

		Such were tentative episodes of his manhood ; his true life began when , past thirty years of age , he made his first long visit to
Italy	LOCATION	, and , after anxious hours of conflict between expe - diency and aspiration , renounced the former for lifelong devotion to art and the life of the spirit .

		This decision met with the parental frankness , `` Well ,
William	LOCATION	, I 've known in my life many a fool , but I 've never known so great a one . ''

		The allurement of art came to him early in life , even in college days ; but its dominance as a factor must date from that commission , given him after his father 's death , to model a com - memorative statue , -- a testimony that his ear - lier dabbling had revealed promise .

		That he might accomplish a work worthy of his father 's memory and his own art , he travelled and stud - ied in
Italy	LOCATION	in
1847	DATE	, and , on returning to Amer - ica , found that his `` heart had gone over from the Law to Art . ''

		This transference of life-interest from Amer - ica and an inherited profession to
Italy	LOCATION	and a slow though progressive recognition in the world of art , was really the crucial event in Story 's life .

		Coming in early manhood , it left him long years for gradual unfolding of gifts , for happy , varied companionship with poets and artists .

		His tardy recognition , especially in
America	LOCATION	, his later honors as the sculptor of the Libyan Sibyl ,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, and Cleopatra , receive due attention in chronological order ; but after the earlier pages , the chief charm of the volume is derived from the vivid portrayals of the friends of that long Roman residence , the elu - sive `` ghosts '' and strong personalities that flit across the pages and are summoned into our presence by the biographer 's magic .

		The one companion who made possible this life of aspiration and realization was the wife of his youth , the adored friend of all his friends , a woman of rare grace and endowment .

		To her '' admirable ef & cacity '' Mr.
James	PERSON	bears ample testimony .

		Fully rounded , even to the golden wedding , was this happy married life .

		When , in
1894	DATE	, Mrs. Story died , her husband received his `` death-blow '' ; for him the few remaining months seemed only '' a blank of silence . ''

		Among the earliest acquaintances in
Italy	LOCATION	with whom the
Storys	PERSON	cemented a friendship of the past was
Margaret Fuller Ossoli	PERSON	.

		With frank acknowledgment of her haunting power , Mr.
James	PERSON	encounters this ''
Margaret	PERSON	- ghost '' and finds her '' evocation '' -LRB- to use his favorite term -RRB- both puzzling and dramatic .

		From these pages we glean little that is new regarding her life at this time , for the memories of these friends have already been incorporated in other volumes pertaining to her character ; but one notes again , with strong emphasis , the deep interest , even affection , which
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	won from the little circle of English and
Ameri	PERSON	- can associates during these days of her nobler womanhood .

		There are paragraphs of special value , as information , about once popular , now forgotten , 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, artists and authors , whose lives became inter - linked with that of Story , -- Page and Craw - ford , Cranch and
Boott	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the most intimate friends in
America	LOCATION	,
Lowell	PERSON	and
Charles Sum	PERSON	- ner , were written delightful letters during the first years in
Rome	LOCATION	, -- letters of permanent value both as chronicles of literary friendship and also as revelations of the tense Italian con - flict and siege of
Rome	LOCATION	, 1848-1849 . ''

		Salad and conversation '' became their only resources , while their hearts were anguished at the reports and evidences of suffering all around them .

		In lighter vein are descriptions of excursions into the fields with their glories , evenings of pleasure listening to
Ristori	PERSON	and
Modena	LOCATION	, sojourns in
Germany	LOCATION	and impressions of the great leaders in thought and letters , -- Humboldt and
Nean	PERSON	- der ,
Ranke	PERSON	and
Bettina von Arnim	PERSON	.

		In
England	LOCATION	the Story s always found conge - nial and appreciative friends , and the letters contain delightful hints of happy hours with
Dickens	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and others of their time .

		These minor glimpses of literary charm , how - ever , must be abbreviated in attention to the major friendship of the Storys and the
Brown	PERSON	- ings , of which these volumes furnish a true memorial .

		Here are side-lights upon the charac - ters of the poets that have never been fully revealed before .

		The letters and journals tell the story of the gradual acquaintance , ripening into life-long affection , between these two fami - lies of kindred race and tastes .

		We first hear of the intimacy in a letter to
Lowell	LOCATION	, -- '' My dear
Jim	PERSON	, '' -- from
Rome	LOCATION	, in
March , 1849	DATE	, when Story records their common pleasure as he read '' The
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' to '' convulsed audiences at our weekly ' at home ' on
Sunday	DATE	evenings , giving them as well as I could the true
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	note , and one evening I interpreted in the same tones one of them to the
Brownings	PERSON	, who were quite as much amused and delighted as I. '' The letters of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	to Mrs.
Jame	PERSON	- son , written four years later , have already given testimony to the assiduous devotion of herself and husband to their American friends during that fearful month of illness and death in the Story household .

		The loss of the first-born son was followed by days of intense anxiety for his sister , and durmg her convalescence she was the recipient of unsurpassed honors .

		To her ,
Thackeray	PERSON	read the unpublished version of '' The Rose and the Ring , '' -- '' between daylight and dusk , as the great author sat on the edge of her bed . ''

		Later ,
Browning	PERSON	entertained the young friends of the Story home by reading '' ' The
Pied Piper	ORGANIZATION	, ' which led to the formation of a grand march through the spacious Bar - barini apartment , with Story doing his best on a flute in default of bagpipes . ''

		Interwoven with the companionship of the Brownings during the months in
Florence	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	are sundry references to a common in - terest in the irascible but ill-treated Landor .

		All students of
Browning	PERSON	's life are familiar with his sagacity and unswerving kindness in managing the affairs of this erratic but inspiring countryman .

		His efforts were sup - plemented by those of the Storys .

		One of the most interesting of the letters is written by
Browning	PERSON	to Mrs. Story from
Florence	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	. ''

		You need not be told how entirely we owe to you the delightful
summer	DATE	we have spent at
Siena	LOCATION	.

		Its one fault was its briefness .

		Ba is hardly so well as when she was let thrive in peace and quiet in that dear old villa and the pleasant country it hardly shut out .

		She is forced to see more people and talk of tener than suits her .

		I am very anxious to get away , and see no ob - stacle to our doing so by the end of the first week in
November	DATE	, when Mr.
Landor	PERSON	will be finally established in his winter quarters .

		We are papering and carpen - tering and doing things superiorly .

		He is quite well ; as gentle and affectionate as ever ; and I shall regret his loss more than there is any use in dwelling upon , now that it must be .


Ba	ORGANIZATION	enters the room at this mo - ment , saying , ' I wish we were in
Rome	LOCATION	! '

		Tell us , for we count on your goodness , the day you expect to be there , and when you get there , any news about houses , sunny ones , and prices of the same : in short , as usual , trouble yourselves infinitely for the sake of us poor do-nothings-in-return . ''

		Only three years of happy devotion remained for
Browning	PERSON	before the death of his wife sev - ered his strongest heart-chords .

		The Storys hastened from
Rome	LOCATION	to
Florence	LOCATION	at news of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's death , and here , standing in the consecrated rooms of
Casa Guidi	LOCATION	, the poet - husband uttered words of matchless tenderness and beauty , which have been retained in Mr.
Story	PERSON	's journal .

		In summary of the years of productive life at this chosen home ,
Browning	PERSON	said : `` The cycle is complete ; here we came fifteen years ago ; here Pen was born ; here
Ba	ORGANIZATION	wrote her poems for
Italy	LOCATION	... Looking back at these past years I see that we have been all the time walking over a torrent on a straw .

		Life must be begun anew -- all the old cast off and the new one put on .

		I shall go away , break up everything , go to
England	LOCATION	and live and work and write . ''

		Browning never lost his affection for the Storys , as occasional later letters testify .

		He advised the sculptor about his contracts and his books , wrote him fully regarding English sentiment during the Trent affair , and reiter - ated his personal cordiality ; but his departure
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 from
Italy	LOCATION	left a void of great depth in Story 's life .

		In later life , when honors had been won , Story and his wife paid two or three brief visits to
America	LOCATION	; but the records of them are seldom satisfactory .

		Their critical facul - ties were sharpened toward American defects , with that jealous patriotism which must ever characterize one who has lived long abroad yet is at heart a loyal American .

		Moreover , Story always realized that , despite commis - sions for statues , he never gained the sympathy of his countrymen in his aspirations .

		After * ' Roba di Roma '' had been rejected by Amer - ican publishers , but accepted in
England	LOCATION	, he wrote to Professor Norton : '' It is in
America	LOCATION	no use for me to hope for anything .

		I do not expect to find a public there until I have ob - tained it elsewhere .

		They will resist to the last con - sidering me as anything but a poetaster , dilettante , and amateur . ''

		In a large measure this statement was true ; his American contemporaries , with the excep - tion of a few friends , did not appreciate his facility or ideals .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	has confessed the inadequacy of some of Story 's work in art and letters ; yet one must not forget , amid the diffuseness of u A Poet 's Portfolio '' and other volumes , such worthy lyrics as '' Io Victis '' and `` The Sad Country . ''

		Considered in the large , his life and work were significant in in - fluence and are destined to have honor in the history of American culture .

		The Moral Law in the World of sh akesp e are .

		* '' It is a commonplace of the schools , '' so I read that it stands in the writings of
Pico della Mirandula	LOCATION	, '' that man is a lesser world . ''

		The old fancy of the microcosm was certainly , and is in many ways , but a fancy ; in some ways , however , true , and in none more than when we think of a great artist .

		For a good many years now , critics have pursued the thought , although I do not recall the idea in Aristotle or
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare 's Portrayal of the
Moral Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Frank Chapman	PERSON	Sharp .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		--
Scott	PERSON	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, Shakespeare . ''

		Suppose , '' he says , '' I had asked you to seek for Shake - speare 's opinion ... Shakespeare knew men better than most of us , I presume . ''

		Shake - speare in his plays had a chance to put together the world as he saw it ; and because he did know men better than most of us , as well as for other reasons , his presentation has always been of immense interest .

		But I do not recall that his view of the world has ever before been sys - tematically considered from the standpoint of two books lately published .

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	in his presentation of '' The Moral System of Shakespeare , '' and Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	in `` Shakespeare 's Portrayal of the Moral Life , '' have not precisely the same idea , but nearly enough to bring their books into natural com - parison .

		`` The contents of these thirty-six plays make a world of their own , '' says the former . ''

		It is surely possible to survey this imaginary world from the same standpoint from which the moralist surveys the world of reality . ''

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	also speaks of ** the world '' Shake - speare '' has created '' ; his object is to give '' an account of the moral life as it is represented upon
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stage . ''

		So far , there can not be much disagreement with our authors .

		We are accustomed enough to think of the world of any great writer of fic - tion , --
Dickens	PERSON	's world , we say , or Thack - eray 's ; and wherever there is any such large presentation of human life -LRB- except , according to
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, in the
Restoration Drama	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- there will be moral facts and phenomena , moral life or moral system .

		The last word offers a possible difficulty .

		We may speak of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's portrayal of the moral life , because
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	portrayed live men and women , and therefore must have made some portrayal of the moral life , -- more through the nature of the circumstances , than he could of the physical or intellectual life .

		But can we speak of the moral system of Shake - speare without assuming that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had a moral system , and that he made some sort of effort to present it ?

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	disclaims such an assumption in his first words .

		His title '' is not intended to suggest that the man Shakespeare had formed in his mind a certain system of morals , which he proceeded to put into his plays . ''

		Neither of these books , then , has directly anything to do with
Shakespeare	PERSON	as a drama - tist , poet , artist .

		Here is the work of '' a man who was one of the most gifted students of human nature the world has ever seen , '' to use 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's words . ''

		The record that he left no worker in the humanities can afford to neglect . ''

		We need not raise the question how far the artist will play the moralist .

		The artist will present us men and women as he may choose , and for what causes he may see fit .

		In the presentation there must be a moral element -LRB- or they will be singular men and women -RRB- , and that element we may study .

		As to the precise value of such study , these books have different ideas .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	says he will not , on the whole , consider '' how far these offspring of a poet 's imagination re - semble the men and women with whom scien - tific ethics attempts to deal . ''

		We may settle that matter for ourselves .

		If we think , with
Ruskin	PERSON	, that '' by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	humanity was unsealed to us , '' that '' Shakespeare never be - trays his reader 's moral judgment , '' that '' all Shakespeare knows is , -- that is the way God and nature manage it , '' we shall consider such a study an extremely valuable thing , even if we do not go to the length of Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	's Zolaesque conception that the work of the poet offers us , as in a scientific experiment , possi - bilities of life which one may wait long before meeting in actuality .

		So much will give a general conception of two very interesting books .

		Both are to be read by the Shakespearean student with profit .

		In regard , however , to the net value of Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	's studies , I must confess myself skeptical in spite of his ingenuity and his know - ledge of the plays .

		The chief standpoint is that of the analyist of plot .

		Now , whether through personal failing , or from unfortunate educa - tion , or from black prejudice , or for some other reason , I can not bear Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	's analyses of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and never have been able to from the moment I read his earlier work on the subject .

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	does some - thing to relieve me here : he says definitely that he has no idea of suggesting that Shake - speare really intended all these effects of de - sign which are so wonderfully pointed out .

		That is something : once grant that Shake - speare did not dream of there being a clash of primary and secondary plots through subaction in one play , a link action properly complicated and resolved in another , three phases of com - plicating intrigue with triple irony in a third , and the air seems a bit clearer .

		Still , I can not help asking myself , if we ad - mit that Shakespeare made these complications , not out of the particular materials to which Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	reduces them , but in other ways here unconsidered , is it not probable that there will creep in elements that will vitiate our conclu - sions ?

		Or , to be specific , let us take '' Ham - let . ''

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	notes in the main plot a six-fold system of graded wrong , with appro - priate nemesis and pathos , and regards the play as an illustration of '' the association of acci - dent and overruling providence '' which he finds definitely alluded to in the last speech of
Horatio	LOCATION	.

		That there are six wrong-doers -LRB- omitting Hamlet and counting Rosencrantz and
Guildenstein	PERSON	as one -RRB- , is clear ; also , that they are all come up with ; and , further , that in each case accident plays a part .

		But sup - pose the real reasons for this fact to have been ethically trivial .

		Suppose Shakespeare made Polonius die because he wished Laertes to have a father to revenge as well as
Hamlet	LOCATION	; made
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	die because it was the only end for her madness , and gave him an opportunity in her funeral ; made the Queen die because it would have been inconvenient to have had her about at the end of the play ; made
Kosencrantz	PERSON	and Guildenstein die , and , indeed , any or all of the rest , because they did in
Belleforest	LOCATION	, -- and these may well enough have been Shake - speare 's actual reasons , if we admit that he did not hold in mind the elements of analysis ; -- suppose that much of the nemesis comes from non-ethical causes , and much of the accident from stage convenience , and what sort of place does it all hold in a moral system ?

		Possibly it will be thought that
Shakespeare	PERSON	-LRB- never betraying , etc. , as above -RRB- would not allow such things to remain in a play , unless they actually presented his view of the moral cosmos .

		This opinion appears to me entirely to beg the question , and I incline to think , '' If so , the less Shakespeare he , '' and even to add , and the more someone else .

		This objection , such as it is , does not lie with Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	, who merely assumes on the part of Shakespeare a normal desire to be life - like in his characters , and an extraordinary ability to be so .

		It must be admitted that he does not concern himself with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own opinion . ''

		Which if any of these different views represents the dramatist 's own position , '' he remarks , '' it is unnecessary to ask even were it possible to answer . ''

		What , then , is the im - portant thing ?

		Undoubtedly this : that , taken by and large ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's world represents fairly the world he knew .

		With all the confu - sion and often chaos of dramatic presentation , the Shakespearean microcosm will practically represent the Elizbethan macrocosm , and there -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 fore has the same interest for the student .

		We have in a small compass what were the ideas and motives of that world ; we can resolve their problems , or note ethical theories that have been propounded by later scholars , or determine principles that will be seen to obtain in the world of to-day . ''

		If
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	portrays human life aright , '' says Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	, we are assured of such and such a principle .

		Such an object is rather different from Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	's , and it is pursued by different means .

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	, as has been said , presents a sys - tem based chiefly upon analysis of plot ; indeed , he analyzes the plot of every play .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	, on the other hand , rarely deals with any play as such .

		He is chiefly concerned with the char - acters as people , their motives , their desires , their judgments .

		To turn to '' Hamlet '' again , Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	points out that the constant ne - mesis for wrong by means of accident gives a sense of a just
Providence	LOCATION	; that in the person of the hero we see the man of the inner life suddenly turned into the life without ; that in the underplot of relief we get a more definite conception of the overthrown moral equilibrium of tragedy ; that various elements in the play indicate the sway of circumstance ; that the Ghost gives an idea of the true nature of what appears as supernatural .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	is inter - ested chiefly in Hamlet himself , in his concep - tion of reason , in his concern for his reputation after death , in his statement of a theory of values , in his skepticism or faith , his ideal of character embodied in
Horatio	LOCATION	, his view of the freedom of the will .

		It would not be quite correct to say that Mr. Sharp concerns himself with individuals , and Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	with the more general aspects of life offered by the com - binations of the dramatist ; but such is the gen - eral tendency .

		It is probably unnecessary to express any opinion as to the comparative excellence of these two presentations .

		One is the work of a student of literature , the other of a student of philosophy .

		It is natural enough , perhaps , that the philosopher should have a more tech - nical and more available view of what is to be included in the term M moral '' than the man of letters .

		For myself , I read with more in - terest about motives , right and wrong , con - science , than about moral balance , retribution , life in equilibrium , the momentum of character .

		These latter conceptions are moral ideas , but they do not seem to get down to the real phe - nomena and principles of morality .

		Let us suppose we are taking Shakespeare as a guide : I should prefer to learn from him by a num - ber of examples the way in which men come to do great wrong , let us say , than to infer from some of his plots that there is an over - ruling
Providence	LOCATION	that works by what seems accident .

		Whichever be better , I note with interest the abandonment by both writers , save in mo - ments perhaps of forgetfulness , of the view that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's moral ideas have any espe - cial value as his .

		We are far removed from
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' There are certain men who know the truths necessary to human life ; they do not ' opine ' them ; and nobody 's opinions on any subject are of any consequence as opposed to theirs . ''

		Shakespeare is no moral oracle imparting sound principles in aesthetic forms .

		Our authors regard him as presenting life truly , and find it convenient to study life in his plays just as a scientist may prefer to study Nature in a museum or a laboratory rather than out of doors , because he finds there the particular things he wishes to study , selected from the exuberance of the universe and put in such order that it is convenient to consider them .

		A
History of Prehistoric Times	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The earliest scene of authentic history is the Valley of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the curtain rises , forty or fifty centuries before our era , it reveals in that region a civilization that must have been the product of a long period of develop - ment .

		But the story of its growth is a sealed book .

		Recent discoveries have , indeed , thrown considerable light on these early ages ; still , it can hardly be said that our knowledge has penetrated very much further back into time .

		But of all questions , those of origins are perhaps the most fascinating .

		It is not strange , then , that these border-lands have attracted many earnest students .

		Among the more re - cent workers in this field is Mr.
J. F. Hewitt	PERSON	, formerly commissioner at
Chutia Nagpur	LOCATION	, In - dia .

		Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	's interest in ethnological questions was first roused in
1863	DATE	, when he began his official life in
Southern India	LOCATION	among a people whose social organization is of the most primitive order .

		In
1894	DATE	he began to publish his investigations in the form of a se - ries of essays entitled '' The Ruling Races of * History and Chronology of the
Myth-Makinq Agb	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
J. F. Hewitt	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		354 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Prehistoric Times . ''

		These were followed , in
1901	DATE	, by a large volume of some six hundred pages , in which his earlier theories are re - stated in a somewhat modified form , and worked into a chronological system which is at least interesting .

		Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	's present book , '' A History of Prehistoric Times , '' will not seem unreasonably large when we consider the fact that it pre - tends to trace the path of civilization through a period of nearly twenty thousand years .

		The author limits his discussion to the subject of how the primitive man reckoned years and seasons ; but incidentally many other matters are brought in .

		It can not be said that the his - tory of the year is the most valuable contribu - tion that could be made to historic science ; but if Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	's conclusions were trustworthy his work would add greatly to our knowledge of the earlier ages , and would push the bounda - ries of history far back into prehistoric fields .

		The author takes us back nearly twenty - five thousand years into
Central India	LOCATION	.

		He finds there the earliest form of social life , the village - community of the Dravidian Malays .

		These people , nomadic at first , soon learned to culti - vate rice , and with agriculture came a settled life .

		Trees were cleared away and rude shel - ters built .

		In the centre of the clearing , a grove was left under the shade of which the festivals of the race were celebrated in dance .

		These villages were grouped into provinces , and these again sometimes into confederacies .

		Family kinship was unknown ; village was married to village , and descent was traced through the mother .

		As the villagers were farm - ers , it was necessary for them to know the se - quence of the seasons ; this led them to study the stars .

		The god of this early age was the pole-star , then in the constellation Cepheus .

		This gives the historian his initial date : the village community must have existed in
India	LOCATION	before 21,000 B. C. Not long after this began a period of mi - grations .

		The Dravidians moved northward and westward , up the Indus and along the shores of the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	, till they finally reached the
Euphratean delta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here on the plains of Shumir the Indian star-worshippers , later called Chaldaeans , at last settled .

		From this region two routes of further migration are traceable ; the one running through
Southern Arabia	LOCATION	to
Abyssinia	LOCATION	and thence down the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	to
Egypt	LOCATION	, the other and earlier leading toward the headwaters of the Tigris and the
Euphrates	LOCATION	and thence on into
Asia Minor	LOCATION	.

		In
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	these Indian workers of the soil came into contact with the Accadian Finns , a pastoral race from the far north .

		These two races were soon joined by a third : the men with the bow .

		These were a tall people , with fine regular features and wavy hair .

		The au - thor traces them back to the Cro-Magnon races of the early Palaeolithic age , the cave-dwellers of the Garonne region .

		The date of their migration is placed at 17,000 B. C. From the union of these races , so utterly unlike in ap - pearance , in social institutions , and in mode of life , sprang the Iberian Basques , the people who settled
Europe	LOCATION	in the Neolithic age .

		To the arts of the Dravido-Finns the northwestern people added pottery and brick-making .

		From
Armenia	LOCATION	this new race spread eastward and westward ; a few thousand years later they were in
Greece	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		They were the builders of the oldest remains at Tiryns and
Mycenae	LOCATION	.

		Later they appeared in
Spain	LOCATION	and
Brittany	PERSON	.

		About 8000 B. C. another great change came over the world .

		The old social organi - zation based on federated village communities began to be somewhat modified by the intro - duction of a commercial element .

		Indian traders passed up into the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	re - gion , everywhere finding the villages that the Basques had built in the later Stone Age .

		These villages now grew into large cities , such as the Athenian Acropolis and the Italian
Caere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The traders brought with them the use of bronze -LRB- the Bronze Age had begun in
India	LOCATION	about 15,000 B. C -RRB- .

		The migratory movements continued .

		Tribe after tribe came up from the Indus and passed on to the

		Tribe after tribe left the shades of the Ardennes region and travelled the long way to the Himalayan slopes .

		Amalgamation continued and new types were constantly form - ing .

		On the whole the age was a peaceful one .

		But soon came a conquering race from the North and disturbed the peaceful dances under the village-tree .

		These conquerors were the M Northwestern Goths , -- the race of cattle herdsmen who based their national organiza - tion on family property and divided their lands ... into tracts owned by the families united to form tribal territories as the village com - munities formed provinces .

		They were the Teutonic Frisians , and Saxons , '' and left their homes about 10,000 B. C. Arriving in
India	LOCATION	, they reorganized that country , and an era of great commercial prosperity set in , continuing from

		THE DIAL , 355 latter date marks the coming of .

		the Aryans , '' a Gotho-Celtic people '' who overcame the commercial princes , and with whose invasion began a new era -- the Iron Age .

		A brief review such as the one just given can , of course , do but scant justice to a system like Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	's .

		But when a writer proceeds to construct and reconstruct history by methods radically different from those in general use , an effort should be made to state at least a few of his leading conclusions .

		Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	assumes that primitive peoples are conservative almost to the point of absolute inertia ; he therefore believes that a great deal of the world 's early civilization has come down to us in some form or other .

		These survivals he finds in myths , in rituals , in the classic festivals , in existing customs , in words , and particularly in the Sanskrit writings .

		That a continued search for the fossilized forms of earlier civilizations is a laudable effort , will be admitted by all ; the difficulty comes when we are called on to determine what is and what is not a survival .

		But such problems evidently do not interest Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	.

		His materials do not appear to have been sifted ; he brings to - gether everything that can in any way be twisted into the appearance of a survival .

		And if an institution can not be shown to go back more than ten thousand years , the inferential method easily carries the author 's conclusions back another ten thousand .

		He also assumes that all myths have some significance , usually historic ; if they do not , why were they invented ?

		Still , every stu - dent of history knows that myths have often been invented for no good reason whatever .

		But supposing the author 's contention to be a good one , how are we to know whether the myth is properly interpreted ?

		Significant or not , the legend will never yield great results in historical study .

		Bad as the author 's choice of materials un - doubtedly is , the manner in which he uses them is far worse .

		His method is the compar - ative method gone mad .

		Irish tales are used in elucidating institutions that developed in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	twenty thousand years ago .

		We are told that the Jews blew rams ' horns at the opening of their year , because it originated with the sun-god who was born when the sun was in the sign Aries , about 15,000
B. C. Tacitus	PERSON	's description of the Germans is used to illustrate conditions on the shores of the
North Sea	LOCATION	ten thousand years before that writer was born .

		Not only does the author ignore time and space in the use of his '' evidence , '' but forced interpretations frequently appear .

		We are told , for instance , that when Tacitus speaks of the Germans as a people who did not live in cities , he meant the Saxons and Frisians only .

		Perhaps the most interesting part of Mr.
Hewitt	PERSON	's work is the chronology .

		He believes that certain myths and Vedic poems record the position of the pole-star at various periods , as well as the constellations in which the sun was found at the equinoxes .

		Astronomy is then made use of to determine the years or periods of years .

		It can not be said , however , that the author 's use of the sidereal science to determine chronology convinces the reader as to its gen - eral utility .

		It should be added that the author seems to have mastered the whole field of myth and le - gend .

		The book contains a vast amount of material , much of it perfectly incomprehensible to the general reader .

		But all is skilfully used and carefully systematized .

		Not so much care has been bestowed on the literary part of the work .

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, may not , in the ultimate reckoning , tarn out to occupy a larger place in the world 's regard .

		Even the great reputation of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has shown signs of being overworked during the past few years , and we can not say that the contents of the new volume are of a nature to stem the current of reaction from the excessive praise of which he was the subject not so long ago .

		Turning over the pages of '' The Five Nations , '' we renew acquaintance with the noble '' Recessional , '' with the striking ''
Kitchener	PERSON	's School , '' `` tnd with that canting apology for im - perialism , `` The White Man 's Burden . ''

		Other familiar pieces -- '' The Truce of the Bear '' and '' Our Lady of the Snows , '' we also find .

		Among the new pieces we discover a group of fine poems having the sea for their inspiration , a group of which the finest is called '' White Horses , '' and opens with this spirited and imaginative stanza : u Where run your colts at pasture ?

		Where hide your mares to breed ?

		` Mid bergs about the Ice-cap Or wove Sargasso weed : By chartless reef and channel , Or crafty coastwise bars , But most the ocean-meadows All purple to the stars I '' But strong as this poem is , and as are the sea - poems that go with it , we are reminded by the very theme of them that
England	LOCATION	still possesses a poet of the seas who is a poet indeed , that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has so far surpassed the best of these verses that a comparison with the younger singer would be an act of wanton cruelty .

		Turning the leaves still further , we come to '' The Feet of the Young Men , '' a swing - ing piece in the most characteristic Kipling manner .

		Then there are some dignified memorial stanzas ded - icated to
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, and some even more impres - sive stanzas dedicated to General
Joubert	PERSON	.

		Passing over many other things well worthy of mention and of praise -LRB- although always qualified -RRB- , we come at last to what the author calls '' Service Songs , '' which occupy the closing third of the volume .

		These , at least , bear no conceivable relation to poetry as that term has hitherto been understood .

		They are extraordinary compositions , no doubt , full of vigor - ous life and acute observation of humankind as represented by the soldier , but their slanginess and the general brutality of their diction puts them out - side the pale of literature , if literature and beauty are still to be considered as being concerned with one another .

		These strictures must be held to apply in considerable measure to the contents of the earlier pages as well , although before we reach the '' Service Songs , '' we do not come upon such unrelieved tracts of uncouth vulgarity .

		If only we might have Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's gold without its heavy admixture of dross !

		A generation hence , when he shall be read only in the anthologies , he will prob - ably seem a more important figure in our literature than he can now seem to readers of the discrimi - nating class , who find it impossible to blink the dis - tressing and unlovely aspects of his work , to say nothing of its pernicious ethical tendencies .

		Mr.
Alfred Cochrane	PERSON	is a poet of light and grace - ful quality whose work commends itself to a refined taste , and who may be read with much quiet satis - faction .

		His `` Collected Verses , '' now published , comprise the contents of two earlier volumes , with the addition of a considerable quantity of matter that has not hitherto appeared in book form .

		Sing - ing , as these verses do , no '' epic hymns of Life and
Time	ORGANIZATION	, '' they are as far removed as possible from Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's turgid measures , but they have a charm of their own .

		Most of them are indeed plucked leviore plectro , and their themes are such as the cricket field , the golf links , and the ball - room ; they are , in brief , vers de societi of typical sort .

		In his more serious mood , Mr.
Cochrane	PERSON	writes such lines as ''
Integer Vita	PERSON	, '' which we re - produce . ''

		A man with sympathies that moved To human interests , human needs ; And with unwearied kindness proved By courteous words and friendly deeds . ''

		One , upon whom his neighbors thrust The burden of their constant cares , A counsellor to love and trust .

		He mixed in other men 's affairs .

		11 Yet with the soul serene , for which The restless thinker vainly looks , That made him in contentment rich Among his birds and flowers and books .

		`` For in his faith abiding strong , Nor by regret nor doubt dismayed , He st ^ od asunder from the throng , And spake with Conscience unafraid . ''

		No fierce ambition for the strife , No master wit to scheme and plan , But through a sane well-ordered life The wisdom of the upright man . ''

		Nature and love are the themes of Mr.
Joseph Russell Taylor	PERSON	in '' The Overture . ''

		The author 's manner is characterized by spontaneity , careless - ness of the poetical conventions , and an audacious realism that sometimes takes the breath away .

		We quote `` The Bachelor in the Wood , '' which is so good a poem that it deserves a less prosaic title . ''

		Beauty I trod , who footed in the wood A
midnight	TIME	galaxy of violets , A milky way of flushed
spring	DATE	- beauties , starred With pleiads of all-golden adder-tongue , -- How could that blossomed fire be else than this , The height of a woman 's ankle in the wood ? ''

		Passion I breathed , who found all air a harp To the mad brown-thrushes quivering and quick , The spaces in that daring minstrelsy Thronged with enkindling echoes , sparrow and wren , -- How could that warbled fire be else than this , The height of a woman 's lips within the wood ? ''

		I trod the stars , I breathed the flame ; but love , O
April	DATE	, can I find it here alone ?

		Those send the bees to find their sister-flowers , These sing unto their mates ; but love , my love ?

		Is it where the hawk hangs on the morning cloud , The height of a woman 's heart above the wood ? ''

		Here is something very like the `` lyric cry , '' and we find it again and again in Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's fresh imaginative utterance .

		His sonnets , also , have
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 357 marked beauty , although more restrained .

		This one is called '' Veteres Ineunt Proscania '' -- one of a series of Latin titles happier than those of the author 's English choosing . ''

		Ah once again upon the rock to lie Under the water-maple , half awake , Shnt in from wind and sun , mountain and lake .

		Save for a space of dimpling under-sky , With you beside me in a boat hard by , Yon with your book of verse beneath the bough , Up whose green curtains , and across yonr brow , Ripples of water-fire forever die ; And ever while the squirrel , hidden above , From leafage burdened yet with yesterday Shakes down light rains on us , reading to me , To hear yonr voice seem near and far away , Reading of her who to the sacred grove Led the blind wanderer , Antigone . ''

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's volume will well repay the atten - tion , although its approach , through a queer com - position called ''
Penelope	PERSON	in Love , '' is set with thorns .

		Mr.
Frederic Crow	PERSON	nin shield has many excellent opinions upon politics , education , yellow journalism , the temperance problem , and other serious themes -- and he expresses them in lines that measure up as verse , and have the correct number of accents , but somehow he fails to produce the effect of poetry .

		A sonnet on '' Utopia '' may be given as an example . ''

		It seems scarce credible to us to-day That thon , good More , shouldst in thy time create -- When Violence was Right -- a perfect state , Wherein a man might work his chosen way , And yet unto the Weal his best convey !

		And thou didst hold that if we could abate Our fatuous lust for gold , all fraud , all hate From very inanition would decay .

		Alack , to those who have not read thy book , Its title meaneth but a madman 's dream , And thy fair commonwealth a wild conceit !

		Oh , madmen they who will not squarely look At life with thy sane eyes .

		For well I deem Thine is no dream , but a great truth concrete . ''

		We are in hearty agreement with these sentiments , but why should they masquerade in verse ?

		Mr.
Crowninshield	PERSON	's volume is called '' Tales in Metre , and Other Poems , '' and we may admit the metre as unimpeachable .

		But we should not call any of his pieces poems , although they have touches of poetic fancy here and there , especially when they reflect the impressions made by art and travel upon the cultivated mind of their author .

		Dr.
William J. Fischer	PERSON	is a young Canadian who has put forth a thin volume entitled `` Songs by the Wayside . ''

		We quote two stanzas from '' A Song of the Sea . '' ''

		sea , bounding sea !

		thy fond music is ringing , Thy voices vibrate in their wave-symphony , And bring to my heart such a wealth of sweet singing , That fills me with joy and a feeling of glee . ''

		And fain would I be a glad child of the ocean , And feel , on my lips , the cool breath of thy waves , That stir in their hissing and frenzied , wild motion The fishes at play , in their deep marine caves . ''

		A friend of the writer , who contributes a '' fore - word , '' informs us that the voice of Dr.
Fischer	PERSON	`` is a young , glad voice . ''

		He also tells us that '' here we find no lines reminding us of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Long	LOCATION	- fellow , or
Lanier	PERSON	. ''

		We certainly do not .

		But among the things that we do find , and that obtrude upon our attention , are a great number of unneces - sary and irritating elisions , and a quite unaccount - able sprinkling of commas in the wrong places .

		A volume of verse-triflings by Mr.
Edward W. Barnard	PERSON	has for its title '' The Conceits of a General Lover . ''

		At least , this is the legend of the title - page , although the word `` Conceits ' '' appears as '' Conceit '' on the back and covers of the volume .

		We quote '' Urbs in Rure -- A Moving Tale '' : '' In vain the
May	DATE	wind wanders on And softly whispers me , When sultry
summer	DATE	days are done , Of nights in
Arcady	LOCATION	.

		But what great miracle shall my
Arcadia	LOCATION	restore ?

		The place that knew Calphnrnia Will know her nevermore . ''

		For months a Damoclean sword Hung trembling o'er us all : We shut our eyes , and laughed and sung , But knew that it would fall .

		'T was on the year 's unhappy scroll Immutably decreed , That she must go -- Calphnrnia !

		And now she 's gone , indeed . ''

		She lives ?

		Ah !

		Yes she lives , but where ?

		Not where our hearts are still ; But in pa 's new ' colonial ' At
East Westmoreland	LOCATION	ville .

		A suburb -- near , and yet so far !

		-- Whence -- O the cruel fate -- For him that 's faring cityward The last train leaves at 8 ! ''

		This bit of verse has some slight point to it , but the case is an exception .

		Most of the pieces are flat and unprofitable , besides showing an almost incredible defect of ear .

		How some of the stanzas could have been thought to be written in metre passes compre - hension .

		`` Semanoud '' is a narrative poem , in stanzas , of a slave who loved a princess .

		The princess spurned his mission , and sent him to labor in the quarries .

		By-and-by he saves her life at the cost of his own , and she is sorry that she had spurned him . ''

		A Dream '' is one of the lesser pieces in this collection . ''

		I dreamed , my love , that you and I had died And passed away to some fair southern clime , Where roses bloomed beside a sapphire sea , Where all the radiant world was Love , and Time Was but Eternity . ''

		I waked , my love , but knew that you and I Only in dreams can meet forevermore .

		The pine and palm were not more far apart , Yet , ` cross the sea from that wide distant shore You speak unto my heart . ''

		The author of these poems is Miss
H. Talbot Kummer	PERSON	, a talented young woman of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, who has spent much time abroad . ''

		Fate and I , and Other Poems '' is the work of Miss
Gerda Dalliba	PERSON	.

		The poems are outpourings of the sentimental sort usually written by young women , `` A Mood '' being a fair example .

		358 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, '' Calm the morning falls from
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, Dim and over-spread with clouds , And the mountain-tops are driven Back into their mists of shrouds .

		`` And sweet rest is on the valleys , Weary of their swaying grass ; For the sun far eastward tarries , And the winds no longer pass '' To and fro -- but all are sleeping Quiet in the soft gray shy ; And the peaceful Heavens are weeping -- It would save my heart , could I ! ''

		Miss
Hattie Horner Loutban	PERSON	's '' Thoughts Adrift '' are little poems of nature and the human heart .

		There is nothing very - distinctive about them , al - though now and tben a pretty conceit is voiced , as in the case of the lines called '' Inconstancy . '' ''

		The Night unto the New Moon clung -- Moon , so sweet , so fair , so young !

		And o'er his face her hair was flung , A veil of misty light .

		He said : ' O
Moon	PERSON	, why haste away ?

		'T is dark , so dark , without thy ray : 1 love thee as can not the Day . '

		So sang the fickle Night . ''

		The
Moon	PERSON	upon
Night	ORGANIZATION	's breast lay cold -- O Moon so pale , so sad , so old !

		He said : ' Why tarry .

		Moon ?

		Behold How many hours thou ` st stayed I These arms another soon shall fold -- The Sun , all youth and warmth and gold . ' ''

		Then swift came Day , the conquerer bold .

		So died the
Night	TIME	, betrayed . '' ''

		A Field of Folk '' is the titular poem in a vol - ume by Miss
Isabella Howe Fiske	PERSON	.

		The suggestion is from
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, and this is the poem itself : ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, hermit-robed , one
May	DATE	of yore .

		Stood on the hills , his soul at gaze to see
Round Holy Church	ORGANIZATION	, fair
Malvern	LOCATION	's priory , Outlying counties spread , his eyes before .

		And when the vision passed , his waking spoke Of a fair woman and a field of folk . ''

		My hermit heart wins
Malvern	LOCATION	's hills to-day And , looking far afield on human life , Sees the same toil , still the same timeless strife .

		And a fair woman stands midmost the way .

		-- Who has so climbed can scarce look out in vain A
summer	DATE	season on the busy plain . ''

		The verse of Miss
Fiske	PERSON	has a noticeable element of originality , which may be illustrated by `` An Apostle of the Oak . '' ''

		I believe in the mighty oak Conceived by God , Born of the virgin sod , Suffered the woodman 's stroke , Whose leaves were crucified By the frost 's sting , And rose again in
spring	DATE	Toward Easter heavens wide , At the right hand of Nature spread It heals the sick , Restores the quick , And broods above the dead .

		And in thy spirit mine believes , In temples of the catholic wood , Communion of the good , Made audient in the leaves .

		Then since new life thou hast in ken And pardon for who need , I face the east , repeat the creed , And standing cry : Amen . ''

		We close this review with examples of the work of two Canadian women , one a new-comer , the other a writer of past achievement .

		The new-comer is Mrs.
Katherine H. McDonald Jackson	PERSON	, and her volume has '' Summer Songs in Idlenesse '' for a title .

		The following lyric of the reflective type is called '' Life '' : '' Light ships afloat on a misty Sea With pain in store .

		Anchored by Love from Eternity To
Time	ORGANIZATION	's bleak shore . ''

		The ropes that moor them to Happiness Are cobwebs frail : 111 can they bear the strain and stress Of Sorrow pale . ''

		The cable of Hope from the anchor slips All worn by tears .

		And out to sea drift the frail white ships Mid doubts and fears . ''

		But as Death 's cold tide in the crnel night Bears them away , Who knows where they go as they pass from sight Into Distance grey ? ''

		There are three long poems in Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	's vol - ume , one an idyl of love in
June	DATE	, one a legend from the Isles of Shoals , and one a blank - verse setting of the story of
Penthesilea	LOCATION	.

		The closing lines of this latter poem may be reproduced . ''

		Thus Achilles felt A woe that would for aye his soul impress .

		While keeping vigil there beside the dead .

		Till o'er his anguish kindly , gentle Night Drew the soft mantle of her shadowed veil And Sleep possessed him .

		Sleep the highest gift Of all the Gods to Mortals when in pain Of mind or body .

		Sleep that gives to man A foretaste of the Everlasting Rest . ''

		This has just the right touch of simple dignity , a touch not unsuggestive of the older '' Hellenics '' of Landor .

		The city worker who has been off on his vacation , according to
Miss Wetherald	PERSON	, returns to his desk -- '' Tangled in stars and spirit-steeped in dew . ''

		He is made the subject of a sonnet , and the phrase `` Tangled in Sfcars '' serves as a pretty title for both the sonnet and the volume which it introduces .

		Another sonnet , `` At Waking , '' is one of the most exquisite of
Miss Wetherald	LOCATION	's songs . ''

		When I shall go to sleep and wake again At dawning in another world than this , What will atone to me for all I miss ?

		The light melodious footsteps of the rain , The press of leaves against my window pane , The sunset wistfulness and morning bliss , The moon 's enchantment and the twilight kiss Of winds that wander with me through the lane . ''

		Will not my soul remember evermore The earthly winter 's hunger for the
spring	DATE	, The wet sweet cheek of
April	DATE	, and the rush Of roses through the
summer	DATE	's open door ; The feelings that the scented woodlands bring At evening with the singing of the thrush ? ''

		Nearly all of these poems are nature lyrics , and many of them share the delicate beauty of the son - net just reproduced .

		THE DIAL 359 Briefs on New Books .

		So rarely now does Mr.
Thomas Bai	PERSON	- ii ^ aging tifle * .

		le 7
Aldrich	PERSON	publish anything that his `` Ponkapog Papers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be sure of a welcome .

		The queer name , which may well have puzzled many a reader of `` From Ponkapog to Pesth , '' designates an actual town , formerly an Indian reservation , a few miles south of
Boston	LOCATION	, and is to be found in the gazetteer .

		In this quiet retreat the author has put together sundry entertaining odds and ends , which `` no more dream of inviting comparison between them - selves and important pieces of literature '' than Ponkapog dreams of mistaking itself for a metro - politan centre .

		The sketch of
Robert Herrick	PERSON	, which concludes the volume , is the only piece of any length , and is an excellent appreciation of the poet .

		The rest of the book is devoted to '' Leaves from a Note Book '' and '' Asides , '' whose charm lies in their daintiness of execution .

		But this very exquisiteness of polish makes even the slightest flaw conspicuous .

		As an instance of the poet
Thom	PERSON	- son 's notorious laziness , the author represents him as standing `` in his garden of an afternoon , with both hands in his waistcoat pockets , eating peaches from a pendent bough , '' -- a difficult feat , one would think , even for a man of the most active habits .

		However , lazy folks always take the most pains .

		There is a subtle psychological truth in the remark of our Ponkapogian philosopher that '' extraordi - nary names never seem extraordinary to the per - sons bearing them '' ; and he favors us with some names almost too good to be true .

		He quotes with approval , one regrets to note , Buckle 's assertion that '' after the love of knowledge , there is no passion which has done so much good to mankind as the love of money . ''

		But there is consolation in the thought that Buckle is now an exploded authority .

		These are trifles , to be sure ; but of such , and of many much better ones , the book is composed .

		The little poem on
Japan	LOCATION	, which sings its way through ten neatly-turned quatrains , is perhaps the gem of the volume .

		Artist i and artitl days in Barbizon It is a peculiar spot to look for great achievements , -- a tiny hamlet of a single street , bounded on the one side by the forest of
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	and on the other by a broad plain .

		And yet , as we are again in - formed , there gathered about an inn , table in this hamlet the largest group of men of creative power with the brush that have ever assembled anywhere since the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		In '' Barbizon Days '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles Sprague Smith	PERSON	has pictured again the lives of Millet ,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and Barye , and the glad and sane '' vie de Boheme '' these men led in those early days -- when each new - comer had to smoke
Diaz	PERSON	's pipe , and when if the color of the smoke were iridescent he was declared a colorist , if gray a classicist .

		Here Millet found the work given him to do . ''

		Its fruits were rugged , harsh to the taste of his generation .

		He might have drawn , from shallower soil , that which pleased .

		But his simple peasant nature , close in its qualities to the homely , industrious , fruit-bearing earth , akin in its tenacity of purpose to the firm-rooted oaks of his beloved forest , refused and refused again , and turned back to work and suffer . ''

		The author aims obviously at the fluent , desultory , imaginative style of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	; yet in his apparent emulation of this author 's highly brilliant essays his metaphors ring true , -- for he has absorbed the atmosphere of the locality under discussion .

		Whether describing
Rousseau	PERSON	's personal struggle with nature , or the poet - ical legends and
summer	DATE	idyls of
Corot	LOCATION	, or the aca - demic sculpture of
Barye	LOCATION	, suggestive of the gorges of Apremont and Franchard , the author speaks with an air of authority .

		It is true that a more critical mind would cope with the facts more suggestively , deducing from them new aspects , new interrela - tions , new philosophical truths ; but to the average art-lover Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's interpretations will broaden and deepen the simple power of appreciation and enjoyment .

		To-day , the good `` vie de Boheme '' has vanished from
Barbizon	LOCATION	; the forest of
Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tainebleau has been transformed , its solitudes have been made accessible , and thus , to the artist , pro- faned , -- for the hamlet has been bound to the great world , not merely by broad carriage roads displacing a footpath across the forest , but even by a railroad that passes
Rousseau	PERSON	's and Barye 's cottages and
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's atelier .

		The many half-tone illustrations enhance the charm of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's text .

		Love-letters of Before she found happiness in the M ^ gar * Fuller , love ^ of the
Marquis Ossoli	PERSON	, rumor has it that
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's heart was twice deeply wounded by men unworthy of the confidence she so generously placed in them .

		The second of these tender episodes is now made public in the `` Love-Letters of Margaret Fuller '' -LRB-
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton -RRB- .

		The dainty little volume is not for profane eyes .

		In one of the later letters ,
Margaret	PERSON	herself wrote , '' I want the mysterious tie that binds us to remain unprofaned forever '' ; and the sympathetic reader must feel , with all his enjoyment of the book , a sort of guilty regret at having suffered himself to become , in a way , an accessory after the fact -LRB- of publication -RRB- .


James Nathan	PERSON	, a German Jew , a commission merchant , a man of no education com - pared with
Margaret	PERSON	's , captivated her fancy , and for the better part of two years she luxuriated and agonized in the raptures and spasms of what seemed to her an elective affinity .

		But the Jew went abroad , a few months before she herself sailed for
Europe	LOCATION	, and there he seems to have married .

		At any rate , his innamorata learned his unworthiness , and with wonderful fortitude calmly turned over that leaf in her troubled life , and pasted it down .

		Only a woman of like ardor and tenderness , and with experience of a like disillusionment , can read
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's heart-utterances with full sympathy and apprecia - tion .

		Painfully introspective and overloaded with 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, psychological analysis these outpourings certainly are ; hut the final impression is of a beautiful and confiding nature that has suffered cruelly .

		The frontispiece portrait , highly idealized and bearing no physical resemblance to its subject , well matches the ethereal beauty of these letters addressed to a lover who , as conceived by his correspondent , had no earthly existence .

		The fact that , after her death , he offered her letters for sale to a publisher , may serve as an index to his real character .

		The letters were at that time -- or so the story goes -- restored intact to the Fuller family by the publisher , greatly to his honor .

		The cream of the volume , to many readers , will be Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's introduction and the reprinted reminiscences of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Greeley	LOCATION	, and
Charles T. Congdon	PERSON	.

		It is a difficult thing to write of spir - f/hUto SPring * itual f orce8 in the making of history .

		This task , the Rev.
Joseph B. Clark	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Congregational Home Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	, has attempted in his volume entitled '' Leavening the Nation '' -LRB-
The Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which he gives an account of the spread of churches throughout the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This church growth originated in the efforts of separate Home Missonary Societies in the
East	LOCATION	, which united in national organizations early in the nineteenth cen - tury .

		The first chapter of the book indicates the early habits of thinking and living that led to the first society in
1798	DATE	.

		The larger part of the vol - ume is taken up with the story of the growth of churches accompanying the great pioneer move - ments that have attended the settling of the country in the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, the Mexican Cession , the Southern belt , and the present-day invasions of
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	.

		The implication of the title , as well as the purpose of the author , is to give due credit to the missions of the leading religious denominations ; but except for the interesting summaries of present religious conditions in each
State	ORGANIZATION	, the story is prac - tically untold except for the Congregational denom - ination to which Dr.
Clark	PERSON	belongs .

		Even for one denomination , the history can only be given in out - line in such a volume ; but even in its abbreviated form , one is surprised at the record of heroic cour - age and endurance , the marshalling of honored names , and the close relation of these self-sacrificing missionaries and their work to the development of the country .

		One feels that here , even with the diffi - culty of estimating the true value of such efforts , a glimpse is had of the deepest motives , and of the underlying facts that explain our measure of civili - zation .

		The Home Missionary effort in the North - west and in the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	is not given with the spirit which marks the account of missionary pro- gress in
Oregon	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		This seems due to the fact that the author did not delve into the records of the earlier years , so abundantly at his hand , sufficiently to reproduce the spirit of those days of giving and doing , surely as stirring then as the spirit which to-day fills Porto Rico with schools and churches .

		Dr.
Clark	PERSON	does not close without paying tribute to the part women have taken in this work , or without vindicating New En - gland from the charge of '' decadence . ''

		He admits the danger from the foreign population in
New En	LOCATION	- gland , and the lessened number of the old Puritan stock in the hill churches , but contends that the remedy is at hand and is effective in the application of Home Missions to the very region where they originated .

		This remedy he thinks also effective for the problem of the congested foreign popula - tions in our large cities .

		This , however , is the field of the prophet rather than of the historian .

		That humor is impossible to the man wuandwtdom .

		80 economical of his mental processes that he '' runs only one train of thought a day , '' will be readily admitted .

		The Rev. Dr.
Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	, as he stands at once disguised and revealed in '' The Gentle Reader '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is evidently not such a man .

		Whether , with a New-England regard for the Sabbath pro- prieties , his intellectual time-table schedules but one train for
Sunday	DATE	, is a query that may arise ; but those who have heard him in the pulpit will hardly believe his mental railway less travelled on the first day of the week than on the following six .

		Readers of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' do not need to have their atten - tion called to the Gentle Reader 's bright , humorous , thoughtful , and thought-provoking reflections on sundry themes , chiefly literary .

		They will , however , be glad to possess , in book form , these delightfully readable essays , and will judge them not unworthy of a place beside the genial disquisitions of the Autocrat .

		In lightness of touch , playfulness of fancy , and a certain pleasing addiction to the para - doxical , the two authors are not unlike .

		A knack of happy characterization is conspicuous in Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	.

		Alluding to the fondness of the quasi - logical mind for arguing in a circle , he aptly styles this diversion `` an intellectual merry-go-round . ''

		Cer - tain other minds , not of the first order , are spoken of as prone to indulge in an equally exhilarating career through space , -- `` the toboggan slide of alliteration . ''

		The painfully accurate historian 's obtrusive footnotes are conceived of as running along at the bottom of the page '' like little angry dogs barking at the text . ''

		It is such sprightly touches as these that tickle the reader 's fancy and keep him ever alert and expectant .

		Mr.
W. D. Ellwanger	PERSON	's book on `` The i * # 5J # .

		Oriental Rug '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- traverses somewhat the same field as Mr.
Mumford	PERSON	's monumental work , but is much slighter , and is written more from the point of view of the connoisseur and collector .

		The author 's ap - preciation of the intrinsic beauty and artistic value of fine rugs and carpets is keen and intelligent .

		It may , however , be doubted whether he has altogether succeeded in imparting that point of view to the
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361 general reader .

		The task , indeed , is an impossible one .

		For those whose eyes are trained to see , there is in Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's volume mnch useful informa - tion about the qualities and characteristics of the different weaves .

		There is also some practical advice to the collector , both as to the choosing and the care of his treasures .

		The chief difficulty in utilizing such counsel , aside from the inherent one of inability to supply the fineness of perception that makes all qualities good and bad almost instantly visible , is that the really fine specimens of the oriental rug weavers ' art are distinctly individual .

		Their value as works of art -LRB- which they indubitably are -RRB- depends not upon the weave , -- that is to say , upon the locality whence they come , but upon such qualities as coloring , texture , fineness , condition , and beauty of design .

		Books , therefore , can serve only in a very limited and imperfect way as guides .

		The one way in which they can be of real help is through their illustrations .

		Those which embellish the vol - ume under consideration leave nothing to be asked for except that there should be more of them .

		With one exception , they reproduce rare specimens from the collections of the author and of Mr.
George H. Ellwanger	PERSON	.

		So beautiful are they , that the lover of such things , especially if he happens to be a poor man , can not escape a pang of regret that the pref - erence of the mass of mankind for what is crude , garish , and vulgar , alone prevents works of equal merit from being generally produced to-day instead of the inferior wares with which the bazaars are filled .

		The Old Testament ranks of Ger -
Babei	PERSON	and
Bible	LOCATION	, many have been mysteriously stirred up by a lecture delivered in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
January , 1902	DATE	.

		Professor
Friedrich Delitzsch	PERSON	, the well-known Assyriologist , was the author of the lecture .

		Its suddenly acquired popularity was due not so much to its contents as to the fact that it was delivered in the presence of his Majesty , the
Kaiser	PERSON	.

		The lecture dealt with the Bible and its new light from the mounds of
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Delitzsch	PERSON	presented the matter in a dramatic manner , and , as was to be expected , magnified very greatly the sub - stantial gains made through the marvellous revela - tions of excavators in the Orient and decipherers at home .

		Such stupendous statements were chal - lenged within a year by a score of brochures written by university professors and scholarly pastors in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In
January	DATE	of the present year the same scholar delivered a second lecture in the presence of the
Kaiser	PERSON	and the
German Oriental Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		These two lectures , abundantly illustrated , have been translated by Mr.
C. H. W. Johns	PERSON	of Cam - bridge , and published as Volume I. of the '' Crown Theological Library '' with the title `` Babel and Bible '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Of the 255 pages , 93 are '' Notes , '' controversial , literary , and archaeological .

		They reveal some of the unpleasantnesses which exist between rival schools and scholars in Ger - many .

		The immense mass of literature on this theme that has appeared in
Germany	LOCATION	within one year and a half has not disturbed the equilibrium of American and English scholars .

		It is a Ger - man quarrel over things not new , nor things said for the first time .

		Imperial countenance gave im - petus and provoked challenges , and the fight was on .

		Mr.
Johns	PERSON	has given us a good translation , so that American and English readers , who care to know why German scholars have been wrangling over '' Babel and Bible '' and how Professor Delitzsch handles them , now have the opportunity to read up the case .

		The inexpensive pocket editions of Noble Author * .

		standard authors , so predominant now in the booksellers ' windows , have their own especial virtues and advantages which no one may gainsay .

		But the idea is some - what overdone , and we are glad to note the appear - ance of at least one new series that will make its appeal to those whose delight it is , in
Hazlitt	PERSON	's phrase , to `` browse on folios . ''

		From all such book - lovers of an older fashion , the ''
Chiswick Library of Noble Authors	ORGANIZATION	, '' undertaken by the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	, deserves cordial greeting .

		To present a few noble books in noble form , embodying the very highest ideals in modern bookmaking , is the object of the series .

		Appropriate commencement is made with Landor 's '' Pericles and
Aspasia	PERSON	, '' reprinted without new editorial matter from the text of
1876	DATE	, and issued in an edition limited to two hundred copies .

		The volume is of folio size , imposing in appearance , yet light and easily handled .

		The text is printed on Arnold handmade paper , from a per - fectly simple but distinctive cut of old style pica type , with marginal running-heads and chapter - titles in red .

		Beyond a frontispiece portrait of
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, a designed title-page , and floriated chapter - initials , there is nothing of decoration in the volume .

		Its marked distinction of appearance rests upon a basis of irreproachable typography and presswork .

		In these details the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	, around which centre the highest traditions of more than a cen - tury of English printing , has fairly surpassed its own best efforts , -- which is saying a great deal .

		The little company of book-lovers into whose hands this limited edition may come should count it among their choicest treasures .

		Ntm-medieinai The 8eries of five volumes entitled therapeutic '' A System of Physiologic Thera - procedure * .

		peutics , '' edited by Dr.
S. S. Cohen	PERSON	and published by Messrs.
Blakiston	PERSON	, is in effect an exposition of the current views of medical men on various non-medicinal therapeutic procedures .

		It includes a wide range of subjects of interest to the ordinary reader , and is a proper and valuable con - tribution to general education .

		It is a series which is adapted to the public library and to the libraries of colleges and high schools , and contains informa - tion which might be called for in almost any library .

		Like all composite series , different chapters are of different scientific and literary value , but nearly all 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	'' of them can be read with advantage by the average reader .

		It is a series devoid of repulsive illustra - tions , and it is filled with maps , diagrams , and pictures , illustrative of the very extensive subjects covered .

		One can hardly consult a work of this kind without finding defects and deficiencies , and we would only call attention to the extensive treat - ment of the life-history of some of the more re - cently discovered parasites , and the very brief way in which some of the more common and better known are passed over .

		For example , no mention is made of the number of eggs which the female bedbug deposits in her lifetime , or the period of incubation required for each egg ; nor is there men - tion of the time required for an adult and fertile bedbug to be developed from the egg .

		Little is said in regard to the methods of destroying this pest , and such directions as are given are inefficient and inexact .

		In only a few households does the life-history of the malarial germ or the tsetse fly become a matter of vital importance ; but the sta - bility and permanency of many a family hangs upon the successful understanding of the life and death of the bedbug .

		The latest Egyptian History .

		Dr.
E. A. W. Budge	PERSON	, author of the latest `` History of
Egypt	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Henry Frowde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has certain admirable qual - ifications for his task , -- some familiarity with Egyptian texts , an immense mass of material at his disposal in the British Museum , a painstaking dili - gence in the collection of authorities , and in general a clear way of putting things in English speech .

		But he lacks some indispensable requirements for success , -- such as accurate knowledge of the Egyp - tian language , critical ability , and a sense for his - torical development .

		The result is that in these eight volumes the student has an unequalled survey of the latest results of excavation , good and useful pictures , some valuable discussions of minor points , but no ordered presentation of events or critical estimate of the sources of knowledge , and so erratic a handling of Egyptian texts as to make the use of his results by a layman quite unsafe .

		Of course it follows that the work is very far from being the ideal history of
Egypt	LOCATION	, although it is an agreeable and interesting account of things Egyptian , and gotten up in admirable style by the
Oxford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press .

		To architects and students of archi - iSSL tvei .

		tecture the name of
C. R. Cockerell	PERSON	is probably somewhat familiar , though thirty years have passed since his death .

		His son , Mr.
Samuel Pepys Cockerell	PERSON	, now edits his journal of '' Travels in
Southern Europe	LOCATION	and the Levant , 1810-1817 '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The re - mains of the temple of
Jupiter Panhellenius	ORGANIZATION	in ^ Egina were discovered by him and his party , and also the bas-reliefs forming the frieze of the temple of Apollo Epicurius near the ancient
Phigaleia	LOCATION	in
Arcadia	LOCATION	.

		The reliefs are now in the British Mu - seum ; the iEgina marbles were unfortunately lost to
England	LOCATION	, being purchased by
Crown Prince Louis	ORGANIZATION	of
Bavaria	LOCATION	.

		Beside
Greece	LOCATION	,
Cockerell	PERSON	travelled in
Crete	LOCATION	,
Asia Minor	LOCATION	,
Sicily	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, exploring ruins and sketching them , and also noting peculiarities of the places and people visited .

		An attractive ex - terior , a high spirit , a dauntless courage , and ap - parently an ample supply of ready money , did him good service wherever he went ; and he bad need enough of boldness and energy in exploring
Greece	LOCATION	in those days of Turkish misrule and violence .

		It is these occasional incidents of peril and of daring adventure that make some pages of the book very readable ; but its literary charm is slight , and its archaeological information has been largely super - seded by works of later origin .

		The editor admits that the young traveller disliked and had no talent for writing .

		The products of his pencil excelled those of his pen ; but of the former we have no specimen .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A subscription edition of '' The Novels and Stories of
Ivan Turgenieff	PERSON	, '' newly translated from the Russian by Miss
Isabel F. Hapgood	PERSON	, is one of the most impor - tant among the enterprises of the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	for the present season .

		The volumes are to be fifteen in number , each with a photogravure frontispiece and a special introduction by the translator , while no less a critic than Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has contributed a general introduction to the edition .

		Of the four volumes al - ready issued two contain the '' Memoirs of a Sports - man , '' the third gives us `` Rudin '' and '' A
King Lear	PERSON	of the Steppes , '' and the fourth , '' A Nobleman 's Nest . ''

		Four more volumes will suffice for the novels proper , leaving no less than seven for the short stories and sketches .

		A complete translation of these minor mas - terpieces has long been desired , and we are happy to note that it is at last forthcoming . ''

		Webster 's
Collegiate Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
G. & C. Merriam Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an abridgment of the '' Inter - national , '' but an abridgment that contains enough matter to be really worth while .

		Condensation has been practised at every possible point , and the use of thin paper still further reduces the dimensions of the volume , which contains over eleven hundred pages , although it is of only moderate thickness .

		The work is indexed , and includes the most important of the supplementary collections of words and phrases .

		The copy on our desk is bound in limp seal , and is altogether both attractive in appearance and a marvel of judicious editing .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an edition , in a single volume , of '' The Complete Works of
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	, '' with an introduction by Professor
Trent	PERSON	, and a life of the poet by Mr.
J. W. McSpadden	PERSON	.

		The word M complete '' is to be taken literally , for the volume includes '' A View of the Present State of
Ireland	LOCATION	'' as well as all the poems .

		Although there are over nine hundred pages , the print is perforce inconveniently small , and anything but tempting to the reader .

		But the whole of Spenser in a single volume is worth having , for reasons of space-economy , if for no others .

		An etched portrait serves as a frontispiece .

		These manuals are so well known that they need no description , and praise would be super - fluous .

		`` The Geography of
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor Spen - cer
Trotter	PERSON	, is a text-book for secondary schools having commercial courses .

		It belongs to the '' Commercial Series '' of the Messrs.

		The illustra - tions are numerous , and the suggested exercises of a practically helpful sort .

		Altogether , it is a book to be praised .

		Two publications of an artistic nature to be brought out by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	during the present month are likely to be much in demand as the holiday season approaches .

		One of these is '' The Boy Calen - dar , '' comprising enlarged reproductions of twelve of Mr.

		The White Company '' and '' The Hound of the Baskervilles , '' the two volumes first published , are handsome productions of the bookmaker 's art , and leave no doubt in our mind that the set is one well deserving of a place on the library shelf .

		Mr.
Lorado Taft	PERSON	's '' History of American Sculpture '' will be the first volume to appear in Professor Van Dyke 's projected series on '' The History of American Art , '' to be issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This series will bring together for the first time materials for a complete history of art in this country .

		Each volume begins with the founding of the nation and carries the record down to the present year .

		A new novel by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	has been se - cured by ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' for serial publication during the coming year , to commence immediately on the conclusion of Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's romance , '' Sir Mortimer . ''

		The same magazine is also fortunate in being able to retain the exclusive services during

MR. GIBSON	PERSON	'S new book is much more attractive than usual , not only because of the larger number of cartoons than usual , but , in par - ticular , of the greatly increased popularity and the telling character of his latest work .

		The keynote is found in the question mark cunningly suggested by the clever drawing accompanying the title phrase .

		Are women really `` the weaker sex '' ?

		Most of the drawings have a humorous bearing on this all-important question , and all of them show the piquancy , deft characterization , and rare execution that have made Mr.

		434 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 434 ON LETTER-WRITERS AND LETTER - WRITING . ''

		Solitude is sweet , '' says a French writer , '' but I desire a friend to whom I can say solitude is sweet . ''

		The best letters , the letters that speak to the heart and soul , have been written by those whose loneliness left them no other adequate means of self-expression , and who , writing to their friends with no thought of pro- ducing literature , have put into what they wrote so much of their inmost and truest selves that their letters could not fail to live and breathe , whether or not they enjoyed the distinction , not always an enviable one , of being published to the world to whom they were not addressed .

		Thousands of the best letters must have escaped this fate , their very excellence as personal mes - sages putting their publication out of the ques - 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, tion .

		But of those that have been offered to the general reader , the most eloquent and touching are from the pens of writers solitary in their nature and habits .


Eugenie de Guerin	PERSON	, in the country , poured out her soul to her beloved
Maurice	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	; and after his death she still wrote to him in her journal , '' to
Maurice	PERSON	in heaven . ''

		This intimate communion was a necessity of her being and of her situation , and it was only natural that the brother 's death should be followed before very many years by her own .

		Cowper , another solitary , wrote letters that will live as long as
John Gilpin	PERSON	remains a familiar figure .

		That most delight - ful recluse ,
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, put the best of himself into his letters .

		Although
Charles Lamb	PERSON	was a convivial soul , may it not have been the essential loneliness of his unmarried life , as well as the pathos of bis relation to his afflicted sister , that gave his letters their inim - itable quality ?

		No man can spend himself in an unlimited variety of ways ; but self-utterance • of some sort he must and will find , or die .

		Thus , when a rich and generous nature is denied the -LRB- bestowal of its treasures in other directions , its letters are sure to have warmth and life .

		That this is not a letter-writing age may be true .

		But readable letters are still written , and occasionally get into print .

		A little volume of excellent ones has recently appeared , in a privately-issued edition .

		They are by
Edward Chipman Guild	ORGANIZATION	.

		The name will indicate -RRB- the writer 's good
New England	LOCATION	ancestry .

		With the blood of the Guilds there mingled in his veins that of the Quincys , the Fly nts , the Eliots , and the Dudleys , all of whom took root in our soil within twenty years of the
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	's arrival .

		His conception of the well-written letter is the true one .

		It is a '' miniature work of art . '' ''

		It has its just and due proportions , like a poem , a picture or a statue ; it has its beginning , middle and end , like a little drama , and it must not be patched and seamed , it must not be spun out ; when the natural and fitting end has come , the < vale ' must be spoken and the sheet folded and the envelope closed ; if there is more to be said it must be put into another letter , tho ' it be written the same day . ''

		Most letters , as Mr.
Guild	PERSON	admits with regret , are mere sketches or memoranda , and convey no impression of warm , spontaneous outburst and overflow of the writer 's personality .

		Our correspondents are too often circumspect and self-conscious ; they do not write as they talk ; they no sooner put pen to paper than unreality stamps itself on every word they utter .

		Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	long ago declared that letters should have '' an even flow of unlaboured diction , and an artless arrangement of obvious sentiments . ''

		One may query , parenthetically , whether such a thing as unlabored diction is possible to the writer of pure Johnsonese .

		Channing wrote to one of his numerous correspondents , in apology for supposed defects in his letters : '' I can not start a subject without clinging to it , and I am very apt to run it down .

		The excellence of letter - writing , as of conversation , is thought to consist in a free and rather desultory movement of mind , in easy transitions and graceful allusions , in flitting from sub - ject to subject , and in sportively connecting remote topics by means of light and delicate resemblances . ''

		He regrets his lack of the '' lighter graces , '' and regards the ability to make oneself agreeable as not the least effectual means of being useful .

		This self-estimate is , of course , to be taken with modifications .

		The letter-writing mood comes not every day ; in fact , for long seasons , the heavenly fire may refuse to descend , and without inspiration a letter is as dead as the implements with which it is written .


Sterne	PERSON	felt this when , excusing his tardiness in answering a correspondent , he said : '' It is not every hour , or day , or week of a man 's life that is a fit season for the duties of Friendship .

		Senti - ment is not always at hand ; pride and folly , and what is called business , of ten-times keep it at a distance ; and without sentiment what is Friendship ?

		-- a name !

		a shadow ! ''

		Just here is suggested another characteristic of good letter-writing .

		Although
Cowper	PERSON	calls friendly correspondence '' talking upon paper , '' it has , with all its points of inferiority , some points of superiority to conversation .

		It admits of a fulness and warmth of personal expression , a certain depth of sincerity , that would be frightened away by the sound of the voice .

		The sentiment regarded by
Sterne	PERSON	as so essential to friendship gains a more deliberate utterance .

		It is true , sentiment may degenerate into sen - timentality , as came very near being the case in an amusing letter written to his wife by a certain
Lord Ogilvie	PERSON	, a Scotchman , about the middle of the eighteenth century . ''

		I aske par - don , '' he begins , M for troubleing you when I have nothing to say that 's worth your while heareing from the
Port of Cambray	LOCATION	, where I could not get into
last night	TIME	.

		I have no other design by sending you this
Billet	PERSON	but to make me think and dream over your Charms , with which I am Ass enough to be intoxicate , and for to pray you to write me every day , and to appoint when I shall come back . ''

		This excellent man was probably better with his tongue than with his pen .

		Not less strong than the impulse to write when the mood is on
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 409 is the impatience to have the letter off one 's hands as soon as written .

		Something like the thwarted feeling of the stammerer takes hold of us at finding in our pocket the letter we had intended to mail yesterday .

		We began to speak , but could not get the words fairly out .

		Every good letter - writer has a lively interest in what he writes , and he imagines his corre - spondent 's interest will abate with his own if the letter is withheld .

		So he hastens to de - spatch it , exclaiming with St.
Paul	PERSON	, '' See how large a letter I have written with mine own hand ! ''

		Another advantage of the written over the spoken communication is that we are less often troubled with vain regrets at lost opportunities to say a bright thing , or with self-reproach for having said a stupid one .

		Dull wits , and nim - ble wits too , keep pace more easily with the pen than with the tongue .

		The writer has time to put his thought into the best possible form , and to embroider it with all the suggestions of a playful fancy . ''

		Trifles '' -- to quote Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	once more -- '' always require exuber - ance of ornament ; the building which has no strength can be valued only for the grace of its decorations .

		The pebble must be polished with care , which hopes to be valued as a diamond . ''

		Our friend
Guild	ORGANIZATION	would heartily subscribe to this .

		He says : '' I like to use a great many words and to say a great deal more than is necessary to convey my meaning .

		I do not say anything which I do not really mean .

		But I like to put my meaning in a vivid and striking way , -- to expatiate upon my feelings ; it may not be the best way , but it happens to be my way , and it is not a bad way ; only what I say is not to be read with a micro - scope . ''

		The essential thing , then , is that the letter - writer should take a lively interest in his own life , however uneventful , and impart this in - terest to his reader .

		Little things are usually more significant than big .

		The best letter - writers have led lives devoid , outwardly , of stirring incidents .

		It is the inner life that signifies .

		Eugenie de
Guerin	PERSON	had nothing but the unfolding of her soul to chronicle for her brother 's reading ; but that was enough .

		Can anything exceed in interest the pulsing thought of a human brain , the throbbing emotions of a human heart ?

		In letters we seem to get nearer to the writer 's intimate self than in any other form of literature , unless it be now and then in lyric poetry .

		The good letter excels both in the skill with which its writer handles his me - dium of expression and in the self-revelation which so arrests the reader 's attention that he loses sight of that medium and seems to stand face to face with the writer .

		Without con - scious effort the fine qualities of a perfect style escape notice , which is occupied with the thing told , and not with the manner of its telling .

		A word now in defense of the good old fashion of making a graceful exit at the end of one 's letter .

		The letter that comes to so sudden a stop as to hurl the reader forward onto his nose leaves a less happy final impression than the one that ends less abruptly .

		To be at once suave and sincere in one 's parting com - pliments is the thing to aim at .

		Suavity un - doubtedly predominated in the courtly endings of eighteenth-century letters .

		But honesty and elegance were sometimes combined .

		It is a never-failing delight to read that famous let - ter , proud at once and reproachful , from Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	to
Lord Chesterfield	LOCATION	.


Boswell	PERSON	praised it as a literary masterpiece .

		Its conclusion is so happily worded as to excuse its reproduction here , familiar though it must be to most readers . ''

		Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favorer of learning , I shall not be dis - appointed though I shall conclude it , if less be possible , with less ; for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope , in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation . ''

		My Lord , your lordship 's most humble , '' Most obedient servant , `` Sam .

		Johnson . ''

		Another neatly-turned ending is found in that pithy and pungent communication from
Frank	PERSON	- lin to his old friend
Strahan	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	, on the outbreak of our Revolution , -- '' You have begun to burn our towns , and murder our people .

		Look upon your hands !

		They are stained with the blood of your relations !

		You and I were long friends ; you are now my enemy , and I am '' Yours , `` B. Franklin . ''

		Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	took commend - able pains not to conclude her letters so ab - ruptly as to jar her correspondents .

		Note in the following how cleverly she at once excuses and avoids precipitation .

		At the end of a letter dealing largely with the Babel of tongues heard by her in
Constantinople	LOCATION	, she writes : '' As I prefer English to all the rest , I am extremely mortified at the daily decay of it in my head , where I '11 assure you -LRB- with grief of heart -RRB- it is reduced to such a small number of words I can not recollect any tolerable phrase to conclude my letter with , and am forced to tell your ladyship , very bluntly , that I am , yours , etc. '' The artificiality here is too manifest and inten - tional and innocent to give offense .

		Not all of us know so well how and when to lift pen from paper .

		MORLET ' 8 LiIFE OF
GLADSTONE	LOCATION	.

		* In commenting on the difficulties of his task in writing a life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, Mr.
Morley	PERSON	acknowledges that he has found it wholly im - possible to treat in detail more than the polit - ical aspect of the career of one who was for over a half a century an important , and often a central figure , in wider English life .

		For
Gladstone	PERSON	was a theologian and churchman as well as a statesman . ''

		He cared as much for the church as he cared for the state ; he thought of the church as the soul of the state ; he believed the attainment by the magistrate of the ends of government to depend upon religion ; and he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to the religious strength and soundness of the community of which the state is a civil organ . ''

		This duality of interests -LRB- though
Gladstone	PERSON	would not have recognized it as such -RRB- consti - tutes the main problem of presentation which Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has striven to meet -- the problem of analyzing the political principles and actions of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, without permitting the essential spirituality of the man to be lost sight of in the maze of party struggles .

		His method of meet - ing it constitutes the distinctive feature of his work , and at the same time serves to make his three large volumes a genuine biographical characterization rather than a mere history of contemporary politics .

		For to-day men are interested most in what
Gladstone	PERSON	was , not in what he did , and in the present work the inter - est is in Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's estimate of the man , rather than in his resume of the man 's activities .

		Having excluded from his labor more than a superficial notice in passing , of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's religious and doctrinal writings , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's method of still impressing upon his reader this side of his hero 's character , is to show by quotation from
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's diary or let - ters , and by frequent repetitions of statement , the constant presence of religious sentiment and conviction in all political acts .

		Thus while yet a student at
Oxford	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	PERSON	writes in his diary -LRB-
December 29 , 1831	DATE	-RRB- , `` May God use me as a vessel for his own purposes , of whatever character and results in relation to myself , '' and was in truth very nearly convinced that his own best future lay in service as a min - ister of the church .

		A year later , when but * Thb Lifb ob
William Ewart Gladstone	PERSON	.

		By
John Morley	PERSON	.

		In three volumea .

		With portraits .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		twenty-three , unexpected opportunity brought him a seat in parliament , and of his own in - tense interest in the campaign preceding the election , he tells himself .

		`` I wish that I could hope my frame of mind had been in any degree removed from earth and brought nearer to heaven , that the habit of my mind had been imbued with something of that spirit which is not of this world . ''

		At first , indeed , politics seemed to him to be endangering his spiritual life , for after a brief experience of parliament he notes : '' Twenty-four years have I lived ... Where is the continuous work which ought to fill up the life of a
Chris	PERSON	- tian without intermission ?

		... I have been growing , that is certain ; in good or evil ?

		Much fluctuation ; after a supposed progress , terminating in finding myself at , or short of , the point which I deemed I had left behind me .

		Business and political excitement a tre - mendous trial , not so much alleviating as forcibly drag - ging down the soul from that temper which is fit to inhale the air of heaven . ''

		Intensity of religious feeling , then , was a vital necessity to
Gladstone	PERSON	, both in his early career and always .

		He looked for direct divine aid and inspiration in every act of his political life .

		`` Spoke 30 to 35 minutes on University bill , with more ease than I had hoped , having been more mindful , or less unmindful of Divine aid . ''

		-LRB-
July 11 , 1834	DATE	. -RRB- ''

		Spoke on the Irish church -- under forty minutes .

		I can not help here recording that this matter of speaking is really my strongest religious exercise .

		On all occa - sions , and to-day especially , was forced upon me the humiliating sense of my inability to exercise my reason in the face of the H. of C , and of the necessity of my utterly failing , unless God gave me the strength and language .

		It was after all a poor performance , but would have been poorer had He never been in my thoughts as a present and powerful aid '' -LRB-
May 30 , 1835	DATE	-RRB- .

		This confidence in divine aid naturally rested on the conviction that in each case the cause to be plead was in itself just and righteous , and in - tensity of religious conviction , whatever else may be said of it , was an unquestionable source of strength in the energy with which he sought to give life to his political ideals .

		Well has Mr.
Morley	PERSON	said of him : '' All his activities were in his own mind one .

		This , we can hardly repeat too often , is the fundamental fact of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's history .

		Political life was only part of his religious life .

		It was religion that prompted his literary life .

		It was religious motive that , through a thousand avenues and channels , stirred him and guided him in his whole conception of active social duty . ''

		And this was as true of his later as of his earlier years , for in
1868	DATE	, on his birthday , the day on which each year he seems to strike a balance of his activities and progress , he notes : * This birthday opens my sixtieth year .

		I descend the hill of life .

		It would be a truer figure to say I ascend a steepening path with a burden of ever gath -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 411 ering weight .

		The Almighty seems to sustain and spare me for some purpose of His own , deeply unworthy as I know myself to be .

		Glory be to His name . ''

		Postulating , then , this one great central char - acteristic , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	further furnishes a de - tailed analysis of various elements constituting
Gladstone	PERSON	's personality .

		Briefly stated , these were : bodily strength , permitting the full play of a magnificent intellect ; strength of will and definiteness of purpose ; political courage , not merely to stand by his political opinions under censure , but to venture on new and untried ground in the full confidence that his ideas would soon meet acceptance even if at first in - volving political disaster ; a real human inter - est in his fellow men -LRB- a quality which Mr.
Morley	PERSON	asserts , though acknowledging that he is expressing a disputed opinion -RRB- ; impetuosity , controlled by a sense of his own shortcomings and by prayer ; genuine oratory , both natural and studied , and for the first thirty years of his career customarily exercised in parliament , where mere words without logic and conviction could not have prevailed ; hatred of injustice , tempered in action by the knowledge that evil conditions must wait their remedy until the time is ripe ; too great a readiness to believe in the sincerity of others ; steady attraction to the practical and feasible , rather than the ideal , in legislation ; unchangeable mental attitude toward religious dogma ; lack of comprehen - sion in things metaphysical and abstract ; per - sonal good manners and courtesy ; and , finally , a deep religious feeling of responsibility for his talents , without any trace of purely per - sonal ambition .

		The qualities thus grouped by Mr.
Morley	PERSON	are in the main those which , at various times and by different writers , have been separately ascribed to
Gladstone	LOCATION	, saving only that of the dominating religious element , which Mr.
Morley	PERSON	is the first to prove con - clusively .

		But there remains the question of consistency , which
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's opponents have always denied to him , drawing a line between sincerity and consistency .

		These argue that while perfectly sincere in each crisis of his career , and in each political act ,
Gladstone	PERSON	was frequently wholly inconsistent , and moreover that he always refused to recognize his own face-about on vital questions .

		In other words , that while he was sincere in believing himself consistent , this was a distinct failing in his char - acter , though a real strength in political life .

		Of this Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has little to say , and by his silence gives some ground for the accusa - tion itself .

		Gladstone 's speeches abounded in conditional clauses , which frequently permitted * him to escape from the consequences of his - own logic , and which , unnoticed by parliamen - tary opponents in the heat of debate , often tripped up those opponents who sought to pin -
Gladstone	PERSON	down to an admission of inconsisr - tency .

		These very conditional clauses , how - ever , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	considers as evidence , not of a fear of exact statement , but of a certain slow - ness of grasp , combined with a desire to be fair , which he represents as characteristic ofc
Gladstone	PERSON	's political evolution .

		For Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- ley does not deny that
Gladstone	PERSON	changed materially in political sentiment from time to time , terming him a `` wonderful pilgrim '' on a `` shining progress , '' and
Gladstone	PERSON	himself in an autobiographical fragment , never printed , .

		but here frequently quoted by the author , seems to look with something like wonder on his ear - liest political conceptions .

		Any estimate of the character of
Gladstone	PERSON	as shown in his political acts , inevitably in - volves at least an indirect comparison with those leaders of opposing parties , who were contemporaneous .

		There were many such , but in public opinion no one occupied the position of an essential rival , in the same way as did Disraeli .

		Both made their first impression upon parliament as members of the Tory party , though very early owning allegiance to oppo - site wings of that party after the split which followed the repeal of the corn laws .

		For fully ten years after this event
Gladstone	PERSON	felt himself a Tory , and it is evident from Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's resume that he long considered the possibility of a reunion of the party under
Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		One great obstacle was Disraeli , , whose leadership in the Commons would have - been personally distasteful to
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and - whose integrity
Gladstone	PERSON	could never bring himself to believe in .

		Added to natural po - litical opposition , there was evidently in each a total inability to appreciate the other 's ideals and character .

		A real though veiled personal dislike accentuated the issues between them , and it is interesting , if not wholly instructive , to note the few instances in which
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	is .

		here permitted to state his impressions of his great rival .

		Writing to his wife in
1850	DATE	of a debate in the Commons he says : ''
Disraeli	PERSON	showed the marvellous talent that he has for summing up with brilliancy , buoyancy , and com - prehensiveness , at the close of a debate .

		You have heard me speak of that talent before when I have been wholly against him ; but never , last night or any other time , would I go to him for conviction , but for the de - light of the ear and the fancy . ''

		412 THE DIAL -LSB- Dee .

		1 , In
1852	DATE	, in a letter to Lord Aberdeen refer - ring to the acts of the Tory party under
Derby	ORGANIZATION	, on the questions of protection and re - ligious liberty ,
Gladstone	PERSON	is more direct in accusation . ''

		The shifting and shuffling that I complain of have ` been due partly to a miserably false position and the giddy prominence of inferior men ; partly to the -LRB- surely .

		not unexpected -RRB- unscrupulousness and second motives • of Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	, at once the necessity of Lord Derby .

		and the curse . ''

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	is himself too much of the Glad - Etonian type to be able to appreciate to the tfull the real constructive genius of Disraeli , `` fantastic in form and expression though it frequently was .

		To Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, as to Glad - stone , the trifling of Disraeli on serious topics appears an unforgiveable sin , and he asserts .

		that such trifling `` though it may divert a Hater generation to whose legislative bills it ■ can do no harm , helps to explain the deep dis - favor with which
Disraeli	PERSON	was regarded by his • severe and strenuous opponent . ''

		That Dis - raeli had political genius of a high order , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	freely admits , as when Disraeli appreciated , earlier than any other man , the development of a great national interest in British empire and in social questions . ''

		This coming mood the Tory leader , with his rare faculty of wide and sweeping forecast , confidently di - vined , and he found for it the oracle of a party cry in phrases about Empire and Social Reform .

		When power fell into his hands he made no single move of solid effect for either social reform or imperial unity .

		When Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	committed himself to a policy , he brought in bills to carry it out .

		Forecast without bills is in - teresting , but not to be trusted . ''

		This is the customary judgment of English liberals in comparing the two men .

		Gladstone is lauded for his actual and practical legisla - tion , and
Disraeli	PERSON	belittled for his lack of it .

		But , in fact , sufficient time has not yet passed to permit any sure judgment .

		Immediate pos - terity may regard exact and constructive acts of legislation as the basis of a statesman 's claim to fame , but if the reputation of men famous at a more remote period of history is any cri - terion , it is rather upon a genius and ability for constructive principles , not specific acts , that a true claim to fame rests .

		In a career so full of incident as that of
Gladstone	PERSON	's , it is wholly impossible to select any two or three events of superior importance , and it is not intended therefore to specify here any such for particular notice .

		Home rule naturally occupies a large part of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's attention in his third volume , but the discussion given to it is far too intricate to permit brief analysis , though it may be noted , in passing , that
Gladstone	PERSON	is energetically defended against the charge of a sudden face-about and surren - der to
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	in
1886	DATE	.

		But there is one inci - dent that will be of great interest to students of American history .

		Gladstone , as is well known , was a sympathizer , though in no sense a partisan , of the South in the Civil War .

		In this connection Mr.
Morley	PERSON	says : '' Of this immense conflict Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, like most of the leading statesmen of the time , and like the majority of his countrymen , failed to take the true measure .

		The error that lay at the root of our En - glish misconception of the American struggle is now clear .

		We applied ordinary political maxims to what was not merely a political contest , but a social revolu - tion .

		Without scrutiny of the cardinal realities be - neath , we discussed it like some superficial conflict in our old world about boundaries , successions , territorial partitions , dynastic preponderance . ''

		Viewing the struggle in this light , and much more interested at the moment in Italian than in American affairs ,
Gladstone	PERSON	failed to see any moral issue at stake .

		Many Englishmen had no interest in the American conflict save as it affected commercial and industrial conditions at home , and it was in this way that the con - flict appealed to
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	shows us , it is true , that
Gladstone	PERSON	argued in Cabinet against the first sharp note drawn up by Pal - merston in regard to the Trent affair , and that presumably he also urged his objections to the Queen and to the
Prince Consort	ORGANIZATION	.

		The infer - ence is that these objections were of influence in producing those suggestions from the Queen which modified
Palmerston	LOCATION	's note , but the basis of
Gladstone	PERSON	's objections was not in any sym - pathy with this country ; it was that `` I could not feel sure that we were at the bottom of the law of the case , or could judge here and now what form it would assume . ''

		Gladstone was in fact anxious to have his government inter - fere in some way and put an end to the conflict , while the only feasible end , in his mind , was the separation of North and South .

		In
1862	DATE
Palmerston	ORGANIZATION	wrote to him that a movement was on foot by which
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	were to offer mediation to the contending par - ties , and that if both
North and South	LOCATION	accepted this , an armistice would follow and negotia - tions on the basis of separation ; while if both declined , the mediating powers would acknowl - edge the independence of the South .

		Glad - stone was heartily in favor of this plan , but curiously enough was himself largely respon - sible for thwarting it .

		He was at
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	at the time , and in a speech evidently premature
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 413 and unconsidered , he practically disclosed what he believed to be the determination of the
Cabi	PERSON	- net . ''

		We know quite well that the people of the
Northern States	LOCATION	have not yet drank of the cup -- they are still trying to hold it far from their lips -- which all the rest of the world see they nevertheless must drink of .

		We may have our own opinions about slavery ; we may be for or against the South ; but there is no doubt that
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	and other leaders of the South have made an army ; they are making , it appears , a navy ; and they have made what is more than either , they have made a nation . ''

		Gladstone quickly found himself in difficul - ties both with the public and with his fellow - ministers .

		Russell wrote to him : '' ... You mast allow me to say that I think you went beyond the latitude which all speakers must be allowed , when you said that
Jeff	PERSON	.


Davis	PERSON	had made a nation .

		Recognition would seem to follow , and for that step I think the cabinet is not prepared .

		However , we shall soon meet to discuss this very topic . ''

		Very naturally
Gladstone	PERSON	was now urged both by conviction and by pride to press for an offer of mediation , and became most energetic in this object .

		The question came to an issue in the Cabinet in
November of 1862	DATE	, when the English government was forced to answer a suggestion from
France	LOCATION	that a joint offer of mediation be made .


Russia	LOCATION	had already de - clined .

		Gladstone writes home at this time : ``
Nov. 11	DATE	.

		We have had our cabinet today and meet again tomorrow .

		I am afraid that we shall do little or nothing in the business of
America	LOCATION	.

		But I will send you definite intelligence .

		Both
Lords Palmerston	LOCATION	and
Russell	PERSON	are right .

		--
Nov. 12	DATE	.

		The
United States	LOCATION	affair has ended and not well .

		Lord
Russell	PERSON	rather turned tail .

		He gave way without resolutely fighting out his battle .

		However , though we decline for the moment , the answer is put upon grounds and in terms which leave the matter very open for the future . ''

		Of the various causes which brought about this change in Cabinet opinion , the tempest aroused by
Gladstone 's Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	speech was by far the greatest .

		In his later career
Gladstone	PERSON	often freely confessed his great error of judgment in regard to the then existing political situation in
America	LOCATION	, and professed also an error of sympathy in the struggle itself .

		These comments on some few characteristics of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's work do not adequately repre - sent either the magnitude of the work itself or the ability of the author .

		It is certainly not over-praise to say that no other such thorough , scholarly , and interesting biography has ap - peared in recent years .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	is without question gifted in biographical writing , as his life of
Cobden	PERSON	, issued in
1881	DATE	, abundantly proved ; but even this earlier notable work , when compared in point of style , method of treatment , and historical insight , with the present work , seems weak and insufficient .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has put his best into this Life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		His fitness for the task was pre - eminent , both from an evident sympathy with and belief in
Gladstone	LOCATION	himself , and from an intimate personal acquaintance in
Gladstone	LOCATION	's later life -- an acquaintance which has per - mitted the inclusion in the work of many re - ports of delightful conversations on literary and other non-political topics .

		It is true that too great sympathy is in danger of becoming ex - treme bias , and so may render a biographer unfit rather than fit for his work .

		Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- ley 's own explanation on this point best repre - sents his conception of his duty . ''

		That my book should be a biography without a trace of bias , no reader will expect .

		There is at least no bias against the truth ; but indifferent neutrality in a work produced , as this is , in the spirit of loyal and affectionate remembrance , would be distasteful , discord - ant , and impossible .

		I should be heartily sorry if there were no signs of partiality and no evidence of prepos - session .

		On the other band there is , I trust , no importu - nate advocacy or tedious assentation . ''

		For the reasons here indicated it is perfectly possible that some of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's historical interpretations , particularly in the later period , may be attacked on grounds of accuracy .

		But considering the political and social relations of the two men , it is difficult to see how the biog - rapher 's task could have been approached , or concluded , in a fairer spirit .

Joline	PERSON	's sanction in assuming that criticism should con - cern itself not only with the thing said , but also with the author 's way of saying it .

		Still , he somewhat disarms criticism by his remarks on the subject of book-reviews . ''

		Laying aside those which are palpably advertise - ments in the guise of criticism , one will find the reviewer in ecstacies over that which his fellow-reviewer feels obliged to treat with contempt or severity .

		It has never been otherwise in the history of literature .

		Reduced to a truism , it is all a matter of taste .

		... It is quite likely that some solemn person may say my remarks are lacking in good taste ; which , correctly defined , is what some people think that every one else ought to think .

		... Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	says of some of his utterances that they are `` egoistic ' ' To be egoistic , ' he tells us , ' is not to be egotistic .

		Egoism should be distinguished from egotism .

		The egoist offers his thought to his fellow men , the egotist thinks it is the only thought worth their acceptance . '

		I plead guilty to the most pronounced egoism .

		It is wholly immaterial to me whether any one accepts my thoughts .

		If I am right , it is not my fault , but the reader 's misfortune if he refuses to accept them ; if I am wrong it is better for all that they should not be accepted . ''

		There is a tradition in a college town that a professor was once questioned at an evening party as to the meaning of a word in Byzantine Greek .

		Turning to his questioner he slowly asked : ''
Madam	PERSON	, is this for information or for conversation ? ''

		And this is precisely the inquiry we are sometimes inclined to put to Mr.
Joline	PERSON	.

		Speaking of American humor , the author points out that if anyone cares to encounter a real Yankee , he is more likely to find him in
Lowell	LOCATION	's ''
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' or the pages of ``
Artemus Ward	PERSON	, '' than in the works of `` Major Jack Downing '' or `` Sam Slick '' -LRB-
Haliburton	LOCATION	-RRB- , -- the latter of whom he calls a pseudo-humorist of the callow age of American literature .

		We can not agree with him entirely when he would have us accept as truth the assertion that , as a nation , we are dangerously near to being decadent in humor ; though we , likewise , question the dubious fun of our pro- fessional comic papers and the jocosity of American dailies . ''

		There are sundry illusions , cherished for generations , regarding certain nations and races .

		The roast beef of old
England	LOCATION	may long ago have been worthy of glori - fication in song and story , but in modern times it is usually transported from
Chicago	LOCATION	across the ocean , and it is by no means as good as English mutton .

		The politeness of the Frenchman is a delusive shadow of a vanished past , as one who has been rudely thrust into a Parisian gutter by a swaggering officer in soiled uni - form is ready to attest .

		The Swedes seem to have taken to themselves the famous French courtesy when they borrowed
Bernadotte	PERSON	in order to place the marshal of
Napoleon	PERSON	upon the throne of
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	.

		The corpulent German , with his huge pipe , his towering stein of beer , and his elongated dachshund , I have en - countered more frequently in the many-colored pages of ' Puck ' and ' Judge ' than in the domains of the War - Lord .

		Is the celebrated American humor another departed dream ? ''

		In further proof he would have us dissect the stories in our
Sunday	DATE	newspapers -- '' no such awful examples of vulgarity , such dilapidated relics of bygone times , such puerile specimens of playful idiocy , could ever be palmed off successfully upon a people capable of appre - ciating true and original wit . ''

		Let the right - eousness of his indignation be the excuse for his vituperation !

		Touching upon dramatic literature , et cetera , we are reminded that play-goers of this genera - tion would stare in dissatisfied astonishment at the plays and players of forty years ago -- as the luxurious Roman who sat in bored silence through the Heauton-Timoroumenos of the popular Publius Terentius Afer may have regretted '' The Frogs '' of Aristophanes . ''

		Our revered fathers used to shake their heads even at
Wallack	PERSON	and thought that all the dramatic perform - ances of the sixties were degenerate .

		So we have with us even now the praisers of past times who sneer at
Ternina	LOCATION	, and
Nordica	ORGANIZATION	, and
Melba	PERSON	, and tell us how much better
Jenny Lind	PERSON	was , and how infinitely superior the piping tones of
Mario	PERSON	were to the manly notes of
Jean de Reszke	ORGANIZATION	.

		We gray-bearded devotees of reminiscence easily recall the alleged wickedness of a certain play called ' The Black Crook , ' wherein the loveliness of the female form divine was displayed in a liberal , gorgeous and spectacular fashion ; but when we compare it with the present day productions of burlesques and operettas , the light artillery of the drama , the old show seems almost Diana-like in its modesty .

		Whither are we tending ?

		When I dream of what may come three decades hence I am inclined to hide myself in the re - tired precints of the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	and blush furiously .

		It is all a matter of custom , but I can not help feeling a sense of sorrow at the decline of good taste when I

		THE DIAL 415 put in parallel columns the coarse and common crudi - ties of
Weber	PERSON	and Fields and the sweet dignity of the plays which used to fill the old
Wallack Theater	ORGANIZATION	with crowds of cultured people .

		Yet I go to
Weber	PERSON	and Fields , and I laugh at their ridiculous antics , while at home I sigh over the decline of the theater and mourn over the departed glories of the legitimate drama . ''

		There is always a piquancy to those remarks in which a writer is visibly striving to discover why he is magnetically attracted by what his intellect condemns .

		We are compelled to state that the chapter entitled '' Of
American Novelists	ORGANIZATION	and of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, with Some Remarks about Criticism '' strikes us as hardly adequate to the theme .

		After reading it one is apt to say , as
Carlyle	PERSON	said after reading
Hegel	PERSON	, that one has often enough been over this road before , but never with a chain and ball at one 's ankle .

		Now and then Mr.
Joline	PERSON	indulges in a quiet little pasquinade at the expense of writers of history ; still , accuracy in history , according to Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, is a fond delusion -- the historian is merely a prosy pedant or a decora - tive falsifier .

		The chapter on '' Gas-logs and the Private Library '' forces one to the conclu - sion that , after all , cosmopolitan
New York	LOCATION	is to be regarded as more favorable to gracefully witty small-talk than the air of the
London	LOCATION	drawing-room or the thinner and more crystal - line atmosphere of the
Paris	LOCATION	salon .

		In speaking of novels and literary asso - ciation , the author quotes a story of
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	to the effect that a worthy citi - zen of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, who settled his quarterly accounts with unfailing punctuality , always de - ducted fifteen per cent on the ground that he had been intimate with Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		The vast majority of the readers of the present generation occupy themselves principally with what are called `` novels '' -- or `` history that did n't happen , '' as they are styled by that admirable historian ,
John Richard Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		* ' These sweets , '' says Mr.
Joline	PERSON	, `` have always appealed to the palate of mankind from the days of Boccaccio and of Marguerite de Na - varre to those of
Hall Caine	PERSON	and Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		I do not wish to be understood as giving to
Boccaccio	PERSON	the title of first of the novelists or to
Parker	PERSON	the distinction of being the last of them , although the lively
M.P.	LOCATION	has apparently acquired a right of way to the seats of the mighty . ''

		Quod bene notandum I We have touched upon a small portion only of these chatty '' Diversions . ''

		Their author has the faculty -- a faculty curiously rare -- of talking with his pen ; this pen-talk , to be sure , would be a trifle more interesting if a little less iconoclastic .

		Chapters on books , authors , fine bindings , and curious editions are interwoven with anecdotes and stories in the narrative , and all go to make up a volume which every book - lover must find entertaining and in some degree instructive .

		The
New Orthodoxy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The publishers advertise Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	's book on '' Ultimate Conceptions of Faith '' as '' a comprehensive statement of the working the - ology of one of the foremost representatives of the liberal orthodoxy of today . ''

		Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	is minister of the Old South Church ,
Boston	LOCATION	, and a leading exponent of the opinions of the more radical wing of the Congregational de - nomination .

		He frankly recognizes the down - fall of the old orthodoxy in the minds of thoughtful people , and the utter impossibility of reconciling some of the ancient dogmas with modern science , or even with modern morality or common-sense .

		So far from deploring all this , he rejoices in it , and believes it necessary for the purification of religion .

		When we were required to accept the
Bible	LOCATION	, word for word , as the inspired work of God , we were justly exposed to the ridicule and contempt of the enemies of religion .

		What a strange mixture of truth and fiction , of good morals and sav - agery , had we adopted !

		What heroes and heroines of those ancient days demanded our reverence !

		Only our colossal stupidity could excuse us , -- we knew no better .

		Yet , after all , we did know a little better than that .

		Forgetting the logical outcome of our professed creed , we did instinctively seek out the good and hold by it .

		The attitude of the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	toward the
Bible	LOCATION	is in itself a recognition of the absurdity of the situation ; the writings are infallible , but you must not take them at their face-value , they must be interpreted : -- of course .

		But now it is different .

		The new faith sees in the Bible the hand of God , interpreted by the mind of man .

		Recognizing the alloy , the gen - uineness of the gold is the more apparent .

		We have the story of a great nation illuminated by spiritual insight ; it is for us to discern the thread of precious metal woven into its sub - stance .

		It does not matter what history may now reveal ; the thing is proof of itself .

		416 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, scbool-boy is reputed to have said that `` the works of Homer were not written by Homer , but by another man of the same name . ''

		It is all the same ; and if you can prove that Jesus Christ or
William Shakespeare	PERSON	did not exist , there are the gospels and the plays .

		As the
Bible	LOCATION	is proof of its own validity as a source of light , so in mankind is found the true testimony to the existence of God .

		The subjective workings of the human mind result in the formation of ideals , and when these are believed in , we have the beginning of the idea of God .

		As understood by us , God is the per - sonification of our best ideal .

		That he is more than this , Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	frankly recognizes , for the human mind has its limitations , the great - ness of which modern science daily emphasizes .

		The argument here presented has an exact parallel on the objective side .

		The things we see and feel are believed by us to have genuine reality , although in fact we know only that we experience certain sensations .

		Moreover , we are assured that the facts thus demonstrated to us are not all the facts ; there are vast realms of objective reality concerning which we have no sensations , and never can have any , as we are at present organized .

		There is a common saying : `` One man , with God , is a majority . ''

		The true believer in the validity and reality of his ideal will die for it , and his death is not a defeat , but a triumph .

		So it was with
Jesus Christ	ORGANIZATION	; through shameful death came glorious victory ; -- a sufficient reason in itself for the event , -- a demonstration for all the ages of the supreme worth of things spiritual .

		Against all this it may be said that the truly modest and wise man is he who does not thus glorify the image he has made , not with his hands , but with his mind .

		If he is thoughtful , he must know that it is imperfect , and that others are wiser than himself .

		Should he not therefore , submit to guidance ; get his religion second-hand , as it were ?

		It is a plausible ar - gument , but it breaks down if , as religious peo - ple in all ages have believed , there is a better source of spiritual power in communion be - tween the individual and his God .

		Just as the modern scientist goes first to nature , and only to books when nature is not available , so the religious man may seek his insight from God , nor be ashamed of so doing .

		To a materialist , this will doubtless seem absurd ; but it is nev - ertheless an objective fact of history that the great men who have moved the world to better things have above all things been believers in the reality of the ideal .

		Perhaps the greatest advance of the new orthodoxy -LRB- if here it be truly orthodox -RRB- is in its conception of Jesus .

		According to Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	, he is but returning to the old ortho - doxy , for he says -LRB- p. 292 -RRB- : '' The preexistence of Jesus I do not find in the teaching of the great theologians , with the exception of Origen , and he teaches the preexistence of all soul .

		It is not Jesus who preexists before his advent ; it is the Logos , the
Christ	LOCATION	, the eternal Son who preexists . ''

		In other words , we have in Jesus the vehicle of the Word , the perfectly transparent window of
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, through which the spirit of God shines with undimished brilliance .

		But as it seems to me , there is here no radical difference from the rest of humanity ; it is a matter of degree rather than of kind .

		Many men have shown spiritual insight in preeminent degrees , all probably have it in some degree ; but
Jesus	LOCATION	was the perfect jewel without a flaw .

		Even this last opinion may well need amendment , for after all , is not such perfection inconsistent with human nature , and is not the story of the temptation a demonstration of the fact that Jesus had to struggle with his own baser ele - ments like the rest of us ?

		But here we are going beyond our author .

		Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	supports the doctrine of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	with the observation that God is neces - sarily parallel to humanity , and therefore must be a social being . ''

		He is not an eternal egoist in eternal isolation '' -LRB- p. 370 -RRB- .

		`` The contest today is between God as an eternal egoist and God as an eternal socialist .

		If God is an eternal egoist He is the contradiction of humanity ; and as history shows , the distance from deism to athe - ism , from an unmeaning God to no God at all , is short .

		If God is an eternal socialist , He is in himself the ground and hope of mankind '' -LRB- p. 374 -RRB- .

		A species of polytheism -LRB- though the term would not be admitted -RRB- seems to be the out - come of the argument , only the plural God - head is in perfect harmony with itself , and by virtue of that fact a unit .

		Thus is the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	explained .

		The permanence of matter and energy , on the objective side , have become axiomatic in science .

		The conviction of the reality of our spiritual being leads us to the idea of immor - tality , which is as much a corner-stone of the new faith as it ever was of the old .

		Says Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	-LRB- p. 167 -RRB- , the '' reciprocity between God and man , whether in terms of love , as in the case of all the holy , or in terms of dis - cipline , as with all defiant souls , would appear to authenticate the immortality of man . ''

		And moreover , `` death is one of the hardest facts

		THE DIAL 41T with which optimism has to deal .

		By itself it seems to me fatal .

		Death as a finality is the supreme sarcasm upon life '' -LRB- p. 229 -RRB- .

		As
Tennyson	PERSON	has it , -- '' Why should we bear with an hour of torture , a moment of pain , If every man die for ever , if all his griefs are in vain , And the homeless planet at length will be wheel 'd thro ' the silence of space , Motherless evermore of an ever - vanishing race , When the worm shall have writhed its last , and its last brother worm will have fled From the dead fossil skull that is left in the rocks of an earth that is dead ? ''

		For the rest , the book is full of interesting thoughts , though its literary form does not seem to me good .

		There is too much of the preacher 's mannerism , which exhibits itself in the repe - tition of the same thing in innumerable dif - ferent ways .

		One is reminded a little of the sailor who boasted that he could swear for ten minutes without using the same word twice .

		On page 137 , Dr.
W. G. Ward	PERSON	is curiously referred to as '' a Mr.
Ward	PERSON	, a minor person in the Oxford movement . ''

		Fox , and his Part m English Politics .

		* In the preface to his political study of
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	discloses his attitude toward his subject in the state - ment that he '' is one of the many readers in whom Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	's
Early Life of Charles James Fox	ORGANIZATION	excited a sentiment which it is perhaps not an exaggeration to describe as a personal affection for the great Whig statesman , '' and that the book '' is an attempt to portray the great ideas that Fox stood for , to vindicate the essential consistency of his career , and to appreciate the magnanimous inspirations he gave to politics . ''

		He says fur - ther , after stating the great questions of the period : '' These questions call for a minute treatment in a presentation of Fox as the champion , during the frenzied years of panic , of government by public discussion , and as one of the few Whigs who anticipated the great Liberal doctrine of national rights . ''

		This minute treatment he pursues through three hundred and fifty pages , devoting one or two chapters to each great aspect of the struggle against the policy of the king .

		It is unfortunate , from the point of view of •

		a forcible presentation of the career of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, that the stage was occupied , during the greater part of the time included in this study , hy
William Pitt	PERSON	the Younger as Prime Minister , , while Fox was not only in opposition , but was hated by the king as no other statesman of the time was hated ; and that he had also , by his foolish coalition with North , forfeited a large * part of his influence with the people .

		Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	, as a partisan of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, is less than fair to his great rival ; and the constant criti - cism and repeated denunciation of
Pitt	PERSON	, and of nearly all that he did , weaken the otherwise able and convincing presentation of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		One should read with this some book like Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	's life of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	, which gives another interpretation of the policy of the great minister .

		It may also be said that Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	, writing for English students of their own history , assumes a knowledge of the details of the political history of the times that makes the book hard reading for any except special students .

		After an excellent preliminary chapter , in which the author gives a summary of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's life to
1782	DATE	, setting forth briefly his youthful escapades , the recklessness and blunders that marred his career , and the fine qualities of the man , the relations of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	to the king are dis - cussed in two chapters of forty pages .

		They include a description of the king 's policy of personal government , and of the disgraceful methods that he used to gain his ends ; an account of the short-lived Rockingham min - istry of
1782	DATE	, and the effective blows that it struck at the king 's power ; and a discussion of the
Coalition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	labors val - iantly to show that Fox 's motives were credit - able , even though he must condemn his judg - ment .

		But it takes more convincing special pleading than the author gives to make us will - ing to free Fox from blame for joining hands , without any justification on the ground of a national crisis , with the man against whom he had been thundering for years as the incarna - tion of all that was vicious in politics .

		Fox never regained the influence that he thus wan - tonly threw away .

		After two chapters on Parliamentary Re - form and The Reign of Terror , which seem to - have been written to show up
Pitt	PERSON	, the pro- fessed reformer , as faithless to his principles , we have two on
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, giving the melancholy story of the years between the granting of parliamentary independence and the shameful purchase of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, chief actors in the first part are G rattan ,
Burke	PERSON	, and
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, all devoted to the Irish cause .

		But with the advent of
Pitt	PERSON	's govern - ment , relations became steadily worse , owing largely to the king 's opposition to
Ireland	LOCATION	; suspicion and hatred followed quickly upon the burst of gratitude that accompanied the gift of independence , culminating in the terrible outrages of the Rebellion .

		Pitt can not be cleared of blame for giving up so easily and so fully to the king 's prejudices ; but
Fox	ORGANIZATION	was also blameworthy in allowing party spirit to dominate him in his opposition to the Com - mercial Propositions of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	, a measure based on modern economic principles that
Fox	PERSON	did not understand , thus joining interested mono - polists and manufacturers to thwart the en - lightened efforts of the great minister .

		Fox `` lid indeed stand here for the spirit of freedom , as he did through all his career ; but
Pitt	PERSON	had almost insuperable difficulties to surmount , in the king whom he served , and in the absorbing questions connected with the French Revolu - tion and the wars with
France	LOCATION	.

		American readers will be especially inter - ested in the chapter on Colonies and
Depen	PERSON	- dencies , for in it Fox is shown as dealing his strongest blows for freedom , in company with
Burke	PERSON	and
Chatham	LOCATION	, against the policy of En - gland in her treatment of the American colo - `` ifes .

		The shadow of the Coalition had not yet covered him , and , though his views of trade were those of his time , he was ahead of his time in seeing '' that it should be the sovereign end of British statesmanship to empty the re - lationship between the colonies and the mother country of any notion that would do violence to the self-respect of the former . ''

		He knew that the cause of colonial freedom was the cause of English freedom .

		The same spirit he carried into his dealings with
India	LOCATION	; and hie made a noble struggle against the slave - trade , having the satisfaction in his last days of carrying into effect two acts that practically abolished it .

		The remaining chapters of the book take up
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's relations to the French Revolution , in several chapters , showing him to have been a consistent advocate of the principle of the right of a nation to settle its own affairs .

		Burke opposed the Revolution with the utmost vio - lence , because he saw that in destroying the old order '' the enthusiasts who were impro - vising a constitution were making a highway for a usurper . ''

		Fox saw that the old order was bad , that it was already broken , and that its ruin opened the way for the people to secure their rights .

		In advocating the right of
France	LOCATION	to decide for herself whether she would have a Bourbon to reign over her , and the right of every nation to settle its own internal prob - lems , he voiced one of the leading principles of the nineteenth century , during which this spirit of nationality has created two great na - tions and others have made desperate efforts to come into complete existence .

		An interesting account is given , in the last chapter , of the efforts that were made while Fox was in public life to mitigate the un - reasonable and unrighteous abuses which all suffered who were not in accord with the Estab - lished Church .

		In all these efforts , Fox helped vigorously as a consistent champion of tolera - tion and equality .

		Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	closes with these words : '' If he fought relentlessly against all the sophistries by which statesmen who dis - owned persecution still perpetuated the intol - erance of the dead , it was just because no statesman had combined so passionately as he respect for the rights of man with respect for the rights of reason .

		It was a book neither original nor profound , and it made no pretence of being either the one or the other ; but it was marked by reverence for the poet , and by a deep sense of gratitude for his spir - itual guidance .

		It seemed to be the report of one who had just discovered
Dante	PERSON	for himself , and was eager to share the new inspiration with his fellows .

		Its enthusiasm had a naive quality that disarmed criticism , and it was a book at once so honest and so earnest that its helpfulness might be allowed even by those whom long study and great love had caused to search the volume of the divine poet through and through .

		THE DIAL 419 chief interest to us was in its unconscious reve - lation of the broadening influence exerted by the sacred song to which both heaven and earth had set their hand upon a mind still struggling in the meshes of a narrow conception of reli - gion , and instinctively groping toward a wider range and a freer outlook .

		The author of that volume now shows us that his studies in
Dante	LOCATION	have been continued to some purpose , and that his desire to help others along the same shin - ing path has not slackened .

		Under the title of '' Aids to the Study of Dante '' he has brought together in a second volume a well - considered selection of such documentary and critical matter as the beginner will find most useful in his studies .

		In the category of docu - ment , we have such things as the accounts of Boccaccio ,
Bruni	PERSON	, and the two Villanis , the Letter to
Can Grande	ORGANIZATION	, and excerpts from
Aquinas	PERSON	.

		In the critical category , we have lengthy passages from the essays by
Church	ORGANIZATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	, and treatments of special topics by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, Mr.
P. H. Wicksteed	PERSON	, Mr.
Edmund G. Gardner	PERSON	,
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	,
Signor	PERSON	Com - paretti , and others .

		The editor contributes notes , introductory paragraphs , and special chapters on Italian lyric before
Dante	PERSON	and on the '' Paradiso . ''

		There are also illustrations in the form of portraits and plans .

		In spite of the somewhat similar works of
Symonds	LOCATION	,
Scartazzini	LOCATION	, and
Maria Rossetti	PERSON	, there was room for such a book as this , and we are glad to accord it a welcome . ''

		Dante and his Time , '' by Dr.
Karl Federn	PERSON	, is a work of far more serious scholarship than the one just mentioned .

		In its present form , the work is not a mere translation , but '' a re - vised issue by the author himself in a foreign tongue of a work originally composed in his own . ''

		We are reminded of this fact by the English scholar , Mr.
Arthur John Butler	PERSON	, who contributes an introduction to the volume .

		Dr.
Federn	PERSON	takes for his text
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's saying that u in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's poem ten silent Christian centuries have found a voice , '' and endeavors , in a series of chapters preliminary to the discussion of the poet himself , to analyze the deposit left by those centuries upon the minds of men in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		In order to understand
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's thought , he tells us , '' We must know the remarkable men of this re - markable time , one must know what occupied them , how they looked upon the world and lived in it , what were their aims and what ways they took to carry them out , what they thought and believed , learned and taught , what seemed of importance to them in their lives , what happened in their world , its movements , its great struggles , its petty interests . ''

		All these things , and many more , are con - cisely and clearly discussed in the section of Dr.
Federn	PERSON	's work called '' The Time , '' the larger half of the volume .

		The chapters deal with such subjects as the destruction of the ancient civilization , the political and moral ideals of the Middle Ages , the secular conflict between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, the knowledge and literature of the time , and the special condi - tions surrounding a thirteenth century Flor - entine .

		All these matters are handled with unfailing interest , and with what wealth of illustration is possible within rather closely - restricted limits .

		Having thus prepared the way , the author comes to the second section of his book , which '' follows
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's path through that dim and distant world which to us is but half-illuminated -- the path of his life , which is the road to his works . ''

		The following im - pressive passage marks the transition from the one section to the other : ■ We shall find the same world through which until now we have walked in ever narrower circles , totally changed and altered in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's head .

		We shall find it arrayed as a wonderful , immense building ; we shall en - ter a cathedral , the foundations of which are laid in the depths of hell , and reflect all the horrors of those wild and cruel times in the terrible judgment which the wrathful Deity of mediaeval
Christendom	LOCATION	deals .

		Then we shall mount on serene and lucid stairs , leading on , through penitence to purification , to a splendour of daz - zling light , such as never poet before or after him knew how to evoke in men 's fancies , as painters may perhaps have dreamt but never known to paint .

		And in every part of this cathedral we shall encounter the men who lived in the world we have tried to describe , and from the howling yells deep below , through the slow , peni - tential chants of the stairs , np to the blessed choirs in the celestial space , there sounds one music of many - sounding harmonies , in which the voices of all speakers join -- the terze rime of Dante . ''

		To interpret the work of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	through the study of his life and environment is thus the task which the author has set himself , and which he has performed with sober and con - servative judgment , placing much stress upon the psychology of the poet as reflected in his writings .

		The central fact of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's inner life is one with that of
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	, a fact which Dr.
Federn	PERSON	clearly perceives .

		By what process of spiritual change could the poet of u Romeo and Juliet '' become the poet of ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and the poet of the ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	'' become the poet of the '' Divine Comedy '' ?

		As the author says , '' a sea of events and strange destinies had to roll by '' the poet before this revolution could be wrought .

Dec. 1	DATE	, formation is , of course , one that lies far beyond adequate explanation ; but it is something to have realized , as Dr.
Federn	PERSON	has done , that this is the problem , and to have touched upon its solution with much psychological insight , and a complete avoidance of pedantry .

		Mr.
W. J. Payling Wright	PERSON	's little book of '' Studies and Notes '' on ''
Dante	PERSON	and the Divine Comedy '' offers practically nothing in the way of research , but merely represents a few simple points of view that have been taken hundreds of times before , and gives elementary explanations of the leading facts of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's life and work .

		It is dictated by reverence , and , for the most part , by sympathy , although we find a jarring note in the opinion that in
Dante	LOCATION	's character '' there lurked a vein of innate ferocity . ''

		The author selects his mat - ters judiciously , and presents them in a sin - gularly lucid style .

		The first chapter , which sums up the historical significance and impli - cations of the battle of
Benevento	LOCATION	, is perhaps the most useful of them all .

		Dr.
Richard Thayer Holbrook	PERSON	has made a deeply-interesting study of the animal lore of the Middle Ages as reflected in the writings of
Dante	LOCATION	, and this work , entitled ''
Dante	PERSON	and the Animal Kingdom , '' appears as a publication of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Altogether ,
Dante	PERSON	men - tions about a hundred animals , real or legend - ary .

		These references occur most abundantly in the '' Convito '' and the '' De
Vulgari Elo	PERSON	- quentia , '' but those who are acquainted with the ''
Commedia	ORGANIZATION	'' alone will realize that the subject offers abundant material for investiga - tion .

		Dante made use of animals chiefly for imagery or symbolism , and we must not look to him for anything like a forecast of the mod - ern scientific spirit , but it is certainly interest - ing to search out his allusions to the animal kingdom for the light which they shed upon mediaeval notions of natural history .

		Doctor
Thayer	PERSON	's work is done with great thoroughness , and makes a copious use of quotations .

		The illustrations , some of them colored , are mostly from old manuscripts and designs , and add not a little to the value of the book .

		Besides ani - mals in our understanding of the term -- from the fungo marino to man -- we have all kinds of monsters , most of them grouped under the cate - gory of '' The Devil and his Brood . ''

		Here come
Charon	LOCATION	,
Minos	LOCATION	,
Geryon	PERSON	, and Lucifer , besides furies , harpies , and centaurs .

		The angels also receive treatment in a special chapter .

		There can hardly be a doubt that
Dante	PERSON	accepted these imaginations as realities .

		To affirm that he did not would , as the author remarks , '' betoken an inadequate knowledge of the age in which he lived .

		Whoever reads carefully the works of an Albertus Magnus , a
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, or those of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, can not fail to perceive how greatly their credulity exceeds our own . ''

		An excellent service to students of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	has been performed by Mr.
George P. Hunt	PERSON	- ington , who has compiled a volume containing all the '' Comments of
John Raskin	PERSON	on the Divina Commedia . ''

		Readers of
Ruskin	PERSON	know how suggestive and illuminating are his crit - ical observations upon the great masters of literature , however wrong-headed they may be in particular instances .

		In the case of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, his power of penetrative sympathy is so great that we are not often required , as we are in the case of some of the great writers whom he discusses , to take exception to what he says , on the ground of whimisicality or petulance .

		In almost every instance , his words about
Dante	PERSON	ring true , and are helpful to our under - standing .

		His references to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	are prob - ably more frequent and substantial in amount than his references to any other poet , and we are not surprised that they should make , when brought together , a volume of considerable dimensions .

		Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, , who writes an introduction to Mr.
Hunting	PERSON	- ton 's book , makes the following summary of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's relations with Dante : '' But whatever errors may be found in Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's - comments , or however fanciful some of them may be , his imaginative insight and his intense moral sentiment brought him into such sympathy with the poet that he entered deeply into the spiritual purport of the poem , and was thus enabled to reveal and illuminate the truth which often lies hidden within verses that to most read - ers seem simple narrative .

		There is no student of the '' Divine Comedy '' but will derive stimulating sugges - tion from these comments and be helped by them to read the poem with keener intelligence and fuller apprecia - tion of its interest and significance . ''

		The opening section of the present volume collects the general references to
Dante	PERSON	, his artistic relations , his interpreters , and the char - acteristics , sources , and inspiration of his great work .

		The comments upon special passages of the '' Divine Comedy '' then follow , arranged in the order of the cantos concerned .

		There are references to every canto but two of the '' Inferno , '' every canto but three of the '' Pur - gatorio , '' and to more than one-half of the cantos of the '' Paradiso . ''

		Where
Ruskin	PERSON	uses the English translations his text is followed without change ; where he quotes from the original , the text is amended according to a modern recension .

		1903 -RSB- THE DIAL 421 It is not altogether inappropriate to include within this review , and to conclude it there - with , a word descriptive of '' The Great Poets of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	.

		The chapters upon
Dante	ORGANIZATION	occupy nearly a third of this volume , and are well adapted for the needs of beginners .

		The entire work is , in fact , ele - mentary , as is seen from the fact that it is the rearrangement of an earlier volume which was prepared for the special uses of the Chautauqua Circles .

		Besides dealing with the five great classical poets of
Italy	LOCATION	, the work gives us an introductory chapter on the origins , and con - cludes with two new chapters on the modern age from
Alfieri	PERSON	to
Carducci	PERSON	.

		Copious quota - tions are supplied throughout , and the trans - lations are selected with admirable taste .

		As an elementary introduction to the history of Italian literature , this book of Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	may be commended ; more than that it does not pretend to be .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Holiday Publications .

		L ''
Madame de Montespan	ORGANIZATION	was something more than the mistress of le
Grand Monarque	LOCATION	, the mother of legitimated princes and princesses ... She was the symbol of her age , the spirit of seventeenth century
France	LOCATION	incarnate .

		In her we find almost all the best and worst characteristics of the great epoch in French history -- its dignity and splendour , its genuine admira - tion for literature and art , its exquisite courtesy , its light-hearted gaiety , its brilliant wit , side by side with its arrogance and egotism , its senseless prodigality , its flagrant disregard of the moral law , its gross super - stition .

		In studying her life we are studying not her alone , but the whole society of which she was the rep - resentative . ''

		It is thus that Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	apologizes for devoting a bulky volume -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- to
Madame de Montespan	PERSON	, bat his real justification lies in the fact that he has folly succeeded in painting her in this larger aspect ; has written '' backstairs history '' so as to lift it above the level of scandal , and make it fulfil its legitimate function , -- that of supplying atmosphere , of giving vividness and real - ity , to the great transactions of any age .

		After his excellent life of
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	, he could be trusted to approach a similar task in this spirit , and to carry it on with thoroughness and brilliancy .

		His view of
Madame de Montespan	ORGANIZATION	is essentially that which modern research has established beyond reasonable doubt ; that far from being Louis 's un - willing victim , she deliberately planned , for finan - cial reasons , to become his mistress ; that all through the twelve years of her reign she resorted to the basest means to keep her power ; and that ruin over - took her when , in
1680	DATE	, Louis discovered her deal - ings with the prisoner La
Voisin	PERSON	and her fiendish associates .

		As this is the first biography in English which embodies the discoveries of Ravaisson and other modern scholars , it is a distinct contribution to the history of its period , and deserves much fuller comment than can be given to it here .

		But as an ex - ample of splendid bookmaking , it deserves first place among the season 's holiday publications , and it is in this aspect that we wish to call attention to it .

		It is printed in large type with generous margins , and bound in green buckram stamped in gold .

		In pro- portion to its large size , the volume is remarkably light and easy to handle .

		There are sixteen superb portraits reproduced in photogravure from old French engravings .

		Among the subjects represented are Louis XIV. , his queen and his three mistresses ,
Colbert	PERSON	,
Bossuet	LOCATION	, la
Grande Mademoiselle	PERSON	, and the Due da
Maine	LOCATION	.

		The frontispiece is a beautiful plate from
Picart	PERSON	's engraving of
Madame de Montespan	ORGANIZATION	, of whom there are also two other portraits , one by an unknown painter , the other from
Pierre Schenk	PERSON	's engraving . ''

		World 's Children , by Mortimer Menpes , text by Dorothy Menpes , '' -- thus runs the title-page of a richly-bound volume issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As is indicated by the reversed order which pats the illustrator 's name first , this is a picture book ; and it is a very delightful one .

		The color printing , which was done at the Menpes press under the superin - tendence of the artist and his daughters , is remark - ably satisfactory , being brilliant bat not glaring .

		Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	's studies are charming ; there is not a child of the hundred pictured in the book who is not both childlike and lovable -- whether he be the little Canadian toddler bandied in far for his first walk , a pensive Roumanian lassie , a yellow baby of Burmah , or a pampered little Miss from
America	LOCATION	.

		It is perhaps unfair to criticise the text .

		One may paint the children of the world , but no one can write of them all except in platitudes .

		National traits are not strong in children .

		In every land they are inevitably the creatures of their parents ' cir - cumstances , so that there are endless social strata to be considered .

		The
London	LOCATION	street arab has nothing in common with the children of
Mayfair	ORGANIZATION	, and there are dozens of grades between .

		So Miss Menpes has possibly made the best of a bad matter .

		We can well afford to smile at some of her pleasing generalities , and still admire the book for the sake of the really interesting information which it con - tains , and for the pictures . ''

		Between the high Sierras south from
Yosem	PERSON	- ite -- east and south over a very great assemblage of broken ranges beyond
Death Valley	LOCATION	, and on illimitably into the
Mojave Desert	LOCATION	, '' -- there Mrs.
Mary Austin	PERSON	tells as lies '' The Land of Little Rain . ''

		The Indians call it the Country of Lost Borders ; and she prefers that name to '' Desert '' for a place that , to the patient observer , is far from being void of life .

		There are hills there , `` blunt , burned , squeezed up oat of chaos , chrome and ver - milion painted '' ; and between the hills are steep and narrow canons , oftener than not dry at the 422 THE DIAL -LSB- Dee .

		1 , bottom , and high sun-baked mesas where the dust - devils dance to the wind 's piping .

		By day , the land is very still , spell-bound in the glare of the sun ; but in the late afternoon the birds appear , and the little furry folk creep out from cover and take to their tiny ribbon-like water trails .

		Then the hawk and the eagle skim over the sage , the coyote lurks by the rabbit-form , the '' billy-owl , '' the bob-cat , and the red fox gather at the water-holes , all watching their chance to prey on smaller creatures .

		Where - ever there are cattle there are scavengers , -- buz - zards and ravens ; and in the dry years vultures , in terrible black clouds .

		There are men , too , in the desert : cattlemen , miners bitten with tales of lost treasure , and Paiute Indians ; there is
Jimville	LOCATION	, a
Bret Harte	PERSON	town , and
Las Uvas	LOCATION	, a Mexican pueblo .

		There is indeed tragedy in the desert ; but Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	wonders if convention has not over-empha - sized that note .

		The lonely land takes heavy toll of the visitor , but it pays high returns ; and once its charm is on you , you may curse it and leave it , but you will surely come back .

		Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	did not go to the desert to write it up .

		She has lived on its borders for years , and because she knows and loves it she can reproduce its atmosphere of ro - mance , of silence , and of strangeness .

		Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	has done admirable work in illustrating the volume and decorating the margins with character - istic and suggestive bits of desert scenery .

		The book is published in handsome holiday binding by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Elisabeth Luther Cary	PERSON	's illustrated mono - graph on the Rossettis , published two years ago , is now followed by an elaborate edition , in two hand - some volumes , of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	's poems , with illustrations from his own work , and an intro - duction and critical notes by
Miss Cary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bind - ing is similar to that of the previous work , but a little less ornate .

		The paper and printing are of the same excellence as before , and the photogravure reproduc - tions , thirty-two in number , naturally include several pictures that appeared in the earlier volume -- not - ably the '' Found '' and the '' Lady Lilith '' then first reproduced from the originals through the courtesy of their , owner , Mr.
Samuel J. Bancroft	PERSON	, Jr. .

		The ad - vantage of having
Rossetti	PERSON	's poetry and paintings between the same covers is obvious , and to the Rossettian the bulk of this edition will be , in proportion , a very slight drawback .

		Miss
Cary	PERSON	's notes call attention to important variations occur - ring in different editions , and supply such biograph - ical detail as will serve to connect the poems with the man whose very incomplete expression they were .

		Without being technical or exhaustive , these notes add greatly to the interest of the poems .

		But the peculiar value of the edition lies of course in the pictures , with their many-colored cross-lights on the poems , which in turn often define or add sugges - tivenesB to the meaning of the pictures .

		The publication by
Messrs. A. C McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of a beautiful portfolio of sketches by
Miss Hazel Martyn	ORGANIZATION	, will arouse increased interest in the work of this talented young
Chicago	LOCATION	artist .

		The present collection contains ten plates in color from chalk drawings , the subjects all being heads of young women .

		The originals of several of the sketches were exhibited in
Chicago	LOCATION
last spring	DATE	; others are from French types studied during Miss
Martyn	PERSON	's recent stay in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The drawings are marked by an economy of line and a dash and brilliancy of finish that suggest
Helleu	PERSON	, but the faces are often prettier .

		The lithographic process of reproduction has produced excellent results .

		The portfolio cover , which is made attractive by Miss
Martyn	PERSON	's design , is strong enough to protect its contents -- as too many portfolios are not .

		The collection will make an ideal Christmas gift .

		Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	, of '' Dodo '' memory , has written a '' Book of Months '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- in which he relates , in the first person singular , the experiences and adventures that filled twelve months in the life of a
London	LOCATION	man-about-town .

		There is some vivid description in the book , considerable witty philoso - phizing , and the inevitable love-story , which , begin - ning very unpropitiously in
May	DATE	, ends happily in the
December	DATE	chapter .

		It is perhaps not unfair to assume that the literary confidences are autobio - graphical and that Mr.
Benson	PERSON	shares many of the habits , beliefs , and opinions with which he endows his hero .

		But the romance , related in quite a dif - ferent style , is clearly an interpolation which results in an odd lack of unity in both style and subject matter .

		This , however , seems appropriate rather than otherwise for a '' Book of Months . ''

		The dec - orative features of the book are unusually handsome .

		They consist of marginal borders which change in design and coloring with the four seasons , and a very effective cover of heavy green buckram , in which is set a panel with a sun-dial design and the legend , '' Horas non numero nisi serenas . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has not quite lived up to his motto , but the '' cheerful yesterdays '' are much in the majority , and there is a good deal of the spirit of Christmas about the entire book .

		When Mr.
Egerton R. Williams	PERSON	, Jr. , wished to make some preparation for a contemplated visit to the cities of the
Apennines	LOCATION	, he was disappointed to find that there was nothing to read upon the subject except profound archaeological treatises and fugitive essays .

		It was the lack of a comprehen - sive book about the most interesting country in the world -- as Mr.
Williams	PERSON	calls central
Italy	LOCATION	-- that led him to write his volume on '' Hill Towns of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The record is a personal one ; the hill towns are described in the order in which Mr.
Williams	PERSON	visited them , and their history , treasures of art and architecture , legends and romance , are set forth as he sought them out in his
summer	DATE	wanderings .

		He thor - oughly enjoyed the picturesque , dilapidated little villages , always built on the edge of a ravine , with their noisy and precipitous streets , dirty inns , tum - ble-down houses , and ruined castles ; and he makes his readers see and enjoy them too .

		His work is
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 423 careful and detailed , calculated to appeal especially to students of art and history .

		Most of the illus - trations are intended as aids to an appreciation of the architecture of the hill towns , but natural scenery is not neglected , and there are a few repro - ductions of great paintings .

		The cover design is one of the most attractive to be found among the holiday books .

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, publisher of '' The International Studio , '' has prepared two collections of plates for the holiday trade , '' The Art Portfolio '' and '' The Art Album , '' representing the best work that has appeared in '' The Studio '' during the past seven years .

		The former consists of sixteen plates in color and photogravure , intended for hanging or framing .

		To that end they are artistically mounted , fitted with brass rings for hanging , and enclosed in a handsome portfolio . ''

		The Art Album '' is a book of one hun - dred plates , similarly chosen and meant to show , in compact and convenient form , a little of the progress of contemporary art during the period covered .

		Both selections have been made with a view to securing variety in subject and in method of repro - duction , and both represent very adequately , though of course on different scales , the somewhat bizarre and '' modern , '' but always interesting , type of art for which '' The Studio '' stands .

		Either will cer - tainly prove a very acceptable gift for an art-loving friend .

		As the memory of even the most constant reader of '' The Studio '' can hardly be expected to stretch back infallibly over seven years , an accom - panying list of the names and artists of the plates in the '' Portfolio '' and an index to the '' Album '' would have added to the value of each .

		A book for those who like to read about the stage and its people is Mr.
Gustav Kobbe	PERSON	`` s '' Famous Actors and Actresses and their Homes '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is devoted to entertaining accounts of the private life , families , homes , friends , and favorite amusements of nine popular stage favorites of to-day , with two supplementary chapters upon '' The Lambs ' '' and ■ The Players ' '' Clubs .

		Most , if not all , of the sketches have already ap - peared separately in '' The Ladies ' Home Journal . ''

		The decorative cover and the illustrations are an important feature of the book .

		The frontispiece is a beautiful photogravure from Mr.
Irving R. Wiles	PERSON	's portrait of Miss
Marlowe	PERSON	.

		The other pictures are excellent half-tones representing the actors and actresses in their homes or enjoying their favorite recreations .

		The last two chapters are embellished with pictures of the rooms of the two famous actors ' clubs , and portraits of their founders and choice spirits .

		Appropriately bound in royal purple is Miss
Sarah A. Tooley	PERSON	's large octavo volume entitled '' Royal Palaces and their Memories '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Windsor ,
St. James 's	ORGANIZATION	,
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	,
Kensington	LOCATION	, and Buckingham are the palaces de - scribed .

		As they have , collectively , been the homes of all English monarchs since the days of William the Conqueror , their `` memories '' might easily lapse into a compendium of English history .

		But
Miss Tooley	PERSON	has used considerable skill in picking out vivid bits of incident to stand for each period , in showing the every-day round that went on within the palaces -- the human and personal , rather than the public and ceremonial , side of court life , -- and in building up a personality for each inmate rather than crowding her narrative with plot interest .

		The result is an entertaining and intimate account , necessarily sketchy considering the space of time it covers , including enough descriptive detail to make the settings real but not enough to be tire - some , -- in short , a book to please the average reader , if we may speak of such a person .

		It is beautifully illustrated , the large size of the pages making possible exceptionally clear and effective half - ton es .

		Romance seems to be a popular note with the holiday writers .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney'a	PERSON	`` Romance of the Bourbon Chateaux '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- follows two similar volumes by the same author , dealing respectively with the feudal and the renais - sance chateaux .

		Like its predecessors , this book is luxuriously bound and copiously illustrated , having a colored frontispiece from a water-color by Mr.
J. Wells Champney	PERSON	and numerous photogravure and half-tone plates of the chateaux and their surround - ing parks and gardens .

		Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	spent years learning to know
Versailles	LOCATION	, and hunting out other Bourbon chateaux near
Paris	LOCATION	or in remote corners of
Burgundy	LOCATION	and
Brittany	PERSON	.

		And now , instead of giving us the result as an architectural study or a detailed record of her wanderings , she prefers , as she has done twice before , to write ten little stories whose scenes are laid in the old chateaux .

		There is , to be sure , an eleventh chapter entitled '' The Bourbons and their Chateaux -- a Summary of the Period for the Serious - Minded '' ; but most of us will uphold Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	by leaving this serious - minded chapter where she puts it , at the end .

		In her preface Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	humbly suggests that her stories may make a future visit to the Bourbon castles more enjoyable , but they are far too deftly written , too fresh and spirited , to deserve any such second-hand recognition .

		As romances they are ex - ceedingly entertaining ; as a serious interpretation of the times of
Louis the Grand	LOCATION	, their value would be greatly increased by a bibliography and an index .

		Two years ago , when '' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' appeared with pictures by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	, some of us felt inclined to cry '' Hands off !

		-- we want no Alice pictures but Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	's . ''

		The new beasts are very amusing , but they do not belong in our '' Wonderland , '' and no other will ever be quite so delightful .

		But it is different with '' The Hunting of the Snark , and Other Poems '' which
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	offer this year , bound , like their `` Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, '' in vellum with gold letter - ing , and having page decorations in color and forty full-page tinted pictures by Mr.
Newell	PERSON	.

		The rhymes from ' • Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' and '' Through the Looking-Glass '' are included , of course ; but there 424 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is only one illustration which duplicates Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	's , and so far as we know he never illustrated any of the other verses .

		Mr.
Newell	PERSON	's Snark is delightfully mysterious and '' boojum '' ; the Badgers and the Herrings could not be better ; and the Phan - tom is very ghostly indeed .

		We feel that the artist has missed a point in not drawing a Jubjub bird , and we hardly consider his Bandersnatch sufficiently '' frumious . ''

		Nevertheless , the edition will be a rare treasure to all who enjoy ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	's '' delicious fooling . ''

		Old Quebec , '' a bulky volume by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	and Mr.
Claude G. Bryan	PERSON	, comes to us from the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The authors make no claim to originality , but present their work as an assim - ilation , in popular and accessible form , of the abun - dant data recorded by Jesuit priests and pio - neers , by
Francis Parkman	PERSON	and other historians of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The story of
Quebec	LOCATION	is told in historical sequence , from the time of the city 's foundation by
Champlain	LOCATION	to the present day , when , shorn of her commercial and political prestige , she watches the dreams of her youth come true -- for another na - tion .

		There are surely few more fascinating fields of research in all the annals of history .

		Romance , pathos , stirring incident , noble characters , give vivid interest to every stage of the story which is here done full justice .

		The style of the book is direct , yet brilliant and picturesque , -- such as we should expect from Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		The numerous illustrations are of two kinds , small half-tones and full-page portraits in photogravure , the latter being very effective .

		The impression left by the book is one of authority , solidity , and thorough-going excel - lence ; of charm which involves no sacrifice of truth to meretricious interest .

		These qualities will com - bine with its handsome exterior and copious illus - tration to recommend it to holiday buyers .

		While many modern nature-writers are remark - able for habits of close and careful observation ,
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	is conspicuous for having in addi - tion a rare refinement of feeling and much delicacy of imagination .

		In him , as has been well said , '' the naturalist and the poet were harmonized . ''

		That American readers may know more of this man , who is undoubtedly the foremost interpreter of nature among Englishmen of his century , a new edition of his characteristic work on '' Wild Life in a
Southern County	LOCATION	'' has been prepared under the title of `` An English Village '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The scenes described in the text are made more vivid by means of illustrations from pho - tographs taken for the purpose by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, who has supplied a brief biographical note ; while Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	furnishes an appreciative interpretation of
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's photographs harmonize in their clearness and care for detail and in their emphasis of the human ele - ment in the picture , with jefferies 's text .

		But they lack subtlety , as photographs always must ; so they furnish no hint of the poetic imagination and sense of artistic form by which
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	glorified his world of common things .

		This is merely to say that no photographs can do justice to
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's '' English Village . ''

		What they do show , and that very well , is the country around
Coate	PERSON	in
Wiltshire	LOCATION	, where his early life was passed , and in and around which he rambles with his readers .

		To the Americans in his company pictures of this background will be par - ticularly valuable .

		So Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's beautiful and painstaking work is certain to be appreciated , at the same time that its limits are understood .

		Miss
Geraldine Brooks	PERSON	's volume of '' Romances of Colonial Days '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- contains nine short sto - ries in which , working on a more or less secure foot - ing of fact , the author has built up as many half - fanciful , Colonial romances of the years between
1621	DATE	and
1785	DATE	.


John Alden	PERSON	and
Priscilla	LOCATION	, Major Andre * , Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	, the
Pepperells	LOCATION	,
Cus	PERSON	- tises , Adamses , and Bryds , with others less familiar , have their part in the narratives , which depict in simple and entertaining fashion the everyday life of pre-revolutionary times in
America	LOCATION	.

		In writing of '' Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days , ''
Miss Brooks	PERSON	learned her ground thoroughly .

		She is not a finished story-teller , yet she succeeds in giving some very effective and convincing pictures of life in the mansions of our colonial ancestors .

		A unique and attractive cover , with nine illustrations by Mr.
Arthur E. Becher	PERSON	, reproduced in half-tone and pho - togravure , give to the book the distinction of a hol - iday publication .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	has chosen `` The Land of Heather '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as the title for his record of rambles through
Scotland	LOCATION	, because he thinks that '' the hardiness and warm bloom of the heather '' expresses the racial individuality of modern Scot - land better than the prickliness of the national thistle .

		In accordance with this theory and also with his previous practice , it is the less strenuous side of Scottish life that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	depicts .

		He and his camera spent a
summer	DATE	at
Diumtochty	LOCATION	, which is described rather as a typical Scotch village than as
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	's workshop .

		Then they took a leisurely journey to
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and spent some time among its historic landmarks .

		Later they paid a brief visit to Kirriemuir , alias Thrums , went by stage and boat through the
Highlands	LOCATION	, got a glimpse of life in the
Hebrides	LOCATION	, saw the
Burns	PERSON	country , and rounded up in
Galloway	LOCATION	.

		Records of similar trips through rural
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
New England	LOCATION	, have made Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's simple an - ecdotal style and quiet humor familiar to many readers .

		The new book owes the usual debt to the author 's camera , which has contributed about eighty photographs of peasant life and natural scenery .

		The decidly unique cover design shows a solemn
Highland	LOCATION	piper playing busily on his queer instru - ment .

		A very individual book on a commonplace theme is `` Cities '' -LRB- Pott -RRB- by the Euglish poet and critic , Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		The title would indicate either a guide-book or a traveller 's account of his experiences , and its vague generality is not pre -
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 425 possessing .

		But closer examination shows that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's method is very different from that of the ordinary traveller-author .

		He writes only of what really appeals to him , keeping himself well in the background .

		He has a keen power of analysis and , as we should expect , a fine feeling for words .

		His essays are consequently brilliant impressionist pic - tures , full of color and movement , very subjective , yet real and convincing . ''


Rome	LOCATION	is a sea in which many worlds have gone down and its very pave - ment is all in waves . '' ''


Naples	LOCATION	has ceased to be merely horrible to me , a boiling pot ; it has become a witches ' cauldron . ''

		There are many sentences as picturesque and suggestive as these , which have been taken unfairly from their setting .

		The cities of which Mr.
Symons	PERSON	writes are

		Eight excellent photogravure illustrations from old pictures harmon - ize in finish and distinction with the style of the essays .

		The binding is plain and beautiful , in keep - ing with the contents .

		Text and make-up will appeal to readers of discriminating taste .

		Five years ago there was published a book of essays entitled '' Friendship '' by that most popular of Scottish preachers , Mr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	.

		This is now reprinted uniformly with a new volume by the same author on `` Work '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Those who have read and enjoyed Mr.
Black	PERSON	's inspiring words about Friendship will be glad to re-read them in this handsome volume , whose fine binding and dec - orative headings and page borders ought to win for it many new friends .

		The same earnest spirit and vigorous mode of expression characterize the new volume also .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	's main contention is a telling protest against the common social ideal that makes ease and pleasure , instead of work and serv - ice , the end of living ; that considers the profits of employment , instead of the moral dignity of labor for its own sake .

		He discusses no social or eco - nomic problems , but treats his subject in that largest aspect which applies equally to all classes and indi - viduals .

		`` Idleness and Work , '' `` The Habit of Work , '' `` The Duty of Work , '' `` The Gospel of Work , '' '' The Consecration of Work '' are a few of his chapter-headings , but they give no idea of his fresh and original treatment of a somewhat hack - neyed theme .

		Like its companion volume , this is richly bound and printed on deckle-edge paper , with colored marginal borders and other decorations .

		For a friend of a philosophic turn of mind few bet - ter gifts could be found than these two books , full of `` high thinking , '' but written in a way to appeal to the average man . ''

		Old Paths and Legends of
New England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Miss
Katharine M. Abbott	PERSON	, is an outgrowth of the wide demand for the little paper - bound `` Trolley Trips '' by the same author .

		Finding that the public was really interested in the his - toric spots of
New England	LOCATION	,
Miss Abbott	LOCATION	has pre - pared a 460-page book on the same theme , with careful annotations and a complete index .

		The amount of material here presented will amaze most readers .

		Accustomed to think of their country as still young and comparatively bare of literary and historical associations , they will not be prepared for the rush of Miss Abbott 's words , nor for the number of interesting cities and villages in
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts ,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	that she mentions .

		Fifty-six towns besides
Boston	LOCATION	are described .

		The homes and haunts of famous men , historic spots of national or local interest , pictur - esque bits of scenery , places associated with Indian legends or quaint Yankee traditions , are all noticed in
Miss Abbott	LOCATION	's pages , so that whatever the reader 's taste he should find something to suit it .

		Of course the book is illustrated ; there are pictures on nearly half the pages , representing in pictorial form all the varied , interests of the text .

		In a pocket in the back cover is a travellers ' map .

		The
Outlook Company	ORGANIZATION	has reprinted some of Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	's critical papers in a handsome volume entitled '' Backgrounds of Lit - erature . ''

		The seven essays included treat of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	.

		Goethe ,
Blackmore	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and
Scott	PERSON	.

		They differ considerably in scope and method of treatment , but most of them combine an analysis of the author 's work with an account of the environment -- whether physical as with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, or human as with Whitman -- which he wrote into it .

		There is nothing striking or iconoclastic about Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's judgments .

		As usual , he says the rather conventional thing grace - fully and well .

		The numerous pictures of the '' backgrounds '' show to much better advantage in the book than they did in the pages of '' The Outlook , '' where Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's essays fir * t appeared .

		Those of
Concord	LOCATION	, made from drawings by Miss
Elizabeth Roberts	PERSON	, are especially interesting .

		The new volume in '' Miranda 's Library '' -LRB- Dent -
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is
Browning	PERSON	's '' Men and Women , '' re - printed with many line drawings by Mr.
H. Ospovat	PERSON	, set in red page-borders , with the title - page and the headings of the poems also in red and bla > k .

		The dramatic picturesqueness of '' Men and Women , '' which must appeal to the least imaginative reader , aids the task of illustration , while at the same time it renders it more exacting .

		For previoux concep - tions are hard to satisfy ; and it is inevitable , too , since not every poem is or can be illustrated , that some favorites will seem to be slighted .

		That one wishes for more of Mr.
Ospo	PERSON	vat 's work , is perhaps the highest tribute that can be paid to it .

		The book is beautifully printed on firm soft paper of very light weight .

		Two new volumes of Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's `` Little Journeys '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- are now published -- to the homes of `` Famous Musicians '' and of '' English Authors . ''

		Whatever their faults , Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's essays are never commonplace .

		There is a briskness about his epigrams , a breezy enthu - siasm about his point of view , that is admirable , and that is undoubtedly the key to the continued popu - larity of his books .

		The musicians whom Mr. 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	,
Hubbard	PERSON	has chosen to `` visit '' are
Wagner	PERSON	,
Paga	LOCATION	- nini ,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Bach	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	, and
Brahms	PERSON	.

		The English authors are
Morris	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Addison	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Southey	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Disraeli	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		The chapter on
Burns	PERSON	, being entirely devoted to an exposition of Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's ideas about love-mak - ing , ends with a scant half-page of biography and a dismissal of the reader to the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' -LRB- `` a compilation that I cheerfully re - commend '' -RRB- for the rest of the facts .

		The chapter on
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	is picturesquely divided into sections ac - cording to the stations on the Lake Shore railroad , travelling on which Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	hastily endeav - ored to replace the manuscript which a careless porter had thrown out of the window .

		A number of fine portraits are scattered through each volume , and the binding is at once tasteful and serviceable .

		It was probably Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	who set the fashion of attaching the term '' pilgrimage '' to a biographical and critical sketch .

		We have long since learned what to expect of Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's journeyings , but it is annoying to find his per - nicious use of the word adopted in other quarters .

		We have , for instance , the '' Little Pilgrimages '' series -LRB- Page -RRB- , two new volumes of which have appeared this Fall .

		One of these is the second volume of '' Among the Men who have Written Famous Books , '' by Mr.
Edward F. Harkins	PERSON	.

		It consists of brief accounts of some living American authors , among them Messrs.
George Ade	PERSON	,
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	,
Peter Dunne	PERSON	,
Jack London	LOCATION	, Hop - kinson
Smith	ORGANIZATION	,
Booth Tarkington	LOCATION	,
Owen Wister	PERSON	, and a dozen others .

		A photograph of the subject precedes each sketch .

		Mr.
Harkins	PERSON	's idea of a famous book is very elastic and his style savors of Newspaper Row , but he has succeeded in produc - ing a book that is at least thoroughly readable .

		The other new volume in the '' Little Pilgrim - ages '' series is called '' The Romance of Old New England Churches , '' and is written by Miss
Mary C. Crawford	PERSON	.

		It is a curiously heterogeneous col - lection of fact and surmise , often very loosely con - nected with any church or even with any minister . ''

		Courtship according to
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	, '' for ex - ample , one of the most interesting chapters , is brought under the main title by virtue of the facts that Judge
Sewall	PERSON	made his famous confession at the Old South Church , and that his son later be - came its assistant pastor .

		But the Old South had absolutely nothing to do with his delicious wooing of
Madame Winthrop	ORGANIZATION	.

		But if Miss
Crawford	PERSON	does not always keep within the limits of her title , she picks up some very entertaining bits of story by the way .

		So the reader is inclined to be tolerant .

		The book is illustrated with portraits and photo - graphs of churches and personages . ''

		In the Palaces of the Saltan '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the story of Mrs.
Anna Bowman Dodd	PERSON	's stay in
Constantinople	LOCATION	, which city she visited as the guest of General
Horace Porter	PERSON	,
United States Ambassador	ORGANIZATION	to
France	LOCATION	.

		As a member of
General Porter	ORGANIZATION	's party , she was received at the Sultan 's court , decorated by him with the order of the Shefakat , entertained at dinner , and conducted through his miles of parks and palaces by an official deputed for the purpose .

		In company with
General	ORGANIZATION	and Mrs.
Porter	PERSON	, too , she got her first glimpses of the composite city of
Constantinople	LOCATION	, and after their departure she remained behind to study its life more closely .

		The account of a visit made under such unique conditions could scarcely fail to be interest - ing .

		Mrs.
Dodd	PERSON	has a gift of graphic description , and her boundless and sometimes well-nigh breath - less enthusiasm for everything in and out of the Sultan 's palaces results in a fresh and racy picture of life in the land of the Arabian Nights .

		Mrs.
Dodd	PERSON	seems inclined , however , to take her work a little too seriously .

		She was after all only an out - sider , with exceptional advantages for observing the ways of the Sultan 's court , but limited in her resources by the shortness of her visit and her ignorance of the Turkish language .

		As a very entertaining account of a very unusual experience her book deserves considerable praise and will attract many readers .

		Its white and gold cover is delicate but handsome , and the illustrations in half - tone and photogravure are both profuse and beau - tiful .

		The pictures can not of course reflect the sacred splendors of the palaces , but
Constantinople	LOCATION	is picturesque enough to supply all the needed material without any infringement of the Sultan 's privacy .

		Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	's clever little story of '' The Cardinal 's Snuff-Box '' has been selected by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	for a holiday reprint .

		The gay scarlet cover , -- symbolic of his Eminence , -- is decorated with golden snuff-boxes .

		The twenty dainty illus - trations , in pen-and-ink , are by Mr.
G. C. Wilms	PERSON	- hurst , who has also drawn suggestive head and tail pieces for each chapter .

		Mr.
Wilmshurst	PERSON	has caught the spirit of the story perfectly , the pub - lishers have provided excellent paper and typog - raphy , and the sum total is an unusually successful illustrated novel . ''

		The Limerick Up to Date Book '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a combined calendar and memorandum , embellished with a series of limericks , old and new , for every week in the year .

		Miss
Ethel Watts Mumford	PERSON	composed and collected the rhymes , and , assisted by Mr.
Addison Mizner	PERSON	, illustrated them and drew the scarlet page-borders .

		The little book contains such old favorites as '' There was an old man of Tarrentum , '' and '' There was an old sculptor named Phidias , '' and there are many clever new ones .

		One , called '' Truth , '' runs thus : '' There was a young lady named
Maude	PERSON	, Who said she was ' awfully boahed , ' For all men she hated , Both single and mated -- But in the dark corners -- Good Lawd ! ''


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 427 Golfers will appreciate `` At a Cursory Glance , '' which tells how '' A curate once smote at a tee , And threw his new club np a tree , Saying ' Fie !

		My !

		!

		Oh dear !

		1 !

		I must give up , I fear , Either golf or the Ministeree ! ' ''

		The lovers of nonsense-verse are legion , and all of them will enjoy '' The Limerick Up to Date Book . ''

		In preparing their illustrated holiday edition of
John Fiske	PERSON	's `` Dutch and
Quaker Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, '' the publishers ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have spared no pains to secure everything in the way of illustrative material that would add in any degree to the historical interest of the text . ''

		Portraits , maps , facsimiles -LSB- of documents , letters , title-pages , and autographs -RSB- , contemporary views , and prints '' -- to quote from the title-page -- have all been utilized , in many cases for the first time .

		The portraits , notably those of
Erasmus	LOCATION	,
William Penn	PERSON	, and
Robert Livingston	PERSON	, are very beautiful ; but the old maps and the '' views , '' such as '' Am - sterdam in the Seventeenth Century '' from a Dutch engraving , and the quaint pictures of early
New York	LOCATION	, are rarer and more unique .

		There are in all twenty-four photogravure portraits , and over two hnndred other illustrations and maps , but in spite of this lavish abundance nothing has been included which does not possess distinct historical interest .

		The result is a complete , scholarly , and beautiful reprint of a fascinating original such as is seldom found even to-day .

		The edition is in two volumes , bound in polished green buckram , uniform with the similar edition of '' The Beginnings of
New England	LOCATION	, '' which this work follows in historical sequence .

		The publishers also announce a large - paper edition in boards with paper label , and lim - ited to 250 numbered copies .

		A very alluring library edition which includes most of
Stevenson	PERSON	's essays and sketches of travel is published in seven handy-size volumes by
Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' Essays and Criti - cisms , '' '' Memories and Portraits , '' '' Familiar Studies of Men and Books '' -LRB- in two volumes -RRB- , ''
Virginibus Pueneque	PERSON	, '' `` An Inland Voyage , '' and '' Travels with a Donkey '' are the titles .

		The first volume is the notable one , for eight of its essays have appeared in the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' and '' Thistle '' sub - scription editions only , while four have never been reproduced since their publication in the '' Pall Mall Gazette . ''

		Walking tours , Swiss life , and the study of literature are the principal topics .

		The contents of the other six volumes need no comment .

		The frontispiece in each volume of the set is a dif - ferent photogravure portrait of
Stevenson	PERSON	, the series of seven making a very interesting study .

		The title - pages are decorated with vignetted photogravures of scenes associated with the author , and there are a few additional photogravures and other illustrations in some of the volumes , and decorative initials , head - bands , and tail-pieces in all .

		The binding is of maroon silk cloth , stamped in gold , the paper of superior finish , the typography attractive , and a rib - bon marker is bound into each volume .

		The small size and daintiness of this edition will make it a very desirable holiday gift , and the fact that it is the re - print of a master ^ work will give it a lasting value .

		Following close on the heels of the first edition of Mr.
Charles Sprague Smith	PERSON	's chronicle of '' Barbizon Days '' comes the beautiful ''
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	'' edition in octavo form , limited to five hundred copies -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The name of this edition is appro - priate , for it is the
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	of reality or the greater forest of the painters ' imagination that is constantly brought before the reader by text and illustrations .

		Most of the latter are half-tones printed in an effective brown tint and surrounded by wide margins which set them off to advantage .

		Bits of forest vista , scenes in the hamlet of Barbizon and the near-by fields , Millet 's peasant groups ,
Corot	LOCATION	's and
Rousseau	PERSON	's landscapes , and
Barye	ORGANIZATION	's sculptures , all furnish numerous subjects for illus - tration .

		There is also a photogravure portrait of each of the four great Barbizon artists , that of Millet forming the frontispiece .

		It would be hard to find a more artistic gift-book than this .

		Two of the late
Paul Leicester Ford	ORGANIZATION	's short sto - ries , `` A Checked Love Affair '' and '' The Cortelyou Feud , '' have been brought together in a prettily dec - orated booklet by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tales are of the clever sentimental sort that Mr.
Ford	PERSON	could write so well , and are unified by the fact that the redoubtable Mrs.
Baxter	PERSON	figures as goddess ex machina in them both .

		Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	has furnished five dainty pen-and-ink drawings , which are reproduced in photogravure .

		His pictures are charming , but we wish he had not used the same models for the characters in both stories .

		The cover design and the page decorations , consisting of elaborate marginal borders in blue and yellow , are by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		As a whole , the book is one of the prettiest of the lighter publi - cations of the season . ''

		Miladi '' is the fantastic title of Miss
Clara E. Laughlin	PERSON	's new volume of essays about the twen - tieth century woman -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The name is that of a bewitching heroine of romance who was
Miss Laughlin	ORGANIZATION	's girlhood ideal .

		In this book she stands for the ideal womanly , and the essays attempt to show how she would solve the perplexing problems and fulfil the manifold duties that beset the young woman of to-day , keeping meanwhile a balance be - tween the claims of self and the claims of others .

		The point of view of the essays is distinctly femi - nine ; sometimes it is sentimental ; but generally it is sane , helpful , and convincing , evidently that of a woman with first-hand knowledge of the equivocal position of many girls of to-day , who , though not forced to earn a livelihood , long to set aside the small world of home for the larger world of in - dustry , and yet wish to do their duty .

		As is fitting , the volume is sensibly but prettily bound in deco - rated board covers , and there are rubricated initials for each chapter .

		428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, `` Among the Great Masters of the Drama , '' by Mr.
Walter Rowlands	PERSON	, contains thirty-six brief sketches of great actors from the days when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Moliere	PERSON	took the boards in their own dramas to the present time .

		Bat among living actors , only those whose work is practically over and whose genius is assured have been included .

		The sketches make no attempt at complete biogra - phy , but amplify some typical episode or character - istic anecdote in bright and entertaining fashion .

		Each sketch is illustrated by a well-known painting of the subject , some explanation of which , with a brief mention of the painter , is included in the text .

		This volume makes the seventh in
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Great Masters '' series of illustrated gift-books .

		A holiday edition of Hon.
John Hay	PERSON	's '' Castilian Days '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a few of the less pic - turesque chapters omitted , and about seventy illus - trations by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, is a delightful addition to the season 's publications .

		Secretary Hay 's account of his travels in
Spain	LOCATION	has the unique charm that comes from a power of keen analysis , enthusiasm , a sense of humor , a feeling for the picturesque , and the gift of graceful and vigorous expression -- a felicitous combination of qualities not often found in these days of made-to-order books of travel .

		The fact that the sketches were written some time ago , when
Spain	LOCATION	was greater than she is to-day , detracts nothing from the read - er 's enjoyment .

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's drawings are the result of a special visit to
Castile	LOCATION	.

		They consist of full-page and text pictures in crayon , pen and ink , and wash , and form a suggestive and beautiful complement to the text .

		The cover design is bold and effective .

		Somewhat similar in form and spirit to '' A Gbild of Nature '' and `` Under the Trees '' is Mr.
Hamil	PERSON	- ton
W. Mabie	PERSON	's new book '' In Arcady '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Charles L. Hinton	PERSON	has again provided the border designs and incidental deco - rations , and Mr.
Will H. Low	PERSON	has illustrated the book with four exquisite photogravures .

		The text is a parable tracing the development of man 's know - ledge and appreciation of the world of nature .

		The imagery , which is Greek , is emphasized by the pic - torial allegory of the illustrations and decorations , while the woodland atmosphere is carried out in the marginal decorations .

		This is one of the most complete and artistic of the smaller holiday pub - lications .

		Miss
Onoto Watanna	PERSON	's charming Japanese stories are so widely known that extended comment upon the new one , '' The Heart of Hyacinth '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is quite unnecessary .

		Hyacinth is an American girl born and brought up in
Japan	LOCATION	, ignorant of her foreign parentage , and much ashamed of her blue eyes and her soft brown hair , which the best efforts of the hair-dresser can not keep smooth for more than a fortnight .

		She speaks fascinating broken `` Engleeh , '' prays to
Kuannon	LOCATION	, Mother of Mercy , and to the God of her fathers in turn ; and her heart is a wayward mixture of east and west , which she at last appropriately consigns into the keeping of a Japanese-English lover .

		Her story is printed on gold-topped pages , whose wide margins are deco - rated with fantastic designs in soft gray , by the Japanese artist
Kiyokichi Sano	PERSON	.

		There are also five full-page plates in color .

		The cover design is a spray of white hyacinth on a lavendar ground .

		Altogether '' The Heart of Hyacinth '' is one of the daintiest and most attractive of the holiday publications .

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's popular dog story , `` The Bar Sinister , '' has been separated from the collection of tales with which it was first printed in book form and now appears by itself in a sumptu - ous little holiday volume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The original drawings by Mr.
E. M. Ashe	PERSON	, which accompanied the story when it came out in '' Scribner 's
Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' are here beautifully reproduced in color , and suggestive marginal sketches in pen and ink have been added .

		The author answers the letters that came to him when the story first appeared , by a short preface which explains that '' Kid '' was , as many of the correspondents hoped , a real dog ; and his name and history , and the identity of his owner -- Mr.
Davis	PERSON	himself -- are divulged .

		The very effective cover design shows '' Kid 's '' escutcheon , a gold bar on an azure field .

		The central figure in Mr.
Forrest Crissey	PERSON	's '' The Country Boy '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- is a solitary , shrinking little fellow , with ideas of the world , loves , hates , and longings that would be strange if so many children had not had them before him .

		The girls call him '' ninny , '' and the reader is half inclined sometimes to call him prig .

		But he always saves himself from that appelation because , unlike many children in lit - erature , he is neither self-conscious nor precocious .

		His unreasoning fear of the dark , his shame-faced adoration of his mother , his awkward confidences to the '' new teacher , '' his thrilling conquest of the '' girl with the brown braids , '' and his '' industri - ous vagrancy , '' are only a few of the things that make him real and lovable , and his adventures well worth reading .

		In her illustrations Miss
Griselda Marshall McClure	PERSON	depicts the boy many times , and always charmingly .

		Mrs.
Helen Philbrook Patten	PERSON	's volume on `` The Year 's Festivals '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is full of the merry spirit of the holiday season .

		Its simple , readable accounts of the origin , legends , and traditional methods of celebrating nine of the year 's great festivals are gathered from many sources ; and the amount of interesting information that has been collected will surprise most readers and furnish many hints to hostesses in search of suggestions for a novel entertainment .

		The illustrations , from paintings representing scenes of holiday revelry , give an additional touch of festivity to the book , which is prettily and appropriately bound .

		A new edition of ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' in four pocket volumes , with cloth , limp leather , or half-calf bind - ings , is issued by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 standard translation of the novel by
Ormsby	ORGANIZATION	is fol - lowed without abridgment , and his foot-notes and appendix of the proverbs of
Don Quixote	PERSON	are re - tained .

		There is also an extended preface by the editor , Mr.
James Fitzmanrice	PERSON	-
Kelly	PERSON	; so that the edition is scholarly , as well as compact and tasteful in form .

		A portrait of Cervantes and three etch - ings by Lalauze furnish the frontispiece illustrations .

		`` The Shepherd 's Pipe '' is a slender little volume compiled by Mr.
Fitzroy Carrington	PERSON	from the pastoral poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and published by
Messrs. Fox , Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selection has been made with taste and discrimination , and considering its small size it rep - resents very adequately the bucolic strain that once ran so sweetly through English verse .

		The arrange - ment of the poems is chronological , and there is an index to authors and to first lines .

		Portraits of half a dozen of the lyrists serve as illustrations .

		The grey board covers are novel and attractive .

		A collection of `` Christmas Songs and Easter Carols '' by the late
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	is a holiday booklet that will appeal to many admirers of the great divine .

		It contains his beautiful '' Little Town of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, '' four other Christmas poems , and three carols for Easter .

		Paper and typography are of superior quality .

		The decoration consists of a rubricated title-page and ornamented headings and initials , besides a tasteful cover design in cream and gold .

		-LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	. -RRB- ''

		In Perfect Peace , '' a thirty-page booklet by the Rev.
James R. Miller	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, has been reissued as a gift-book , with profuse illustrations and an ornate binding -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Miller	PERSON	's work always com - mands attention , and there will be many to enjoy and profit by this earnest and inspiring sermon , which gains a new emphasis from its dainty set - ting and from Mr. 6 .


H. Edwards	PERSON	's harmonious drawings .

		A sheaf of calendars for
1904	DATE	shows nothing so amusing as Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's '' Boy Calendar '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a series of twelve cartoons , some of which
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper readers will remember .

		The episodes in the Boy 's year are characteristic and full of humor .

		The Boy himself is omnipresent , and so is his Dog , with a horde of other boys and dogs only less delightful ; and
Aunt Mary	ORGANIZATION	has not been forgotten .

		The Boy and his friends will cer - tainly prove cheering companions for the fleeting days of the new year .

		-- `` A Calendar of Prayers by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	-RRB- is one of the most beautiful of the season .

		Each of the twelve pages shows an artistic border in black enclos - ing a prayer whose rubricated initial letter adds a touch of color to the design .

		Even
Stevenson	PERSON	could not write another petition equal to his familiar '' At Morning '' ; but the spirit of the other prayers 13 the same , and each one is good to think upon for a month .

		-- Very similar in its decorations to the
Stevenson	PERSON	Calendar is '' The Symphony Calendar '' -LRB-
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The brief quotations , which are meant to put the reader in tune with life , are vari - ously chosen from the words of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, or
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, but the key-note of all is energetic optimism .

		-- `` The Canterbury Calendar '' is in triptych form , the side panels showing the pilgrims starting from the inn and their arrival at
Canterbury	LOCATION	, while the cen - tral division represents the company riding merrily through a wood .

		The design , which is in antique style , is printed in colors , and the general effect is very pleasing .

		-- A fourth of Mr.
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	' a publications is '' A Stenciled Calendar '' with seven animal pictures in color by Mr.
Edward Penfield	PERSON	.

		No particular symbolism is apparent in the choice of beasts to stand for the various seasons .

		They are interesting , but we should enjoy them more if Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	or Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	had written rhymes to accompany them .

		As it is , we are not sure just what sentiments they are intended to arouse .

		Books for the
Young	ORGANIZATION	.

		L Of the books provided for children this year , there is little to say in the way of general comment .

		The output is at least as large as in past years ; the literary quality is about as it has been .

		In one respect only is any marked characteristic to be noticed , and this is the very considerable advance shown in the mechanical make-up of this season 's books -- especially in the mat - ter of illustrations .

		Not more than three years ago colored illustrations in children 's books were something of a rarity ; to-day they are to be found in possibly a third of the season 's output .

		The work of the best artists , the finest processes of reproduction , are to be met with as frequently now in books for children as in any other department of publishing activity .

		As regards literary quality , perhaps the best of the season 's books are those dealing with school and college athletics .

		Historical romances for the young are as numerous as ever , but a tendency exists to bring them nearer the present time , as if in response to a journal - istic demand for something imminent enough for con - temporary interest .

		Stories dealing with business life are rather less numerous than usual .

		War , which has seemed to be losing ground of late , looms large in the reading for boys this year .

		By way of compensation , however , there are more volumes with a sociological tendency .

		One rather marked feature of the children 's books of the season is the absence of reprinted classics in new and decorated editions ; there are some books of the sort , but they are much less in evidence than in recent years .

		Beginning with the books dealing with out-of-door life , and bringing into the category those having to do with school and college life , since their interest is largely that of out-of-door games , we find in '' Trapper Jim '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- a clever account , by Mr.
Edwyn Sandys	PERSON	, of the manner in which a young man , a writer on hunting and fishing topics , takes in hand a small boy and brings him into rational interest and accord with the great animal world and with the breadth and freedom of life in the open .

		A more fascinating book for boys could hardly be selected .

		-- Intended for those of fewer years and more imaginative qualities , Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	Out-door life and game * .

		430 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, has limited himself more than usually to facts in `` Two Little Savages '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , wherein a party of youngsters have good times playing at being Indians .

		This book , with its numerous illustrations and enticing make-up , should add many new recruits to Mr.
Seton	PERSON	's large juvenile following .

		-- A wholesome and readable story of college life , by Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	, en - titled ''
Weatherby	PERSON	's Inning '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , tells how a college freshman who is suspected of cowardice comes into his own again through good ball-playing and a faculty for minding his own business Mr.

		-- Football is the interest back of Mr.
Albertus T. Dudley	PERSON	's well-written '' Following the Ball '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a story of boarding school life and athletics .

		Among the children 's books dealing with rtoruTorm historical subjects , special praise belongs .

		to Miss
H. Twitchell	PERSON	's '' Famous Chil - dren Who Have Gained Renown in the Fast '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It combines a wealth of valuable informa - tion with matters of real interest to children , and its illustrations are taken from the masterpieces

		-- '' The Spy of Yorktown '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	, carries the war of Independence through to a successful conclusion , and is a thrilling book After having kept reasonably quiet about the Mexican war for many years , three American authors now blossom out into books about it .

		It is too bad that not one of these three books has pointed out the rank injustice of this war , the more so that its evil effects upon civilization were never more apparent than now , when it is being used to justify other wicked wars of conquest . ''

		The Giant of Three Wars '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a life of General
Winfield Scott	PERSON	, the earlier chapters concerned with
Scott	PERSON	's gallant part in the war of
1812	DATE	and the final chapters with the war of the Rebellion , but the greater part of them filled with the tale of

Cyrus T. Brady	PERSON	, follows the fortunes of a mid - shipman who marches with

States	LOCATION	.

		In it a number of char - acters familiar to the readers of the earlier books in the '' Young Kentuckiaus '' series reappear , and the writing of the narrative from the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	point of view affords a desirable variety .

		-- Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	takes the British and aristocratic view of the French Revolution in '' The Red Cockade '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which does not help it for American readers '' In the Grip of the Mullah '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a better story in every way from the same pen , narrating what happened to a shipwrecked English officer after he fell into Moslem hands Two books come from the pen of the late
George Alfred Henty	PERSON	.

		The first of them combines in a single volume a view of three of
Britain	LOCATION	's '' little '' wars , its title being '' Through Three Campaigns : A Story of
Chitral	LOCATION	,
Tirah	LOCATION	, and
Ashanti	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In it the British army is seen at its best , as usual .

		Mr.
Birch	PERSON	's illustrations , in color and other - wise , are a charming feature of the book .

		-- '' The Lit - tle Foresters , a Story of Field and Woods '' -LRB-

		434 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Notes .

		Bede 's `` Ecclesiastical History '' in Doctor
Giles	PERSON	's translation of
1840	DATE	, is the latest `` Temple Classic , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's '' Hypatia , '' in two volumes , is added to the new library edition of that author 's writings in course of publication by
Messrs. J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A selection from the poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, edited by the Rev.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	and Mr.
D. Laurence Chambers	PERSON	, is a new volume in the '' Athenaeum Press Series '' of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selection is judi - cious , covers the poet 's entire development , and has an extensive apparatus of notes .

		We have received from the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	'' The Prisoner of Zenda '' and ''
Quisante	PERSON	' , '' being the first two volumes of a new library edition of the novels of ''
Anthony Hope	PERSON	. ''

		Fifteen volumes will complete the set , and the edition is limited .

		In mechanical execution this edition is a counterpart of the edition of Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's novels , recently mentioned by us as coming from the same publishers .

		The '' Puritan '' edition of
Bunyan	PERSON	's '' Pilgrim 's Prog - ress , '' published by the
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has for its special feature a series of thirty-one illustrations , by Mr.
Harold Copping	PERSON	, which represent the characters in the costumes of
Bunyan	PERSON	's time .

		The text , also , has been the subject of a careful editorial treatment , and is given as nearly as possible in the shape finally authorized by the author 's own revisions and corrections .

		The ''
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	'' of Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	, sent us by the
Saalfield Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a reprint of the author 's recent newspaper corre - spondence from the three Scandinavian countries .

		The work is rambling and far from accurate , but it makes fairly interesting reading , and is written from a stand - point of genuine sympathy and admiration .

		There are nearly a hundred full-page photographic illustrations , which constitute perhaps the most attractive feature of the volume .

		Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	continue their ad - mirable work of republishing , in agreeable , but inexpen - sive form , the standard productions of English literature .

		Their most important enterprise of this sort for the present year takes the shape of companion sets , in twelve volumes each , of the works of Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	.

		In the case of Fielding , we have the works nearly com - plete -- novels , essays , dramas , and miscellanies -- while in the case of Smollett we have the five novels alone .

		Both sets are edited by Dr.
Gustavus Howard Mayna	PERSON	- dier , and are illustrated in photogravure .

		The favor accorded
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	's `` New Standard Dictionary '' has led to the publication of a new library edition of the work .

		For those seeking an inex - pensive lexicon of compact dimensions , this one offers several points of desirability .

		It contains nearly all words in general use , with a considerable number appear - ing now for the first time in a dictionary .

		The defi - nitions , while short , seem to be sufficiently explicit .

		Biographical and geographical dictionaries , with much other useful matter of the same sort , are contained in an Appendix .

		A special feature of interest , not usually found in similar works , is the series of colored plates , eleven in all .

		In addition , there are hundreds of draw - ings in the text and a number of full-page illustrations .

		The volume is neatly bound in half leather , and provided with a thumb index .

Senator HOAR	ORGANIZATION	'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY of SEVENTY YEARS ' • Indeed , so packed is it with memorable things that the reviewer , se - lecting here and there a chapter or a passage for special notice , feels like one gathering pebbles on the seashore / * -- The Dial .

		`` A book which , considered as , a contribution to the materials of American history , will rank with
Benton	PERSON	's ` Thirty Years in the
U. S. Senate	ORGANIZATION	' and
Blaine	PERSON	's ` Twenty Years in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, ' is the Auto - biography of Seventy Years , by
George F. Hoar	PERSON	.

		From one point of view the narrative is decidedly superior to either of the works with which we have compared it .

		The author is not only a statesman but also a scholar and a man of letters .

		It may be doubted whether any citizen who has played for an equal length of time an important part in American politics has possessed in an equal measure the gifts and the attainments that make an accomplished writer . ''

		--
New York	LOCATION	Sun .

		`` Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's sense of humor is keen and his book is illuminated con - stantly with flashes of fun that relieve its more solid qualities .

		It is a dignified , optimistic , entertaining , and inspir - ing record of a long and useful life . ''

		NOTES 479 TOPICS LN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 481 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 482 TEE HERD ER C ENTENARY .

		On the eighteenth of the present month , it will be one hundred years since
Johann Gott	PERSON	- fried Herder died at
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		The
German Department of the Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	has arranged for that date a memorial celebra - tion for the purpose of calling renewed attention to the intellectual services of that great thinker as well as to the singular elevation of the char - acter which gave to those services a heightened impressiveness .

		It is well that we should thus recall the memory of the distinguished dead , and the centennial pretext , although obviously an artificial one , is as good for that purpose as another .

		It is particularly well that we should recall the memory of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, for he belongs to the class of men whose work , while profoundly influential upon the thought of the age , becomes in time so mingled with the general intellectual current that its special identity ceases for the 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, general consciousness , and is to be restored or recreated only by the student of literary history who takes a plunge into the past for that par - ticular purpose .

		The fame of some men is sufficiently pre - served in their own works , while the fame of others is preserved , largely at least , in the reflection of their influence from minds to which they proved an inspiration .

		We still read
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	for the sake of their genius as embodied in the masterpieces of their creation ; the writings of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , are left undisturbed to collect dust upon our shelves , and even the professed student of German literature will in many instances be compelled to admit that his chief impression of that profound thinker comes from the associa - tion with
Goethe	PERSON	when both were young men at
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		It is indeed fortunate for
Herder	ORGANIZATION	's memory that in his youth he was thrown for a year into the still more youthful companionship of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		We turn over and over again to the
Strassburg	LOCATION	pages in '' Dichtung und Wahrheit '' chiefly , no doubt , to read of the idyl of Sesen - heim ; but the second feature of interest in those pages is provided by the poet 's confession of his indebtedness to the literary critic and philosophical historian who came into his life at just the psychological moment when the ferment of his ideas was ready for clarification , and when he was seeking to set in order the house of his intellect . ''

		Because his talk was always significant , whether he questioned , answered , or communicated himself in some other fashion , he spurred me daily , and even hourly , on to new views ... The more eagerly I received , the more generously he gave , so that the hours we spent together were of the most interesting sort . ''

		Throughout Goethe 's career we find abundant evidence of the fructifying influence of this early association with the philosophical critic , we find it in his broader outlook , in his rigor - ous standards of appreciation , and in his constant striving toward the largest possible synthesis of the facts of nature and human life as presented by direct observation and the examination of the past .

		The history of culture offers no more inter - esting field of study than that of the transition from eighteenth to nineteenth century modes of thought .

		The eighteenth century was arti - ficial ; its successor became natural .

		Rous - seau 's appeal to men to get back into natural ways of thinking and living seems to us now even more significant than it did when it was made over a hundred years ago , for the trans - formation of which his activities concerned only particular phases is now perceived to have been farther-reaching than the compass of all his dreams .

		The world into which
Herder	ORGANIZATION	was born was crystallized by tradition and prescrip - tion .

		Its life was one of convention , its scholar - ship was lacking in philosophical breadth , its whole fashion of thought was trammelled by an artificial method from which even the mighty intellect of Kant could not shake itself free .

		Literature was judged by artificial canons , history was envisaged without perspective , and religion was conceived as a formulary .

		How clearly do all these limitations confront us in the work of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, the typical master-mind of the eighteenth century , who for all his wit , and lucidity , and amazing energy , has an im - portance in the history of intellectual develop - ment that falls far short of what seemed to be his measure to the age in which he made so great a stir .

		Herder was nearly enough the contemporary of Voltaire to justify a comparison between the two men , and in a certain sense the compara - tively obscure German pastor outranks the brilliant French worldling whose intellectual dictatorship hardly brooked a rival .

		We should be the last to underate the magnificent services done for humanity by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	in his crusade against superstition and injustice , but he does not belong to the class of constructive thinkers who constitute the links in the chain of intel - lectual progress .

		Even when his cause was entirely just , he was battling for ideals as old as human thinking ; his face was turned toward the past , and he had no '' Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be '' when the men of a later time should set resolutely about the task of reconstructing the fabric of know - ledge upon the firm foundations of first-hand observation and logical method combined .

		Herder , on the other hand , possessed a sin - gular insight into the underlying and sub - conscious processes that were shaping the intellectual development of the future ; his ideas were germinal where they were not absolutely constructive , and he made all the coming gen - erations his debtor .

		We may not now read his writings , but his thought has become so fully our possession that we are in danger of forgetting that it ever was his thought alone , imposed upon a reluctant age , and made ours through the mediation of Goethe and many lesser men . ''

		Herder gave the initiative in all directions , '' says
Scherer	PERSON	, '' in history , philology , and liter -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 457 ary criticism . ''

		In his character as a Lutheran clergyman , his inflaence on religious thought was marked , and he so outgrew the pietism and narrow orthodoxy of his earlier years that he ended in a modified acceptance of the philos - ophy of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and in the conviction that ** theology is a liberal study , and requires no slavishness of soul . ''

		In a word , he fore - shadowed the higher criticism of the Scriptures , and more than foreshadowed their modern natural interpretation as works of literature .

		As a student of the creative writing of all ages and races he prepared the way for that spirit of cosmopolitanism in appreciation and compari - son which is in our own time bearing rich fruit , and he pointed the way to that conception of world-literature which has ever since held the imagination of far-seeing thinkers .

		He was also one of the pioneers in the modern move - ment which has made of literary criticism much more than a matter of judgment by fixed rules or of rhetorical analysis , and which demands of the critic that he shall be the natural his - torian of literature , taking into account all of the conditions under which work is produced , and occupying the point of view of the men by whom it was written .

		In his unfinished yet monumental treatise on the philosophy of his - tory , he developed a grandiose conception of the scheme of the development of civilization , and of the underlying unity in the annals of mankind .

		The man of whom these things , and many more of like import , may be said is one who deserves well of his posterity , and in this year of the special remembrance of his achievements it is not without profit to ourselves that we turn to his own pages , and learn from them directly something of the obligation of the modern world to his teaching .

		There are few writers of his century with whom we have so much in com - mon , or whose books we may read with less of the feeling that their message has been long outworn , and that they offer standpoints be - yond which we have far advanced .

		If Herder fails of his due effect upon the student of to - day , it is not because his essential ideas have grown antiquated , but rather because they have won such general acceptance , and become so incorporated into the very fibre of our minds , that they seem to us commonplaces of thought , and can no longer appeal to us with the preg - nancy of meaning that was theirs when they flowed directly from the springs of his intel - lectual being , and were charged with the vital - ity of his impressive personality .

		THE ILLUSTRATING OF CHILDREN 'S BOOKS .

		On a shelf in my library is an old volume , now yellow and dog-eared , which was a treasure of my grandmother 's girlhood .

		It was one of the few picture-books vouchsafed the children of a century ago .

		I regard it with more than a book-lover 's affec - tion , and am constrained to look at it when at all pessimistic about the juvenile books which are being put forth by the publishers of to-day ; for it empha - sizes , as nothing else can , the development in the art of making books for children , and teaches us to be thankful for what the young people of the present generation have escaped .

		This volume is '' A
Xew Hieroglyphical Bible	PERSON	for the Amusement and Instruction of Children ; Being a Selection of the most useful Lessons and most interesting Narratives , Scripturally Arranged , from Genesis to the Revelation , Embellished with Famil - iar Figures and Striking Emblems Elegantly En - graved ... Recommended by the Rev 'd
Rowland Hill	PERSON	,
M.A. Xew York	LOCATION	: Printed for and Published by the Booksellers .

		MDCCXCYI . ''

		The Preface further informs us that the author 's object is '' to imprint on the
Memory of Youth	ORGANIZATION	by lively and sensible images the sacred and important truths of Holy Writ , '' and that * • the utmost attention has been paid to select such passages for illustration and embellishment as contained truths the most obvious and important or historical facts the most interest - ing . ''

		Turning over the leaves , we find one of the first i ; obvious and important truths '' to be the fol - lowing , labelled Exodus xxxrx , 28 , -- without a suggestion of context : u And a Mitre of fine linen , and goodly Bonnets of fine linen and linen Breeches of fine twined linen . ''

		The '' striking emblems ele - gantly engraved '' consist of an episcopal mitre , two sunbonnets , and a pair of boy 's trousers .

		-- the pictures taking the place of the words which they are supposed to represent , and thus forming a sort of illustrated rebus to attract and interest the young .

		Contemporary with this stimulating volume was the well-known '' Xew England Primer . ''

		with its crude representation of
Adam	PERSON	's Fall , and its mildly exciting picture of Mr.
John Rogers	PERSON	being consumed at
Smithfield	ORGANIZATION	, with a cheerful smile upon his face , and ; ' His Wife with nine small Children & one at her Breast following him to the Stake . ''

		The period which gave to the children of America the '' Hieroglyphical Bible '' and the `` Xew England Primer '' did not recognize the humorous or the fanciful as in any sense legitimate matter for the young , though the children 's books of that epoch appeal to us of to-day with a humor that is quite irre - sistible .

		A child 's book was then a serious matter , and mere amusement was an end at which it seldom aimed .

		The child was considered quite able to amuse himself without assistance , and the proper function of the book was to instruct , correct , and 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, admonish .

		As the ''
New England	LOCATION	Primer '' had it : '' Thy Life to mend , This hook attend . ''

		Turning from the juvenile volumes of the be - ginning of the nineteenth century to those of to-day is like passing from a darkened room out into the sunshine .

		Illustrating is now a distinct art , and illustrating for children is an important branch of it .

		Some of the best artists of the present genera - tion have devoted their lives to the service of the child ; and the function of illustrating has risen from merely embellishing the text to really inter - preting it .

		We sometimes speak of the illustrations of a book , in connection with its typography and binding , as its '' mechanical features '' ; but this characterization is not as often made as formerly , and should not be made at all .

		The pictures of a child 's book are an organic part of it .

		They are as much to the child as is the text , -- often more than the text , -- and determine in many cases his literary likes and dislikes .

		The interpretation which the artist gives to
Cinderella	LOCATION	may decide whether she is to be admired or only pitied , and
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	may be made an altogether kind and friendly per - son or a frightful semi-savage .

		This influence is , of course , especially strong in the case of the very young .

		A picture is the simplest and most ele - mentary expression of an idea .

		It precedes written language .

		The savage read his primitive stories in picture-writing , before his descendants learned the use of letters ; and as the childhood of the individual is a counterpart of the childhood of the race , the child to-day gets his story also from the picture , before the text is open to him .

		If we grant the importance of pictures in fixing the child 's impressions and forming his tastes , we must see to it that he has good pictures , -- pictures that , first of all , will attract him ; for if they do not attract they will not influence him , unless it be neg - atively .

		Then , while they attract they must also cultivate his ideals of beauty and his appreciation of art , -- for how is he to learn what good art is un - less it is often before him ?

		And , finally , while it is not the function of children 's pictures , as it is not the function of art in the large , to teach morality , they should teach nothing that is low , cruel , or de - basing .

		Having stated , then , as the first requisite of good juvenile pictures that they must attract the child , the question arises , What sort of picture does the child prefer ?

		This is not easily answered .

		I have experimented with children in different grades of the public schools , and with others who have never attended school .

		The experiment has shown that the tastes of children vary almost as much as those of adults , and that they change as the child de - velops .

		There are , however , several well-defined likes that belong to every normal child .

		The child likes color .

		The normal untrained child likes bright color .

		A red hat attracts the infant , while a black hat does not .

		But as the child grows , he comes to see beauty also in subdued tones , and his training helps him to do this .

		He should never be taught , however , to despise pure bright color .

		The love of it is the natural heritage of the child , and he never outgrows it .

		All that we need concern ourselves about is to show him the beauty of harmonious combinations , and he will soon come to dislike those that are inharmonious .

		Again , the child naturally likes a broad , simple treatment , whether in color or in black-and-white .

		This fondness for simplicity is somewhat modified , as the child grows older , by an interest in detail - r but it may safely be affirmed that a child of two years or less does not want detail in a picture .

		He wants only a distinct impression .

		My little girl at the age of two preferred a series of simple outline drawings in a '' First Reader '' to all her other pic - tures .

		There was a cat which she could see at a glance , and a cup which she instantly recognized as a familiar friend .

		This stage was passed in due season , and she began to show interest in a cat with a bell around its neck , and a cup with figures on it ; but it was not until the perceptive faculties had developed that the love of detail came to her , and even when it did come it did not supplant the fond - ness for simple treatment and clear images .

		It does not do this in any normal child .

		The tendency of modern illustrators is to go back to the antique .

		The child is confronted with archaic line-drawings suggestive of Dttrer and the early German wood-engravers .

		All the life and dramatic interest of a situation are conventionalized out of it , and the dead remains are set forth in faded colors with a decorative framework of historic or - nament .

		Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	is perhaps the best - known exponent of this style .

		Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, in his later work , seems also to have adopted it , though he mingles with it the poster style , which is even more conventional , and at least equally objectionable .

		The poster style seems to be borrowed from the Japanese .

		It has some elements that appeal to children .

		It may , from one point of view , be re - garded as the child 's own method of expressing his ideas of form , as he draws his outline with a pencil and fills it in with the colors from his paint-box .

		But it is adapted only to the simplest subjects , and the average modern artist makes a mistake in trying to show by means of it all the details of a complex story .

		He gives us a background of distant trees which have no distance at all , but in which the figures of his foreground seem to be hopelessly entangled .

		This idea of ignoring perspective and making objects at a dozen different distances all appear to be in a single plane , after the Japanese fashion , is entirely vicious .

		It is an affectation , which copies the faults quite as servilely as the merits of the method it affects .

		Another manifes - tation of this conventional insanity is seen in con - centric spirals of hair and beard , and in hard ellip - soid clouds lying on a sky of parallel lines .

		Now , a child does not want to see his Crusoe or his Sinbad
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 459 stiffened into a knave of spades .

		He does not care for the decorative .

		What he wants is life .

		A boy of eight made a fair criticism on one of these crowded , flat , ultra-conventional illustrations , when he gave as his reason for not liking it that it was `` all muggled up . ''

		The illustration was one of Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	's , but was in that artist 's most involved and chaotic manner .

		No modern illustrator perhaps possesses more sympathy with children , or can make more delightfully attractive figures of little folks when he keeps to the simple treatment ; but he often attempts more than the method which he has chosen will allow .

		What is true of Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	is true also of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	, Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	, Mr.
Heywood Sumner	PERSON	, the Rhead brothers , and other well-known illustrators whose skill is un - questioned but who have become so wedded to this particular method as to refuse to recognize its lim - itations .

		One of the best exponents of the legiti - mate use of linear drawing is the French illustrator ,
M. Boutet de Monvel	PERSON	, who appreciates the beauty of simplicity , and who possesses , moreover , the rare sympathy with child-life and child-nature which is so essential in work for children .

		Another quality which is almost a sine qua non in pictures for children is action .

		Children like to see things go .

		and the figures which appeal to them are those which are doing something .

		A boy in the second grade chose a spirited picture .

		• • A is for archer , '' by Mr.
Stuart Hardy	PERSON	, in preference to a decorative treatment of
Grimm	PERSON	's girl at the well , by Mr.
Crane	PERSON	.

		When asked why , he replied , • • Because I like to shoot . ''

		The picture must tell a story in order to interest the average child , and the story must be such as he can appreciate .

		This leads me to say that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is one of the most thoroughly satisfactory of modern illustrators for children .

		He is known mainly through his black - and-white pictures in the Nister books .

		Mother Goose ,
Andersen	PERSON	's and
Grimm	PERSON	's stories , and a few other volumes of the same class .

		His figures are drawn with a few strong strokes of the pen .

		and de - pict the most beautiful and most lovable children .

		Besides the life and spirit which his drawings show , there is also sympathy , imagination , a rare sense of the humorous , and a treatment of the grotesque which never descends to coarseness .

		If his pictures lack at times the perfect naturalness of
M. Boutet de Monvel	ORGANIZATION	's , they compensate for the loss by more of grace and vigor .

		Miss
Fanny Cory	ORGANIZATION	has done some excellent things in a similar style , and gives promise of becoming one of our most successful illustrators for children .

		Beauty is a quality which children are not slow to discover and appreciate in a picture .

		They like pictures of beautiful children .

		Miss Maud Hum - phrey 's little doll-faced cherubs are perhaps a shade too pretty .

		Certain boys , upon arriving at the su - perior age of twelve to fourteen years , affect to scoff at them : but it is doubtful , after all , whether the contempt is not directed mainly toward the elabo - rate frills and ruffles which encircle them .

		Miss
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	's quaint little figures are pictur - esquely attractive , and though the fitful aesthetic impulse which gave them birth has passed away there is something too sweet and beautiful in them to let them grow old .

		Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	's chil - dren are always popular .

		True , they are idealized children : if they were not , they would lose much of their charm , -- for children themselves are idealists .

		Their admiration goes out toward the things that are different from the everyday , and an ideal face ap - peals to them where a face expressing individuality does not .

		The tendency of modern art is to despise ideal beauty and to strive for individuality -- for character .

		It is a tendency which does not meet with the approval of childhood .

		As to the grotesque , it does not appeal equally to all children .

		Young children usually dislike it , though they are sometimes fascinated by it as ani - mals are charmed by a serpent .

		There is in most children a stage , which begins at the age of about six or seven and lasts for several years , during which this desire for the extravagant , the uncouth , and the terrible sometimes becomes a passion .

		To fail to recognize the craving is usually to drive your children to satisfy it , sometimes surreptitiously , with the worst possible material .

		There is the grotesquely fearful and the grotesquely comic , and both have their fascination at this period .

		Your child will probably try your soul by discarding the artistic picture-books which you have bought him and showing a decided preference for the adventures of ''
Buster Brown	PERSON	'' and '' the Katzenjammer Kids , '' as depicted in vivid red , blue , and yellow on the pages of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper .

		Discourage these pictures by all means ; but give him something good to take their place , -- something really funny , that is bright wiihout being lurid and comical without being vulgar .

		Mr.
Denslow	PERSON	has done some good things in this field , though he often comes perilously near the line of vulgarity .

		An expurgated edition of his • ' Father Goose , '' which should omit about one picture in ten , would make an excellent nonsense - book for children , and would satisfy this temporary demand for the grotesque .

		As to the grotesquely terrible , your child must have a little of it if he insists , but do n't let him have it at night if you value either his comfort or your own .

		A child must be treated tenderly at this pe - riod , and the imaginative nature , which is then most intense , must be so trained as to lead him to enjoy the fanciful in beauty rather than in ugliness .

		Fair - ies are better than hobgoblins , and the child should be allowed all the fairies he wants , until he outgrows them and asks for something more substantial .

		Children like animal pictures in almost any form , -- dictionary - and geography animals included .

		The most delicately fanciful treatment that has perhaps ever been given to the animal creation is that of Mr.
F. S. Church	PERSON	.

		Church 's animals combine the im - aginative , the poetic , the grotesque , -- all with the 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, most delicate sense of humor , and with a sympa - thetic touch that makes the child at one with them .

		So much for what the child likes .

		But his pic - tures should not only give him what he likes , -- they should give it to him in the best possible way .

		The touch of the true artist should be manifest in them .

		Your child will find color in the vivid pictures of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper already referred to , and at first he will appreciate it in that form quite as much as in the most artistic color-plates which you can get for him .

		He will find a broad and attractive treatment in the advertisements in the street-cars , and will be quite pleased with them .

		He will find action in the scrawls which he makes upon his slate , ■ and will satisfy his craving for the grotesque with the crudest of caricatures .

		But here is where he needs your careful and discriminating guidance .

		Let his books be illustrated by a master-hand , and accustom him to the best art .

		It will not be long before he will recognize and appreciate it .

		By the best art , I do not mean necessarily that of Botticelli or of
Raphael	PERSON	, though he should know some of the world 's great art works as soon as he is old enough to understand them .

		I mean simply good art , whether the drawing be that of a tin cup or of a cathedral .

		There are too many illustrators who try to atone for poor draughtmanship by a wealth of carefully wrought details , -- textures , shadows , and all that .

		Scores of amateurs have found a market for their work in the multiplicity of modern books , but their touch is readily discernible .

		Their figures are wooden or putty , and their faces are expression - less or idiotic .

		The child naturally assumes that the pictures which adorn his books are right pictures , and from them he gets his ideas of drawing , -- his first im - pression of what art is .

		There is no harm in giving him such entirely natural and enjoyable scrawls as those which illustrate
Lear	PERSON	's Nonsense Books .

		The ■ child is not deceived by them .

		He takes them as a , joke , and the joke is healthful and stimulating .

		These pictures of
Lear	PERSON	's , with all their crudity , are far more expressive than many finished pictures which the child finds in his books and which he supposes to be in some sort a standard of artistic excellence because they pretend to be something .

		Do not buy for your child books which are falsely or poorly illustrated .

		Better give him no pictures at all than wrong ones .

		Should you not teach him good art as well as good literature ?

		Many a man confesses with regret that he does not know the difference between a good picture and a bad one .

		If this is true of you , see to it that your children know more about such matters than you do ; and if you can not trust yourself to select their picture - books , ask the assistance of some friend in whose discrimination you have confidence .

		The well - illustrated book costs a little more , sometimes , than the poorly illustrated book , but not always , -- and if it costs more it is worth more .

		Often it does not < ; ost more , but only requires a little more care and judgment in its selection .

		We come now to the moral effect of pictures .

		They should not be used as a vehicle for teaching morality , but on the other hand they should never by inference or example teach immorality , -- and by immorality I mean anything that is mean or degrading .

		I have before me a child 's book in which several boys are pictured as having tied a tin can to a dog 's tail , and are immensely amused at the struggles of the poor beast to rid himself of it , as he flees wildly down the street .

		The accompany - ing story ends with the moral that this was a very wrong thing for the boys to do ; but the artist has not expressed this saving moral conclusion .

		Both story and picture are bad ; for while one boy will pity the dog , another will think it a good joke and will perhaps decide to try the experiment on the next unfortunate canine that crosses his path .

		A small boy of my acquaintance became highly interested , not long ago , in the adventures of a naughty youth presented in the comic supplement of a well-known newspaper .

		The youth in the news - paper shampooed his sister 's hair , and anointed the poodle , with a mixture of ink , glue , and the family hair-tonic , leaving the remainder of the compound in the bottle for the use of his father and mother .

		The results , as pictorially set forth , were so intensely amusing that the small observer immediately took steps to repeat them in real life .

		Much mischief is suggested in such ways as this , and the sugges - tions come from artists who have little sympathy with children , knowing them mainly as a theme to make jokes about .

		All this emphasizes the point that the true artist for children must have sympathy as well as experi - ence with his audience , must know what is good for them , and must love them too much to offer any - thing that is not of his best .

		The artist shows his character in his work .

		Let it be a good character , and your children will unconsciously imbibe from his pictures heroism , gentleness , and nobility .

		Let it be a mean character , and its influence will be mean .

		Fortunately , there are plenty of good men and women who are illustrating children 's books , and who are putting into their work not only skill and genius , but also good judgment , sympathy , and love .

		Let the parents and teachers , -- those who buy books for the children of the present generation , -- but discriminate in their choice , realizing that the picture is as important as the printed page in form - ing taste and influencing character , and they will soon see in their children the results of this power - ful educative influence .

		They will see , too , an improvement in the illustrations of the books which are being offered to the young .

		Publishers will not issue poorly illustrated books , if it is found that well illustrated books are in demand .

		It is thus in the power of book-buyers to raise the character of all books by demanding what is best , -- not what is most expensive , but what is elevating both to the taste and to the morals .

		Disraeli Self-Portrayed .

		* Close on the heels of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's
Gladstone	PERSON	comes a life of his great rival ,
Disraeli	PERSON	.

		It would have been too much to expect from Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	a biography equal to Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's ; and so no one will be disappointed .

		Neverthe - less it is somewhat remarkable that no writer has yet come forward to make full and satis - factory use of the wealth of biographical mate - rial left behind him , now more than twenty years ago , by the
Earl of Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		Per - haps this may be explained in part by the fact that he is a far less sympathetic subject than his great antagonist .

		His brilliance , his wit , his statecraft , his indomitable determination to overcome disadvantages of race and station and to raise himself to the summit of his ambi - tions , compel our admiration ; but hardly would one wish , either as writer or as reader , to linger over the not always edifying details of that astonishing conquest of success , as one lingers over the successive stages of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's rise .

		Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	does well to call his book an unconventional biography made up as it is very largely of selections from
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's con - versations and writings .

		Book I. , forming the first third of the volume , is entitled , '' His Talk from Youth to Old Age . ''

		The second book , which comprises the remaining two - thirds , is headed , '' His Letters , Books , and Public Life . ''

		The work is thus a scrap-book rather than a formal biography ; it furnishes no complete and consecutive account of the man 's career , and no large view of him in rela - tion to his country and his time .

		It will serve some future biographer as a valuable source to draw from , and meanwhile it will amuse the lover of personal anecdote and the unassiduous student who likes a book that can be opened anywhere and closed at any time without doing violence to the narrative .

		The arrangement is topical rather than chronological , and the para - graph and page headings serve as useful finger - posts to the desultory reader .

		The author refers to himself , not as a biographer , but as a collector of
Disraeliana	LOCATION	, and he is manifestly enamored of his chosen subject .

		To him Dis - raeli is a hero , else the book had never been written .

		A few quotations will give a taste of *

		its quality .

		The reported utterances of Disraeli are hardly ever to be taken at their face value .

		With him truth was a pearl not to be cast before swine ; or , to use the author 's words , -- ■ Some people we all know whom we , serious , refuse to treat seriously ... ' Before you can understand
Pitt	PERSON	, you must understand
Shelburne	LOCATION	, ' Disraeli once said ; and before you can interpret the sayings of Dis - raeli , you must in some instances have an acquaintance with the character of those to whom they were spoken . ''

		By a curious chance , both the names by which we know the author of ''
Contarini Fleming	ORGANIZATION	'' are variously pronounced . ''

		Oh , knock out the apostrophe ; it looks so foreign .

		Write my name in one word -- Disraeli . ''

		This to a newspaper editor when the young politician was canvassing the
Maidstone	LOCATION	vote .

		The name ''
Israel	LOCATION	, '' according to Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	, indicates the correct pronunciation of '' Disraeli '' ; and the Countess of
Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, we are told by
Lord Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	, once gave him very emphatic - ally to understand that she was not the
Countess of Beckonsfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		Friction in this small matter being smoothed away , we proceed .

		Disraeli 's early shifting from party to party , and his unheroic encounter with
O'Connell	PERSON	, our author presents in as favorable a light as pos - sible .

		Of the eccentricities and absurdities of conduct and attire by which the young novelist sought to attract attention , little is said ; and we are willing to pass over them as belonging to the follies of youth .

		Disraeli 's relations to his family , especially his love for his sister
Sarah	PERSON	, as evidenced by his letters to her , are matters one may dwell on with pleasure .

		`` Domestic love -- the patrimony of the Jewish race had a conspicuous illustration in
Disraeli	LOCATION	; and he knew , even when he wrote of schoolboy life , the love that two men of his race felt for each other , passing the love of women .

		His love for his father makes a delightful record ; there is nothing quite like it to be found in the memoirs of other statesmen , from
Pitt	PERSON	to
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	and
Gladstone	PERSON	... This familiar love of fathers and brothers was not then so common among Englishmen as it now is .

		Some sons rarely saw their fathers , thought of them and addressed them by formal titles , and never kissed them .

		Disraeli was too manly to think that affection unmanned men ; and in this regard he may be quoted as one of the revivers of masculine friendship among Englishmen . ''

		We read , too , of
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's private character , that he was by nature so averse to all that is questionable in conversation and anecdote that no one dared twice tell him a story unfit for ears polite .

		Further matters of personal in - terest are contained in the following : ''
Disraeli	PERSON	, who knew railways when they were yet a novelty , never got over a certain nervousness about catching a train .

		... In other ways than those of the 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, rail ,
Disraeli	PERSON	showed himself a man of instant anxieties .

		A seemingly phlegmatic man may in reality be a very nervous man ... Disraeli had the nervous man 's one hope -- courage .

		He did not fly ; he overcame .

		He liked to be asked to the Royal Academy Banquet ; but on such occasions there was an indigestion under his plate in the slip of paper containing the name of his toast .

		His buttoning and unbuttoning of his coat during the stress of a Parliamentary oration , his handkerchief play , and half his gestures , were the tricks of a speaker in search of distractions that put him and his audience at ease .

		He never made a speech of any consequence that did not cost him a moment of reluctance . ''

		That this nervousness never stood in the way of a swift and masterly despatch of business , we may rest well assured .

		Bismarck , as quoted by our author , has said of him : '' I repeatedly had
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	to spend the evening with me during the
Berlin Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		As he was unwell he only came oti condition of being alone , and I thus had many an opportunity of getting to know him well .

		I must say that in spite of his fantastic novel - writing , he is a capable statesman , far above
Gortschakoff	PERSON	and many others .

		It was easy to transact business with him .

		In a quarter of an hour you knew exactly how you stood with him ; the limits to which he was prepared to go were clearly defined , and a rapid summary soon defined -LSB- sic -RSB- matters .

		Beaconsfield speaks magnificent and melodious English , and has a good voice . ''

		Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's liking for Disraeli and aver - sion for
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	are well known .

		`` Gladstone treats the Queen like a public department , '' said
Disraeli	PERSON	, in explanation ; '' I treat her like a woman . ''

		It has elsewhere been recorded that the Queen gave as one reason of her dis - comfort in
Gladstone	LOCATION	's presence , that he always addressed her as if she had been a public as - sembly .

		Yet before yielding her approval and confidence to his political opponent , she had to overcome strong prejudices . ''

		She , more than most , had to overcome prejudices against the alien , against the trespasser upon the en - closure of British politics , against the fiction-writer 's appearance upon the stage of fact .

		The Prince Con - sort 's dislike for him was another bar to his approach to the Queen ; and the
Court	ORGANIZATION	's conversion to the Repeal of the Corn Laws , together with its adhesion to the popular reverence for Peel , produced something ap - proaching a feeling of positive dislike for the stripling
David	PERSON	who with a rude sling of speech brought low the Goliath of the
Philistines	LOCATION	.

		Little did the Queen im - agine in those days that
Disraeli	PERSON	was to be more to her than Peel : more to her than even
Melbourne	LOCATION	, that very fine British gentleman to whom she brought the affec - tionate homage which the young girl yields to the most accomplished man of the world among her senior friends ; that he was to rank , not merely as her Prime Miuister , in the ordinary sense of the term , but as the Prime Minister among all the ministers of her long reign . ''

		In discussing these two statesmen ,
Gladstone	PERSON	and Disraeli , Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	shows plainly to which of the opposing camps he belongs .

		He speaks of
Gladstone	LOCATION	as having '' the habit of identifying himself with the Deity and his opponent with the Devil , '' and adds : '' Glad - stone had , from the first , formed a low opinion of Disraeli .

		There are those who say that he joined the Liberal ranks because he could not bear association with
Disraeli	PERSON	in the Tory . ''

		In proof of the favorite minister 's attachment to the Queen , a letter of his is given , written in
1879	DATE	, soon after a slight misunderstanding between the two .

		One paragraph may be cited . ''

		I love the Queen -- perhaps the only person in this world left to me that I do love ; and therefore you can understand how much it worries and disquiets me when there is a cloud between us .

		It is very foolish on my part , but my heart , unfortunately , has not withered like my frame , and when it is affected , I am as harassed as I was fifty years ago . ''

		Of
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's witty sayings the book contains a good number , but not all of unquestionable paternity -- as , indeed , the author admits .

		To an author , in acknowledgment of his book , he is reported to have said , '' Many thanks ; I shall lose no time in reading it . ''

		Much the same formula is ascribed to
Gladstone	LOCATION	.


Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, as cited by Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	, made use of a still neater phrase when , after a few compliments , he concluded with `` I am lying under a sense of obligation . ''

		One more smart saying of Disraeli 's , and we have done . ''

		Everybody knows the stages of a lawyer 's career -- he tries in turn to get on , to get honors , to get honest . ''

		As already remarked , this entertaining volume is not to be taken too seriously .

		There is diversion , and also infor - mation , to be found within its covers , and the many illustrations add greatly to the interest ; but a full , critical , and impartial biography it decidedly is not , and does not pretend to be .

		THE DIAL 463 when finding this legendary matter under the title '' history . ''

		No one would think of com - paring the work wjth
Winsor	PERSON	's '' Westward Movement '' or Doctor
Hosmer	PERSON	's ''
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, '' two scholarly and discriminative works covering the same ground ; it is rather to be placed on the same shelf with Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's `` Winning of the West '' and
Albach	PERSON	's '' Western Annals . ''

		A description of
Champlain	LOCATION	's discoveries opens the volume , under the happy title , '' On the Brim of the
Great Basin	LOCATION	. ''

		Stories of the later French explorations in the
Valley	LOCATION	proper follow in order , condensed from Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's translation of the `` Jesuit Relations . ''

		A chap - ter on the Indians in
the Valley	LOCATION	is followed by a description of the expulsion of the French .

		Accounts of
Pontiac	LOCATION	and
Dunmore	ORGANIZATION	's wars ,
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	's expedition , the battle of
King 's Mountain	ORGANIZATION	, Spanish intrigue in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, and the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, make up the bulk of the volume .

		Interspersed are chapters on frontier life and on the Christian Indians .

		The volume is difficult to estimate or to clas - sify .

		The reproduction of many old maps and original illustrations would lead one to expect a thorough treatise based on the sources of information .

		On the contrary , the material is almost without exception second-hand .

		Fre - quently passages and even paragraphs are quoted from some present-day writer , with proper acknowledgement .

		There is no bibliog - raphy , but the local histories of the states in the Valley must have been drawn upon largely for the details and stories .

		In the same way , the illustrations include some rare and instructive reproductions , with others that require a strong imagination to determine their pertinency to the subject-matter .

		Portraits of General and Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	appear , for instaDce , in a chapter on
Frontier Life	ORGANIZATION	about
1775	DATE	.

		The naming of
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, furnishes the raison d'etre for a portrait of
Marie Antoinette	ORGANIZATION	.

		One portrait of
George Rogers Clark	ORGANIZATION	bears the legend , `` Said to be from life '' ; and another , '' Said to be the only portrait from life now in existence . ''

		Somehow this reminds one of the skull of
St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	when a boy .

		The title on
Lewis	PERSON	's map has managed to creep around to a margin .

		No doubt many readers will follow the ancient legends and enjoy them fully as much as if they had not been disproved again and again .


George Rogers Clark	PERSON	will continue to lean with folded arms against the door-post at
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	, and bid the dancers continue -- but to remember that they are dancing under
Virginia	LOCATION	and not
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		This story , first emanating from
Denney	LOCATION	, is clearly dis - credited by
Clark	ORGANIZATION	's narrative and by the other contemporary descriptions in the
Draper MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		collection .

		Clark 's brave expedition into the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	is here given credit for the Amer - ican title to the region in the peace negotia - tions , regardless of the fact that the American negotiators never mentioned
Clark	PERSON	, and Con - gress gave them no instructions that mentioned him or his expedition .

		The Jesuit `` college '' at
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	still finds a place in this history .

		The absurdity of an institution of higher learn - ing at an Indian mission in
Illinois	LOCATION	in
1721	DATE	ought to stop the circulation of the story from very suspicion , even if different investigators had not shown that '' the Jesuits from the seminary at
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	'' meant Jesuits in
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	from the seminary at
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		The inscription , `` D. Boon cilled a bar , '' on a tree near the head of Wautauga , is referred to as confidently as though it rested on some good authority .


John Sevier	PERSON	is picturesquely made into a fugitive from justice , although he was dwelling quietly in
Greene	PERSON	county until elected to the state legislature in
1789	DATE	.

		These are illustrations of history as it is written from current books and legendary tales , instead of from the sources of historical fact and know - ledge . ''

		Strenuousness '' is evidently the motive sought in all actions of the pioneers , and of the national government concerning them .

		This '' my country '' style of writing history ignores the fact that there is another side to the story .

		The authors bitterly arraign
Britain	LOCATION	for using Indians in the Revolutionary war , yet the use made of them by the Americans is barely men - tioned .

		The action of the Spanish authorities at
New Orleans	LOCATION	in closing the port in
1802	DATE	is condemned as a violation of the treaty made seven years before ; yet a reading of the treaty would have shown that the right of deposit was limited to three years , and had long since been abrogated because not renewed .

		In another place , a chief reason why
Napoleon	PERSON	sold
Louis	LOCATION	- iana is said to have been his fear lest the fierce Americans would pass down the river with the current and make war upon
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		An interview with
Napoleon	PERSON	on this point would be interesting , although scarcely supportive .

		The swashbuckler style of American history might be passed without comment , if it did not breed jingoism and offensive ultra-Amer - icanism .

		On the other hand , it must be said 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, that the book is likely to prove attractive to the general reader , and that any production which may lead to the study of local history is to be commended .

		The handsome appearance of the volume will no doubt attract attention to a perusal of its contents .


Edwin E. Sparks	PERSON	.

		An
Heir of Velasquez	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The writer about painting , even when ad - dressing himself to general rather than special interests , must always remember that it is the • outside , the appearauce , of things that is pri - marily the painter 's concern , and that he is limited to a single aspect of his subject and to a single instant of time .

		The failure to realize this fundamental difference between the art of the painter and the art of the writer is a pro- lific source of much literary misappreciation of painters ' work .

		The very thing that is deserv - ing of highest praise , -- that quality of the picture that makes its excellence altogether of its own kind , -- is thus counted against it as a fault , and the splendid self-containment that holds the painter strictly to his own terms is reckoned as narrowness or superficiality of view .

		In the making of an illustrated art book , it has been quite impossible until lately to pro- duce plates that are the just equivalent in light and shade of the works themselves .

		It follows , therefore , that we have often to take what the writer of the text has to say about the pictures with a large measure of trust , for we are unable , on account of the imperfections of the reproductions , to determine from our own independent standpoint whether this or that judgment be faulty or sound .

		But there is no such difficulty in the case of the volume under review .

		The reproductions are so per - fectly executed , and convey so exact an idea of the originals , that most of us will accept the very high praise of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's introduc - tory note , and lend our consent to an estimate which , subtly implicit to the last clause , finally affirms that
John S. Sargent	PERSON	is `` one of the family of Velasquez , and no less than his chief heir . ''

		Were the sixty-two photogravure plates here presented one touch less excellent than they are ; were they not such that the significance of no single brush stroke is confused or lost ; * The Work of
John S. Sargent	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	With Intro - ductory Note by Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	.

		London :
William Heinemann	PERSON	.

		New York : Imported by
Charles Seribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		such , in a word , as only the most highly evolved processes of reproduction in this kind could make them , we might hesitate , judging only from the evidence in hand , to accept so high a verdict .

		As it is , we are able to follow the master line for line , and value for value , and almost tint for tint -- for such perfection of light and shade has in its suggestion the full potency of the colors themselves ; and our conclusions need be hardly more or less at fault than if we had before us the paintings themselves .

		The introductory note by Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	is brief , comprising hardly more than four thou - sand words , but it is vastly suggestive .

		It brings before the mind all of those considera - tions that bear upon the subject as it concerns those for whom pictures are made .

		It also presents the claims of the art considered as handicraft ; for , as the writer points out , tech - nical procedure , while on one side the concern only of those who paint or are trying to , is also an unnegligible quantity for others , when , as in this art of painting , it becomes so very a part of what addresses itself to all , and is perceived by all .

		There is a '' display '' of the brush made familiar to us in a good deal of modern paint - ing that has little in common with Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's splendid assurance , we might almost say auda - city , of procedure .

		But even in such a por - trait as ''
Carmencita	PERSON	, '' or in that of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	finds to make '' permanent , too singly , one aspect of an often altering face '' -RRB- , Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	does not seem to be consciously recommending his art .

		Though the manner in which he has given the effect of life to these painted images is greatly impres - sive , so also are some characteristics of the people depicted .

		Not even in those portraits in which the technical method most asserts itself does it seem to arrogate authority , or to claim for itself anything higher than a ser - vant 's place .

		But while Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's most conspicuously - displayed art of painting seems not for its own sake , but rather for the subject 's , it would ap - pear that perception had been here and there too instant , and touch too swift , to get quite at the heart of the matter .

		So , while in the opinion of the reviewer , no exception can fairly be taken to the most commanding exhibition of a skill perhaps incomparable in modern painting , some of these portraits do , as Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	suggests , hold us too definitely and firmly to the chosen aspect of the subject .

		We have a vivid realization of a particular appear -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 465 ance of the person , but remain uninformed to a degree as to what that person is at other times and under other circumstances of lighting and of place .

		There are , however , many of Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's pictures that seem to carry a clear suggestion of the whole personality .

		He appears often to have divined what intimacy reveals , and to make us feel as though we had known the subject long and well .

		Those portraits that tell us most about their subjects are , as a rule , less pictorially impressive than the ones that fix our attention more exclusively to the appear - ance of the person in the selected moment .

		They would be less arresting seen on a gallery wall , and at a distance ; but they hold our in - terest longer , for they get nearer to that mean of character , that blend and union of compos - ite traits , that is the person . ''

		Miss
Cary Thomas	PERSON	, '' `` Lady
Agnew	PERSON	, '' `` Lord
Watson	PERSON	, '' and `` Lord
Russell	PERSON	of Killowen '' are notable examples of this wholeness of characterization , and we find their pictorial simplicity and un - aggressiveness a condition of this wholeness .

		It had not been our privilege until we saw this volume to know those works of Mr.
Sar	PERSON	- gent that have inspired the highest praise .

		We can now find a warrant for what , judged by the paintings of his that we have seen and by the more or less inadequate reproductions of those that we had not , had seemed extrava - gant laudation .

		We believe the excellence of such portraits as '' The Misses Hunter '' and of those to which we have just referred , as well as of some others , could hardly be overstated , nor can we conceive of any environment of art in which they would fail to assert themselves and make good their own individual claims .

		They have the directness of a
Hals	PERSON	, the solid - ity of a Rembrandt , the combined subtlety and sureness of perception and touch of a Velasquez , and with it all the well-stamped impress of this new master 's hand .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	says that
Rodin	PERSON	recognized the supreme master of painting in the por - trait of that '' bouquet of flowers , '' the three • • Misses Hunter '' ; nor would he , we think , have found less in any one of perhaps a dozen of the pictures here shown .

		But he would , we believe , have been chiefly impressed with an - other distinction , great but not `` supreme '' in this field , in viewing some of the portraits that make up this splendid volume .

		He must have felt what Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	discerns , that the point of view is here and there too `` sudden , '' and that the artist 's sense of some graphically - expressive or captivating aspect of his subject , has been more keen than his appreciation of the character itself , viewed as a whole .

		There is , however , about those of Mr.
Sar	PERSON	- gent 's pictures that fall sensibly short of the greatest distinction , a decorative charm and splendor that is almost if not quite unique in portrait art , and that independently of its truth to life makes each new work of his an event .

		His power to realize the potentialities of his theme , in those ways that minister to the de - light of the eye , is clearly marked in '' El Jaleo '' and in `` A Spanish Dance '' ; and best , perhaps , in that marvellous picture of two chil - dren in a garden , the title of which , ''
Carna	LOCATION	- tion ,
Lily	PERSON	,
Lily	PERSON	, Rose , '' acknowledges the master motive , and where the two children are but incidents of line and color in the entrancing blend and play of evening , day , and candle light .

		Here the artist frankly acknowledges that for him beauty is enough .

		Even in the field into which his genius has been diverted , in works like ''
Madame Gautreau	PERSON	, '' where the motive is portraiture pure and simple , the subject walks hand in hand with the graces , and we are as much convinced of beauty as of life .

		It is in Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's portrait groups , how - ever , that his superb appreciation of the de - lightful possibilities of his subject are most fully displayed .

		The group gives fuller scope than the single figure to his genius for captiva - ting arrangement of picture furniture , and for the employment of those devices of foil and counter-foil , accent and contrast , that make pictures pleasant to look upon .

		Apart from his '' Carnation ,
Lily	PERSON	,
Lily	PERSON	, Rose , '' which we think has no rival for purely aesthetic charm in all this artist 's work , his three groups of '' The Misses Hunter , '' '' The Ladies
Alexandra	PERSON	,
Mary	PERSON	, and
Theo Acheson	PERSON	, '' and '' Lady Elcho , Mrs.
Tennant	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Adeane	PERSON	, '' have peculiarly the qualities that touch us where music does .

		These are subordinated in the impression of the first-named group to our sense of what the subjects themselves are , -- and this is the picture 's great distinction ; while in the others our delight in the fluent grace of line and in the harmony of the forms and color is more vivid than our appreciation of the things that a portrait should first make clear , and from which no graces or beauty of its style should be able to divert attention .

		Nor is the first of these three groups anything less than superb in all its superficial art .

		It is in the very best manner of this master ; and yet , first and last , mastering our consciousness of 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, all graciousness of an art that to pause upon is to marvel at , we are held by these living vital presences , and all the grace and beauty of the pictorial arrangement is as an open door leading to them .

		It is to be remarked in even the briefest note on Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's work , that he paints man , woman , and child with an equal art ; nor are we able to say , after a careful comparison of the examples shown , that he excels in any one of these three directions ; for whether it be a man 's strength , a woman 's charm , or a child 's naivete that is his concern , his sympathy seems equally engaged and his art equally fit .

		In his portraits of children , we must find that characteristic of his genius which makes some pictures impress us as too '' sudden '' in their point of view , a first condition of their great charm .

		A child 's face is as plastic as potter 's clay , as quickly changing as
April	DATE	weather .

		All is fluent , mobile , unfixed .

		Art then , to fix it , must be instant in perception and swiftly sure in touch .

		Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's art is , almost ideally , both ; and because it is , he has been able to catch that flashing butterfly thing , a child 's soul , as it shows on the face of it .

		Speaking lightly , it might be said of Mr.
Sar	PERSON	- gent 's portraits of men that they are '' speaking likenesses '' ; but the description would leave what is best in them undefined .

		Notably in his portrait of Mr.
Asher Wertheimer	PERSON	would this be the case .

		There is much more here than could ever come out in the man 's speech , more even than he is silently conscious of .

		We feel in looking at this portrait that we should know what he would do , even before he himself had made up his mind about it .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	calls attention to the fine way in which Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	differentiates the English lady from women of any other race or class .

		Her observation would apply equally well to the English gentleman , and here .

		This head and figure are most deeply informed with things racial and con - genital ; face and gesture are so animated with the spirit of that unconscious ego that has the casting vote in closely balanced alternatives , that what would still be an open question for him is for us a foregone conclusion .

		In a word we are convinced that through Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's portrait we know Mr.
Asher Wertheimer	PERSON	bet - ter than he knows himself . ''

		All whose interest and care it is to be well informed about what great painters are doing , must feel indebted to the publishers of this volume for thus bringing this master 's most representative work within our reach .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	says : '' The coming of a great painter is so rare , and his contemporaries are so much and so often taken by surprise by the annual exhibition of his genius , that it must be difficult for them to assure themselves of what he is . ''

		Those whose privilege it is to possess or to have access to this book will find it less difficult to reach such assurance .

		a New Book about
Hawthorne	PERSON	.

		* If we can not adopt the enthusiastic sugges - tion of the publishers and welcome Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	's new book as '' the most important and valuable literary contribution of the year , '' we can pronounce it a volume of extreme inter - est , and well worthy of a place in the rapidly accumulating mass of material upon which someone will ultimately base an adequate his - tory of the
New England	LOCATION	writers of the last century .

		After saying this much , we must stop and point with some indignation at a few of the flies unnecessarily present in the ointment .

		In the first place the volume is full of passages to which the reader , for various reasons , will wish to turn again ; but there is not the slightest trace of an index to assist one in realizing such a desire .

		The page headings , grouped together at the opening of each chapter in the outward semblance of subject analyses , would have less - ened the difficulty somewhat if they had been selected simply with a view to service .

		But here comes in the second fly in the form of a sacrifice of such service to the method of the headline writer in the daily newspaper . ''

		My Father 's Decapitation , '' '' I Kick My Aunt Lizzie , '' '' Hindlegs , '' '' A Respectable Female Atheist , '' `` Lovely but Reprehensible Madam ! ''

		`` Unsentimental Little Quadruped , '' `` It Gnawed Me Terribly , '' `` Her Skeleton , Huddled , Dry , Awful , '' '' Rivers of Human Gore , '' `` She Ripped the Man Open , '' ``
Fleay	PERSON	, Malarious Paradise , '' '' Not Even a Bone of Her was Left , '' are a few of the headings which strike the eye as one turns the pages rapidly over .

		At the top of one page we find the well known Horatian line , '' Dulce est Desipere in
Loco	LOCATION	. ''

		Very good !

		but Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	should hardly find the allowably pleasant place for playing the fool in the headlines of a book devoted to his father 's memory .

		THE DIAL 467 be supposed that he made the selections , but it is not too much to suppose that he could have prevented such vulgarity .

		We are sorry to say , however , that the evi - dences of bad taste in the volume are not wholly confined to the headings .

		We may illustrate by the flippant references to
James Martineau	PERSON	: `` Like
Emerson	PERSON	, he had ascended a Unitarian pulpit , but , unlike
Emerson	LOCATION	, he stayed there long after what he was pleased to regard as his convictions had ceased to possess even a Uni - tarian degree of religious quality . '' ''

		He was so elevated and superior that one could hardly help believing that he must know something of value , and this illusion was the easier because he did know so much in the way of schol - arly learning . ''

		The Brownings are certainly worthy of respectful treatment , but they fare even worse than Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	.

		After admit - ting graciously that
Browning	PERSON	's son '' was not such a mollycoddle and ass as he looked , '' he continues , '' My mother took him at his moth - er 's valuation , and both she and my father have expressed admiration of the whole
Brown	PERSON	- ing tribe in their published journals . ''

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	herself seemed to him '' a sort of miniature monstrosity ; there was no body to her , only a mass of dark curls and queer , dark eyes , and an enormous mouth with thick lips ; no portrait of her has dared to show the half of it .

		Her hand was like a bird 's claw . ''

		Per - haps Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	would do better to trust the portraits than to base such a description on recollections from mere childhood .

		But after all these unpleasant features are discounted , we still have a book of great value to the history of American letters .

		Its general tone is not unkindly , in spite of such passages as we have quoted concerning the Brownings and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	.

		In some cases the feeling is distinctly warm where others have shown an emphatic tendency in the other direction , -- as with
Charlotte Cushman	PERSON	, who fared so badly in the notable autobiography of
William J. Stillman	PERSON	.

		The attack of
Stillman	PERSON	, however , had none of the flippancy which is so marked a feature in the cases before us .

		Not the least valuable point in Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	's book is the information we get concerning many minor characters with whom his father came into in - timate contact , such as
Herman Melville	PERSON	,
Henry Bright	PERSON	, and
Francis Bennoch	PERSON	.

		The happy home life of the
Hawthorne	PERSON	family is constantly com - ing into the foreground , and this is well , for much of
Hawthorne	ORGANIZATION	's published work lends itself not unnaturally to the mistaken inference that he was not personally of a happy disposi - tion .

		The author promises another volume , at some indefinite time in the future , dealing with his father primarily as a man of letters .

		The best hand to deal with a man 's standing as an artist can hardly be that of a son , but we may at least hope for a more intimate know - ledge of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's literary methods than another would be likely to give .

		Recent Nature Chroxicl.es .

		* Winter is the time to read nature-books .

		`` Id
summer	DATE	, - when the shawes be shene And leaves be large and long , It is full merry in fair forest To hear the fowles ' song . ''

		But it is n't merry at all to stay at home and read about the shawes and the forest and the fowles .

		Even in the autumn , so long as the sunshine holds and the air is full of cheery good-byes from birds southward bound , the best nature-book ever written is but dull business compared with a walk in the open .

		But when winter shuts the nature-lover in , and bids him have recourse to the inward eye which is the bliss of birdless days , the nature-book comes into its own .

		It reenforces the inward eye , and prepares its outward counterpart to see new sights next
spring	DATE	.

		Given a good fire and plenty of nature-books , the lover of birds and blossoms can get through the winter in com - parative comfort .

		If the season 's publications do not provide very plentifully for the nature-lover 's need , they at least furnish one book which is perfect of its kind .

		This is Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	's '' The Clerk of the Woods . ''

		Those who have already seen the brief chapters in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Evening Transcript '' or the
New York	LOCATION	'' Mail and Express '' will be doubly glad to have them printed in this more permanent form .

		468 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, '' expressive of the modest purpose of the writer , whose business was not to be witty or wise , but simply to ' keep the records . ' ''

		The records are kept from
May to May	DATE	, not only of the woods , but of birds and flowers , and -LRB- at least in outline -RRB- of mountain , meadow , and brook .

		They are kept , too , as part of life , and not as something remote .

		No one is more sensitive than Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	to the reaction of out-of-door nature upon human nature ; nor does the inter - play often become too subtle for his power of words .

		Here is a prose poet who has the grace of walking and talking at the same time .

		You are unconscious of reading what he says ; rather you are .

		walking with him and listening , while he brings his delicate power of expression to the service of his love for nature .

		If the winter fire tempts you into analysis when '' The Clerk '' is finished and you have nothing else to do , you will realize that Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	is not so scientific as Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	.

		He does not pursue his subject so far , nor make you so certain that he knows the entire alphabet of it .

		Nor is he so philosophical as
Thoreau	LOCATION	, -- not so bent on knowing the reason of things , nor so given to practical and common-sensible deductions from what he sees .

		He seldom turns the right side of out-door nature over , to show you the wrong side of human nature .

		His work is slight , per - haps , compared with that of either of these great men .

		But it is easy to be happy in his company .

		While you walk with him you know that bluebirds and violets are the really impor - tant things in life , and you are not oppressed either by your own ignorance or by dubious comparisons between nature and civilization .

		Of less general range and less literary excel - lence , but of no less healthiness and sincerity , is Mr.
Walton	PERSON	's '' A Hermit 's Wild Friends . ''

		The writer 's friends are the birds and small animals with whom -LRB- no one will be tempted to say with which , after reading the book -RRB- he has become acquainted in his eighteen years of life on Bond 's Hill ,
Gloucester	LOCATION	.

		`` To some of these wild things , '' he says , '' I am caterer , protector , and friend .

		They do not object to my presence when engaged in domestic affairs , so my ability to pry into their secrets is increased in ratio to the confidence accorded me . ''

		But the word `` prying '' quite belies the hermit 's feeling .

		He and his proteges live together on terms of mutual respect and affection .

		The happy result is that be introduces us , not to species or groups , but to individuals .

		Wabbles , the song sparrow who for fourteen summers visits the door-yard , and confides to the hermit his sorrows over the death of the first Mrs.
Wabbles	PERSON	, the hen-peck - ings of the second , and the loss of numerous nestlings ; and Tiny , the red squirrel who holds the premises for years against all other squir - rels and has various contests of wit with his protector , are both worth knowing .

		And so are all the hermit 's other friends .

		Mr.
Walton	PERSON	's stories about them are not exciting , but they have the stamp of truth which only long and sympathetic intimacy can give .

		Consequently they are the best sort both to enjoy and to make deductions from .

		The attitude of Mr.
Long	PERSON	in `` A Little Brother to the Bear '' is confessedly somewhat different from Mr.
Walton	PERSON	's .

		Mr.
Walton	PERSON	is merely an observer .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	is both observer and interpreter .

		He believes that the natura - list '' must collect his facts , at first hand if possible , and then he must interpret the facts as they appeal to his own head and heart in the light of all the circumstances that surround them . ''

		This is a perfectly possible theory , but in order to understand the application of it the reader should know just what is meant by interpretation .

		It is at this point that Mr.
Long	PERSON	fails to make himself clear .

		There is no line of demarcation in his stories which says : '' This is fact , for I saw it ; this is interpretation , for I only thought it . ''

		He makes as if perfectly equal in point of fact the two statements that the king - fisher hides her nest carefully on the bank of a stream , and that three young kingfishers he sees plying their trade together are playing a game to see which one can catch and swallow his fish first .

		He asserts with equal confidence that does rather than bucks usually lead the herd , and that the young deer he watched running in circles on the beach are '' being taught to twist and double quickly . ''

		In each case , the first statement is fact , the second interpretation .

		It is through failure to make this distinction clear that Mr.
Long	PERSON	has laid himself open to criticism by other naturalists .

		But whether the reader takes this matter seriously or not , he can not fail to enjoy this new book .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	knows his animals well , loves them unfeignedly , and tells their stories artistically .

		The names he uses , which he says he has taken from the
Milicete Indians	LOCATION	, are a stroke of genius .

		Almost any - one , it would seem , could write stories under the inspiration of such names as Mooweesuk -LRB- raccoon -RRB- ,
Mooween	PERSON	-LRB- bear -RRB- , Whitooweek -LRB- woodcock -RRB- , and K'dunk -LRB- toad -RRB- .

		Yet it is doubtful if anyone , with or without the names , will soon write more entertaining stories than these .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 469 Less skilful in treatment are the stories of coyotes , antelopes , prairie dogs , and other animals , in Miss Cook 's '' Along Four-Footed Trails . ''

		Among the multitude of animal books these children of the plains have scarcely received the attention they deserve .

		Miss Cook has seized upon much that is picturesque in their lives , for she has lived neighbor to them all , and knows their ways by heart .

		Her best stories are of a pet coyote and a tamed wild pony .

		Some of her other tales , about rabbits , beaver , mice , and buffalo in the wild , are told too discursively , and a few have the unfortu - nate tag of a human story that does not belong ; but they will be interesting , especially to chil - dren , even if the art displayed in them is not quite equal either to the knowledge or the sympathy .

		A little English bird-book from the pen of Mr.
A. J. R. Roberts	PERSON	, forming one of a series of practical '' Country Hand-books , '' is inter - esting partly by way of contrast to American books .

		After the tone which our best nature - writers take toward the birds -- the tone which assumes that they are as human as we , -- this English book sounds stiff and remote .

		Does the English genius preclude familiarity ?

		Or must a book sound formal because it is a hand - book ?

		However , it is pleasant to get the specialist 's point of view toward nightingales , skylarks , and other songsters known to us be - fore only through the poets .

		Even more in - formation about those whose names we know best would not have been amiss .

		And the American reader wishes that at least a few comparisons between English and American birds might have been given , -- but that was scarcely the object of the book .

		Its purely English destiny is evinced by the fact that more space and rather more appreciation are given to the English sparrow than to the thrush !

		But though the text is less minute in description and less intimate in tone than an American hand-book would be , the balance is restored by photographs , many of which were taken by the author .

		The pictures of young blackbirds and jays are paralleled in Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	's `` Nestlings of Forest and
Marsh	PERSON	, '' but we have nothing to equal the daring beauty of those which show kittewakes and razorbills , herrings and cormorants , in their nests on dizzy cliffs over the sea .

		Last in our list , but last only by reason of our prejudices , is Mrs.
Patterson	PERSON	's spider-book , which she calls '' The Spinner Family . ''

		A more delightful book was never written on an appa - rently less promising subject .

		Miss Muffet herself would have welcomed the immortal spider if it had been introduced in this author 's charming manner .

		This is a case in which all of us who belong to an older generation -- including Miss Muffet -- must lay aside our prejudices , and let the children have their due .

		No child should be cheated out of acquaint - ance with Mrs.
Epeira	PERSON	, Mrs.
Grass-Spider	PERSON	, Mrs.
Theridion	PERSON	, and all the other well-dressed and delicately industrious members of society celebrated in these pages .

		The writers of all of these recent nature - books believe in the reasoning power of the lower animals , some of them citing their be - lief with a joy akin to that of discovery .

		The belief and the joy are well ; but has someone forgotten what
Darwin	PERSON	said long ago -- that `` a little dose of judgment or reason , as
Pierre Huber	PERSON	expresses it , often comes into play , even with animals low in the scale of nature ' ?

		The truth is not new , except as it seems new when new manifestations of it are found .

		Another feeling which these nature-lovers have in com - mon is that of hatred for the man with the gun -- in Mrs.
Patterson	PERSON	's case , the woman witb the broom ; but that is very much the same thing .

		In view of man 's inhumanity to brutes , it is no wonder that we find these lovers of wild life suggesting rather broadly that on the whole human nature is inferior to that of our feath - ered and four-footed kindred -- that , as Mr.
Walton	PERSON	puts it , '' the feathered biped 's hu - manity contrasts sharply with the human biped 's brutality . ''

		It is inevitable that companionship with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air should foster pity for these creatures , who are subject at once to nature `` red in tooth and claw , '' and to a lord of creation who carries a gun .

		Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	and Mr.
Walton	PERSON	are restrained in the expression of this pity , though they feel it deeply .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	and Miss Cook sometimes rather invite the reader to tears .

		It is here that nature-writers encounter their greatest danger .

		There is a point of pathos beyond which they should not go .

		Human nature that is worth anything has to bear a good deal of its own that is pitiful .

		It should not be weighed down , to no good purpose , with the groaning and travailing of the whole creation .

		Perhaps by another generation of nature - study in school and the reading of nature-books at home , we shall be able to eliminate the man with the gun .

		But it is not likely , no matter how much nature-writers make us feel the tragedies of the 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, struggle for existence , that we shall take to the woods to do sentinel duty over the victims of that struggle .

		Nor are we likely to take to the fields to learn our inferiority to the crea - tures who live there .

		It is the duty of the naturalists to keep us modest and teach us in this matter ; but it is also their duty to teach us without making us over-sad .

Helen E. Starrett	PERSON	.

		Notable among the more substantial holiday pub - lications are '' The Memoirs of
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	, '' for the first time translated into English by Mr.
Ralph Nevill	PERSON	, and issued in a three-volume edition , lim - ited to five hundred copies , by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is now more than two hundred years since Courtilz de Sandras published his fas - cinating historical romance , claiming , as was his custom , that the work was an authentic memoir .

		In those two centuries the methods of biographers and historians have changed radically , and it is only too easy to dispose of
Sandras	LOCATION	's assumption of either title .

		But the vivacity and charm of this his masterpiece still remains , and so does
Dumas	PERSON	's en - during tribute to it , -- for in
Sandras	LOCATION	's pages he found '' The Three Musketeers . ''

		This is not the place to speak in detail of
Sandras	LOCATION	's vivid picture of seventeenth-century
France	LOCATION	, of the relation of
Dumas	PERSON	's work to his , nor of Mr.
Nevill	PERSON	's excellent translation .

		This is unabridged , except in volume II. , where certain passages having no connection with
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	's career have been compressed to suit modern taste .

		To holiday buyers , this edition will appeal by virtue of its attractive and yet substantial red-and-gold binding , and its illustrations , which are carefully selected portraits of fifteen of the prom - inent personages of the time . '

		Louis XIII. ,
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- rietta of
France	LOCATION	,
Henrietta	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	,
Cardinal de Retz	ORGANIZATION	, Ninon de 1 ' Enclos ,
Anne	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	, and the
Comtede Guiche	PERSON	, are among the subjects .

		The portraits are reproduced on parchment , which gives them an antique air well suited to this quaint chron - icle of the old rSgime .

		One volume in the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	's pic - torial series dealing with places and people has already been noticed among the holiday publications -- Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's `` Old Quebec . ''

		Another new volume in the series is ''
Boston	LOCATION	, the Place and the People , '' by Mr.
M. A. DeWolfe Howe	PERSON	.

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	explains that for many years the history of
Quebec	LOCATION	was the history of
New France	LOCATION	; Mr.
Howe	PERSON	does not need to point out to good Americans a parallel case for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The first chapters of the history thus present a difficult task ; and it is due to Mr.
Howe	PERSON	to say that his treatment of the foundation of
Boston	LOCATION	and its colonial , pro- vincial , and revolutionary epochs is admirable in its grasp of essentials and in its avoidance , at the same time , of the appearance of a brief history of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The Hub and the `` Wheel '' chapter is a suggestive exposition of
Boston	LOCATION	's com - mercial enterprise . ''

		The
Boston	LOCATION	Religion '' is as clear and fair-minded a recital of the Unitarian controversy in brief form as we remember to have seen .

		Literary
Boston	LOCATION	is not forgotten , nor the .

		abolitionist movement , nor the civic energy of the city ; and the final chapter on `` The Modern Inher - itance '' shows the spirit of
Boston	LOCATION	to-day .

		The interest of the book rests on the same solid founda - tion of real worth that characterized `` Old Quebec . ''

		There are many illustrations by Mr.
Louis Holman	PERSON	, besides others from photographs .

		The latter in - clude portraits , autographs , quaint prints , and views of old and new
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Readers of ''
Stringtown	LOCATION	on the Pike '' will re - member the boy '' Red Head , '' and will enjoy his story in full as Mr.
John Uri Lloyd	PERSON	has now told it , in a holiday volume published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The primitive life of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountains of course furnishes the background for the plot .

		The feud around which it centres dates back to the wars of the Roses , but though its cause has long since been forgotten the terrible obligation of maintaining it is still binding .

		There is stirring adventure in the book , and a love story for variety .

		Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	vouehes for the accuracy of his picture of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountaineer , that curious and fast vanishing survival of a strange and lawless past , and
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 471 hopes that his story may possess a serious interest for students of Americana .

		The frontispiece is a picture of '' Red Head '' by Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	, who has made a number of other drawings and a border for every page .

		Mr.
Birch	PERSON	's drawings are well executed and pleasing , but his page decorations are too heavy and elaborate for the best effect .

		`` Warwick Castle and Its Earls '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a chronicle of all the lords of the line , both legendary and historic , written by the present
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is published in two bulky volumes whose solidity and mechanical perfection pay fit tribute to the dignity of their theme .

		For a history of the house of Warwick comes close to being a history of
England	LOCATION	.

		The castle is nearly as old as the nation , and its earls have played a part in all the most conspicuous dramas of the nation 's history .

		They have been prominent in foreign and civil wars ; they appear as the hosts of kings and again as their executioners ; they have dictated the law of the land and bowed to its majesty on the scaffold .

		The Countess has found one earl who was a pirate , and a pretender to the earldom who invented a valuable patent medicine .

		So the history lacks neither largeness of interest nor variety .

		The author has had access to all available sources .

		The text is annotated , appendices furnish genea - logical tables and reproduce documents of special interest , and there is a full index .

		The many beau - tiful illustrations show
Warwick Castle	ORGANIZATION	in every stage of its development , portray the earls and countesses and their friends , and reproduce all sorts of interesting relics .

		Portraits in photogravure of the author and her husband form the frontispieces .

		The book will interest anyone who traces his de - scent from a branch of this great house , and others who enjoy the more intimate disclosures of history .

		The fine binding of polished green buckram , stamped with the family coat of arms , and the abundant pic - tures , will commend the work to holiday buyers .

		In two small volumes , handsomely bound in polished red buckram and boxed together , Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	gives us an interesting collec - tion of `` American Myths and Legends '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- .

		In the preface , Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	confesses to once having thought his previous work , '' Myths and Legends of Our Own Land , '' fairly complete ; but these full and fascinating volumes disprove that supposition .

		The new volumes include Indian folk - tales , beast-lore , ghost and spectre stories , traditions that have named our towns , added words to our vocabulary , or romantic associations to our land - scape , with much besides .

		Each legend is briefly and clearly told , without much comment or any strict classification .

		The abundant and interesting ma - terial here presented will no doubt surprise many readers .

		Each volume has a photogravure frontis - piece , with four or five half-tones , showing char - acteristic bits of scenery in different sections of the country . ''

		Stately Homes in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a large and imposing volume , whose object is to pic - ture and explain the various types of houses that the American multi-millionaire inhabits .

		The text , consisting of a popular account of the colonial , transitional , and modern styles of domestic archi - tecture , i3 written by Messrs.
Harry W. Desmond	PERSON	and
Herbert Croly	PERSON	.

		The pictures , more than a hundred and fifty in number , are from photo - graphs showing interior and exterior views of old colonial homes and modern palatial residences in
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, at
Newport	LOCATION	, on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and on
Long Island	LOCATION	, with a few in other localities .

		The typical and the magnificent rather than the unique or artistic seem to be the subject of both text and pictures .

		The book will appeal to those who take an intelligent interest in the de - velopment of this phase of our architectural ideal .

		Its sumptuousness of make-up and its beautiful pictures will commend it to holiday buyers .

		A book intended for the gratification of the
Beardsley	PERSON	cult is `` Under the Hill and Other Essays in Prose and Verse , '' being Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's compi - lation of such of the literary and artistic remains of his friend
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	as had not hitherto appeared among the artist 's published works .

		`` Under the Hill '' is a whimsical bit of narrative describing the visit of the `` loving Abbe Faufre - luche '' to the '' Venusberg . ''

		It has the sensuous suggestion , the satiric turn , and the brilliantly ar - tistic touch that is characteristic of everything
Beardsley	PERSON	put his hand to .

		Five of his drawings furnish the illustrations .

		Two eccentric ballads , a translation from
Catullus	LOCATION	, reminiscences of Beards - ley 's table-talk , and two letters make up the rest of the literary remains .

		Several hitherto unpublished drawings and a photogravure portrait of
Beardsley	LOCATION	at
Mentone	LOCATION	are included among the illustrations .

		Mr.
Lane	PERSON	, in a publisher 's preface , gives an inter - esting account of
Beardsley	PERSON	's connection with '' The Yellow Book '' and an estimate of his genius and his relation to the development of the art of black and white .

		The feeling that is uppermost as one closes this sumptuous memorial volume is perhaps aston - ishment that the davs of '' The Yellow Book '' seem so far behind us .

		Yet the very fact that progress in line drawing has lately been so rapid makes a backward glance interesting ; and since
Beardsley	PERSON	died at twenty-six , all that he did is surely not too much by which to judge him .

		In spite of an imposing bibliography , an elaborate index , and the dignity of a two-volume edition , it is impossible to regard Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	's `` Love Affairs of Great Musicians '' with much seriousness .

		The style is both careless and flippant , straining after sensation and ignoring the canons of good taste . ''

Dec. 16	DATE	, ject on what he considers its proper plane .

		Bat the prefatory note , calling attention to the timeliness of the book in view of many recent contributions to the subject , sounds serious , and the long list of au - thorities consulted shows industry , which , rightly directed , ought to have produced an entertaining and profitable study , and even now has not been wholly without interesting results .

		The best chap - ters are naturally those on well-known musicians .

		It seems unnecessary , to say the least , to include myths of Orpheus , Pan , and Apollo in such a book , and the '' Omnibus Chapter '' is too general to be of value .

		The conclusion is too long for a summary , and its main thesis -- that the musician may be noble or the reverse , like any other man -- hardly needed a two-volume proof .

		The publishers -LRB-
L. C Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , who bring out this book as a part of their `` Music Lovers ' Series , '' have provided abundant illustrations , decorated end-papers , and an ornate binding .

		An exceedingly interesting contribution to the history of modern French art is made available to readers of English by Mr.
P. G. Konody	PERSON	's transla - tion of
Monsieur Camille Mauclair	PERSON	's `` Great French Painters . ''

		The sub-title , '' The Evolution of French Painting from
1830	DATE	to the Present Day , '' gives a clearer idea of the author 's intention .

		The transla - tion is published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a well-bound folio , with lavish illustration from the work 8 of the modern French schools .

		The paintings of
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Degas	LOCATION	,
Manet	LOCATION	,
Renoir	ORGANIZATION	, Millet , and Puvis de Chavannes are accorded fullest representation among the hundred and ten half-tone reproductions .

		M.
Mauclair	ORGANIZATION	's sympathies are clearly with the mod - ern schools -- the symbolists , impressionists , and intimists .

		But this bias is so frankly stated that it can not mislead the reader , and it serves to lend color and interest to the exposition .

		The programme of the book is vast , covering as it does seventy years of great progress .

		This confused body of material is , however , unified by the attempt to show how , since the days of Ingres and
Delacroix	LOCATION	, French art has grown steadily more national and also more individual ; and how the great masters like
Corot	LOCATION	,
Courbet	LOCATION	, Millet ,
Manet	PERSON	, and
Degas	LOCATION	, arraying them - selves against the claims of a pseudo-classicism , have become both the real upholders of tradition and the advance guard of the evolutionary movement in favor of personal and national freedom in subject-matter and method .

		This evolution is traced through chap - ters dealing with its successive phases .

		A word of praise should be said for the translator , who has succeeded in preserving the flexibility and compact - ness which are characteristic of the French critical style .

		Last year we had a beautiful reprint of Thack - eray 's arraignment of the Christmas Annuals , the atrocious '' table-books '' of his time .

		This year another neglected satire , '' Reading a Poem , '' has been reprinted in a limited edition by the
A. Wessels Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		This sketch , which originally appeared in a weekly paper called '' The Brittania , '' has been reprinted only twice before .

		In
May , 1891	DATE	, fifty years after its first publication , it was printed among the '' opuscula '' of the '' Sette of Odd Volumes , '' and in
1897	DATE	it was issued in a limited edition by Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	.

		The fact that the piece was com - pletely lost sight of for so long is strange , inasmuch as it is specifically stated to be by '' Mr.
Michael Angelo Titmarsh	PERSON	, '' is characteristic in style and sub - ject , and introduces the ever-welcome '' Yellow - plush . ''

		The text of the present reprint is from a copy of `` The Odd Volumes , '' an interesting account of which is contained in the preface .

		The frontis - piece is a photogravure portrait of
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		The book is printed on fine deckle-edged paper , and bound in plain green boards .

		It will be a treasure to the collector .

		For a bibliophile of fastidious taste in the matter of fine printing , no more acceptable gift could pos - sibly be found among the season 's books than the reprint of More 's '' Utopia , '' published by the
Scott	PERSON	-
Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their '' Library of Noble Authors . '

		- '' Printed at the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, in an edi - tion limited to 200 copies for
America	LOCATION	, the series of which this is the second volume represents the highest attainments in modern typography and book - making .

		The folio form , the dignified typography , , the impressive effect of beautiful handmade paper and generous margins , are peculiarly appropriate to the text in the present reprint .

		The second -LRB-
1556	DATE	-RRB- edition of
Ralph Robynson	PERSON	's translation is here fol - lowed , in all its archaic spelling and punctuation ;
Roper	PERSON	's life of More , collated and edited by Mr.
George Sampson	PERSON	, and a selection from his family letters , are also included in the volume .

		A splendid photogravure from
Holbein	LOCATION	's portrait serves as frontispiece , and there is a graceful title-page de - sign in line drawing by Mr.
W. L. Bruckman	PERSON	.

		It is safe to say that More 's noble vision was never clothed more fittingly than in this noble edition .

		Equally commendable as a piece of good printing , though less imposing and less expensive , is a reprint of
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Conduct of Life , '' also a product of the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	and issued by the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text , presented without editorial accom - paniment of any sort , is set in a simple old style face of type , large and easily read , and printed with gen - erous margins on Dutch handmade paper .

		The binding is a pleasing combination of linen cloth and vellum , heavily stamped in gold .

		A Christmas gift of more intrinsic value , especially for the young , could not be desired .

		The edition is limited to 350 copies .

		Mr.
Roy Rolfe Gilson	PERSON	's `` In the Morning Glow '' was a new and charming type of the literature of childhood .

		The two favorite sketches in the book , `` Mother '' and `` Father , '' have now been reprinted separately in a beautiful volume -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , with pictures and marginal designs by Mrs.
Alice Bar	PERSON	- bour
Stephens	PERSON	.

		The eight full-page illustrations are printed in a soft brown tint , and neatly mounted on blank pages of the book , without damage to which they might easily be detached for framing .

		They
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 473 are certainly worthy of preservation in this way .

		The borders are very pretty , but the cover shows a tendency , too common in holiday editions , to an excess of ornament .

		Another lavishly illustrated book about childhood is Mr.
Walter Russell	PERSON	's u Bending of the Twig '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	explains that the purport of his book is not to show how the u grown-ups '' should mould the lives of children , but how , inevitably , the children mould the lives of the '' grown-ups . ''

		As a matter of fact the book suggests answers to both these questions , and inci - dentally gives a clue to Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's power of understanding and drawing children .

		He can tell them fascinating stories and -- what is a rarer gift -- can make them tell him even better ones in return .

		His tales generally have the realistic back - ground that children love , and often deftly conceal a moral which some of the children in the book are amazingly meek in accepting .

		However in the main they are real children , -- particularly the boys , -- and they have ample reason for being , apart from the fact that they are the originals of the pictures , which are naturally the main features of a book by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	.

		There are about fifty of these draw - ings , each representing a different mood or aspect of childhood .

		Marginal sketches on every page supplement the full-page portraits by helping to make the book abound from cover to cover in the joyous spirit of childhood .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's work is too well known to need praise .

		He has put some of the best of it into this volume , which is unique among the holiday publications .

		A book full of the joys of youth and spring-time is `` On the Road to Arcady '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Mabel Nelson Thurston	PERSON	, with frontispiece , decorated end-papers , headings , and marginal drawings in pen-and-ink by Mr.
Samuel M. Palmer	PERSON	, a member of the artists ' colony at
Wilmington	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's work on the inside of the book is original and pleasing ; but he has overloaded the cover with ornament until it is bewildering rather than impres - sive .

		The story takes the form of a journal written by an eccentric but very attractive middle-aged woman , with a love for nature and for solitude .

		The former taste is strengthened , the latter for the time entirely obliterated , by the advent of a fasci - nating young cousin .

		The latter overturns all the older woman 's habits , fills her quiet house with young men , induces her to adopt two waifs from an orphan asylum , and finally wins the heart of a bach - elor cousin for whom , we are led to believe , the dia - rist has cherished a secret fondness .

		If ho , she accepts the situation with commendable tranquility , considering , no doubt , that the joys of spring-time in
Arcady	LOCATION	still remain to her .

		The story is grace - fully told , with plenty of humor and a keen appre - ciation of the charm of the out-door world and the vagaries of human nature .

		Two companion volumes whose charm the lover of choice editions will be quite unable to resist , are `` The Essays of Douglas Jerrold '' with an edi - torial preface by his grandson , Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	, and `` The Essays of Leigh Hunt , '' edited by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, both volumes being illustrated by Mr.
H. M. Brock	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- imported by
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The plain silk cloth cover with a gold monogram as its only deco - ration has an air of quaintness and distinction that is quite in keeping with the contents of these two little volumes .

		Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's pen and ink drawings will be a surprise even to those who know his work best .

		Their dainty finish , quaintness of conception , delicate humor , and perfect appreciation of the text are as unusual as they are delightful .

		Each of the essays has a head and a tail piece , and these are quite as carefully wrought and as illustrative as the other drawings .

		Paper and printing are all that could be wished , and these volumes are easily among the half dozen ■ best things '' of the holiday season .

		The volume entitled '' Through the Gates of Old Romance '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
W. Jay Mills	PERSON	, is made very attractive by a cover of heavy white buckram and many pictures of the belles and beaux of bygone days .

		The absence of a preface leaves us in doubt about Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's claims to historical authenticity , but apparently the nine stories which make up the volume are historical novelettes , with a foundation of fact and a considerable superstruc - ture of fancy .

		The stories of the
Franklin	PERSON	family 's connivance at an elopement , of
Philip Freneau	PERSON	's poetic courtship , and of
Pinderina Scribblerus	PERSON	, poetess of
Perth Amboy	LOCATION	, are among the best .

		In all the tales the quaint picturesqueness and the romantic gaiety of colonial life in
America	LOCATION	is strongly brought out .

		The very dainty and allur - ing form of the book is appropriate to the holiday season .

		A book to delight the few who care for such things is '' The Life of Saint
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	'' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- , a translation , by Miss
Valentina Hawtrey	PERSON	, of a fourteenth-century Italian manuscript of un - known authorship .

		In the introduction ,
Vernon Lee	PERSON	classes this devotional romance with `` Aucassin et Nicolette '' as '' one of the absolutely satisfactory works , so few but so exquisite , of the middle ages . ''

		This is high praise ; but the quaint and charming narrative , with its interesting psychology , seems to merit it .

		The legend is that
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	was the sister of
Lazarus	PERSON	, and was married to John the Evangelist , who deserted her on her wedding-day to follow Christ to the desert .

		The recent stage interpretation of another version of the same story gives timeliness to the translation of this medieval legend , which , however , needs no extrinsic sources of interest .

		The illustrations , showing the Mag - dalen as fourteen great painters have conceived her , are a beautiful and impressive commentary on the text .

		The binding is quaint and dignified . ''

		Gardens of the Caribbees , -- Sketches of a Cruise to the
West Indies	LOCATION	and the Spanish Main '' reads the title-page of two daintily proportioned volumes written by Mrs.
Ida M. H. Starr	PERSON	, and 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, published with many illustrations by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	as a part of their '' Travel Lovers ' Library . ''

		Before she started on her cruise , Mrs.
Starr	PERSON	had thought of the
Caribbees	LOCATION	as veritable Islands of the
Blest	LOCATION	.

		On the first day out she de - cided that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	was quite right about the impossibility of reaching them by any steamship line .

		But a few days later she landed at
Haiti	LOCATION	, a.nd began to realize most , if not all , of her dreams .

		Mrs.
Starr	PERSON	was accompanied on her journey by her husband and two small daughters , and they , with friends made on the way , play a considerable part in the narrative , which is written in a simple , chatty style , with the emphasis on the people of the islands and their ways of life and thought .

		The recent desolation wrought by Mount Pele `` e gives these volumes a certain timeliness , and their artistic form will make them acceptable gift-books .

		The volume entitled '' My Favorite Book-Shelf '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will prove an acceptable gift for a busy friend who , having little time or taste for thorough reading , likes to get some small knowledge of the world 's prose literature by means of brief selections .

		The compiler , Mr.
Charles Josselyn	PERSON	, does not claim for his anthology any basis of selec - tion beyond his own choice and a due attention to variety .

		The authors represented are as diverse as
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and Macaulay , '' Ouida '' and
Doctor Johnson	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	and Charles Lamb ; but most of them are classic writers .

		The selections are brief -- often only a paragraph or two -- but complete in thought .

		They are generally expository , and in spite of the diversity of subject-matter and point of view most of them touch on the authors ' philosophy of life .

		The compilation would lose none of its popular character , and be much more useful for reference , had the name of the work from which each selection was chosen been given .

		The book is handsomely bound .

		If Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	were not so successful in picturing the fashionable world of to-day , we should be inclined to judge his Puritans and Indians more leniently .

		His illustrations for the new holiday edition of '' The Courtship of Miles Standish '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- are very pretty but they do not fit the text .


John Alden	PERSON	looks as if he had stepped out of a
New York	LOCATION	drawing-room , the rest of the characters are stiff and unreal , and the In - dians positively grotesque .

		Of the forty-odd illus - trations nine are in color , and there are besides decorations on every page and a special cover de - sign .

		The paper is of excellent quality and the type attractive .

		It is a pity that so much trouble should have been spent to so little purpose , but doubtless many of Mr.
Christy	PERSON	's admirers will be loyal enough to like his latest departure , and to commend the publishers ' choice of an illustrator for
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		`` Colonel 's
Carter	PERSON	's Christmas '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's ingenious explanation of its late arrival as preface , and several daintily colored illustrations by Mr.
F. C. Yohn	PERSON	, is sure to be popular among the holiday books .

		Some of the
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	's friends may question Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's wisdom in attempting this revival , but they will find little justification for their fears .

		The story deserves to rank with the rest of the
Carter	PERSON	chronicles ; it will please the Colonel 's old friends , and make him new ones .

		Mr.
Yohn	PERSON	's illustrations and the pretty cover design emphasize the Christmas spirit that pervades the story .

		In `` The Forest , '' whose chapters will be familiar to readers of `` The Outlook , '' Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	has achieved the difficult task of writing an outdoor book in a new way .

		The thread which holds it together is the story of a thousand-mile canoe trip through the woods of
Canada	LOCATION	and
Northern Michigan	LOCATION	.

		But in addition to chapters of experience and adventure there are practical hints to would-be campers , character sketches of Habitants and Indians , and suggestive analyses of '' the call of the wild '' and the subtle spell that the '' blazed trail '' casts over its captives . ''

		One can not imprison the Forest inside the covers of a book , '' says Mr.
White	PERSON	, and this is true ; yet there is a great deal of the composite , changeful spirit of the great woods within these covers . ''

		The Forest '' is beautifully illustrated and decorated by Mr.
Thomas Fogarty	PERSON	, a friend of the author and his companion on the trip of which this book is the outcome .

		The work of Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	in compiling descriptive passages by great writers under various attractive headings has obtained wide recognition .

		She has this year edited and arranged a new volume -LRB- the sixth in her series -RRB- , called '' Historic Buildings Described by Great Writers '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The buildings dealt with have been chosen for their artistic beauty or interest , and also for their his - torical associations .

		None of those already described in `` Turret8 , Towers , and Temples '' or `` Romantic Castles and Palaces '' are included in the new vol - ume .

		The buildings are of all periods and many countries , and the commentators as diverse as
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Gautier	PERSON	, and
Gibbon	PERSON	.

		There are forty-two excellent illustrations in half-tone , and the binding is uniform with the rest of the series .

		Holiday editions of '' Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	'' and '' Lovey Mary '' were the only logical outcome of the popu - larity of the Cabbage - Patch heroines , and they have just been issued by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pretty cloth binding , with gold lettering , is uniform for both volumes , in each of which are two dozen drawings , half in color and half in black-and-white , by Mrs.
Florence Scovel Shinn	PERSON	, whose clever work in the original edition of '' Lovey Mary '' assured a welcome for her additional drawings in this larger edition , and for the entirely new set of pictures in '' Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	. ''

		It is difficult to believe that any - body who reads current books has overlooked Mrs.
Rice	PERSON	's stories , but there will be many to enjoy re - reading them in their holiday setting .

		The two volumes are neatly boxed together .

		1903 -RSB- THE DIAL 475 The special winter number of '' The Studio '' takes the form of a richly illustrated brochure on `` The Genius of
J. M. W. Turner	PERSON	'' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- .

		From many sources a large and representative selection of the drawings , paintings , and engravings of
Turner	PERSON	has been gathered ; a collection repre - senting every period of the artist 's career and every type of his work .

		There are sixteen plates in color , a facsimile letter from
Turner	PERSON	to his father , two portraits , and nearly one hundred and fifty other beautiful reproductions .

		Four essays upon the art - ist 's various modes of work furnish the text .

		The volume will make a holiday gift that should be acceptable in many quarters .

		It is well worthy of a substantial and artistic binding .

		Twenty of Mr.
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	's dialect poems are published in holiday form by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title of the first piece in the collection , '' When Malindy Sings . ''

		Like '' Candle-Lightin ' Time '' by the same author , the book is uniquely illustrated from photographs taken by the
Hampton Institute Camera Club	ORGANIZATION	, and deco - rated with marginal borders by
Miss Margaret Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	.

		The photographs are in excellent taste , being humorous but dignified , with none of the burlegque suggestion that turns bo many pictures of negro life into caricature .

		A few very beautiful landscape views add variety to the illustrations .

		Of the poems , it is only necessary to say that they are in the same delightful vein which has won for Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	so enviable a reputation as a poet of his own people .

		`` Reflections of the Morning After '' -LRB-
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written and illustrated by Mr.
Herman Lee Meader	PERSON	, is a pocket volume appro - priately bound in highly-colored calico , with a symbolic and also highly-colored heading .

		The decorated end-papers are in the same lurid style , but the title-page and marginal borders are illus - trative of the author 's mood without being ugly .

		The '' Reflections , '' which are grouped under such headings as '' Alcoholic Fumes , '' '' Grouches and Grins , '' and `` The Lockstep '' -LRB- marriage -RRB- , are always well put and sometimes very pithy , but more often only sharply cynical , and occasionally vulgar .

		It would possibly idealize '' The Morning After '' to omit this last element altogether , but it would have made a better book .

		However , by judicious choosing one can get considerable good philosophy from Mr.
Meader	PERSON	's '' Reflections . ''

		For the last six or seven years Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	has been writing essays for newspapers and period - icals .

		Some of these he has pruned and gathered into a volume entitled `` The Kinship of Nature , '' now published , with a photogravure frontispiece of the author , by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays , which are short and informal , follow no continuous trend of thought , though they are unified by the author 's cheerful philosophy , which the '' Songs from Vagabondia '' and the rest of his verse have made familiar .

		Such titles as '' The Art of Life , '' `` The Crime of Ugliness , '' ''
April	DATE	in Town , '' '' The Wan - dering Word , '' '' The Courtesy of Nature , '' and '' Trees '' will give the reader who is unfamiliar with the author 's prose style some notion of what he may expect .

		Mr.
John Luther Long	PERSON	's '' Madame Butterfly '' is offered to holiday buyers in a new `` Japanese edition '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The piquant charm of the story is known to many readers , and to play - goers as well ; for it has long since been dramatized , and now -- so Mr.
Long	PERSON	's preface tells us -- the Italian composer ,
Signor Puccini	PERSON	, is writing an opera with '' Madame Butterfly '' as the libretto .

		The new edition is printed on heavy paper , with wide margins , and illustrated with very artistic photographs of Japanese subjects , taken by Mr.
C. Y. Abbott	PERSON	, an amateur photographer of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		The cover design is the most authentically Japanese feature , being made by a native artist ,
Genjiro Yeto	PERSON	.

		A beautiful edition of
William Morris	PERSON	's '' Defense of Guenevere , and Other Poems '' is issued by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, with many illustrations and decorations by Miss
Jessie M. King	PERSON	.

		The designs have much of the spirit of the Pre-Raphaelite painters , though Miss
King	PERSON	's use of the fantastic , sweeping line is more suggestive of
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	.

		Altogether the edition will be pleasing to admirers of
William Morris	PERSON	's work .

		It contains about thirty of his shorter poems , printed on excellent paper , with gilt top and uncut edges , and bound in red and gold .

		Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	's `` Nonsense Anthology '' has already become in its way a classic .

		Everybody who cares for nonsense verse approves of Miss Wells 's choice and wants to own the handy little collection of favorite pieces .

		Because of its great popularity as a gift-book , the publishers -LRB- Scribner -RRB- have now issued a holiday edition , prettily bound in full limp leather and printed on thin paper .

		The new edition is certain to be a favorite one .

		Miss
Marie Corelli	ORGANIZATION	wields so versatile a pen that it is impossible to declare any sort of literary work out of her range .

		But we may safely say that '' Angel 's Wickedness , '' the booklet which she has furnished for holiday consumption , is hardly char - acteristic -- except of her versatility . ''

		Angel 's Wickedness '' is a '' true '' story of the
Sunday	DATE	- school book order , with a heroine who becomes at the end of the short tale as angelic in nature as she had previously been in name .

		There are no illustrations , but the heavy paper , wide margins , and gray board-cover with its pretty gold stamp , give the little book a festive air , and the moral of the story has a Christmas turn .

		-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
Walter R. Beers	PERSON	. -RRB- ''

		Little
Henry	PERSON	's Slate , '' by Mr.
W. D. Nesbit	PERSON	, is a collection of the choicest of
Little Henry	ORGANIZATION	's sayings , published in a unique booklet by Mr.
William S. Lord	PERSON	.

		Chicago newspaper readers will remember these juvenile epigrams and enjoy seeing them realistically printed in reproduction of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's own work and illustrated by the same hand .

		Every other page of the book contains a saying and is deco - 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, rated to simulate a slate .

		The saying on the cover , which will serve as a sample of the rest , reads : `` My Paw ses a man is never to oled to lurn & wim - men is never to yung to teech him . ''

		The
1904	DATE	edition of '' The Cynic 's Calendar of Revised Wisdom '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will appeal to many holiday shoppers in search of a unique and inexpensive gift .

		As before , Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	,
Miss Ethel Watts Mumford	PERSON	, and Mr.
Addison Mizner	PERSON	have collaborated in its preparation .

		The general form of the calendar , with its checked ging - ham cover and poster label , red and black decora - tions , and blank pages for memoranda , has been retained ; but the illustrations are different and much better than those of last year , and many new bite of wisdom have been revised for
1904	DATE	.

		M Eat your steak or you '11 have stew '' ; '' Consistency , thou art a mule ! ''

		; '' Many hands want light work , '' are a few of the new '' twisted '' proverbs .

		If enjoyment of '' The Cynic 's Calendar '' is a test , most of us must confess to being cynics .

		Books fok the
Youxu	PERSON	.

		n. 8mm nMw Literature for children has received so few additious of decided merit this sea - sou that the publication just at this time of Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	's `` The Singing Leaves '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- calls for a word of especial com - ment .

		This is not a book inteuded as a whole for younger folk , but one of its chapters , '' The Little Past , '' is designed for small people , and another , '' The Young Things , '' for young girls .

		Of the eleven titles in the former chapter , the pieces called `` Journey , '' `` The Busy Child , '' '' The Masterpiece , '' '' Late , '' and one or two more , deserve all the good that can be said of them .

		The distich , '' Concerning Love , '' may be quoted . ''

		I wish she would not ask ma if I love the Kitten more than her .

		Of course I love her .

		But I love the Kitten too : and It has fur . ''

		Of the other chapter mentioned , it may be said to form perhaps the only poetio interpretation of the life of young girls as revealed by one of themselves .

		Mr.
Norman Gale	PERSON	has doue what a young man can to inform his brethren of that enviable and delicious life , but it has been reserved for
Miss Peabody	LOCATION	to reach the heart of the matter .

		For the delightful mingling of moods which constitutes humor at its best , '' Vanity , Saith the Preacher , '' a little poem on a young girl 's frocks and footwear , deserves high praise .

		Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, preserving something mmdkiti * ry .

		° * th `` ?

		archaic speech of
Mallory	PERSON	aud all of his archaic spirit , has rewritten from that great original `` The Story of King
Arthur	PERSON	and his Knights '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and provided as well the brilliaut series of drawings with which it is illustrated .

		The result is a volume unusually harmonious and of extra - ordinary literary and artistic value .

		The whole round of the Arthurian myth is not here exhausted either , leaving a prospect of another volume in the future .

		-- Miss
Eva March Tappan	PERSON	has left for a time the more serious field of history , which she has been so busily rejuvenating for youthful readers , and now gives us '' Robiu Hood : His Book '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , bringing into one volume all the old ballads and folk-tales concerning the prince of robbers .

		There are many outline drawings in the text , and six full-page pictures in color , all from the skilful baud of
Miss Charlotte Harding	ORGANIZATION	.

		-- Four stories addressed to half-grown children , written by Miss
Evaleen Stein	PERSON	, are published under the title of '' Trou - badour Tales '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- .

		Three are from old
France	LOCATION	, and one , relating to the discovery of a lost canto of the `` Kalevala , '' from
Finland	LOCATION	.

		This last is a rare bit of work , while all show Miss
Stein	PERSON	's knowu poetio qualities .

		The illustrations are numerous , being the work of
Miss Virginia	LOCATION	Keep and Messrs.
Maxtield Parrish	PERSON	,
B. Rosenmeyer	PERSON	, and
Edward Edwards	PERSON	.

		-- From the profound erudition of the Rev.
H. Pereira Meudes	PERSON	comes '' In Old
Egypt	LOCATION	: A Story about the Bible but not in the Bible '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with abundant illustrations by Miss
Mabel L. Humphrey	PERSON	.

		The book coucerns itself with the coming of the prophet
Moses	PERSON	into the world , beginning with the deeds of his father Am rani and carrying the tale as supplementary to the scriptural narrative on through numerous interesting episodes of the life of the Hebrews in the days of the Pharaonic captivity .

		Nothing but good can result from a book so conceived and written .

		-- In Mr.
William Henry Johnson	PERSON	's '' Pioneer Spaniards in
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,

Ojeda	LOCATION	,

Narvaez	PERSON	,
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	, aud De Soto .

		There are numerous illustrations from portraits and scenes in ancient books discussing the doughty deeds of these explorers .

		As a bit of Americana for the young , the book should find an appreciative audience .

		-- Copious excerpts from typical speeches of oue of the greater American statesmen maybe found in ``
Daniel Webster	PERSON	for Young Americans '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an introduction being provided by Mr.
Charles F. Richard	PERSON	- son , the editor , who has also included
Whipple	PERSON	's essay on ''
Webster	PERSON	as a Master of English Style , '' aud added the Declaration of Independence , the federal constitu - tion , and
Washington	LOCATION	's '' Farewell Address . ''

		Numerous portraits of
Webster	PERSON	at different stages of his career , and pictures of scenes in which he was an actor , illus - trate the book , which is a worthy contribution to the knowledge of a man whose greatness was always human .

		-- The first volume of '' Famous Battles of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, begins with
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	and ends with the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		It is both a conclusive and various work .

		Several of the accounts are from dis - tinguished hands , such as Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's story of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's overthrow ; but most of them are the work of contemporary writers , such as
G. A. Heuty	PERSON	,
Archi	ORGANIZATION	- bald
Forbes	PERSON	, and others .

		The conflicts between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	are told from the American point of view , aud those of
Great Britain	LOCATION	with other nations from the Euglish side ; so that the English-speaking peoples have much the best of the argument in every sense of the word .

		The volume is fully and attractively illustrated .

		chronologically with `` The Round Tower : A Tale of `` 96 '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , in which Misses
Florence M. S. Scott	PERSON	and
Alma Hodge	PERSON	tell what befell a small Irish boy and his family during the brief French invasion of
Ireland	LOCATION	at the close of the eighteeuth century .

		The story is vivacious , and the
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 authors are evidently in sympathy with
England	LOCATION	rather than
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		-- The late
Paul du Chaillu	PERSON	left '' In Afri - can Forest and Jungle '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- behind him , and seemingly as a reminder of the field in which he attained his first popularity .

		It is in his earliest manner , telling interestingly and convincingly of the adventures of a European naturalist in the darker parts of the dark continent .

		The pictures , by Mr.
Victor Perard	PERSON	, represent the hero , his native assistant , and their dog in various difficult situations .

		-- '' With the Treasure Seekers : A Tale of the
Florida	LOCATION	Cays '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a story of some gold and silver bars which were not found , and some plate made of precious metals which was , the party of discoverers setting forth in a private steam yacht and having numerous exciting times before they returned to
New York	LOCATION	again , a shipwreck being the last of their troubles .

		The book is illustrated , and is a good example of Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's writing at its best Al - most the earliest and one of the greatest of American industries concerns itself with the felling of forests , which has doubtless led Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	to the writing of `` Two Young Lumbermen ; or ,
From Maine	LOCATION	to
Oregon	LOCATION	for Fortune '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It has two young men for its heroes , and these hardy and hearty
Maine Yankees	ORGANIZATION	work from their native state across the continent to
Oregon	LOCATION	by way of
Michigan	LOCATION	, achieving success at last through a contract with a rail - way , after many difficulties .

		The book is a romance of contemporary business life .

		Mr.
A. B. Shute	PERSON	pro- vides the pictures .

		-- A few stories of life at school may be included here , notably a book about the National Mil - itary Academy called '' West Point Colors '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is written by Mrs.
Anna B. Warner	PERSON	, with the active cooperation of a number of the cadets themselves , and gains thereby a reality attainable in no other way .

		The only illustrations are from photographs .

		-- ''
Riverton	LOCATION	Boys : A Story of Two Schools '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an amusing book by
Messrs. K. M. Eady	PERSON	and
R. Eady	PERSON	.

		One school is aristocratic , the other a seminary of learning where the pupils actually learn .

		The rivalry is intense , and involves two cousins , one in each of the opposing schools , in some curious little scrapes .

		The end comes with the boys on the battlefield .

		-- For somewhat smaller boys Mr.
Harold Avery	PERSON	has written '' The House on the Moor '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , also an English school story wherein a careless boy loses his overcoat containing a valuable letter of his father 's , in recovering which he succeeds in bringing an escaped convict to justice .

		The story is mildly sensational .

		-- Here may also be included '' The Ship of State : By Those at the Helm '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , a useful series of accounts of the manner in which government governs in this country , republished from the pages of '' The Youth 's Companion '' and fully authenticated by the names of the contributors to the little book , repre - senting the present executive department of the federal government most fully .

		A large number of this season 's books have been addressed particularly to girls of all sizes and ages .

		At the head of this supplementary list may be placed Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	's '' Aunt
Jimmy	PERSON	's Will '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is the story of a small gentlewoman who is left seemingly destitute in a small
New England	LOCATION	town by the death of her widowed father , a highly unsuccessful artist of Irish extraction .

		In spite of the determination of a kindly farmer near by to give her a home , she is taken by her uncle to a
New York	LOCATION	flat of the grade just above a tenement , and there remains until the kindly farmer 's About girls and for them .

		wife and her son , between them , make her return pos - sible .

		The contrast between the healthy life of the country and the strenuosities of the metropolis is viv - idly drawn , and Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	is given the opportunity to do some delightful character painting .

		Mrs.
Florence Scovell Shinn	PERSON	contributes some excellent pen-and-ink drawings to the book .

		-- Miss
Gwendolen Overton	PERSON	has taken a western army post for the scene , and its com - mander 's adolescent and only child for the heroine , of '' The Captain 's Daughter '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which is shown most entertainingly how a young girl can plunge herself and everyone she loves into hot water by acting on her own responsibility in a situation where a head was needed much more than a heart .

		Though a series of crimes is committed and several accidents occur , the book is not in the least melodramatic .

		It will certainly make the duty of parents somewhat easier when girl - hood is at its most difficult moment .

		Miss
Frances D. Jones	PERSON	supplies some spirited pictures '' Half a Dozen Housekeepers '' -LRB-
Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	, is a brisk account of how six young schoolgirls kept house at the home of one of them during an enforced absence from a
New England	LOCATION	boarding-school during a threatened epidemic .

		No girls ever had a better time , and they left an impression on the quiet old town where they disported themselves which was not without per - manent effect .

		The illustrations are by Mr.
Mills Thompson	PERSON	.

		-- Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, always a good story-teller , has collected a number of tales into a vol - ume entitled , from the first of them , '' The Green Satin Gown '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		She has taken a number of significant episodes in the life , high and low , of a
New England	LOCATION	city of the smaller sort , gentlefolks , mill-hands , and the rest appearing in her pages to advantage .

		The initial story is especially charming .

		Miss
Etheldred B. Barry	PERSON	illustrates the book '' Three Hundred Things a Bright Girl Can Do '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is a volume written by Miss
Lilla Elizabeth Eelley	PERSON	, with numerous illustra - tions , from which any girl can get valuable hints toward usefulness both at home and in the community .

		Self - help is the best helpfulness , and to this good end
Miss Keller	PERSON	's book makes valuable contributions .

		Prominent among the books dealing with small girls and boys is Mrs.
Ruth Mc	PERSON	-
Enery Stuart	PERSON	's ``
George Washington Jones	PERSON	: A Christmas Gift That Went Begging '' -LRB- Alte - mus -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Stuart	PERSON	here fairly repeats the brilliant success of last year 's ''
Napoleon Jackson	PERSON	, '' the same delightful mingling of tears and laughter being trans - ferred from adult to youthful life .

		The little colored boy who remembered that his grandfather had been sent in early boyhood as a holiday gift with the inscription , `` I ` ma little nigger , But I '11 grow bigger , '' induced the child to set forth and offer himself as a Christmas gift .

		How he adopted an aunt in the search , and how he came at last into his own after many dis - couragements , make a charming Christmas story , the sympathetic pictures of Mr.
Edward Potthast	PERSON	adding to the general result '' The Little People '' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- , by Mrs.
L. Allen Harker	PERSON	, is quite as much for grown persons as for the immature , being a collection of short stories of English life in which children play a varied part , sometimes reconciling differences between parents , and sometimes getting into mischief which affects their elders .

		The stories are unquestionably interesting to the elders , but are in most instances beyond the range Youngster * of various sorts .

		478 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of simple childhood .

		-- Miss
Elizabeth Hill	PERSON	records a pleasant recollection of a summer spent in the country in '' My Wonderful Visit '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- . ''

		When I was a little girl , '' she begins , '' I made an enchanting never - to-be-forgotten visit , '' and the words fitly describe the event .

		The visit was to a certain Cousin
Sally	PERSON	, who seems to have been as sympathetic as Miss Hill and her illustrator ,
Miss Beatrice Stevens	PERSON	, here prove them - selves to be .

		-- Mrs.
Martha Finley	PERSON	continues her famil - iar annual volumes with ''
Elsie	PERSON	and her Loved Ones '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , wherein the '' Elsie '' family spend a winter in

		-- Miss
Jocelyn Lewis	PERSON	's small heroine in '' The Adventures of Dorothy '' -LRB-
Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is ten years old when she has her first experience in the country , a visit resulting in much inno - cent mischief .

		A small boy adds to the ensemble much devotion and an equal capacity for getting into trouble , the most exciting episodes being depicted also in Mr.
Seymour M. Stone	PERSON	's illustrations .

		-- '' Five Little Pep - pers at School '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- shows Mrs.
Margaret Sidney	PERSON	's interesting little flock divided , the boys goiug to one place and the girls to another in pursuance of education , but not until they have done several things to show their kindness of heart .

		Mr.
Hermann Heyer	PERSON	, evidently a lover of children , provides the illustrations .

		-- ''
Jaue	PERSON	and John : Their Parties , Plays , and Picnics '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has a distinct leaning toward nature study in its pages , the children of the book spending their time inland and at the sea shore , and collecting everywhere specimens of all sorts of living things .

		The pictures in color by Mr.
Charles E. Heil	PERSON	add to the worth of the volume .

		Fairy books seem to be as numerous Tales of ^ ig year as ever , and more pains are bestowed upon them than upon any other class of books for small people .

		In this season 's list Mr.
L. Frank Baum	PERSON	holds the place of honor with no less than three books , of which two are entirely new , all published by the
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' The Magical Monarch of Mo '' tells of a country where everything the human heart can wish for is found as fruit upon the enviable vegetation of that favored land , a consumma - tion that makes socialism impossible and recommends itself at sight as a complete solution for all social ills .

		The pictures , as in the others of Mr.
Baum	PERSON	's books , are in color , in this instance being drawn by Mr.
Frank Verbeck	PERSON	.

		`` The Enchanted Island of Yew '' is in four quarters , '' like a mince pie , '' and through its confines three mortal children ramble and make friends under the care of
Prince Marvel	ORGANIZATION	, one of the best of fairies .

		Miss
Fanny Y. Cory	ORGANIZATION	has made the illustrations and decorations , hardly a page being without embellishment .

		The last of Mr.
Baum	PERSON	's three books is a new edition of '' The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , '' with the text un - changed , but with several new pictures by Mr.
William Wallace Denslow	PERSON	.

		The chapter in which the scarecrow comes to life remains one of the best of its kind . ''

		Six Giants and a
Griffin	PERSON	, and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is by Mr.
Birdsall Otis Edey	PERSON	, with clever pictures by Mrs.
Beatrice Baxter Ruyl	PERSON	.

		The stories show an abun - dant fancy , and cover a great deal of ground , mythical and modern .

		-- An excellent compilation from the fairy lore of many lands has been made by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	in '' The Golden Rod Fairy Book '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with many pages in color from the de - signs of Mr.

Denmark	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and Arabia are laid under con - tribution , some of the stories being translated by Miss
Singleton	PERSON	herself , and due credit being properly given in all other cases .

		-- '' The Outlook Fairy Book -LRB-
Outlook Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Miss
Laura Winnington	PERSON	, has not the same distinction as Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's book , and the curious credit is given for several famous tales as taken '' from the German of
Hans Christian Ander	PERSON	- sen , '' not flattering to the countrymen of that most lovable of
Danes	LOCATION	.

		Some fairy ballads are included with the prose , and the pictures are by Mr.
J. Conacher	PERSON	.

		Books of child-rhymes are this year aTd ^ ilSZ ^ generally good , though not numerous ;
Miss Peabody	LOCATION	's book , already mentioned , being of another class entirely and a much higher one .

		Mr.
William Wells Newell	PERSON	has issued a second and greatly enlarged edition of his '' Games and Songs of American Children , '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , adding much new ma - terial to the former book , and appealing to students no less than little people through the width and treat - ment of his subject .

		-- '' The Just So Song Book '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- contains all the children 's lyrics from Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	's well-known volume , set to music of a modern and alluring sort by Mr.

		-- `` Songs of the Trees : Pictures , Rhymes , and Tree Biographies '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- has been written by Mrs.
Mary Y. Robinson	PERSON	, with music for the songs by Miss

		The book is arranged by months , each of the twelve having three full-page pictures in color , showing some tree or shrub having especial refer - ence to that time of year .

		The book is filled with useful and unobtrusive information .

		-- '' Laurel Leaves for Little Folk '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is edited , illustrated , and decorated by Miss
Mary E. Phillips	PERSON	, who has covered almost the entire range of modern American writers , many of the contributions from well-known pens being here published for the first time .

		The book is certainly stimulating , and should give many a little one some conception of what it is that constitutes litera - ture .

		-- '' Rhymes of Real Children '' -LRB- Fox ,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is by Mrs.
Walter L. Goodwin	PERSON	, who writes under her maiden name of Betty Sage , with charming pictures in color by Miss
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	.

		There is more than average merit in these taking little bits of simple verse , and
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	's illustrations are certain to give additional popularity to the volume .

		-- Mr.
O. H. von Gottschalk	PERSON	has made the pictures in color and written the verses for '' In Gnome Man 's Land '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , in which he sings the adventures of a small boy in a won - derful country where the vegetables have human life .

		The boy is present at the great battle between these inhabitants of the garden and a horde of army worms , success being finally won for the vegetables by the useful if irascible wasps which constitute their flying artillery .

		The books for very small children , which ooksfor remain to be considered , are of many smallest readers .

		Chief among them may be men - tioned the delectable volume so well known in
England	LOCATION	since
1897	DATE	, `` A Bad Child 's Book of Beasts '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is in this classical work that the author , Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	, observes , `` I shoot the hippopotamus with bullets made of platinum , because if I use leaden ones his hide
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 479 is sure to flatten 'em , '' -- and others of his comments on animal life are equally pertinent .

		The pictures by ''
H. T. B.	PERSON	'' are so bad that they are really good ; and the only wonder is that we have had so long to wait for an American reprint of the book .

		-- '' Wanderfolk in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a superior book of animal stories , the text by Miss
Edith Guerrier	PERSON	and the pictures by Miss
Edith Brown	PERSON	.

		The tales are not only witty , but under the humanizing of the birds and beasts which take part in them there lies real knowl - edge of animal psychology and habits Two pretty little tales of animal life have been written by
Miss Beatrix Potter	ORGANIZATION	and published in separate volumes -LRB-
Warne	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with graceful illustrations in color . ''

		The Tale of
Squirrel Nutkin	ORGANIZATION	'' tells of the real life of a real squirrel , and '' The Tailor of

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written by Mrs.
Abbie Farwell Brown	PERSON	and illustrated by Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	.

		Out of many lands and from many sources these quaint and veracious stories have been gathered .

		Many of them are from ancient mytho - logical origins , and the illustrator has had these deriva - tions in mind in planning his designs .

		The book has no little literary merit .

		-- '' The Life of a Wooden Doll '' -LRB- Fox ,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a long series of incidents in the life of its heroine , told for the most part by photographs , a few words being added by the book 's inventor , Mr.
Lewis Saxby	PERSON	.

		The fact that the scenes are unquestion - ably from real , though still , life , gives them powers of conviction not otherwise attainable .

		-- '' Children of the Arctic , by the Snow - Baby and her Mother '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is a result of Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	's arctic life in 1893-5 in company with his wife , Mrs.
Josephine Debitsch Peary	PERSON	.

		The '' snow-baby , ''
Marie Ahnighito Peary	PERSON	, was born to the exiled couple while among the eternal snows , and it is of what was seen through her childish eyes regard - ing the life of the little Eskimo youngsters that the book treats .

		Quite as much information is conveyed through the reproduced photographs as through the text , interesting though the latter is .

		This work is a revision and expansion of the latter part of the author 's '' Mediaeval and Modern History , '' the former part having appeared some time since in the revised form and in a separate volume .

		`` The Alphabet of Rhetoric , '' by Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	, is a book for the uses of the general reader rather than for teaching purposes .

		The topics are alphabetically arranged , and the work is an excellent guide to good usage , conveniently planned for reference .

		The Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	are the publishers . ''

		What to See in
England	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Gordon Home	PERSON	, is a guide-book published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a book of alternating pictures and text , each subject treated having a single page of print set opposite a full - page illustration .

		One hundred and fifty subjects are thus dealt with , and there are two maps .

		The late
Ross Winans	PERSON	's `` One Religion : Many Creeds , '' first published about thirty years ago , is repro - duced by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	in a new edition , upon the initiative of Mr.
Walter Winans	PERSON	, a grandson of the author .

		The Rev.
Charles Voysey	PERSON	contributes an intro - duction to the work in this its latest form .

		Ferdinand Gregorovius 's ''
Lucretia Borgia	PERSON	, '' a study from the original documents , is translated from the third German edition by Mr.
John Leslie Garner	PERSON	, and published in a handsomely-illustrated volume by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		The date of the first edition was
1874	DATE	, a fact that may be worth bearing in mind .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new descriptive list of their own publications , just issued , is made especially attractive by a number of colored inserts , from illus - trations in books published by this firm .

		It is , besides , an unusually well-arranged and intelligently-prepared catalogue , which every book buyer will find of use .

		The editors of `` The Psychological Review '' will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of that journal by the commencement , in their
January	DATE	issue , of a special literary department , to include prompt consideration of current literature in psychology , phil - osophy , and cognate subjects , with literary news and announcements . ''

		The
Temple Series of Bible Characters	ORGANIZATION	and Scrip - ture Handbooks , '' published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is edited by Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	, and will extend to a considerable number of small volumes .

		The two now before us are ''
Abraham	PERSON	and the Patriarchal Age , '' by Dr.
Duff	PERSON	, and ''
David	PERSON	, the Hero-King of
Israel	LOCATION	, '' by
Canon Knox-Little	ORGANIZATION	.

		A number of interesting items are contained in the
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	's programme for the coming year .

		Of especial importance may be noted a series of hitherto unpublished extracts from
Emerson	LOCATION	's private journals , edited by his son ; six reminiscent articles by Col.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, entitled `` Part of a Man 's Life '' ; and Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's new serial , '' The Common Lot . ''

		Mr.
Sidney Norton Deane	PERSON	has translated from the Latin , and
The Open Court Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , a selec - tion of the most important of the writings of
St. Anselm	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selection includes the '' Monologium , '' the `` Pros - logium , '' and the '' Cur Deus Homo '' together with
Gaunilon	PERSON	's `` In Behalf of the Fool , '' written as an
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 481 appendix to the first-named of these works .

		Criticisms of the ontological doctrine by various philosophers are also added to the volume by way of apparatus . ''

		Witnesses of the Light , '' by the Rev.
Washington ■ Gladden	PERSON	, is a volume made up of the
William Belding Noble	ORGANIZATION	lectures for
1903	DATE	.

		These lectures are given at
Harvard	LOCATION	, during the season of Advent .

		They are six in number , in the present instance , their subjects being
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Michel Angelo	PERSON	,
Fichte	LOCATION	, Hugo ,
Wagner	PERSON	, and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the volume .

		About a year ago , Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	was persuaded to write for the
New York	LOCATION	'' American '' at the rate of three articles a week for the period of three months .

		The thirty-nine leaders thus resulting , together with some other contributions to journalism made at the same time , are now collected into a volume entitled '' We , the People , '' which is published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Best Tales of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	'' and `` The Best Poems and Essays of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, '' are two companion volumes edited by Mr.
Sherwin Cody	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both volumes are supplied with biographical and critical matter by the editor , and are issued in uniform style with his earlier illustrations of the short story and the English essay .

		`` A Little
Booke	PERSON	of Poets ' Parleys , '' by
Miss Charlotte Porter	ORGANIZATION	and Miss
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, is a series of imag - inary conversations upon such subjects as
America	LOCATION	, evolution , love , music , war , and woman , each involving two poets , whose works are drawn upon for character - istic quotations .

		The idea is a capital one , and it is skilfully carried out .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are the publishers .

		Mr.
L. Cope Cornf	PERSON	ord 's '' Essay-Writing for Schools , '' published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is not exactly a text-book , although it might well serve for one .

		It is addressed to young writers , whether in or out of school , and its method is that of persuasion enforced by ex - ample .

		The case of the novelist turned rhetorician is somewhat unusual , but in the present instance the meta - morphosis is certainly praiseworthy .

		Dr.
E. Moore	PERSON	's third series of '' Studies in Dante '' will consist of miscellaneous essays , dealing with the astronomy and geography of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, the date assumed by
Dante	PERSON	for the vision of the
Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	, sym - bolism and prophecy in the last six cantos of the Pur - gatorio , the genuineness of the dedicatory epistle to
Can Grande	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	will issue the volume very shortly .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' Practical Lessons in Hu - man Physiology ,
Personal Hygiene	ORGANIZATION	, and
Public Health	ORGANIZATION	, '' a school text-book by Mr.
John I. Jegi	PERSON	.

		The book is marked by exaggerations and one-sided statements on the subject of narcotics that are usual in texts of this character , resulting from the unholy activities of the '' temperance '' fanatics , and their ill-advised meddling in the matter of public education . ''

		Tittlebat Titmouse '' is the title given to what is called '' a new and improved edition '' of Warren 's '' Ten Thousand a Year . ''

		The volume is published by the
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the '' improvements '' have been made by the Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	.

		They turn out to be sins of omission , the resulting vol - ume being about one-third the size of the original .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's excuse for the abridgment is found in the approval of Dr.
E. W. Warren	PERSON	, the son of the author .

		The Messrs.
Scribners	PERSON	are the importers of the following reprints : `` The Cavalier in Exile , '' by the Duchess of
Newcastle	LOCATION	; `` Dante 's Divine Comedy : the Book and its Story , '' by
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	; and a thin-paper edition of the novels of
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	, seven books in one , a veritable multum in parvo of literary delight , filling nearly a thousand pages , printed on thin paper , and bound in flexible leather .

		It would be diffi - cult to get more money 's worth than this within a single pair of covers .
